      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the total number of persons who emigrated from the Republic since 13th June, 1951, indicating the number of males and females, up <Col N="2" /> to the most recent date for which figures are available.</P>

      <P>For reasons given in my replies to related questions on 1st May and 26th June, 1952, the information asked for by the Deputy is not available as regards persons who left Ireland (excluding the Six Counties) for the purpose of taking up employment or permanent residence in Great Britain or the Six Counties.  It may be stated, however, that new passports were issued in the period 1st June, 1951, to 31st August, 1952, to 2,805 males and to 3,101 females for the purpose of taking up employment or permanent residence in other countries.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Migration Figures.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the estimated net migration for the years 1949, 1950 and 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated net migration for the year 1949 was 34,000 and for 1950 was 41,000.  These estimates, in so far as they relate to migration to Great Britain and the Six Counties, were based on the passenger card sample inquiry in conjunction with global statistics of passenger movement into and out of the State, classified by origin of journey.  As explained in the article&mdash;Statistics of Emigration and Passenger Movement&mdash;published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin,</i> June, 1951, pp. 76-84, which set out the methods by which these figures were derived, such estimates are subject to substantial sampling errors. It was, however, possible to relate the total of net emigration for the intercensal period 1946-51, as derived from the censuses of population and birth and death statistics, to the separately computed figures for the individual years, and in view of the concordance between the totals it may be considered that the figures for the individual years 1949 and 1950 are reasonably reliable.</P>
      <P>As regards 1951, the formal application of the methods described in the basic article gave, in the analysis of the passenger movement for that year, results which were internally inconsistent, e.g., the numbers estimated on an inward journey as coming on a visit are markedly at variance with the estimated number on an outward journey stated to be returning from a visit.  In view of these results and since no independent check is available, for reasons which I stated in my replies of 1st May and 26th June, 1952, it is not possible to furnish a reliable estimate of net emigration for the year 1951.</P>

Until such time as the monthly publication is achieved, copies of the statement will be circulated to members of the Oireachtas through the Dáil Office.</P>

      <P>The latest available data on national income, capital formation, ect. will appear in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey,</i> 1950-51, which is at present being printed and which it is expected will be issued at the end of this month.  In view of the fact that changes have been made in the concepts and methods used in the compilation which are impossible of adequate explanation within the limits of a reply such as this.  I would ask that the Deputies would await the issue of the official estimates contained in the document in question.</P>

      <P>The Prices Advisory Body, as a result of its inquiry into the increases in motor insurance premium rates which took effect on 1st December, 1951, has recommended that those increased premium rates should be reduced by 12½ per cent. from 1st December, 1952.  I have accepted the recommendation and the members of the Irish Standing Committee, Accident Offices Association carrying on business in this country have agreed to put the recommendations into operation so far as motor cars and commercial vehicles are concerned. The insurance premiums for motor cycles will be determined by reference to the experience in each individual case.  The recommendation by the body took into account the fact that the insurance companies will have the benefit of the present increased rates for a full year from 1st December, 1951, to 30th November, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the general public are concerned at the further increases in the prices of bread and flour, but I believe that the public appreciate that increases in bread production costs consequent on higher wages must be met by higher prices. The Labour Court, on 21st August, 1952, recommended certain increases in the wages of bakery operatives and on the 29th of the same month application was made by the bakery industry for such relief, by way of either adjustments in flour or in bread prices, as would enable the industry to implement the recommendation of the Labour Court.  It was decided to permit the industry to pay the higher wages recommended by the Labour Court by adjusting bread prices.  In the case of bread or flour it is a simple matter to calculate the effect of the wage increases on production costs and an investigation of the effect by the Prices <Col N="20" /> Advisory Body was not considered to be necessary.  I would, however, remind the Deputy that it is within the powers and functions of the Prices Advisory Body to inquire into the prices of any commodity at any time on their own initiative.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not consider it advisable in the case of a staple commodity such as bread and its ally, flour, that the Prices Advisory Body should have had this application for an increase sifted in public, so that those who are interested in maintaining price levels of flour and bread should have an opportunity of putting their point of view to the Prices Body and allowing the matter to be decided by a body which has some competence for dealing in costings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that twice during the period when he was a member of the Government increases in wages in the bakery trade were recommended by the Labour Court and twice the price of bread was adjusted upwards accordingly?  There is no problem in relating the effect of increased wages to bread production costs.  The condition of the industry was very thoroughly investigated by the Lavery Committee only a short time ago and the report of the committee is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the case the insurance companies made for their 25 per cent. increase in insurance charges.  Now the Prices Tribunal has found out that they were charging twice too much.  Why, when the Prices Advisory Body was sitting, were they not given an opportunity of hearing whatever case was to be made for an increase in the price of bread?  If the Minister takes the view that the thing was simple, that it could have been easily decided, that was a stronger reason for bringing it before the body so that the whole thing would be publicly ventilated and everyone would be given an opportunity of bringing his point of view to bear on consideration of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of denying the Prices Advisory Body an <Col N="21" /> opportunity of investigating this matter.  They can do so on their own initiative if they think it desirable and it is not necessary for me to ask them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of bread was increased in the light of the wages being paid, to 8/11 per dozen loaves wholesale, while, outside the City of Dublin, in the rest of Ireland to-day the following prices are being charged per dozen loaves: 8/9, 8/6, 8/3 and 7/9?  Now, if it is possible for a rural baker to accept 7/9 per dozen loaves and pay the increased charges, is not there something queer about Dublin bakers&mdash; whose output is ten, 15 or 20 times as great&mdash;being allowed to charge 8/11 and 8/9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are parts of the country where the maximum prices for bread and flour are not being charged.  That may be an argument for the decontrol of bread and flour: it is not an argument against permitting adjustment of the maximum price fixed when it is obvious that the costs have increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not the least use in providing for competition to operate in Dublin, where the bread trade is controlled by a closed ring, into which nobody may poke his nose, as between miller and baker.  They have the public by the throat and no one can control them except a statutory body.  If you restore competition in Dublin, they can raise the price of bread to 9/- and no one can do anything about it.  The only way is to declare a fixed price and control the situation so long as you have the ring there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the case for decontrolling the price to intensify competition, but the effect will be to divert trade to certain large bakeries and close small ones; and that is a result to which we would have to give careful consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the increase in price has taken place in <Col N="22" /> Limerick while there has been no increase in wages?  What is the justification for the increase by the Limerick master bakers when no increase has taken place in wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not receiving any increases.  The prices which are being charged in Dublin are being charged in Limerick and Cork, where the people have got no increase in wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the only question that arises for me is one of policy&mdash; whether the bakers should be permitted to pay the increased wages by an adjustment in the price of bread or an adjustment in the price of flour.  As a matter of policy, it was decided to adjust the price of bread to enable them to pay the increased wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> I referred to this matter in a statement which I made in the Dáil on the 3rd April, 1952 (Official Report, columns 1302-3).  The arrangements for bulk-buying of tea through Tea Importers, Ltd., have been continued up to the present to give effect to the policy of making purchases directly in the countries of origin and must be maintained for this purpose until suitable alternative arrangements can be made.  I have been considering, in consultation with trade interests, what changes it would be practicable to make in the arrangements, but it has not yet been possible to reach a conclusion in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that tea can be purchased at the present time at a very considerably lower price than that at which tea of corresponding quality is being purchased by Tea Importers, Ltd.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I could buy tea to-morrow in Mincing Lane at 18 pence per lb. of the same quality as that which is being charged out by Tea Importers, <Col N="29" /> Ltd., at 3/3?  If that is a temporary business it is understandable, but in view of that will the Minister no't restore to every tea merchant in the country the right to buy his tea wherever he can get it cheapest for the consuming public?  If the tea merchants of Ireland are released from the grotesque tyranny of Tea Importers, Ltd., the price of tea can be reduced by 1/- to 1/6 per lb. in 24 hours.  Will the Minister not do it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>For my own part, I would much prefer to get away from this system of bulk buying and restore independent operation to the various tea wholesalers.  I want to make it quite clear, however, that the policy of buying direct in countries of origin and not paying commission on our tea to London tea brokers is going to be maintained.  I have asked the tea wholesalers' association to put up their proposals as to how that aim of policy can be realised while at the same time the bulk buying arrangements can be terminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the policy to which he has adverted in the reply he has just given to Deputy Dillon is being maintained, why has the Minister permitted Tea Importers, Limited, to purchase tea on the London market?  Is not that contrary to the policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two answers to that.  One is that we have still a problem of heavy stocks being held here which will have to be liquidated. Secondly, no satisfactory alternative arrangement has yet resulted from my discussions with the tea trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not a satisfactory arrangement the fact that you can buy tea cheaper in London than you can buy it anywhere else, with or without the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reason for the marked differential in prices of tea as between here and Britain, and the amount of the export tax per lb. paid on tea imported from India, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Comparison of retail price levels for tea in this country and elsewhere is complicated by the fact that there are so many different blends of tea.  Tea can be obtained in this country at retail prices ranging from 3/6 a lb., upwards.  I understand that in Great Britain tea is available at a retail price as low as 3/- a lb., but that supplies at this price are scarce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directors of Tea Importers, Ltd., have informed me that the prices at which they can distribute tea at present are necessarily above those prevailing in Great Britain because of the fact that, in pursuance of the stockpiling policy in recent years, they built up a substantial emergency reserve which is now in process of being liquidated.  The teas comprising that reserve were bought at prices in excess of present market prices in the countries of origin.  Another factor which affects the selling price here is the cost incurred by the company for overhead expenses, such as warehousing, interest charges, etc., in connection with these emergency stocks.  In view of the international situation is was decided that for the current purchasing season Tea Importers, Ltd., should not provide for carrying any larger stocks than is necessary for ordinary trading purposes. I am advised by Tea Importers <Col N="31" /> Ltd., that when the emergency reserve has been liquidated there should be no substantial difference between the landed price of tea in this country and the landed price in Great Britain, quality for quality.  The demand in this country, however, has traditionally been for a better quality of tea than in Great Britain, and any attempt at comparison of average prices in the two countries would, of course, have to take account of this consideration.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the tax which is levied by the Indian Government on all exports of tea is approximately 4½d. a lb.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take together Questions Nos. 41 to 60, inclusive, all of which relate to the recent National Loan.</P>
      <P>Where the State credit is concerned, it is necessary to decide how far the public interest is served by the publication of detailed information which is liable to misuse in uninformed quarters.  I am prepared to give as much information as was supplied in relation to the last three National Loans, and, indeed, to go further in certain respects.  In some of the queries addressed to me, however, information is sought on points of detail, such as the number of applicants in each county, the amount applied for by Irish co-operative societies, etc.  Statistics of this sort have no obvious value and I would not consider it justifiable to impose on the taxpayer the expense of assembling them.  The State, indeed, has no duty either to the Dáil or to the public to identify subscribers by reference to their status, residence or amounts applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish commercial banks agreed to underwrite the loan jointly with the <Col N="41" /> Government.  But in contrast with September, 1950, when an underwriting arrangement covering £10,000,000 of the 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds issue was made with the banks, neither the banks nor the Government were called upon on this occasion to put any money in the loan, as it was oversubscribed by the public.</P>
    <P>As is usual and prudent, discussions took place with the Irish banks and with other interests prior to the issue of the loan.</P>
    <P>No direction or request was conveyed to the banks regarding the desirability of providing facilities by way of overdraft, loan or otherwise for subscribers to the loan.</P>
    <P>Although my predecessor as Minister for Finance categorically refused on March 23rd, 1949 (Volume 114, columns 1453 and 1454) to give me similar information in reply to a parliamentary question relating to the second issue of 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds, I am prepared to supply the following details in regard to the recent issue:-</P>

    <P>This represents 1.64d. for each £1 obtained as against 1.85d. for each £1 obtained through the September, 1950, issue of 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds.</P>
    <P>The question relating to the market depreciation in certain existing stocks appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the basis on which all Government loans are floated.  Such transactions are for lengthy periods, in the case of our loans the period being generally 20 years.  The original lender contracts to let the Government have the use of his money for that period on the undertaking of the Government to repay him in full at the end of it.  In return for this long-term loan the Government covenants to pay the lender over the period a fixed rate of interest, higher than if the loan were for a short term.  The loan stock issued to the lender becomes his property and he is free to dispose of it on the market if he wishes or to hold it until redemption date.  To enable it the more conveniently to meet its obligation to repay the loan at the end of the loan period, the Government establishes a sinking fund on a basis set out in the prospectus of the loan.  Generally this sinking fund is applied in accordance with the prospectus to purchase stock for cancellation at or under the issue price.  The establishment of the sinking fund ensures that there will usually be a ready buyer available for a substantial but limited amount of the stock to which it relates.  It cannot do more than this and does not purport to do more and the extent of its <Col N="43" /> operations are fully realised by those who invest in public securities.</P>
    <P>In brief, therefore, the general obligations assumed by the Government in relation to a National Loan are (1), to repay the principal in full at the due date; (2), to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and (3), to set aside a sinking fund which will be available for the purchase of stock for cancellation. If, as some people seem to expect, the Government were to stand ready at all times to buy at par any amounts of National Loan stock offered for sale, this would be to convert a long-term loan into a demand liability, with disastrous effects on the national finances and on the terms of private credit.</P>
    <P>It will also be understood that a new loan must be more attractive than existing stocks if subscriptions on a large scale are to be forthcoming. Naturally, the market values of existing stocks are affected when a more attractive stock is introduced. Prices are directly influenced by sales on the part of those wishing to switch to the new loan.  Before the 3½ per cent.  Exchequer Bonds were issued at 99 in September, 1950, the 3 per cent. Exchequer Bonds stood at £95 per cent. They declined to £93-£93¼ per cent. immediately afterwards.  The second issue of 3 per cent. bonds itself knocked 1¼ points off the market price of the first issue.  The success of the new loan has been all the more gratifying because it has not affected any more seriously the market prices of existing Irish Government stocks.  A week before the terms were announced the 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds stood at £80 per cent.; they were dealt in after the issue at £78½ per cent. and £78 per cent.  The 3½ per cent. Exchequer Bonds stood at £86¾ per cent. prior to the issue and have been quoted regularly since at £85 per cent. In both cases present prices are about the same as they were some months ago.</P>
    <P>The fall over the past few years in the market value of existing stocks is a reflection of the depreciation in giltedge securities which has been worldwide <Col N="44" /> and has extended to the securities even of such Governments as the United States of America.  No ultimate loss will, however, be suffered by any subscriber to an Irish Government loan who holds his stock firmly as £100 cash will be repaid in respect of each £100 stock at the redemption date. Moreover, within the limit of the resources available to it, it has always been the policy of my Department to try to support the market and to control erratic and disturbing movements.</P>

      <P>As I was unable to gather it from his verbose avoidance of giving any information to the House, I should like to ask the Minister, if in fact any effort was made on his behalf or on behalf of any of the bodies mentioned in the question to prevent the new loan from going to a premium.  That is a simple question which the Minister should answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred at the beginning of my comprehensive reply to all the questions put down by Deputy Costello, to the fact that where the State credit is concerned it is necessary to decide how far the public interest is served by the publication of detailed information which is liable to misuse in uninformed quarters and a reply to a number of the questions put down by Deputy Costello, if answered in the form in which he requires them to be answered, would be, I think, liable to misuse in uninformed quarters and would be detrimental to public credit.</P>
      <P>As I have already pointed out, I have an excellent precedent for dealing with Deputy Costello's question.  I refer to the answer which was given to a Deputy by the then Minister for Finance on the 23rd March, 1949.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As I told the Dail on the 2nd March, when announcing the recent issue of £12,000,000 of 3 per cent. Exchequer Bonds, the amount allocated for public subscription was £8,000,000, the balance of £4,000,000 representing applications on behalf of departmental funds.  Public subscriptions amounted to £7,697,000 and the actual investment on behalf of departmental funds came to £4,303,000.  By arrangement with the joint stock banks none of them subscribed to the issue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then, here is the point:&mdash;</P>

There is £6,000,000 of it given for 2½ per cent in British securities and £13,000,000 at 3 per cent. in British securities or in war defence loans.

In the normal course, had the Taoiseach been here, we would have asked for an early discussion on the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department for the purpose of discussing general Government policy, but, in his absence, we desire to raise so far as possible general Government policy and particularly financial policy on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance and to have that discussion at the earliest possible date.</P>

Costello in the Dáil on that day, I have to inform the Dáil that I communicated the terms of the complaint to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The following reply was received:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I wish to express my regret for having assaulted Deputy James M. Dillon in the precincts of the Houses of the Oireachtas and apologise to the Seanad for any reflection on its good name caused by my action.  At the same time I extend my apologies to the Dáil for my conduct towards a member of that House and I trust that the good relations which have at all times existed between the two Houses will not be in any way impaired in consequence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir.  I say the incident referred to is the fifth assault on Deputies of this House by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I want the Ceann Comhairle to tell the Seanad <Col N="57" /> that we do not give two fiddle-de-dees for their pious observations and that we intend to take measures in this building to restrain Senators or others who go rambling through our corridors looking for drink and fight.  The only way to do that is to request the Commissioner of the Garda to take the same precautions in the corridors here as he takes at the North Wall, and that is to provide a sufficient number of Guards to restrain violent individuals who seek to disturb the peace of these premises.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, it is you, the Ceann Comhairle, who, I submit to you, is responsible for the decencies being observed in this House.  If the Senators cannot behave themselves I suggest you should throw the Seanad out and let them get their own place.  If the Fianna Fáil Deputies will not behave themselves I suggest that you get a sufficient number of Guards in order to ensure that they will be thrown in the Bridewell until they sober up and conduct themselves.  I am suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wanted to put a question, I understood, asking what had been done.  I have given some consideration to the matter and so have officials of the Dáil.  They have given a good deal of consideration to this matter.  As the Deputy knows, we are not in complete control of all the building.  The Ceann Comhairle has no control except over the Chamber.  I endeavoured to make that clear on the occasion on which the regrettable incidents occurred&mdash; that I could not deal with matters that did not arise within the Chamber.  I made that as clear as I could.  That is my understanding of the position at the moment.  Regarding the passages and the corridors and other such places, the Ceann Comhairle has not any control.  I was endeavouring, with the expert advice that I can obtain from the officials, to see what could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, as Deputy Dillon knows, a motion on the Order Paper which sets out a certain procedure by which that desirable object might be achieved.  I <Col N="58" /> suggest that the position ought not to be prejudiced until some attempt is made, through the machinery of that motion, to achieve that object.</P>

My interest is, if the Ceann Comhairle cannot in his authority control the place, whether the Garda will be installed to deal with the type of people who frequent this building?  Otherwise, no civilised citizen will be able to move about in it. The only way you can deal with the itinerant drunk is to throw him in the Bridewell until he makes up his mind to abide by the law.  All I am asking is that in Dáil Éireann, as elsewhere in the City of Dublin, if people go rambling about looking for drink and fight, they will be thrown into the Bridewell until they cool off.  I want nothing else &mdash; no undertaking from Fianna Fáil.  They are not worth the breath used on them.  I want such deployment of the resources of the community as to ensure that the minimal standards appropriate to the purlieus of the North Wall will at least be maintained in the precincts of Oireachtas Éireann&mdash;nothing more.</P>

If a proposals is introduced by either side of the House to deal with the question it will naturally be received with a certain degree of suspicion and Party feeling.

      <P>On a point of order.  If these Resolutions may now be discussed, presumably a member of the House is within his rights in seeking to move an amendment to the Resolutions.  Am I to understand therefore that these Resolutions are now being discussed though nobody has had the chance to frame amendments to them.  Surely, we ought to be given a chance of seeing the Resolutions, of reading them and of drafting whatever amendments we desire to make.</P>

      <P>There are two Resolutions, one of which, according to the practice of this House, is always disposed of on the day on which it is introduced.  That is the Resolution dealing with the increase in the cost of driving licences.  In order to meet the point raised by Deputy Norton, in <Col N="64" /> 1926, when the House was in Committee discussing a similar matter, the proposal was accepted by the House, because the House had to deal with the Resolution on the day that the licence fee was chargeable.  In fact, that fee continued to be charged until the Report Stage was taken.  An amendment reducing the amount to 10/- was then accepted by the House, resulting in a refund having to be made by the local authorities concerned, of the difference between the £1 as imposed on the Committee Stage and the 10/- finally accepted on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that it was clever or otherwise.  I am merely stating the facts.  I am merely stating the procedure down the years and I am trying to convince the House &mdash;I think I should have no difficulty in doing so&mdash;that since this has been the procedure all the years since&mdash;may I say in addition that it is possible for forestalling to take place in relation to this proposal&mdash;it is necessary to ask the Dáil to pass Resolution No. 1 to-night.  If the Dáil so decides, it can follow the steps followed in 1926.  That does not prevent Deputy Norton or any other Deputy from putting down an amendment on the Report Stage in that regard.</P>
      <P>So far as Resolution No. 2 is concerned, the position is entirely different.  It does not require that this House should pass Resolution No. 2 to-night.  I should like naturally to get it and to carry over the discussion to the Report Stage or to the Bill which will be introduced later which will cover the subjects referred to in Resolution No. 2.  While I know it is not vital in the same sense as it is to pass Resolution No. 1 to-night, I still should like to get it.</P>

The White Paper was circulated as a result of a desire for information on this matter.  A Resolution is now before the House which embodies exactly every single proposal as set out in the White Paper with one exception, the one exception being Resolution No. 1 which deals entirely with the proposal to increase the cost of driving licences. That matter was not referred to in the White Paper for the reason that if one single word escaped that such a provision was contemplated there could be forestalling on the part of those who intended taking out driving licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance informed the House in his Budget statement in April last that legislation would be introduced later in the year to increase the rates of motor taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's proposals for the revision of motor taxation, with which the Financial Resolutions are concerned, were, with one exception, explained in a White Paper published in August last.  Their purpose is to increase the contribution of motor <Col N="70" /> vehicles users to the cost of road works in order to provide for the increased road maintenance and improvement which the increased use of motor vehicles has necessitated.</P>
    <P>Since 1920 the proceeds of motor taxation (which was revised in that year) have been paid into the Road Fund from which grants for road maintenance and improvement are made to the road authorities.  With the growing importance of motor traffic, the share of road expenditure met on its behalf by the State continued to increase.  In 1926 the rates of motor vehicle duty were comprehensively reviewed.  There has been no comprehensive review of motor taxation since 1926 but in the meantime conditions so far as roads and road traffic are concerned have altered out of all knowledge.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the White Paper for the growth of motor traffic in recent years speak for themselves.  The overall numbers of vehicles registered has increased from 73,813 in 1939 to 155,982 in 1951.  A preliminary examination of returns of the census taken in August, 1952, shows that this figure has further increased to 167,798 vehicles.  As the White Paper points out, there is more than an absolute increase in the number of vehicles involved.  The average vehicle is faster and heavier, and is driven more miles per week.  The main roads must be maintained and made safe to take the increasing volume of modern traffic.  Again, motor traffic is now resorting in an increasing degree to roads which have never been conditioned to bear it.  Approximately 34,000 miles of our county roads are still in an unsurfaced condition.  Many of our important bridges have to be reconstructed or replaced.  In the cities new and improved arteries are needed to deal with traffic congestion.  Apart from improvement works, insufficient money is being spent on road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, on the whole, have continued to make increased provision for their roads; nevertheless, there is a limit to what they can be asked to do. Local rates have doubled since 1939.</P>
    <P>The income of the Road Fund in the present financial year is estimated at <Col N="71" /> £3,500,000, from which must be deducted £120,000 for administration expenses and £287,600 for loan charges, leaving £3,092,400 available for the payment of grants during the year.  A sum of £2,286,000 was borrowed in recent years to supplement the income of the fund in the payment of grants. In addition grants allocated but not paid at the beginning of the financial year amounted to £1,830,000.  The sum borrowed will be repaid by the annuity of £287,600 over a period of ten years. Grants amounting to £3,310,000 have been allocated in the present financial year bringing the total of these and grants allocated but not paid at the beginning of the year to £5,140,000 against which a sum of £3,092,400 is estimated to be available in the fund for payments in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that, while the increased number of registered vehicles means an addition to the income of the fund, that addition does not correspond with the increase in the scope and cost of necessary road works.  As stated in the White Paper, the average cost of materials, machinery and labour for roads is now over two-and-a-half times the cost in 1939.  The position, therefore, briefly, is that the Road Fund cannot meet the demands of 1952 on the basis of rates of taxation fixed in 1926.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What about 1947?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners of motor vehicles represent the section of the community whose use of the roads gives rise to the need for extra expenditure and who will benefit most by the extra expenditure.  Better roads should bring economies in the operation costs of vehicles which will in the long run more than offset the extra taxation.</P>
      <P>The proposals are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Driving licences: It is proposed that the duty on the taking out of a driving licence will be increased from 10/- to £1, with effect from to-morrow. Driving licences remain in force for a period of 12 months from the date of issue, and in this way they differ from the motor vehicle licences, which relate to fixed periods.  This proposal, for <Col N="72" /> obvious reasons, is not one of which advance notice could have been given. The additional duty is estimated to bring in revenue of about £135,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Private cars: It is proposed to increase the duties on private cars by sums ranging from £1 per annum on the smaller cars to £2 per annum on the larger cars.  In proposing these increases regard has been had to the increases made as from 1st January, 1948.  At the same time it is intended to introduce a new method of calculating horse-power, under which the basis will be the cubic capacity of the engine instead of the diameter of the cylinder, as hitherto; this will be done by regulations.  The net effect is expected to represent additional revenue of £120,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Motor cycles: Duty will be calculated according to the cubic capacity of the engine instead of the unladen weight of the vehicle.  Low rates are introduced for the engine-assisted pedal cycle and the auto-cycle, while special provision is made for pedestrian-controlled vehicles (milk trolleys, etc.).  It is anticipated that these provisions will involve a loss of £3,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Goods Vehicles: Duties on these vehicles will be increased by up to 50 per cent. in the case of the lighter vehicles and by higher percentages in the case of the heavy vehicles, which cause damage to the roads out of all proportion to the duty at present paid on their use.  The new rates will be graduated by quarter-tons instead of tons.  The extra duty in respect of trailers will be increased and graduated according to the weight of the drawing vehicle.  The concession allowed to vehicles assembled in Ireland from Irish parts and to an extent approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is extended to vehicles not exceeding 1½ tons in weight unladen.  The annual rate of duty on these vehicles will be £10 lower than the rate applicable to vehicles not so assembled.  The net effect of the proposals regarding goods vehicles is expected to increase revenue by about £380,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Tractors: No increase in duty is proposed for the 5/- class of vehicle. A single rate of £8 will replace the <Col N="73" /> rates of £6 and £10 respectively for tractors used for agricultural haulage, for which a more precise definition is proposed.  The rates of duty on general haulage tractors will be increased by 50 per cent.  It is estimated that an extra £31,000 per annum will be produced by these proposals.</P>
    <P>Large public service vehicles: The rates of duty on large public service vehicles, that is, buses, will be increased by 20 per cent., to yield an estimated additional £34,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Small public service vehicles: It is proposed to restore the relationship which existed between the rates of duty on these vehicles and those on private cars prior to 1948.  Hackneys will therefore be liable to duty at the same rates as private cars, subject to a limit at 20 horse-power.  Taxis will be liable to duty at the rates applicable to private cars, subject to a limit at ten horse-power.  These proposals are estimated to yield an additional £56,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Hearses: Motor hearses will be liable to duty at the rates applicable to private vehicles, subject to a limit at 12 horse-power.  It is estimated that this will involve an annual loss of approximately £4,000.</P>
    <P>Trade licences: The rates of duty on these will be increased by 50 per cent., giving an extra £7,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>Road construction vehicles: These will be exempt from duty.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increased duty on driving licences the changes are proposed to come into effect from 1st January next.  In addition it is intended that payments will be made by Government Departments to the Road Fund in respect of the use as from that date of their vehicles on public roads. The payments, estimated to produce in all approximately £70,000 per annum, will be borne on the Votes for the Departments and offices concerned.</P>
    <P>The effect of all the proposals mentioned will be to provide the Road Fund with an estimated increased revenue of about £830,000 per annum in a full financial year.</P>
    <P>The basis of distribution of the increased Road Fund income which <Col N="74" /> will be available for road works as a result of these proposals will be a matter for determination from year to year, with due regard to the annual road works proposals of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult and, perhaps, inappropriate for me at this stage to attempt to forecast in detail the actual lines which the improvement and maintenance schemes of future years should follow.  So far as I, personally, am concerned, I visualise an increase in the scope of road improvement schemes on county roads as well as main roads, but I do not regard the access of such additional money as we may obtain as affording any justification for ambitious schemes not warranted by current traffic trends.  All the available funds for many years to come will be needed for essential improvements and for conserving the national asset which is represented by the capital already invested in our road system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question arises out of Resolution No. 1. What amount of the Road Fund is, in fact, expended upon road-making or road maintenance and what amount is kept by the Exchequer?  The questions which I desire to ask in respect of Resolution No. 2 arise out of the Minister's statement to the effect that a new method of calculating horse-power on the basis of the cubic capacity of the engine will be introduced.</P>
      <P>I understand that in 1923, when horse-power was arranged on the basis of cubic capacity, 160 cubic centimetres were fixed as equivalent to one horse-power. Under the present proposals 125 cubic centimetres are selected as being equivalent to one horse-power.  I want to know the reason for the change.  The purpose of my question is to ascertain whether the Minister is aware that that change has the effect of putting quite a large number of the smaller and more popular cars above the dividing line by a very small number of cubic centimetres.  For instance, a Ford Consul and a Vauxhall are only seven cubic centimetres above the dividing line.  A Hillman which is newly assembled here in Dublin, is only six cubic centimetres above the dividing line.  A Hillman Minx is 15 cubic centimetres above the dividing line.  If, instead of 125 cubic centimetres, a figure of 127 cubic centimetres were accepted as equivalent to one horse-power, I am advised that many of these anomalies would be avoided.  Perhaps the Minister will look into the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the forecast of a change in the method of calculation, I may tell the Deputy that this has come as a result of consultation between my Department and all the interests affected.  I met representatives of all the motor trading organisations twice&mdash;first, before the issue of this White Paper and, secondly, before the circulation of these Resolutions.  They gave me the impression that they were satisfied and that they regarded the change as very equitable and desirable&mdash;that is, so far as the method of the calculation of horse-power is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Deputy Costello asked for information as regards the application of the Road Fund to the making of roads.  I can only remind the Deputy that while he was Taoiseach the last raid was carried out on this fund.  A sum of £280,000 per annum will be paid for the next ten years from the Road Fund as a result of money which was borrowed on the strength of that fund.</P>

Do I understand that it has been implied that the subject matter of the two Resolutions will be incorporated in one discussion?  Do I understand that some time during the evening the Minister will intervene to put a closure on the discussion?  Is there any possibility that that will relate to Financial <Col N="77" /> Resolution No. 2 as well as to Financial Resolution No. 1?</P>

The Minister gave a lot of figures, segregating those relating to different types of motor vehicles.  He gave figures relating to the estimated additional yield from each type of vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Am I to take it that the figures which the Minister gave were an estimate of what would accrue for a full normal year?</P>

      <P>At any rate, we are in Committee on Finance and so there is no restriction as to the way in which a Deputy may come into the debate. He may speak once, twice or three times, as the case may be.  In view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves and of the statement that has been made, I think it is imperative that the two Resolutions be discussed separately.  We first deal with Resolution No. 1.  It will be impossible to do that without covering a good deal of ground, particularly in view of the Minister's statement.  When we have dealt with it, we then deal with Resolution No. 2.  There may be a certain amount of duplication in the discussion that will take place.  As we are in Committee on Finance, that duplication will inevitably arise.  If the <Col N="79" /> Minister is pressing to have Resolution No. 1 decided to-day, it would be more satisfactory for him to have that Resolution segregated from Resolution No. 2.  The House must not get itself into a position on such important motions that it can be told to wait and talk about Resolution No. 1 on the Report Stage.  We might then be told to wait and talk about it on the Finance Bill when it is introduced.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the House deciding to deal with the two Resolutions in whatever way it wishes, provided I get an assurance from the House that I will get Resolution No. 1 to-night.  I say that because it is my duty and the duty of my Department to notify all the registration authorities throughout the country at once.  I will be satisfied if I get Resolution No. 1 to-night.  This position arose before in 1926 when, on the Report Stage, an amendment was passed by this House which reduced the amount of the levy.  I do not think I am asking too much from the House when I ask to be given the Committee Stage of this Resolution to-night so that I can notify all the registration authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I would much prefer an amendment which would ask the Minister to reconsider his whole approach to this problem of additional taxation because I am afraid that the proposals disclosed by the Minister to-day, and previously heralded in this White Paper on the question of additional motor taxation, indicate that they have not got the mature and sagacious consideration which a matter of this kind needs.  Instead of that, we have probably the best example of what I describe as the &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; Government here this evening.  The Minister comes in and tells us it is essential that he should have this Resolution on the first day the Dáil meets after a recess covering three months.  He says the House must give it to him this evening on the basis, presumably, that somebody might manage to get away with a considerable amount of loot at the public expense if this Resolution is not passed this evening.</P>
      <P>The only way in which one can defeat Resolution No. 1 is by giving oneself the privilege of paying 10/- twice this year for a motor driving licence in order to avoid paying £1 next year.  I leave it to some other brain to work that out and show in relation to the calendar how much will be saved by recourse to this financial manipulation.  There is no need to panic about Resolution No. 1.  It is obvious that the ordinary person will face up to this imposition with the same grim determination as he has faced up to former impositions this year.  It is quite obvious that he will bear the new burden imposed upon him so far as these Financial Resolutions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with Resolution No. <Col N="82" /> 1 the Minister says quite frankly and definitely that he proposes to take another £135,000 out of the pockets of the motor drivers and he will do that by the very simple device of increasing the licence from 10/- to £1 per year.  The Minister is not concerned with the equity of the new charge he proposes to impose.  He is concerned merely with getting an additional £135,000 for the Exchequer.  He is not increasing the charge merely because the issue of driving licences causes no damage to roads and drivers of motor cars cause no damage to roads other than that which is a necessary part of road haulage.  The Minister in this case is after £135,000 and that is the only reason for increasing the driving licences and that is the only reason governing the increase in driving licences.</P>
    <P>Many of the folk who will pay this additional fee will be ordinary drivers who have to pay their driving licence annually because it is only in very few instances that employers pay driving licences for their staff.  The ordinary man who earns his living by driving a motor car or a lorry will now have the privilege of giving the Minister an additional 10/-, making £1 in all, for a licence which hitherto cost him only 10/-.  But the Minister does not care.</P>
    <P>He wants £135,000 and he proposes to get it out of the pockets of drivers of motor vehicles including the pockets of the fellows who have driving licences for the purpose of earning a livelihood. Their driving licence is the foundation of their trade.  It is their right to drive on the road and the Minister selects that class as a fit subject for the additional taxation proposed to be imposed by Resolution No. 1.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to any increase in driving licences.  If the Government needs another £135,000 urgently it can get the money quite easily.  To-day the Minister for Finance told us about a soft cheque for £75,000 passed over to the Irish banks in the last few days because of their having underwritten the 5 per cent.  £20,000,000 loan.  Every simpleton in the country knew that that loan would be oversubscribed. It did not need underwriting, but the <Col N="83" /> banks were asked to underwrite it and, adopting the simple device of insuring the Government against the risk of the loan not being filled, the banks now walk off with a £75,000 cheque which will be paid out of the money the ordinary worker will have to find in order to meet the additional charge for motor licences under the Resolution introduced by the Minister for Local Government to-day.  The motor drivers will finance the bankers for underwriting the 5 per cent. £20,000,000 loan.</P>
    <P>So far as the ordinary motoring public is concerned these two Resolutions represent a miniature supplementary Budget because the motoring community is being selected for increased taxation.  If we are in future faced with the prospect of taxation of this kind the community will never know from day to day what taxation it will have to face.  We are now slipping away from the old established practice of an annual Budget and slipping into a device of an annual Budget plus, as we had in 1947, an emergency Budget, plus, as we are having now in 1952, another emergency and Supplementary Budget in relation to the motoring community.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the range of taxation which the Minister proposes to impose in these two Resolutions.  The first people selected for additional taxation are the unfortunate taximen who operate in the Cities of Dublin and Cork and the hackney drivers who operate throughout the country.  In so far as these folk depend upon the driving of hired cars for their livelihood it may be said that their occupation earns them a rather doubtful remuneration. In order to keep their heads above water, to pay the insurance on their cars, to pay for their licences to drive their cars and to keep them in repair they have to work long hours day and night.  Notwithstanding that the Minister now proposes to impose additional taxation on these unfortunate men to the extent of another £56,000 in addition to what they are paying at the moment.  This imposition will fall in the same year in which we have had the toughest Budget the country has ever known over the last 30 years.  I think it is grossly unfair <Col N="84" /> that these men who are struggling to keep their heads above water and earn a miserable competence to sustain themselves and their families should be selected for this new taxation at a time when everyone will tell you that business was never so bad as it is at the moment.  This taxation will constitute a very severe blow to taxi owners and hackney drivers and I see no reason why such a heavy burden should be visited upon such a relatively small class.  I see no reason why it should be in the dimension of £56,000 per year.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which the Minister could get additional taxation.  He could close the gaps that exist at the present time and wipe out the abuse of people securing licences for public service vehicles which are not operated as public service vehicles.  It is well known that many people get a public service licence to run their own private cars.  They register their cars as public service vehicles.  They hire the vehicles to themselves and their families.  If they go into the market they pick the best of the traffic.  Unless the jobs pay well they withdraw their cars from public hire and use them as family cars at the reduced licence fee.</P>
    <P>Consideration of the invasion of other people's livelihood by folk of that kind by the Minister would, I think, enable the Minister and the local authorities to get from cars so licensed a much greater taxation return than they get at the moment.  In any case, if we acknowledge that hackney hiring is an occupation and that taximen are following a definite occupation, it is clearly desirable that some steps be taken in the interests of a class that renders a very useful public service, to stop that trade being invaded by everybody who wants to abuse the law and get cheap licences and at the same time deprive others of an opportunity of earning a fair livelihood. I am strongly opposed to this new taxation being visited upon these small men.  They have no resources to enable them to meet it and it is an unfair burden on them&mdash;particularly unfair after the burdens they have already borne arising out of the normal Budget.</P>
    <P>Let us come to private cars.  There <Col N="85" /> may be a case, so far as the smaller car is concerned, that this new taxation is nothing that we need worry about unduly.  There may be a case in present circumstances for an increase in certain respects.  I pass from the private car, because it is not the main consideration in my mind, to the question of goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>The taxation on the lighter types of goods vehicles is, roughly, the same as it was, and shows but little increase up to the three-ton or four-ton class. After that there is a very steep increase. While one may make the case for a certain increase in respect of motor vehicles having regard to the increased cost of road maintenance and other considerations, I think one must do so with some understanding of the position of those who use those vehicles at present.  So far as the lighter vehicles are concerned, there is not very much of an increase.  There is an increase which will be felt by those people, but one might say it is a bearable increase.</P>
    <P>When you come to vehicles of the four-five ton class, you get a steep rise in taxation.  For example, a vehicle of five tons rises in taxation from £90 to £145, with £15 for every quarter ton over the tonnage which is covered by the £145.  The taxation there is far too steep.  If you look at the taxation on the unladen weights of vehicles above the five-ton class, you can see there clearly evidence that the increase is 100, 150, 200 and 300 per cent. on classes of vehicles which cannot be said to be unduly heavy for our roads. What is the effect of that increase going to be?  It seems to me that one of the real dangers is that people who use vehicles of that kind will use less of the vehicles and that, instead of keeping them on the roads for the 12 months, providing employment for drivers and helpers during 12 months, the tendency will be to use the vehicles only when they can be fully employed.  That may well mean a curtailment of employment all round in the motor haulage business and it may show itself in intermittent employment where firms find it advantageous to suspend the licensing of lorries because of the new taxation <Col N="86" /> charges which they must meet.  I, therefore, desired in my amendment that that whole matter should be reconsidered with a view to ensuring that the increase which is so steep here would not be made so steep in whatever proposals were being brought before this House.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to the other class of vehicles, the very heavy vehicle of 12, 15 and 20 tons.  Under this Financial Resolution, they are going to bear a very heavy burden.  Quite frankly, we are not terribly worried about the burden that is imposed there.  We have to ask ourselves at this stage whether it is in the national interest that we should continue to import from all over the world heavy motor vehicles 20 tons and upwards and use them on Irish roads not made for them&mdash;and this at a time when our railways are screeching for traffic and when the taxpayer is being asked to pay £2,500,000 to keep the railways going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view and in the view of this Party, it would be a sounder national policy to put these large vehicles off the roads entirely, to save money that we at present export for the purchase of these vehicles and divert to the traffic-starved railways the quantity of goods which is hauled in these heavy imported lorries over Irish roads which are not capable of taking that traffic.  It would be much more honest to say that this heavy type of lorry would not be permitted to operate at all, and that we have an iron road in the railways capable of taking that heavy traffic.  The reasons for such a step are, first, to put the railways in an economic position; secondly, to save the employment which is in the railways and, thirdly, because the cost of maintaining our roads so as to allow these heavy vehicles to operate freely is a burden which neither the local ratepayer nor the national Exchequer is capable of sustaining on a satisfactory basis for any length of time.  There again I want a reconsideration of this matter in order that we might get a new slant in our national policy in respect of these heavy vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> I am convinced that we ought not encourage their use on the roads.  We are doing that here, we have allowed it to happen in the past, it is happening to-day, and it is going to continue in the future, even though there will be higher taxation.  The owners will also expect the roads to be made up so as to take the impact of these heavy imported lorries laden to their fullest capacity.  At the same time, the trains will be going empty.  We should not let these imported lorries transport the goods which the railways so essentially require.</P>
    <P>These are my views on the Resolutions. The Resolutions show no adequate measurement of our precise transport difficulties.  One does not know whether it is intended to be a transport policy, whether it is a road policy or whether it is a Supplementary Budget.  It has no distinguishing features about it, and might well be described as all three.  In my view, the matter has received inadequate consideration.  While certain small people are not being heavily taxed under these Resolutions, others are being unfairly taxed where there is no case for it.  In addition, there is the further fatal weakness that we are permitting to operate on our roads vehicles for which the roads were never intended when originally made. Because of these considerations, I would prefer to move that the matter be referred back for reconsideration; but if I cannot move an amendment on those terms, I have to move the only amendment open to me, that this new taxation be not operative for two or three years&mdash;in the hope that, if that is carried, the Government will get an opportunity in the meantime to consider the matter from a more sensible standpoint than is disclosed in these Resolutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Resolution and I support Deputy Norton's amendment in the spirit in which it is moved.  It is moved for the purpose of defeating and frustrating the intention of the Minister to increase the price of driving licences.  The Minister, in his explanation in regard to the set-up of the Finance Resolution, <Col N="88" /> made it quite clear that he and the Department of Local Government are just having to act as the catspaw of the Minister for Finance to impose increased budgetary charges on the people.</P>
      <P>The £11,000,000 additional taxation that was imposed in the Budget, plus the additional cost from £6,000,000 to £8,000,000 that was imposed upon the people's expenditure by the withdrawal of the food subsidies in the Budget, were enough in themselves to go on with at the time but now the Minister is picking up odd ha'porths of tar around the place.  Certainly the proposal to increase from 10/- to £1 the cost of motor licences in indeed a ha'porth of tar.  I do not know what kind of a hole it is going to stop in a road.  At any rate, we oppose it on the basis that it is a continuance of the whole budgetary policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over the general line of the Government budgetary policy except to mention one or two figures which will indicate in the meantime, in the taxation that was imposed in the intervening years since 1947, the amount of taxation and the amount of additional cost that was imposed on the motor industry and the users of motors.  The swing back is entirely to the heavy budgetary policy of the Government as exemplified by its approach to the Budget of 1947.</P>
      <P>In 1947, the additional taxation was imposed that, in the net way, would bring, during the year ending March, 1948, £2,500,000.  That was not sufficient and the Government of that time came to the Dáil in the autumn of that year and put up proposals for an additional £4,770,000 for the remaining part of the year.  Then the Government went out and the budgetary policy was pursued that lightened that imposition of taxation on the people for three years.  In that period, however, substantially heavy burdens were placed on the motoring fraternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the table explanatory of the Budget for 1948, there was a certain adjustment with regard to taxation in regard to beer and wines and there was an additional £300,000 by way of motor vehicle duties and £910,000 on motor spirit.  In the table explanatory <Col N="89" /> of the Budget for the following year, £300,000 was taken out of the Road Fund but a net relief of £733,000 was given, however, to the taxpayer. Again, in the table explanatory of the Budget for 1950, £300,000 was taken from the Road Fund and there was a net imposition of additional taxation to the extent of £355,000 imposed for the year.  In the table explanatory of the Budget for 1951, again £300,000 was taken from the Road Fund; £600,000 additional taxation was put on petrol and oils.  There was a net reduction in taxation to the extent of £264,000.  So that, during the three years ending 1949, 1950 and 1951, the main incidence of any additional taxation that was imposed bore on those who were running motors.  Nine hundred thousand pounds were taken from the Road Fund for budgetary purposes but the general incidence of taxation on the people was made easier and lighter.</P>
    <P>Now, in an astounding way, we swing round in the Budget for the current year to the imposition of £20,000,000 additional taxation on the people. Having done that, the Minister for Local Government is used by the Minister for Finance to come in and to impose nominally taxation to the extent of £830,000 and, in fact, to impose, by the taxes he is proposing, a very substantial increase over that amount because the general proposals he is making are going to dislocate industry, increase unemployment and prevent any systematic approach to road transport policy or even to policy with regard to the maintenance of the roads.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the annual cost to an ordinary individual of running a motor car at the present time, when you take into consideration that you wipe out depreciation by a fourth, is something over £200.  Since the Minister showed his hand with regard to the general line of taxation in the White Paper, the garage proprietors and garaging industry in this country have been faced with a phenomenon that they did not have to face since 1945.  Since 1945, most people who had got into the habit of putting their cars up for the winter months, and had got garage proprietors to block up their cars for the <Col N="90" /> winter months, took out their cars. They have been on the road for the 12 months.  Since the Minister's White Paper was published, the phenomenon has again shown itself, and garage proprietors are being asked to block up a substantial number of private cars. Now the winter is coming on and I would like to know if the Minister has given any consideration to what it means in regard to the drop in petrol consumption and the drop in revenue in regard to the non-payment of the motor tax over the winter quarter.</P>
    <P>The motor assembly industry has been established for quite a long number of years, and is giving a certain amount of general cost to the Minister, but it is in the interests of the nation's economy.  The motor assembly industry has become a very substantial industry. Has the Minister taken into consideration what the position is in the motor assembly industry at the present time?  Has he had a look at what has taken place with regard to the new private cars, new lorries and commercial vehicles that are coming on the road at the present time?</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Finance foreshadowed in his Budget at the beginning of the year that increased motor taxation would be imposed, we have seen that, whereas in the months of May, June, July and August, 1951, 1,502 new goods vehicles were registered, in the same four months in respect of the year 1952, following the threat of the Minister for Finance to impose additional motor taxation, that 1,502 has become 1,021. In June this year there were 343 less additional private cars registered.  In July, the number had gone down 217 as compared with last year, and in August it had gone down 263 as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>All that implies a substantial reduction of employment in the motor assembly industry and when you consider the number of cars that are being taken off the road, as a result of their lives being ended, it implies a contemplated fall in the use of petrol.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the industrial side there is an additional point.  One of the most satisfactory developments in connection with the motor industry in recent years has been the collaboration between the workers and the garage <Col N="91" /> proprietors to establish a proper system of apprenticeship training so that there will be a systematic approach, through our vocational schools and in a supervised way by the trade committee, to the training of young men for garage work and putting them into employment.  There is a systematic examination for these people and in the 1952 entrance examination there were 753 candidates for qualification for garage apprenticeship and 269 of these passed.  The examination took place in May or June and, up to the other day, out of the 269 who passed it has only been possible to place 67 in employment.  Of the young fellows who went into that work in the city and were nearing the finishing stage of their apprenticeship, 30 have been unemployed.</P>
    <P>There you have the reaction of this badly thought out scheme.  It is not related to any new approach to road development or improvement.  In my opinion, it is not related to any new frame of mind with regard to reducing the rates in the country or assisting local authorities.  It is just a question of seeing into whose pocket the Minister for Finance can put his hand in order to get a few more shillings out of it.  There is no consideration of how wide the effect of the action may be. The effect has gone down to the very threshold of our vocational schools, to the young people coming out of these schools and hoping to get into employment, and to the young fellows just reaching their final year of apprenticeship and hoping to get on full time pay in the garages both in the city and in the country, throwing them out on the roadside at a time when they might hope to get established in full economic life.</P>
    <P>It has gone further than that.  There is hardly a motor assembly business here that has not had to discharge from 50 to 100 men from employment. The same thing applies pretty generally in a lesser degree to garages, throughout the city at any rate, and I am sure it is occurring in the country. That is one way in which the Minister for Finance's proposal is operating through the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Then when you come to the increased tax on goods vehicles a situation is being created which will raise the cost of distribution in the country. If you raise the cost of transport to individual firms using their own transport for delivering their goods throughout the country, they will increase their charges and square their accounts.  By the time the increased charges for distribution have been passed on through the wholesale and retail channels, as a result of the £380,000 which the Minister for Finance expects to get from the increased tax on goods vehicles, an increased amount will be coming out of the pockets of the people who have to pay for the goods delivered by these vehicles.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the hackney drivers in the city raises very complicated questions as to the licences that are to be issued to people to engage in that trade.  The balance sheets of the hackney drivers operating in the city and the country have been carefully assembled by their various associations and I should like to hear from the Minister whether he has considered the representations put before him.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised many times as to why some portion of the increased tax on petrol should not be available for the maintenance of the roads.  It is a reasonable question.  It opens up the whole question of the approach to the maintenance and improvement of our road system. Instead of having a systematic approach to that, we have these proposals put before us by the Minister for Finance, unchecked in any way as far as I can see by the Minister for Local Government as to the effect they will have on the local authorities' rates and on the roads.  There will be many cynical expressions on the faces of the local representatives throughout the country when they hear that this money is to be provided to relieve the rates and to reduce the amount of money that will have to be provided from the rates.  The Minister asks that an additional 10/- should be paid by people who take out a driver's licence.  We are against that.</P>
    <Col N="93" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations in regard to these Resolutions.  In regard to the first one, which proposes to increase the cost of the driving licence from 10/- to £1 a year, I do not think there will be the public outcry against that which has been mentioned this evening.  I feel that in all matters with which this House has to deal, particularly in regard to matters of finance, there ought to be a realistic approach.  The Minister has told us that there has been no alteration in the cost of the driving licence since 1926.  The cost of the driving licence has been 10/- a year. Since 1926 there has been a very substantial change in the country. Generally speaking, wages and incomes have substantially increased.  The value of money has deteriorated, and 10/- in 1926 or 1930 would be equivalent to not much more than, if as much as, 5/- now.</P>
      <P>Actually in increasing the duty from 10/- to £1 there is very little alteration in the particular charge on the individual who has to get the licence.  I think that nobody in this House or nobody in the country will follow Deputy Norton in his suggestion that this huge impost is going to affect employment, that it is going to make it impossible for a driver to pay his driving licence.  Deputy Norton described it as a huge impost and that is what I term an unrealistic approach to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper which has been issued the full facts have been given in relation to roads, and everybody knows that wages for road workers and people engaged in repairing and making new roads have enormously increased, that the cost of materials used in the repair and in the making and maintenance of roads has also substantially increased. It is obvious that somebody must pay for the maintenance of our roads and it was clear to motorists that they would be required&mdash;and I think they accepted it that they would be required&mdash;to pay increased tax for the purpose of ensuring that the roads were maintained.  After all, these wonderful roads that we have all over the country now have been constructed and built and are maintained for the purpose of facilitating motor haulage and <Col N="94" /> motor transport.  It is obvious that if that is so the people who use the roads must pay for the roads.  If we approach this problem in that realistic way we will find that there are not so many objections to these Resolutions as the speeches by Deputy Norton and Deputy General Mulcahy would indicate. No Deputy here will say there is very much difference between the £ to-day and 10/- 12 years ago.  There is very little difference and I believe that, generally speaking, drivers of motor vehicles will realise that they must contribute something to the enormous charges the State and the local authorities have to undergo in regard to road repair and road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies I have received a circular letter this morning from the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland dealing with this question of motor taxation.  These gentlemen&mdash; whoever they are I do not know&mdash; come along and say that direct labour should be wiped out, that all road work should be done by contract, that there should be no direct labour on the roads because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They say: &ldquo;The proposed drastic increase in taxation especially on heavy vehicles is unnecessary, and if enforced will affect the cost of distributing essential goods and foodstuffs and thereby increase further the cost of living.&rdquo;  I am only referring to the other resolutions that they sent in connection with that to show that they were not concerned entirely with motor taxation.  They want to interfere with the machinery by which the roads are maintained.  They go further&mdash;I am quite sure Deputy Norton would not agree with that&mdash;by saying that &ldquo;licensed hauliers have the right and the obligation to operate on comparable <Col N="95" /> conditions with the national transport undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Obviously Deputy Norton and Deputy General Mulcahy have two different views in regard to road transport and in regard to rail transport, because Deputy Mulcahy wants more people employed in motor production and in connection with motor transport generally.  Deputy Norton says that he wants to put large vehicles off the road altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Norton said was that he wanted to put large vehicles off the road and divert to the traffic-starved railways the goods that were carried in these heavy vehicles.  He did mention the fact that some of these large vehicles are made abroad, but that was only incidental to his point that the large lorries hauling goods must be driven off the roads.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this problem of increased motor taxation with a number of ordinary people who have motor cars.  As I have already said, they expected that there would be an increase in the duty and they were very favourably impressed by the smallness of the increase.  In fact, there are some popular vehicles under this new arrangement on which taxation will be reduced, but that is in a general way as far as ordinary motors are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that Deputy Dunne, Deputy Norton, Deputy Corish and other Deputies of the Labour Party believe in a policy of road maintenance, in a policy that will maintain decent employment and continuous employment on the roads.  We can only have this continuous and decent employment on the roads if we are to have adequate financial provision for it, and any person who studies and understands the financial necessities of the State in 1952 will realise that additional money was necessary and had to be provided for the roads. Nobody will object to an increase in <Col N="96" /> the cost of driving licences to £1 or to the other increases mentioned here.</P>
    <P>There is one point in this regard which requires particular consideration, and again in this matter one treads a somewhat thorny path.  I refer to the problem of the taximen, particularly in Dublin City.  These taximen, particularly in Dublin City, render great service to the public, being available at all hours of the day and night.  These men realise that, in general, the roads must be maintained and that there cannot be stabilisation of duty, but they maintain&mdash;and I think they have a very strong case for consideration&mdash;that because of the nature of their public service, they should be given the benefit of a flat rate of duty.  They have interviewed the Minister or his representatives and have put forward their case in that regard in a reasonable way.  I feel that the reasonable case which taximen in Dublin and particularly those who are available at particular points in the city have made in regard to their own taxation should be favourably considered. They have made a very strong case for special consideration and I certainly should like to take this opportunity of supporting that case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton seemed to think that it would not matter very much whether it was to take effect now or in three months' time, but obviously under the machinery at present in operation, if a person knows that the cost of a driving licence is to be increased, it is up to him, if it pays him to do so, to go in and get a new driving licence.  As <Col N="97" /> apparently there is a precedent not only in regard to this matter but in regard to similar matters, there should be no question about giving the Minister the Resolution to-night.  Furthermore, a sense of responsibility would indicate that it is a matter on which there should be no division of the House, but even if there is a division, I feel that there are sufficient responsible Deputies to give the Minister his Resolution.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to listen to the pious platitudes of Deputy Cowan.  He comes in here and groans mournfully on behalf of the taximen, but will not answer the direct question as to whether he will put down an amendment to delete the imposition which it is proposed to place upon them and vote against his new found pals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time as he talks about the taximen, he says it is quite reasonable to impose on them an increase of 10/- in the cost of their driving licences.  I am completely opposed to this increase, because here again we have a continuation of all the viciousness associated with the extraction of money from the people, of whom Fianna Fáil have now become the masters.  They hit, in the first instance, with a Supplementary Budget a limited section of the community&mdash; they went for the smoker and the consumer of beer or whiskey.  Now they have singled out another section for the relentless heel of the oppressor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They call it &ldquo;changes in motor taxation&rdquo;.  They can call it whatever they like, but it is only a device whereby to extract, in an nonbudgetary way, money from the people. I have put in an amendment which I will get an opportunity of moving later, suggesting a reduction in the cost of driving licences, for the simple reason that motorists are the one section who have, on the one hand, to bear the grossly unfair increases in taxation and, <Col N="99" /> on the other, pay a 100 per cent. increase in the cost of driving licences.</P>
    <P>With pious unctuousness, Deputy Cowan talks about the reason for giving this Resolution to the Minister to-night, and suggests that there should be unanimity in the House, but the reason given by the Minister for the necessity for this Resolution is sheer poppycock, and nobody knows it better than the Minister himself.  Driving licences are renewable annually from the day on which they were taken out, and their expiry date is the evening of the previous day in the following year, and it is ridiculous to suggest that there is an urgency as between 3 o'clock this evening and 10.30 to-night about getting that Resolution through.  The motor taxation offices all over the country were closed at the time the announcements were made, and even if the Minister were to be delayed an extra 24 hours, the advantage that could be taken of it would be microscopic This is the self-same Government who are now seeking to extract £135,000 extra by way of doubling the charge for driving licences as handed back to their pals, the dance-hall proprietors, a sum of £140,000 because it was too difficult to collect.  Where is the sanity in that type of Government activity?  In this case, in the main, the persons whom they will ask to carry the heavy cost of tax increases over a wide range of vehicles are those whom they will also tax through the 100 per cent. increased cost of driving licences.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the present Government, using, with a certain amount of adroitness, the Department of Local Government, is seeking virtually £1,000,000 through this device.  The pious statement is made by the Minister for Local Government that it will in some way ease the burden of rates for the people because there will necessarily be a greater grant out of the Road Fund for road-making. That is a rather naïve suggestion, particularly when one realises, having regard to the Finance Accounts of 1952, that the motorists, between taxation on vehicles and on petrol, made the substantial contribution of nearly £12,000,000 to the revenue last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> If the Minister is in earnest about giving subvention-in-aid to the Road Fund for the maintenance of roads, to relieve the burden of rates on local councils, there is a more equitable system of doing it than this method. Would it not be reasonable to apportion some part of the revenue derived from motor vehicles and heavy transport vehicles through taxation of light and heavy hydrocarbon oils and petrol to the Road Fund?</P>
    <P>In this particular nasty bit of financial jugglery, Fianna Fáil have singled out a limited section to hit hardest. We can give back £140,000 as a present to the dance-hall proprietors, but we will impose on an already overtaxed and overburdened hackney system an additional £56,000.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest for one moment that it is impossible to bear certain of the taxes but I shall not be like Deputy Peadar Cowan, trying to juggle on both sides of the fence.  It is a heinous, filthy effort by the Government to try to take from that limited section&mdash;the hackney owners and taxi- men&mdash;£56,000 extra by this device, to say nothing of the extra couple of thousand pounds that they will take from the same section in the increased cost of driving licences.  That will be no credit to this House if it is passed into law but it is typical of the intellect, mind and financial approach of the Government that conceived it.</P>
    <P>I shall not make any bones about the fact that I oppose this White Paper completely because it is creating the undesirable and unpleasant precedent of using a device such as this.  There was a short statement in the Budget statement that we would have tax extraction <i>par excellence</i>, by a Government that was afraid to bring in any type of Supplementary Budget but which uses this device to avoid the necessity for doing that.</P>
    <P>The proposal to increase the cost of driving licences by 100 per cent. at this moment is just another indication of the viciousness of the financial policy of the Government.  For 12 months it was discrediting the country generally, depressing our credit, critical of borrowing, critical of certain developments.  Having worked up that <Col N="101" /> atmosphere, they swallow everything holus polus and go for a loan of unprecedented size at an unprecedented rate of interest and they get it.  Now, having had to abandon their denial of the economic soundness of financing certain capital projects from borrowing, they find themselves in the position that they have to seek money for other types of current expenditure and here is the device, conceived in shame and brought to light in a most discreditable manner.  The Minister for Local Government, with the responsibility of office on his shoulders, comes in clamouring for Resolution No. 1 to-night on the most spurious and the most shallow possible foundation.</P>
    <P>Pious Deputy Cowan says something about 10/- in 1926 being the same as £1 in 1952, that the country will not object to it.  Has the same pious Deputy taken the least care to examine the amount that has been extracted from the motoring section of the community in the interim?  Year after year every expense in connection with motoring, whether it be the cost of petrol, road tax or repairs, has risen steeply.  Apparently it is the Government's view that this is the section of the community that can be most easily oppressed and from whom it is easiest to extract money.  On this occasion it is not on the back that is best able to bear the burden that the load is placed. The main viciousness of the thrust is against a limited section of the community and Deputy Norton did not overpaint the picture when he described their conditions.</P>
    <P>The existence of the hackney owner or taximan to-day is, at best, precarious. Is that particular section in any way equipped to carry the burden of £56,000 extra?  I do not think so. It would serve a very useful purpose if many Deputies of the Party opposite would consider the individual merits of the particular section that will be hit.</P>
    <P>I shall not cavil at an increase in taxation that may hit certain types of motor cars.  That is not the burden of our complaint against this system. First of all, our complaint is against the method and the technique used to extract money.  Secondly, we take a firm stand on behalf of a very <Col N="102" /> oppressed section of the commuity who will be nearly harassed out of existence if the impositions now contemplated are put into effect.</P>
    <P>Take the question of roads and road maintenance, which the Minister is trying to use as the gambit to inflict these impositions.  Are certain types of traffic or certain sections of the community to carry the burden of that maintenance or is it to be distributed in a more equitable fashion?  Deputy Cowan endeavoured to distort and twist certain suggestions made by the Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;Deputy Norton&mdash;apropos of certain heavy vehicles.  I was listening during the course of all this debate and the reference made by Deputy Norton was to vehicles of the 20 ton unladen weight calibre carrying immense loads of heavy goods that might be diverted to the traffic-starved railways.  That is something that merits a lot more consideration than the pietistic stupidity of Deputy Cowan.</P>
    <P>A very serious problem is created when very heavy vehicles use roads not fit to carry them.  It is quite true that the incidence of costs in road maintenance has gone up considerably.  What is the true position?  Why are we constantly talking about the Road Fund when, in fact, millions of pounds belonging to that fund have been used for purposes other than roads.  We are now trying to repair the ravages made on that fund by successive Governments by putting most of the burden on the backs of the motoring community. When I say the motoring community, I mean that the burden is being carried, in the main, by people who are carrying goods, using lorries, hackney cars, or taxis.  We are looking for money from this limited section of the community when, in fact, the fund that needs to be reconstituted has been robbed systematically and consistently over a period.  What is the real explanation of the difficulty?</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that now is not the time or that this is not the way in which the Government should deal with the problem of road maintenance? It is not the duty of the Government to try to crush out vehicles by imposing taxation by way of road <Col N="103" /> tax.  It is their duty to conceive and direct a policy whereby vehicles will not be allowed to operate where, in the considered opinion of the Government, their weight and type makes it impossible for our Irish roads to carry them.  What will come about in the final analysis?  The weak will be pushed out and the strong will be able to survive and ultimately extort, by way of increased charges, the full burden of these increases from the distribution costs of industry throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have got to face this White Paper on the basis of the amount of taxation that each particular type and class of vehicle can bear.  In my view, it would serve a useful and a practical purpose if the Government would reconsider <i>in toto</i> the question of increasing by 100 per cent. the cost of licences and would review <i>in toto</i> the question of the burden imposed on hackney men and on taximen.</P>
    <P>As regards lorries, we have a clear anomaly; the Government is talking in one breath about a Bill to remove restrictive practices and yet, with a concealed viciousness, they are introducing, by means of additional taxation, a restriction that will effectively curtail the use of lorries.  Is it reasonable or fair to allow that particular type of viciousness to go unchallenged? We do not intend to allow that in this House.  It does not matter what pious hopes may be cherished in the expansive bosom of Deputy Cowan.  Tooth and nail, every inch of the way, the Opposition will fight every one of these proposals because they are ill-conceived and are placing a burden on a limited section of the community without having any consideration for the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>Apparently, Deputy Cowan could see no merit in the fact that Deputy Mulcahy indicated a repercussion already felt in vocational schools in connection with trainees for garages and for the motor trades generally. Motorists and lorry owners can be taxed to saturation point.  This Government has already adopted that <Col N="104" /> practice in connection with cigarettes, beer and tobacco and they are already feeling the pinch; despite vicious taxes on these commodities they are not getting increased revenue.</P>
    <P>Is it the Government's desire to crush many of the 23,000 lorry owners out of business?  If it is, why do they not come out like men and say so? Why use these unpractical and heinous methods of eliminating them?  Many of these men are committed in a very heavy way for hire purchase repayments and many of them are making a very limited income with their trucks.  How are they going to bear this additional burden, or is the Government completely unconcerned as to whether or not distribution costs go up?  Is it the Government's idea to &ldquo;grab while you can and grab as much as you can&rdquo;?  That is certainly clearly indicated in this White Paper.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government would be well advised to return this document to the secret recesses from which it was unearthed and to bury it there again.  In the final analysis, this is but a loophole out of the task of bringing in a demand for extra money by way of a Supplementary Budget.  It is opening up an avenue through which the Irish people can be taxed, but it is a dangerous avenue.  It is placing different sections of the community in the position that they do not know when the blow will fall on them.  This is something that would have been honestly met if the Minister for Finance faced up to his own responsibility instead of making a catspaw or a puppet out of the Minister for Local Government for his purpose.</P>
    <P>I am strongly opposed to the increased burden that will have to be borne by people operating two-ton to five-ton trucks in this country.  In the main, many of these lorries are individually owned, operated by one person who is making a living for himself and his helper and their families.  These people deserve better consideration from the Government. May I say, for the information of Fianna Fáil Deputies, that they will get a rude awakening later because many of these people were at one time loyal adherents of that Party?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> A person who has already had to bear the burden of increased petrol costs, increased repair costs, increased costs of tyres and tubes, is now to be crushed out of existence by this additional tax.  This proposal is typical of the Government that conceived it, and I prophesy that it will die in the shame in which it was born.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to those Resolutions, and I deprecate particularly the manner in which the Minister introduced Resolution No. 1.  He has tried to rush it through the House, under the cloak of Resolution No. 2, with the purpose of which every Deputy was already familiar.  The reason he gave for endeavouring to rush it through the House was that motor drivers throughout the country might attempt to evade the tax if the Resolution were not passed to-night.  I do not accept that excuse at its face value for this reason.  If the Minister wanted to give the House a chance of discussing this proposal in full, he could have introduced a short Bill of two or three sections which would invalidate any licence taken out in the period from to-night until the Resolution had been fully debated and disposed of, that is, any licence except one taken out for the first time.  Any other licence could be invalidated.  If some persons took out a licence a month ago and proceeded to take out another licence now &mdash;it would be inconceivable that anybody but a lunatic would do so&mdash;a short Bill of two or three sections would quickly set the matter right and give the House a chance of discussing this proposal in all its aspects.  Yet the Minister comes in here with this lame-legged excuse, an excuse which nobody but a child would swallow.  Apparently, Deputy Cowan has swallowed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another cheap device to try to extract from motor drivers and those who take out driving licences a sum of £135,000.  It all boils down to the fact that the desire of the present Government is not to ascertain how to run the country best, how to run the country economically or how to levy taxation in the most equitable and impartial way.  It appears to me that the Minister for Finance and other Ministers are taxing their brains to see <Col N="106" /> what pockets in the country they are going to pick next.  They leave no section untouched.  The Budget this year contained quite a number of shocks.  They started by driving up the cost of living for ordinary workers by abolishing the food subsidies under the Budget proposals.  Not a month or a week has gone by since without some new section of the people being hit.</P>
    <P>Now, the motor drivers in the country, who are by no means a wealthy class, will have to contribute another £135,000.  It is a significant fact that that is exactly the same figure as the amount remitted to the dance-hall proprietors last April.  The Minister may smile, but I might remind him that there are many drivers in the country who do not own the vehicles they drive.  They are just ordinary workmen, some driving tractors, some lorries and some cars, to try to earn a living.  As the previous speaker pointed out, a driver's licence is the tool of his trade.  It is the key to the door of his job, because without it the owner of the vehicle by whom he is employed would not allow him to take it on the high road.  It is an offence for the owner of the vehicle as well as for the driver if he takes the vehicle out without a licence.  This is the allegedly wealthy class which the Minister for Finance, using the Minister for Local Government as his tool or his big stick, is seeking to crush.  The Minister should not forget either that there are many drivers of hackney cars who do not own the cars which they drive. They are merely driving for wages. There are also many young fellows in the country driving tractors for farmers and for tillage contractors, driving lorries and vans for shopkeepers and other people.  All these young people are now being called upon to pay £1 per year before getting a driver's licence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan says that 10/- does not count, that it does not matter a whole lot.  It is very easy for Deputy Cowan to stand up in the Dáil and say that 10/- does not count.  The increase in the price of flour and bread did not count.  The increase in the price of drink and cigarettes did not count, and the increase which the worker will have <Col N="107" /> to pay under this proposal will not count.  Is that the attitude of the Government&mdash;that all these things do not count?</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked just now if the Government wanted to crush out of existence small business people and if they think it is in the national interest to eliminate such sections, why did they not come out in the open and say so?  Then everybody would know where they stood.  While I know that it would be irrelevant to discuss the provisions of the last Budget now, I think I may be permitted to say that the Budget did hit small businessmen particularly with the result that many of them were eliminated.  Now it seems that small businessmen with travelling shops must go off the road or that the drivers of these vans, mostly young country boys, who would otherwise have to emigrate, must help to pay the full price of having Fianna Fail in power.  If the Minister and myself had the means at our disposal to find out exactly what the actual number was, I do not think I would be far wrong in saying that only one out of every four people who possess driver's licences himself owns a mechanically propelled vehicle.  The other three of the four took out their licences so that they might earn a living by driving these vehicles for other people.  This additional tax of 10/- per head will be taken out of the pockets of what I might justly describe as the hardest working and poorest section of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's lame story that it is necessary to rush this through the House to-night on the grounds that there would be too much evasion of the £1 from a driver's licence. Does the Minister think for an instant that a person who took out a driver's licence in the summer would, just for the sake of diddling the State out of 10/-, rush in to-day, to-night or to-morrow morning to get a licence for 10/- because next July he would have to pay £1?  I want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that a simple Bill of two or three sections would prevent any such evasion and meet the Minister's wishes in that regard if <Col N="108" /> he wanted to do that and give this House a chance of a full debate.  It is a mean and cheap device to rush this very contentious matter through the House without a debate.  It is a very cheap device to cheat Deputies by slipping this in under cover of Resolution No. 2 about which I will say a few words now.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give me or the House a sound reason why the £6 tax on agricultural tractors should be increased to £8?  If he gives me a simple answer to that I will accept it. but I know that the Minister has not got a reasonable answer.  Does he think that an ordinary young fellow down the country who perhaps went to England and worked in a coal mine in danger of his life in order to buy a tractor, a plough or other agricultural implement with which to earn his living and serve his neighbours, is a man to be taxed?  How much damage does that man do on the road?  He travels with his threshing machine, tractor or plough for one hour a week on the road, or two at the very most. The Minister seeks to take from that particular section £31,000, I think. These tractors pay £6 which compares with a small car or medium-sized car. Six pounds is exactly twice too much if we are seeking to tax a vehicle because of the amount of damage or user on the road.  A tractor is shod with a pair of ordinary motor tyres in front and with what are called land tread tyres on the back.  It is not more than 12 or 15 cwt. and its speed does not exceed 12 or 15 miles per hour.  It is proposed to take an extra £2 for each of these tractors.  If the Minister were to tax farmers who were able to keep tractors for their own use I would have very little to say of it, but I do not know half a dozen farmers in my county who have their own tractor and I am sure that the same applies in every other county.  Most of the tractors we see on the roads are owned by young men, members perhaps of large families, who used their intelligence and brains to get a little money together to start life here and work for themselves. Every Deputy in the House must be familiar with that kind of thing.  It is a cheap thing, a mean thing and a nasty thing to clap £2 extra, apart <Col N="109" /> from other things, on them.  Coupled with that also, is that encouraging from the point of view of this famous demand for more production from the land which we hear so much about? Is the Minister for Local Government showing that his spots have not changed since the time when, as Minister for Agriculture, he threatened to put tractors in over the farmer's walls and knock down his fences?  That type of statement has miraculously disappeared since 1948 and has not been taken up by the new Minister for Agriculture. I will not dwell further on that except to say that to tax these drivers, at least those who are serving the farming community, who have helped enormously to increase agricultural production, who have tried to make an honest living in their own country, having perhaps earned in a foreign country oftentimes in danger of their lives the means to make that living, is a mean thing for the Government to do.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the small public service vehicle.  I do not know what type of district the Minister comes from but I come from a district, a county, the activities of which would come to a standstill if the hackney car as we know it were wiped out.  It is the only means of conveyance for people to town or market or on the occasion of any family celebration or of any family trouble.  They are being taxed out of existence.  Again, most of these vehicles are owned by young men who thought twice before emigrating or perhaps did emigrate to England in order to earn the price of the car with which they are earning their living and serving their locality.  Perhaps Córas Iompair Eireann would come in and provide a bus service in that locality.  But is that the type of person who should be taxed out of existence?  I do not think so.  I think, furthermore, that a lot of these people who helped, many of them, honestly and sincerely to put the present Government into power, will be sadly disillusioned at the way they are being blistered by the Government which they put in.  However, they will have another chance in the near future to undo what they have done.</P>
    <P>There is a question I would like to <Col N="110" /> ask the Minister: is all the Road Fund, is all the taxation which comes from the motor trade&mdash;I am including the duty on vehicles, the duty on parts coming into the country, the duty on petrol which is about 2/- a gallon, drivers' licences and a few other things &mdash;is all that money used for the purpose of road construction, road development and road repair?  I know that it is not, at least I feel that it is not and that, furthermore, it has not been so used in the past.  If the Minister has plans to improve the roads of this country and the motor tax is to be used for that purpose, I think he should give these plans to the House.  Deputy Costello asked him to do that shortly before he made his opening statement and he did not do so.  It is very discourteous of a Minister not to give facts and figures when they are asked for, particularly when they are connected with such a vital issue as has been raised here.  I want to condemn this dodge&mdash;it is nothing else but a dodge&mdash;to introduce a Supplementary Budget.  The Fianna Fáil Government, when in office previously, introduced a Supplementary Budget in October, 1947, and I think they learned a very severe lesson.  I do hope that the country will have a chance to teach them a similar lesson in the very near future for coming back to their old tricks.</P>
    <P>The last class hit by Resolution No. 2 is the lorry owners.  Why is the Minister, why are the Government, determined to crush these people out of existence?  I say to the Minister&mdash; I say it in all sincerity, without rancour or bias&mdash;that if it is in the best public interest that these people should be put off the road, why not come into the open and do so without adopting this subterfuge, this dodge, to crush them in a quiet way?  If it is in the best interests of the nation to eliminate these people or that particular type of business from the country, why not come out in the open?  The running of the country is not a thing which should be concealed. It is like poking at these people out through a fence while the man who is doing the poking is well hidden. There is no need for that.  The country would be better pleased with <Col N="111" /> a Government which did not adopt that attitude.  The people know quite well that any Government must, from time to time, face unpleasant facts and unpleasant situations.</P>
    <P>I close on the note that I do not agree with the present Government's policy of crushing out the small businessman, the small shopkeeper, the small publican, the small lorry owner, every small man, leaving nobody in the country but one mass of ordinary people who all adopt the same means of livelihood and a few monopolies or cartels to do what they like with that mass.  I do hold that the small shopkeeper, let him have a travelling shop or not, the small publican, the young man who is earning his living with a lorry or with a tractor and tillage set and who is doing tillage contracting work for his neighbours who, perhaps, are not wealthy enough to buy this machinery, are filling a very useful place in the life of the community and they should not be eliminated, as appears to be the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I want to make quite clear that we in Clann na Talmhan are opposing these two Resolutions.  I hold that the tax to be levied is not needed.  Will the Minister tell me that all the Road Fund has been spent on road development, repair and improvement in the past few years?  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that, if this new measure goes through, the tax to be levied will be devoted exclusively to road repair and development?  Will he give the House an assurance that if lorry owners, hackney owners and other such people lose their livelihood, as a result of this new taxation, Córas Iompair Eireann will come to the rescue of the people in the rural areas who have been deprived of the service of these vehicles?  The Minister should answer these questions without ambiguity because they are extremely important matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is just a Supplementary Budget.  We are told that these taxes are necessary for the purpose of the maintenance of the roads.  If we are going to get to a <Col N="112" /> stage in this country where every section of the community is to be mulcted for the purpose of enabling the Government to take over <i>in toto</i> the expenditure of all the money in the country, I feel that we are gradually heading for a socialist totalitarian state.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 1, which proposes to increase the cost of a driver's licence, represents a 100 per cent. tax.  It is to come into effect as from to-night lest the Government should miss even one 10/- on driving licences in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the cost of the maintenance of roads is going up.  Let us, however, examine for a few moments why the cost of everything in this country &mdash;whether it be the maintenance of roads or anything else&mdash;is going up Prices are going up for the simple reason that, day by day, and hour by hour, increased charges are placed on every section of the community.  The Minister's suggestion&mdash;he is only deputising for the Minister for Finance&mdash; is that these taxes are necessary because the cost of the roads has increased. If you increase the cost of driving licences then, straightway, you increase the charges.  Let us review the situation as it affects the country as a whole.  This Financial Resolution is further evidence of the vicious circle we have had to contend with ever since the Fianna Fáil Government got into power.  To start with, it is going to cause dislocation in practically every factory and every industry and it is going to cause a rise in the price of practically every commodity.  Some of the bigger factories or bigger firms employ as many as 15 or 20 lorries. They have now to face a 100 per cent. increase in the cost of driving licences and there are also very heavy overhead charges on the lorries.  The owners and directors of these firms are not philanthropists and they are not going to accept these increases without passing on some of them.  These increases will react on the cost of delivery of the raw materials and of distributing the goods which are manufactured from the raw materials.  Somebody has to pay these extra costs and it means that the price of the article will go up straightway because the cost of producing it goes up.  The next thing is that in all <Col N="113" /> probability there will be a very reasonable demand for increased wages.  They will go up, too.  In that way, the vicious circle continues.</P>
    <P>I know of a merchant in my constituency who has 20 lorries.  He deals quite a lot in grain, and uses the heavier type of lorry for his business. These lorries are essential for farmers in a county such as Wexfore, where there is a lot of tillage.  We want to dispose of our coarse grain and our wheat as soon as possible after we sell it.  What will be the position in the future?  Assuming that the merchants will be able to maintain their present number of lorries on the road, and to continue the useful employment which they give, they will charge more for the transport of the grain, and that increased charge will come out of the pockets of the farmers, who will, in addition, be hit as a result of the proposal in connection with tractors.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about the Government and about their intentions to develop the industrial arm of the country and to increase agricultural production.  It was more or less suggested that any extra taxation which they would impose would be on luxury goods.  Are tractors luxury goods?  Is there any justification in the wide world for the increase in the tax on tractors?  There is no justification for the increased tax on tractors, except that this is a Supplementary Budget and that the Government want to get more money.  One would think that they would have learned a lesson as a result of the previous Supplementary Budget which they introduced, and which was the direct cause of putting them out of office.  One would think that they would have learned a lesson as a result of what has happened since the imposition of penal taxes by the Minister for Finance in his recent Budget&mdash; penal taxes which he imposed on so-called luxuries, namely, beer, wine, whiskey and cigarettes.  Since the imposition of these extra taxes there has been a falling-off in the consumption of these commodities.  I maintain that, apart from disrupting the commercial life of this country, the Government will not get the same return of revenue which they got heretofore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Let us again examine the position from the point of view of the farming community: one can talk about farmers nowadays without having people look askance at you, because the people of the country as a whole realise that, in the final analysis, they have to depend on us.  What about manures?  We had to pay enough for them this year.  We were told that one of the reasons why we had to pay so much for manures was the cost of transport.  Some of us were hoping that next year manures would be a bit cheaper: I understand the price is coming down.  Any hope which we had in that direction will now be nullified.  On the whole, heavy lorries are used for the transport of manures. I am 100 per cent. behind the railways and behind increasing the carriage of goods on the railways.  The railways, however, do not run near the farmers' doors, and for that reason lorries are favoured for the transport of certain commodities.  These commodities have to be transported by lorry and somebody has to pay for it.  The Government will have the money and they may wish to utilise it for various purposes. They may utilise it for the purpose of bolstering up Córas Iompair Eireann. The fact, at any rate, is that this additional taxation is going to hit every section of the community.</P>
    <P>These Resolutions represent a further drive in the policy outlined in the White Paper.  That policy was to the effect that when this Government took over the people had too much money, that the people should not be allowed to spend the money and that it was the Government's job to spend it. That is really what is behind these proposals and that is what is behind the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It seems that we are going to have a division on this proposal to increase taxation. There is no use in issuing a warning to the Fianna Fáil Deputies because they belong to a Party and have to vote with that Party.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to warn the three or four Independent Deputies who will vote with the Government that this is just the first of a long series of marches into the Division Lobby, and that this Government intend to mulct the people and to take every shilling that they <Col N="115" /> can from them.  In other words, they intend to run this country according to their own methods, and they intend, in spite of all their promises to the contrary, to eradicate all private enterprise. That is where they are riding for a fall.  Our only hope is that we will get a chance, and get it soon, to put them out of office, and that the Fianna Fáil Party and Government will come down before they have wrecked, crippled and destroyed the trade, industry, agriculture and commerce of the country.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long on this Resolution because most of the things that I had intended to say have already been said.  One of my colleagues has asked the House to give the Minister this Resolution to-night.  I want to know, what is the hurry?  I earnestly hope that the House will not give the Minister the power to-night or on any other night to increase taxation on the taximen and on the hackney owners.  They are already overburdened with taxation. Their petrol has been taxed, and also their tyres, the oil they use and the cars they own.  Repairs are now costing them almost double what they used to cost.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to exclude these men, who have a hard struggle at the moment, from the effects of this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to attend a funeral at an early hour one morning last week.  I took a taxi in O'Connell Street.  The man whom I engaged told me that he was just about to go home, that he had been out all night and that his receipts for the night were 7/6.  He said to me: &ldquo;Everything we have is taxed; they have taxed our tyres, our petrol and oil; they have taxed our cigarettes and our bread and butter and they have put an extra tax on our cars.&rdquo; To tax that man's car is equivalent to taxing the tool which he uses to earn a livelihood.  He tries to earn a living with that car so that he may be able to pay all his other taxes.  I hope the Minister will see his way to exclude these men from the burden of the tax.  They are a hardworking body of men.  They have to be out in all <Col N="116" /> kinds of weather.  We are told that the tourist season has been reasonably good, but the taximen and the hackney men have a hard time during the winter.  They get very little to do and are often on a back hazard for hours.  Then they are called up to a front hazard outside a hotel.  A man may get a call off a front hazard and the person may give him 2/6.  When he makes that call he has to go back to the tailend of the hazard and wait a long time before he gets another call.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton drew attention to the fact that there are private people encroaching on the business of these men.  It was pointed out that if there is a good fare to be taken these private individuals, with a hackney licence, take the cream of the business.  That is very unfair competition.  In my opinion, it is up to the men's organisation to help the Minister to eliminate it.  I should like to point out&mdash;so far it has not been touched upon by any previous speaker&mdash;that a taximan must have two licences.  First of all, he must have an ordinary motor driving licence and, secondly, a special licence which gives him the right to drive a taxi.  I want to know from the Minister whether he is going to increase both.  These taximen are having a very hard time.  The taximan whom I engaged last week told me of the hard night that he had. That applies to all taximen in Dublin. He talked to me about the number of household things that are taxed.  He said that they were being taxed out of existence, and wound up by saying: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, will you tell me why do they always hit the weak?&rdquo;  He repeated that a second time before I left him.  By &ldquo;they&rdquo; he meant the Government.</P>

      <P>I forget that.  I intend <Col N="117" /> to move an amendment at a later stage to the effect that the taximen and the hackney men be excluded from this increase.  I would make a special plea to the Minister to consider that.  One of the Independents who is supporting the Minister's Party put up what Deputy Collins said was a double case.  He did say that he hoped the Minister would get his Resolution to-night, and that there would be no amendment carried.</P>
      <P>He then went on to extend his sympathy to the taxi drivers and the hackney men.  I wonder will he vote for my amendment or for any of the other amendments, and thereby give practical effect to his sympathy, or will he be content to pay lip service only to this very deserving body?  Will the Minister do better and, instead of providing the opportunity for driving the Deputy into the Lobby one way or the other, concede that it was never intended to include the taxi drivers and the hackney car drivers in either of these Resolutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy Norton deferring the operation of these Financial Resolutions.  I have never seen Resolutions before this House which called more for reconsideration than do these two that are before us now.  They are ill-conceived.  They are unjust. Indeed, I would go so far as to say they are unwise.  They impose taxation without any regard to the type of people who will have to meet that taxation. In imposing taxation it is a fundamental principle that those imposing it should consider the type of people who will have to meet it.  The Minister proposes to impose these additional taxes without any reference to the effect they will have on the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that 10/- is not an inordinate increase in the cost of a motor vehicle licence.  An increase from 10/- to £1 would not be unreasonable in many cases, but when one comes to apply that level of taxation to men who earn their livelihood by running hackney cars, taxis or lorries there is cause for grave dissatisfaction. Many of these men are not employed <Col N="118" /> whole-time.  They dare not present themselves to a potential employer without having their licences.  As Deputy Norton and Deputy Byrne have pointed out, a driving licence is an implement or tool in so far as these men are concerned, and it would be just as consistent for the Minister to tax the hammer, the chisel or the saw that the carpenter uses.  It is manifestly unfair to impose the same level of taxation in relation to the driving licences of men who make their livelihood by driving taxis or hackney cars as is imposed upon those who drive merely for pleasure or for some other purpose.  I think this proposal is illconsidered. If the concession asked for was given by the Minister I do not think that the relief given would entail any considerable loss to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to increase taxation upon vehicles.  These men are earning a very precarious livelihood.  I am not so conversant with conditions in the City of Dublin as I am with those in the City of Limerick and throughout the country.  These men are put to the pin of their collar to earn a livelihood. Apart altogether from the hardship and injustice involved, this Resolution must result in a net increase in unemployment because people will be driven out of employment.  Any taxation that reduces employment is bad taxation.  These men at the present time are standing at their hazards waiting, Micawber-like, for something to turn up.  Because of the increase of private motorists on the one hand and the scarcity of money in the pockets of the ordinary citizen on the other hand there is not to-day the same volume of employment for these men.  They must maintain their vehicles in first-class condition.  There are special officers of the Garda Síochána to check their vehicles for the protection of the public. They must use up-to-date high-powered cars.  They must pay the tax on their vehicles and it is unfair that they should be asked to meet this extra burden.  I hold that they should be exempt from the increases proposed under this Resolution.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed in connection with the two and three ton lorry are not excessive.  After that there are very steep increases and I think they <Col N="119" /> should be reconsidered.  I have no sympathy with the very heavy lorries using our roads.  I would like to put them off the roads completely but I do not think it is fair to do that by way of taxation.  Taxation was never intended as a secret weapon.  Its purpose is to raise sufficient funds to carry on the business of the State.  I would put all the heavy lorries off the road and I am sure I would be supported in that by our engineers. Maintaining the roads will be a very costly procedure so long as these 25 to 30 ton lorries continue to use our roads. I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulty experienced in maintaining the roads.  A couple of years ago we spent £19,000 per mile building up from the bog surface to the top of the road. This country could not afford to finance road construction and maintenance on that scale but that is the prospect with which it will find itself faced if these very heavy vehicles are allowed to continue using our roads.  All that traffic could be diverted on to the railways.  Putting these lorries off the road could be achieved by other methods apart from taxation.  I do not like to see taxation abused.  The engineers have advised that these heavy vehicles should not be allowed to operate.  The ordinary lorry driver is entitled to protection.  I object to these tractors and trailers 40 feet long twisting and turning round our roads. I have no use for them whatsoever.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, I consider that this proposal has been fired to the Dáil without due consideration having been given to it and to the effects it will have.  As I said earlier, in some instances there will be a reduction rather than an increase, while, at the same time, it will drive out of employment some people who are making a very hard and hazardous living giving service to the public and who are entitled to be protected.  For these reasons, I ask the Minister to reconsider these proposals and bring back something of a more reasonable nature, to try to achieve whatever increase he needs for the Road Fund and for the building of roads.  There is no use in getting the money with one hand and, on the other hand, <Col N="120" /> driving people to work on the roads with picks and shovels instead of driving hackneys&mdash;as I have seen a hackney man doing in Limerick, working a concrete mixer on the roads when he lost his job as a hackney man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion.  Deputy Norton's approach was not unreasonable. He did give away the main case against the motion, by accepting right away the principle that the very heavy lorries should be heavily taxed with a view to their elimination from the road traffic.  He was not entirely reasonable in his attack on the increase in the cost of driving licences.  Any person who owns a car either for pleasure or profit will not regard an increase of 10/- a year for a driver's licence as excessive, when we consider the value of money to-day as compared with its value when licences were first introduced nearly 30 years ago.  If a person finds that an additional 10/- makes it impossible for him to drive a car, then he should not be driving at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton made one point which was a very interesting one.  He said there are motor drivers, employees of motor owners, who have to pay their own licence fee, and he pointed out that this increase would be a hardship on them.  I admit it would be a hardship on them, but I feel it is not right or proper that any employee of a motor owner should have to pay the fee for his own driving licence.  The person who owns the car should not only pay his employee, but should pay for the licence also.  It would be only a matter of prudence for the car owner to make that payment, so as to ensure that the driver would be duly licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point, on which most Deputies would feel a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Norton, was when he made the case on behalf of <Col N="121" /> the taxi owners and hackney drivers. The strongest case he made in their favour was that in many cases they have to compete with wealthy people who have other sources of livelihood, and who use their cars for hackney purposes in competition with those who have to depend on them for their main source of livelihood.  In so far as the increased tax on hackney drivers is concerned, the Government would be taking a more effective measure to assist those deserving people if they were to protect them from unfair competition. A man who has purchased a car for the purpose of making his livelihood out of hackney work, is entitled to be protected from competition from people who simply have cars for pleasure and who, maybe, want to earn a little pin money by using their cars now and then for hackney work.  It is along these lines that the Government should proceed in seeking to help taxi owners and hackney drivers generally.</P>
    <P>A good number of speakers on the Opposition side so far have mentioned that they are strongly opposed to this increase in the cost of driving licences and to the other taxes imposed, in so far as they concern all types of motorists. In general, there is not a strong case against the very moderate increases that are provided in this motion in respect of private cars.  As a matter of fact, in the case of some types of private car the taxation is being reduced under this motion.  Altogether, the increases are not substantial.  It is noteworthy that a somewhat different attitude is being taken up by some members of the Opposition from that which they took up earlier in the year in regard to the Budget.  At that time there were strong complaints against the increased cost of living, the reduction in bread subsidies and so on, and the suggestion was made by many speakers in opposition to the Budget and in opposition to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Earlier in the year, quite a number of people commented on the luxury cars, and asked why they should not be taxed.  They commented on the number of them in the City of Dublin, and at race meetings and so on, and asked why the owners of them should not be taxed instead of the poor.  Now the Government proposes to put a moderate tax on the luxury cars, as they have been described, and on the whole I do not feel that we can make any serious complaint about it.  The tax on the small car which the ordinary middle-class people use for business or pleasure has been increased by only £1 or 30/-, and that is not very substantial.</P>
      <P>I am in disagreement with many speakers on the Opposition side who said that the impost in this motion on the smaller type of commercial vehicles is not severe.  I think that the impost on all types of commercial vehicles is very severe.  It is even very severe on the small types of van.  I think it is a severe impost.  It is not, as I say, a luxury tax inasmuch as the small commercial van and the small lorry are used, in the main, for business purposes and for the purpose of people earning their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though it may be only a matter of £2, £3 or £4&mdash;I suppose in the case <Col N="123" /> of the small commercial vehicle it only represents an increase of £2&mdash;I think it is a severe impost.

Owners of commercial vehicles and of lorries of all types have got to use the roads generally for their business. This being mainly an agricultural country, they are going to use the rural roads, the county roads and small roads and many of those roads are in a very bad condition.  I would like to have an assurance that, instead of applying this £800,000, or whatever it is that is involved in this motion, to making the main roads faster by removing turns and speeding up traffic on the main roads, this money will be used mainly to make the county roads more usable by those who pay this substantial contribution.</P>

      <P>If we are to support and accept an increase in taxation upon road users, motorists and owners of commercial vehicles, they ought to have an assurance that, having paid this, they will be immune from restrictions, interference and elimination.  I think that is essential to a consideration of this problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton in opening this debate suggested that the whole matter involved in this motion should be put back for reconsideration.  I think that we have got to consider the whole question of road transport in connection with this motion because it does vitally affect every phase of road transport.  If people who own cars and commercial vehicles of any kind are asked to contribute £800,000 per year in additional taxation, I think they are entitled to a very definite assurance that they will be allowed to continue to operate their cars, vans and lorries without interference from any source. I think that is very essential and very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few points&mdash;small points, perhaps&mdash;to which I would like to refer.  In this motion, there is provision for some increase in the taxation on tractors.  The provision is in the main a sort of compromise. Whereas some tractors were taxed at £6 and others at £10, all tractors are now being taxed at £8.  As the majority of tractors come under the £6 tax, this will amount to an increase of £2 upon the majority of tractors.  I think that is also an impost, but I would like to <Col N="125" /> know or to be assured that it is counteracted by a clarification of the position in regard to the use of the tractor.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the motion, did make the point that the purposes for which the tractors may be used would be clarified, but he did not develop the point very much.  I presume that, after the passing of this motion or the Bill which will further implement it, any farmer who pays an £8 tax on his tractor should have the right to use that tractor for any purpose for which he would have used his horse upon the road.  That is to say, he should have the right to convey to his farm any type of produce he requires on the farm or convey to town or market any produce which he would convey by horse and cart if carters were not available.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential that this point should be cleared up because there are district justices who have held that a £6 tax enables a farmer to carry any type of agricultural produce, including live stock, while other district justices have held a contrary opinion.  I think it is unfair to farmers, and Guards who enforce the law, and unfair to everybody that confusion should exist.</P>
    <P>I hope that if and when farmers who own tractors have contributed this tax of £8, they will be absolutely free to use their tractors without any interference with the conveyance of their produce to the town and factory or wherever it has to go.  I hope they can draw whatever requirements they need on the farm, using tractors for the conveyance of their own and their neighbour's live stock.  There has been interference with farmers conveying beet pulp and sugar beet to and from factories. I think such interference should be eliminated.  The farmer should have a right to use his tractor for any or all purposes for which he would use his horses.</P>
    <P>There is another small matter about which I am not quite clear.  There is a reference in this motion to a tax on trailers.  I assume that that tax will be only on trailers used in conjunction with goods vehicles.  A great many farmers find it convenient to use a small trailer in conjunction with their private cars.  If a private car is used to draw a trailer at present there is no <Col N="126" /> extra tax in respect of the trailer.  I hope that position will continue because, after all, you cannot convey very much goods by means of a small trailer, you cannot convey more than the car itself will carry.  It is a very great convenience for a farmer going to the market to have a small trailer attached to a small car and the position should continue as it is at present.  Personally, I am of opinion, although I may be wrong, that that position will continue as it is at present, but I should like to have the matter cleared up.</P>
    <P>Those who use small commercial vehicles for their own business, whether they be farmers or small business people in provincial towns, will bear this increased impost and will accept it.  I have been told by a number of representative business people and farmers that they will accept it without serious complaint if they are assured that it will not be followed by restrictions on the use to which they may apply their commercial vehicles and their lorries.  I think the payment of this increased impost should be a definite assurance that they will be allowed freely to use their vehicles for all purposes for which they require them.</P>
    <P>There is, I know, an agitation to eliminate private enterprise on the roads.  That would be a disaster for the country economically and a disaster for the nation from every point of view. It is something which should be guarded against and I think this motion will have the effect of ensuring that for at least another 25 years&mdash;I think it is 25 years since there was a change in motor taxation&mdash;the users of cars and lorries will be allowed to ply their cars and lorries on the road without check or interference.</P>
    <P>One last matter to which I want to refer is, I think, pertinent to this discussion.  We are applying this increased taxation to the improvement and development of the roads.  It is time for the Minister responsible for local government to take effective steps to ensure that the money granted to local authorities for improvement of the roads is used to the best advantage.  I will not say any more on that point because it is a matter <Col N="127" /> of administration, but I can say that at least 10/- out of every £ voted by local authorities or by the State out of the Road Fund for the maintenance and improvement of the roads is practically wasted.</P>

      <P>We were given some portent of this impost which it is proposed to place on the already overburdened backs of the motor drivers of this country, if it is passed through this House, in the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance. Inadvertently, we were given the number of drivers' licences prematurely in that statement.  It would appear that, even at that time, the motor drivers were very much to the forefront in the mind of the Minister for Finance as people whom he intended to mulct, from whom he intended to extract a few additional shillings to put into the general coffers of his Ministry.  The Minister for Local Government is now deputising for him, and has introduced casually in this House and asked us to pass within a matter of hours a proposal to double the cost of drivers' licences.  The Deputy who has just concluded rather naïvely suggested that this would assist in putting some of the luxury cars off the road.  Will any owner of a luxury car quibble at the payment of an additional 10/-?</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that the number of drivers' licences for 1951 exceeded the number of licences issued for private cars by 126,730.  What effect can this further tax on 126,730 people who do not own private cars have on the elimination of this luxury driving?  It has already been stated by several Deputies that a driver's licence is necessary for any boy seeking a position as a driver.</P>
      <P>One noticeable feature of this discussion is the extreme reluctance of Government Party Deputies to contribute to the debate.  We await with interest the contribution which they have to offer in support of the Government's action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan's speech was intended for publication in <Col N="128" /> a journal in his constituency.  It remains to be seen whether it will be supported by his vote.  Earlier this year we had strong appeals for greater production, and now in motion No. 2 we are asked to deliver another blow at the production effort in this country. We hear a lot about the flight from the land.  To-night we are delivering another blow at the few amenities available in rural Ireland.  Already, even before the impact of this additional impost, hackney drivers have approached us in recent months seeking employment in other spheres.  I wondered how they have carried on in recent times.  I am not aware of the difficulties of taxi drivers in Dublin but no doubt Dublin City Deputies are aware of them.</P>
      <P>Speaking for the drivers in rural areas, I can say that the extension of private motoring has put them in a very bad way.  These men have to pay very much increased prices for all the accessories for their cars.  Furthermore, the glut in the market for second-hand vehicles means a very great depreciation in the value of the hackney cars which are condemned by the Garda as being unfit for further use in that capacity.</P>
      <P>It means that the driver has to suffer that loss in the amount allowed in leaving in that old wreck of a car into a garage.  Then he is further called on to meet the very much increased cost of a new car.  That means that practically every month, quite before this was introduced, these men are being driven with their backs to the wall while their wives and families are mulcted by the already increased cost of living.  Some sections of the community may by agitation put forward well documented proof of the necessity for increased wages to meet the increase in the cost of living but these unfortunate people cannot do so because they are in a highly competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the agricultural community are faced in this with a very severe impost. Every small farmer throughout the country will be hit by this increase.  It is certainly not a luxury for him to possess a small car or to have a small convert to transport his milk to a creamery or to bring him home to carry <Col N="129" /> on his productive work on the land from any visits he may have to make into the town.  Every member of his family may require a licence and now we are asking to-night to double the cost of these licences.</P>
    <P>Tractors, described in the White Paper as tending in many areas to replace the farmer's horse and cart&mdash;as no doubt they are&mdash;will be called upon to bear an additional tax of £2.  It may be pertinent to warn this House that costings are increasing in every sphere of production, the cost of producing milk and butter and of the requirements of life, and here now we are still further increasing that cost. The co-operative creameries in the South of Ireland and the Dairy Disposals Board creameries are now called upon to pay immense amounts in the way of taxation on the lorries that they have for transporting their milk to the chocolate factory or to the creamery centre.  That is work which cannot be done by any other transport body in this country or outside it.</P>
    <P>The distribution of ground limestone cannot be carried out in any other way than the method now employed.  This increased tax on all of those vehicles means a further impost on the cost of production which cannot fail to be reflected in the cost of living.  All those points should be well borne in mind before this House so readily accedes to the casual demand of the Minister for Local Government here on the first day we meet after the recess.</P>
    <P>The transport of beet from the field to the factory must again be carried out by lorry.  The same applies in many other instances, for example, the transport of pigs and cattle from fairs and markets.  I know that in my home town, where we are quite some distance from a railhead, the farmers were forced, at one time, to come to that railway station to line up there in a mile long queue with their horses and carts and to wait their turn in delivering those animals into the trucks at the railway station.  It will be impossible to get them to go back to that system.  It is intended in this resolution to drive those lorries off the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know, Sir, but I have been drawn into this by some interruptions.  It is very important particularly in the new developments in the threshing of grain that grain would be conducted direct from the farmers' yard to the stores and mills throughout the country.  Again this is work which is carried out by private hauliers and work which is being carried out by young men who spent the gratuity they got leaving the Army in purchasing lorries for work such as this.  To-day they are providing the contact between the private turf producer, the man who is producing handwon turf in the mountainous and boggy districts and those men to whom they sell it, who, in turn, deliver it in the towns and cities especially in the South of Ireland.  It is being made impossible for hundreds of those men, many of them married with families, <Col N="131" /> to continue if they are now called upon to pay this additional impost by way of this minor matter of an increase in the cost of the driver's licence and the major problem of the increased amount under Resolution No. 2 which they are being called upon to pay to carry along their vehicles on our roads.</P>
      <P>It would seem as if the body set up by the last Government, the Prices Advisory Body, were quite aware of the extent to which motor owners were already driven when they decided that the increase in insurance premiums which it was intended to plank upon them should be reduced. Consequently we feel that if this new impost was presented to any impartial body they in turn would definitely give it the knock-out because we feel that the present burden is quite enough to place upon the backs of the unfortunate hackney drivers of this country, on the unfortunate lorry owner, on the small farmer who has his little convert to bring his animals to market or to bring his milk to the creamery; that it is quite enough for them and for the creamery concerned bringing their milk long distances to the chocolate factories or to the creameries in the manufacture of butter, to bear the tremendous impost which was planked on them by the Minister for Finance by the increase in petrol this year.  Consequently, we feel that this is a retrograde step, that it is a blow at private enterprise, that it is a damper on increased production which we are told is so vital if the economy in this country is to be improved.</P>

      <P>This whole question of increased taxation under Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2 should be viewed against the background that the entire sum to be raised, which will amount to somewhere near the £1,000,000 mark, is to be put into the Road Fund and used for the repair of our main and second-class roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is every indication that the roads are in many cases in very poor condition, that very large sums of money must be used to bring up these roads to a proper standard.  During the war years, many of our main roads and second class roads were allowed to deteriorate.  It is only by spending comparatively large sums of money as soon as we can that any effort can be made to effect an improvement.  There has, so far, been no suggestion in the speeches we have heard from the Opposition as to how money could or should be raised for this very necessary work.  It is very easy to protest against taxation. Taxation is something which nobody likes and it is very simple to build up a beautiful case against taxation, no matter how small; but we must remember that there is a purpose behind it and if the money is not to be found by the method suggested here, what is the alternative method put up by any of the Opposition Parties for getting it?</P>
      <P>Most of the controversy over the past month or so with regard to this question has had to do with the fear of limitation in the radius of operation of commercial vehicles and in discussing this matter with people I met&mdash;deputations and so on&mdash;I found that the taxation end was not what worried them most.  Their main worry was the fear that a 20 mile radius would be introduced, and I feel, as some other Deputies said, that, when this taxation is enforced, commercial lorries and other vehicles should be allowed to operate as they wish, subject to the conditions of the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having studied the figures in Resolution No. 2, I am glad to note that the percentage of increased taxation in the case of the lighter vehicles is small compared with the percentage proposed in the case of the heavier trucks and vehicles.  That is as it should be, and I think the Minister could have come down even more lightly on vehicles used for the haulage of turf and farm produce.  If any concessions can be given in that respect, they should be given because <Col N="133" /> they are really necessary, and these people should not be asked to contribute even the light percentage which they are now asked to contribute.</P>
    <P>So far as I can gather from the speeches I have heard from the other side, we are all agreed that heavy taxation or a complete embargo is desirable, where the very large lorries are concerned.  Some Deputy said that this high percentage of increase, where lorries over eight and ten tons are concerned, will be passed on to the consumer.  It is well known that large trucks which carry loads ranging from eight to 12 tons, from Dublin to the West, North and South of Ireland earn about £40 on the run, being the difference between their costs and the cost which had to be paid by rail.  In the case of Donegal, it works out about £40 per load, and that profit is not passed on to the consumer.  The prices of the commodities delivered by lorry now are just the same as they were when these deliveries were done by rail transport a few years ago.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that taxi and hackney car owners are not making profits.  The vast number of private cars on the roads has cut down the numbers of their customers and a concession should definitely be made to these people, but, tied up with it, there should be something to prohibit unauthorised taxis on the roads.  One of the things which is dealing a deathblow to the livelihoods of these hackney car and taxi owners is the prevalence of unauthorised vehicles which carry passengers for hire, and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned some time ago that the increases in motor insurance premiums decided on by the insurance companies were being investigated. We hope and believe that, when that investigation has been carried out, we will find a fairly substantial percentage of reduction in motor insurance premiums.  Insurance companies which do motor insurance show fairly substantial profits and pay fairly substantial dividends at the end of the year, and it is hoped that the premiums for both private and commercial vehicles will be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> One very good point made by Deputy Cogan&mdash;I do not propose to follow it up&mdash;was that money spent by the Department of Local Government, and by the county councils especially, on the roads is not in all cases spent to the best advantage.  I am inclined to think that a good deal of the money allocated is eaten up in transport by the county councils and the employment of very many officials.</P>

      <P>At this stage in the life of Dáil Éireann, it appears to me that the Minister might be perfectly right in looking for a closure motion, because no matter how much or how long any of us speak, the Minister and his Party, with those who support him, are determined to put these proposals into operation.  Without meaning any disrespect, I want to open my remarks in this strain.  I think it might be appropriate at the beginning of a session, and peculiarly appropriate in view of the appeal made by the President of this State some short time ago for greater co-operation between the Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody in Dáil Éireann will accuse me of having prejudices on any particular question. It is not just an act when I say that these proposals are contentious.  That is clearly demonstrated by the speeches of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Cowan. <Col N="135" /> While the Government may have their minds made up with regard to the raising of a certain amount of money which, I believe, is needed for the better maintenance of roads, the Minister should not have his mind made up on the details.  Let us say for the sake of argument that there is a sum of over £800,000 needed for the upkeep of the roads.  Everyone would agree that more money should be spent on the roads but the discussion should be on the question as to whether or not the methods proposed by the Minister are the right methods and whether or not he is causing hardships on a certain section or sections of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Cogan made a fair speech.  I give him credit for that and will not attribute to him any motive other than that he wanted to make a fair comment.  He disagreed with about five out of the six or seven proposals which the Minister has put before the Dáil to-day and which we have read in the White Paper that was circulated some months ago.  He thought it was unfair that the hackney owner, the tractor owner and certain lorry owners should have to pay more.  I think he took exception to the fact that the cost of driving licences was to be increased. He thought possibly that was a bit excessive and a bit sudden.  Deputy Cowan went more or less on the same lines.  He, of course, showed his determination to support these proposals hook, line and sinker.</P>
    <P>I think these gentlemen are fairly representative of the feelings of the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, especially in respect of the proposal that affects hackney owners and taximen.  The amount that it is proposed to raise by increasing the motor tax in respect of hackneys and taxicars is £56,000&mdash;a comparatively small amount of the total figure of £830,000. Could not the Minister take the Dáil into his confidence with a view to seeing whether or not it is necessary to raise that £56,000 or, if it is necessary, by what other method it could be raised?</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the proposals come as a shock.  I do not think they are excessive in some respects but, <Col N="136" /> generally, they are a shock to people who have been already shocked by what has been described by the two sides of the House as a very harsh Budget.  The Government said that it was necessary.  We do not think it was necessary.  Everybody agrees that it was a very harsh Budget.  It must be remembered that these proposals are a Supplementary Budget affecting people who drive vehicles of one kind or another.  These people are taxpayers and ratepayers.  They are ratepayers who have had to bear extra burdens in the last few years and taxpayers who have to bear the burdens of the last Budget.  They are people who have had to pay more for tea, bread, sugar, beer, cigarettes, tobacco and all the other things that were the subject of increased taxation in the last Budget.  It is piling on the agony to ask them to bear further burdens by way of increased motor tax and the increased cost of driving licences.</P>
    <P>The last speaker on the Fianna Fáil side of the House said that Opposition speakers had protested against this tax but had not suggested where the £830,000 for the upkeep of the roads should be found.  I suggest, as I suggested three or four times in the debate on the Budget, that inasmuch as the Minister made a present of £1,300,000 to the Imperial Tobacco Company, that £1,300,000 or part of it could have been devoted to the roads. Deputy Seán Collins suggested that the £140,000 that was given by way of remission in the dance tax would have gone some way to assist county councils in their efforts to maintain and improve the roads.</P>
    <P>My main appeal is in respect of hackney owners.  Those of us who have campaigned in general elections know hackney drivers intimately.  Nobody can describe them as princes or wealthy men.  We must agree that they serve a very useful purpose.  Possibly it is not the intention of the Minister to drive these people from the roads in an effort to help Córas Iompair Éireann, but in some cases they will be driven off the roads.  There is no doubt about that.  There has been a protest by the hackney owners and drivers in my constituency to the Minister <Col N="137" /> for Local Government in a small effort to get him to change his mind and to change his proposals, especially those that affect their livelihood.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Keyes and other speakers, one might as well tax the hammer, the chisel and the saw of the carpenter or any of the implements that any tradesman uses as tax the motor car which is the medium of livelihood for hackney owners.  These people should not be harmed to the extent to which these proposals will harm them.  They perform many useful services that cannot and that never will be provided by Córas Iompair Éireann.  They are needed for weddings, funerals, football matches in places not served by Córas Iompair Éireann.  They are a necessity to the community.  Owing to the big increase in the number of cars in the country the livelihood of hackney owners has become even more precarious than it was.  Often the hackney in provincial towns and rural areas might not get a run in a day.</P>
    <P>Once or perhaps twice a week they might get a run as far as one of the principal cities&mdash;Cork, Dublin or Galway&mdash;but, by and large, I do not think any of us could say that they have a lucrative type of employment.  I do not know whether or not the Minister would agree with me in this, but I am of opinion that the Irish motorist is not capable of bearing the heavy burden that he is being expected to bear at the present time, whether he be a private motorist, a hackney car owner or, in the majority of cases, a lorry owner.  If we relate the big mileage of roads that need to be maintained in this country to the number of motorists, I feel all of us will agree that excess demands are being made on the motorist.  Every penny that is collected by way of road tax and by way of driving licence is allocated by the Minister for Local Government to the county councils for the building, the general reconstruction, the maintenance and the upkeep of the roads. The method is different in other countries.  It is different in Britain, where that particular type of contribution is far in excess of what is needed for the maintenance, general upkeep, <Col N="138" /> reconstruction and building of roads.</P>
    <P>We have a comparatively small population of motorists.  I feel that the Government ought to consider the idea of not making grants out of the Road Fund to county councils for roads.  What the Minister receives for the Road Fund by way of tax or from the cost of driving licences should be put into the general Exchequer and the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government could then decide what amount of money should be donated for the upkeep, the reconstruction and the building of roads.  I feel it is not fair to lay down that the county councils will get merely what is collected through the Road Fund.  It merely amounts to this: that if there are X number of motorists in the country, they, having regard to the motor car tax, will get a comparable sum of money from the Road Fund, if there are Y motorists they will get a comparable sum, and so on.  A certain amount of work needs to be done on the roads, and the Road Fund should not determine that, but the Government, in their general taxation policy, should determine it.</P>
    <P>I make this suggestion to the Minister inasmuch as he has a proposal now before the House to increase the cost of driving licences to £1.  A big proportion of the motoring population in this country motor for six months of the year only&mdash;people who cannot afford to tax a car for the whole year. I am referring to the men and women with small families who use motor cars merely for the summer period.  I suggest to the Minister that he should facilitate any people who want to take out a driving licence merely for six months and charge them 10/- only.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter which has been a bone of contention which I feel the Minister might well consider. There are unfortunate people like myself who can only afford to pay the tax on a motor car quarterly. However, we have got to pay a quarter of the tax every quarter, plus 20 per cent.  That is not fair.  People tax their cars every quarter because they cannot afford to pay, all at once, the tax for the whole year, be it £22, £24 or £30.  At the present time the tax on my car is £24 per annum.  However, <Col N="139" /> due to the fact that I pay the tax quarterly, it amounts to £28 16s. for the whole year.  I feel that that is very unfair and that the quarterly tax should only amount to a quarter of the yearly tax.  If the Minister could not agree to that arrangement, I think he should fix the quarterly tax at a sum amounting to a quarter of the tax for the whole year, plus 10 per cent. I would appeal to him to consider these two suggestions, because they are ones which would meet some of the requirements of the poorer type of motorists and would be some sort of concession.</P>
    <P>With all respect to every Party in the House and with all respect to the revered gentlemen who made a plea some weeks ago for co-operation, I would ask the Minister to take the House into his confidence so that we can devise between us some method whereby we can improve the roads without burdening unfortunate people who are overburdened at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Public Authorities Protection Act first saw the light 50 years ago in the House of Lords on March 3rd, 1892.  The purpose of the Bill now before Dáil Éireann is to repeal that Act <i>in toto.</i> On March 3rd, 1892, Lord Halsbury, who was the Lord Chancellor in Lord Salisbury's last administration, and probably one of the most incompetent Chancellors who ever sat upon the Woolsack, introduced a Bill the Long Title of which was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to Generalise and Amend certain Statutory Provisions for the Protection of Persons acting in the execution of statutory and other public duties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The story of that enactment in Parliament must be one of the strangest that has ever disgraced a Legislature, and the record of injustice wrought under the provisions of this statute exemplified the axiom that a tree can be judged by its fruits.</P>
      <P>Lord Halsbury presented the original Bill to the House of Lords with a memorandum of great length which manifestly neither he nor anybody else had ever read because by the time the final version of the Bill which he had produced reached the Statute Book it actually enacted what it was designed to repeal&mdash;I refer to the clause relating to penal costs&mdash;and, though it was described as applying to the United Kingdom, it subsequently transpired that its application in Ireland was questionable and in Scotland impossible.</P>
      <P>The story of its progress under the guidance of Lord Halsbury in the House of Lords and the Attorney-General, Sir Richard Webster, in the House of Commons briefly is as follows: Lord Halsbury certified to the House of Lords that the Bill was substantially a statute law revision Bill and that it did no more than substitute uniform procedure for irrationally varied procedure in approximately 100 British Acts of Parliament, and on this assurance the House of Lords gave the Bill a Second Reading and sent it to a Committee of the whole House, from which it was reported without amendment and recommitted to the Standing Committee.  At this stage, Lord Halsbury had second thoughts and inserted the famous, or infamous, section entitling a public authority who was a successful defendant in proceedings governed by the Act to recover from the plaintiff solicitor and client costs.</P>
      <P>Lord Dudley secured the adoption of an amendment in the Standing Committee, which on further reflection their lordships decided to delete on the Report Stage, on the understanding that Lord Halsbury would introduce words to effect the object which the Lord of Dudley had in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant to mention here that one of the original purposes of the Bill as introduced was to repeal all special provisions in Public General Acts as to costs.  The consequence of Lord Halsbury's amendment was not only to re-enact a special provision in regard to costs, but to extend this provision to all public authorities, and the consequences of this omnibus procedure have drawn from the judiciary <Col N="153" /> comments during the last 50 years which have to be read to be believed. Lord Salvesen, in the case of Eadie v. Glasgow Corporation, reported in 1916 in the Sessions Cases, which are Scottish Reports, Volume 163, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with your lordships reluctantly, because as I have taken occasion to say whenever this Act has come under my notice, I think it creates a monstrous injustice that a wealthy corporation should be entitled to hold <i>in terrorem</i> over any person who litigates with them the risk that he may be subjected not merely to expenses as between party and party, but to whatever expenses the corporation may choose to incur as between agent and client.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill, as amended, was sent to the House of Commons on June 20th, 1892, and strange as it may seem, its text as submitted to the House of Commons was curiously different from the text which had left the House of Lords. Certain new words had been inserted and others had been left out.  The number of English Acts repealed had grown from 101 to 103, and the Bill had the unique feature in Clause 1 of having two separate sub-clauses described as (d).</P>
    <P>Mr. Morton M.P. queried the Bill on the ground that he suspected anything that originated in the House of Lords, though this was regarded by the Speaker as savouring of impropriety, and Sir Walter Webster, the Attorney-General, assured the House that &ldquo;the Bill is simply a Consolidation Bill to simplify the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, when the Committee Stage was reached on the 21st June, Mr. Fowler, M.P. expressed anxiety, and the Attorney-General reiterated his assurances but said that if the Rt. Hon. gentleman wished to have time to look into it he would not press the Bill that night.  But before the matter could be brought to the attention of the House of Commons again, Lord Salisbury had resigned, a general election had taken place, and on August 18, 1892, Mr. Gladstone became Prime Minister and appointed Lord Hershell to the Woolsack.</P>
    <P>Lord Hershell, it may be said in parenthesis, was a relatively competent <Col N="154" /> Lord Chancellor, but he followed in the unfortunate footsteps of his grossly incompetent predecessor.  On February 6th, 1893, Lord Hershell introduced a new Bill which is the Public Authorities Protection Act as we now know it.  He determined to be as expeditious and as reassuring as his incompetent predecessor, Lord Halsbury, had been, and, in addition to assuring the House that it was substantially a consolidating measure, he added that it had passed both Houses, during the last Parliament.  That statement was quite untrue, but, doubtless, it was due to an oversight on the part of Lord Hershell.</P>
    <P>The proceedings then seem to have grown even more confused, because the Journal of the House of Lords records the insertion of certain amendments by Lord Ashbourne and by the Lord Chancellor himself, but goes on to say that further amendments were made&mdash; and to this day no one seems to know what they were or who made them. That is the interesting part of it.  There is no record of what these amendments were and there is no record of who moved them or how they were made, beyond the insertion of the note that other amendments were made.</P>
    <P>However, when the Bill turned up at the House of Commons on March 21st, someone had discovered that the new Bill had inherited from its predecessor the strange characteristic of having its two sub-clauses lettered (d) and this blemish had been removed by their lordships.</P>
    <P>Surprisingly, the number of statutes had increased, no one knows how, from 103 to 108.  It was thought that Lord Ashbourne had a hand in it, but apparently the Scottish peers were on holiday, for no trace of their hand could be discerned upon the Bill.</P>
    <P>On September 11th, Mr. Marjoribanks, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, presented the Bill to the House of Commons, and &ldquo;hoped there would be no objection to it, as it was a useful and necessary codification of laws existing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. T.W. Russell, M.P., who afterwards presided over the Department of Agriculture in Ireland, asked if this were not a new law.  Mr. Marjoribanks said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Mr. T.H. Bolton, M.P., <Col N="155" /> asked if it was entirely codification. Mr. Marjoribanks replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Mr. Bolton was not so easily to be put down and is on record as saying &ldquo;Entirely?&rdquo; in an interrogative fashion, to which Mr. Marjoribanks cheerfully replied &ldquo;Entirely&rdquo; in an affirmative tone.  Whereupon the Bill was read a Second Time.</P>
    <P>When the Bill came up in Committee, it had a sponsor of no less a person than Sir William Harcourt, and he said that he understood it was&mdash;but Hansard recalls that nobody seemed to know quite what he said, but it was thought he said&mdash;it was a Bill to consolidate certain Acts and secure uniformity. Two amendments were inserted, one exempting any proceedings by any Department of the Government against any local authority or officer of local authority, the other declaring that the Act would not apply to Scotland&mdash;the Scottish members of Parliament having apparently been more diligent than the Scottish peers had been.  This latter amendment declaring that it would not apply to Scotland was so hastily drafted that its results have been unforeseen and unforeseeable, and until the Act was later amended in Great Britain it continued to cause confusion and even, perhaps, miscarriage of justice in the Scottish courts.</P>
    <P>The present position is that if any citizen brings an action against a public authority for damages, his or her action fails unless it has been started within six months of the act which caused the damage; and if the action fails, the unsuccessful plaintiff has to pay solicitor and client instead of party and party costs.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A public authority&rdquo; may mean a great many things.  It may mean a county council, it may mean a dispensary doctor, it may mean a sheriff's bailiff, a Government Department or a host of other parties.  A danger grows in our time, with the development of a number of quasi-Government companies, that judicial decision may hereafter add to the category of &ldquo;persons&rdquo; who may properly be described as public authorities a wholly unforeseen regimet of &ldquo;persons&rdquo; who would <Col N="156" /> enjoy the benefit of this preposterous Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Remember that any public body, so called, that enjoys the benefit of this Act enjoys the privileged position of a public authority against every private citizen.  What is the nature of that privilege enjoyed by the public authority?  If the public authority is acting in the discharge of a public duty, that public duty is owed to the plaintiff in common with the rest of the public, but the Public Authorities Protection Act applies and the public authority enjoys its protection as against the private citizen.  So that, not only is the public authority immune from proceedings unless they have been started within six months of the act complained of, but also, if for any reason it appears that the plaintiff cannot succeed in his action, he may be required to pay the successful defendant public authority exceptionally heavy costs.</P>
    <P>Over the years a great many judicial decisions have been given in cases where the Public Authorities Protection Act was pleaded by the defendant, and it would appear from the cumulative effect of these decisions that it is not by any means impossible now that a citizen might lose his right to take action for damages done to him by the act of a public authority before the citizen himself knew that a right of action existed, and this possibility was dwelt upon by Lord Justice Atkin in the case of Huyton Gas Company v. Liverpool Corporation in 1926. when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If an act is done which subsequently causes damage, it appears to me that &lsquo;the act complained of&rsquo; in an action is the act, not the damage; and that the damage is the legal justification for complaining of the act.  This form of words leads to the possibility that a person may lose his right of action before ever he has acquired it, as where damage is the gist of the action and only occurs more than six months from the date of the act complained of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Cases have been known where aggrieved citizens have negotiated <Col N="157" /> with a public authority and the negotiations continued for more than six months and then broke down, whereupon the aggrieved citizen discovered that he was debarred from suing the local authority under the provisions of the Public Authorities Protection Act, although negotiations had been begun well within the six months referred to in the Act.</P>
    <P>This conclusion was established in Carey's case, where Lord Halsbury delivered the judgment, and appears to be the only judge who ever expressed the opinion from the Bench that &ldquo;the language of section 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act is reasonably plain and it is manifest that &lsquo;continuance of injury or damage&rsquo; means the continuance of the act which caused the damage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is not surprising, as Lord Halsbury was himself the original author of the Act, the ambiguity and unsatisfactory character of which has been the subject of comment ever since it was first introduced in the House of Lords 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>As late as 1926, Lord Justice Scrutton commented in Huyton &amp; Robey Gas Company v. Liverpool Corporation (1926): &ldquo;If time runs from the act this leads to the startling result that you may lose a cause of action before you have got it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provision as to punitive costs has been commented upon eloquently by Lord Salvesen in Eadie v. Glasgow Corporation (1916), when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have taken occasion to say whenever this Act has come under my notice, I think it creates a monstrous injustice&mdash;that a wealthy corporation should be entitled to hold <i>in terrorem</i> over any person who litigates with them the risk that he may be subjected not merely to expenses as between party and party, but to whatever expenses the corporation may choose to incur as between agent and client, and that, I suppose, irrespective of the fact that the corporation has the services of the town clerk, who undertakes this work for a salary, with the result that the award of expenses goes, not to pay for the litigation, but to reduce the other expenses of <Col N="158" /> the corporation by being credited to the general fee fund.  I have never been able to understand the policy of the statute.  The ordinary expenses of litigation are quite sufficient to deter responsible people from engaging in reckless litigation against a wealthy corporation, and actions by persons who are of no substance will not be diminished in number by the risk of the litigants being subjected to expenses between agent and client, because they litigate with an absolute sense of freedom from responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am submitting to Oireachtas Éireann that this Act should be repealed, and that a new situation should be created in which all public authorities will stand in respect of their torts <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of the community in exactly the same position as an ordinary citizen, enjoying no greater nor lesser privilege than anybody else.  It will be for public authorities themselves to make the case hereafter on the merits, if they wish the Legislature to confer upon them a privileged position before the law which nobody else enjoys.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing in any free community that there should be an independent judiciary, at whose bar of justice, all persons, great and small. may meet on a basis of equality to have their just claim enforced and their rights protected.  It is the purpose of the Bill which I now submit to Oireachtas Éireann to establish this principle in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House against a particular danger.  I trust the Minister will not think me guilty of any discourtesy because I inquired of the Chief Government Whip what the Government's attitude would be.  The Minister was good enough to let me know in broad outline what his view of the situation was.  It did not entirely deviate from my point of view nor did it entirely coincide with the proposals that I was submitting to the House, but I do want to suggest to the Minister and to the House that we would be quite mistaken if we allowed our judgment to be unduly influenced by the measures adopted in the British House of Commons to remedy the <Col N="159" /> situation created by the Public Authorities Protection Act 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>About 12 years ago or more legislation was introduced into the British House of Commons to amend the original Act.  Under the amendment I think the public authority in England now has either a year or two years in which its liability continues, but I am going to submit to the House that that amendment by the British Legislature was the fruit of an uneasy compromise devised to placate a very powerful vested interest in Great Britain which was acrimoniously represented on the floor of the House of Commons, which is the Municipal Bodies' Protection Association representative of all corporations and town councils and similar bodies in England, Scotland and Wales who were, not unnaturally, most anxious to preserve this unreasonable privileged position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>A long and acrimonious debate took place and members of Parliament on every side of the House pressed on the Attorney-General that he should accept amendments designed to repeal the Public Authorities Protection Act altogether. Under pressure from the municipal authorities in England he found himself unable to go that far, although, from close perusal of the debate, I could find no point of principle taken by the Government of the day in defence of the old Public Authorities Act of 1892.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that the original Act of 1892 or 1893, having been passed on the representations that it was a mere codifying Act, nobody appeared for the first three or four years, to be aware of the extraordinary privilege that it conferred on corporations and local authorities until a malignant town clerk in Dundee suddenly adverted to the persecution that he could operate on his neighbours by the use of this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>There are those who suggest that he got at Lord Halsbury through Lord Dunedin, who was a &ldquo;butty&rdquo; of his, and that he fooled Lord Halsbury and the rest and, having lain &ldquo;doggo&rdquo; for two or three years after the Act of <Col N="160" /> Parliament was passed, he proceeded to use it and it was only then that municipalities in Great Britain and in Ireland woke up to the fact that they had had conferred upon them by this statute a privilege which they had never heretofore enjoyed and the nature of which Parliament never understood.  Since then it has been invoked more and more and I think there is a Scotch case now in existence where an <i>obiter dictum</i> from the Bench suggests that, even where the officers of the local authority feel that equity demands that this defence should not be raised, they have a duty to raise it and that they must plead it whether they think it is equitable to do so or not.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that a resourceful town clerk of Dundee used to engage litigants in benevolent negotiations and keep them negotiating for six months, and then laugh heartily at them when the proceedings were instituted.  If Deputies are interested in the details of that story, I must refer them to the speech of Mr. McQuisten, M.P., in the British House of Commons in 1938, when the amending legislation was being enacted.  It is a pretty story. He says he knew the town clerk of Dundee when he was a very small boy, and that he was even an office boy to the town clerk.  &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  If Mr. McQuisten's story be true, we will not be surprised at the nature of the enactment.  Certainly a study of the procedure by which the Bill was railroaded through the British House of Commons will, I think, make it manifest to everybody that nobody in the House of Lords or the House of Commons knew what the Bill was about.  I think it was passed on false pretences, and that it was brought in originally to abolish the whole system of punitive costs, and wound up by making what had never been law before, the system of punitive costs applicable to all actions of tort.</P>
    <P>I can see that it will be difficult for Deputies to believe that the story of this enactment is as I described it.  I think there is available to anyone who wishes to check it abundant evidence to prove that the story I have recited <Col N="161" /> is true.  The Act is disreputable in its history.  Its enactment was clearly an error of judgment and its effects were never intended by the Legislature which enacted it.  It has created a vested interest that should never have been created.  All I am asking Oireachtas Éireann to do is to put our local authorities and public bodies in exactly the same position as any individual citizen or any limited liability company or any other persons known to the law; to leave local authorities subject to the same Statutes of Limitation as apply to the rest, and from that point of departure that all will be equal before the law</P>
    <P>If public authorities have a case to make&mdash;and I do not think they have&mdash; for a special Statute of Limitation restricting citizens' right of action against them, let them make it. Oireachtas Éireann can consider the case they make on its merits.  But, until public authorities successfully do that, I suggest to the House that Oireachtas Éireann should do no more than this: put public authorities in the same position before the law as any other person in Ireland, put no penalty on them, but do not confirm any improper privilege which they at present enjoy.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to bear in mind that the principal sufferers under the existing statute are people who have been in the employment of public authorities and have suffered an injury, the full consequences of which do not manifest themselves for some months after the injury has been done, or somebody whose property has been injured and the consequences of the Act which did the injury have not manifested themselves for eight or nine months after the act causing the injury was done when such persons have no right of action against the public authority at all.</P>
    <P>That this may be made abundantly clear, let me conclude with two types of cases which constitute a very grave injustice and which this Bill is designed to put an end to.  A man works for a public authority and sustains an injury.  Perhaps he hits his knee or strikes his elbow.  No immediate evil consequences emerge, but nine or ten months later arthritis develops which <Col N="162" /> good medical opinion attributes to the injury he has received.  He sues the authority, and even if it transpires that the damage from which he is then suffering, the cripplement which he is then suffering, is attributable to a blow received from a vehicle managed by the local authority seven or eight or nine months before, he finds that he has no right of action against anybody and that he is obliged to suffer.</P>
    <P>The other type of case is the case of a person whose property, say, adjoins a public road and as the result of some carelessness on the part of a local authority damage is done to the foundations of his house on the 1st March. The damage done to the foundations of his house does not extend to the fabric of the house, say, until September or October following.  When it manifests itself in the fabric of the house, a contractor is called in and tells the householder that his house is in a more serious condition than was thought at first.  He traces the crack in the wall or whatever it may be to its source and discovers it to be in the foundations and says, &ldquo;This has been done as a result of a very heavy vehicle which was too heavy for the roads passing or re-passing unduly frequently adjoining your premises.&rdquo;  Then it transpires that the local authority had heavy vehicles in that area and used the road in the vicinity of the house to excess or in some circumstances so used the adjoining road as to shake the foundations of the house.  Although that man's house falls down, even though it is admittedly due to the injury done to the foundations of the house nine months before by the local authority, the local authority is obliged to plead the Public Authorities Protection Act.  The fact that the man brought the action the moment he perceived the damage is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the action was instituted more than six months after the act of the local authority which ultimately resulted in the damage complained of, and that non-suits him. He has no remedy against anybody.</P>
    <P>I exhort Oireachtas Éireann to set an example to legislatures everywhere and, where it is possible to undo injustice to the humblest of its citizens, expeditiously and effectively, we should <Col N="163" /> not be restrained by red tape or bureaucracy, or undue caution from remedying injustice no matter how humble its victim may be.  To a labouring man or to the tenant of the humblest cottage in this country the loss of his health to one or of his home to another is as great a tragedy as the collapse of a palace or the decline of the strongest and healthiest amongst us.  We ought not to stand by paralysed by the venerable character of a fraudulent statute under which that situation has been created which debars us from action.  We have the power and I am suggesting to this House we have the duty to put right what is now wrong, and in doing that we do not in the least diminish our ability to add to our Statute Book any statute that it appears to us proper to put down, giving to local authorities any special position we think is equitable and just to give them if and when they make the case that the public weal demands that they should be so privileged.  All I am asking is that public authorities be put in the same position as every other citizen under the law and that nobody, public or private, shall be accorded a position of privilege unless and until he has made a case before this Oireachtas that it is in the interest of public weal that he should have privileges that his neighbours do not enjoy.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has had any practice in dealing in any capacity with this Act will feel that some amendment, at any rate, is necessary.  I must confess that I am to this extent in agreement with Deputy Dillon.  I have always found it very hard to see what was sufficient justification for the enactment as it stands in the Statute Book.  Anybody who has had any dealings with the matter in court&mdash;and particularly solicitors who are the people really concerned with this Act in the first instance very often as it is an inevitable problem for them if there is any question of action involving a public <Col N="164" /> authority at all&mdash;will realise that the Act as it stands is both dangerous and has in fact worked a number of injustices.  The question is not so much whether it should be amended. I think we all agree on that.  The question is whether it should be obliterated or whether there is any degree of protection needed for a public authority in this matter at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has gone into some detail about the Act and he stressed the question of costs which is important enough.  However, I think that the reason why the matter crops up frequently, where people are most confronted with it, is in regard to the first part of the enactment, the time limit.  This is the matter which really causes trouble and although I am going to repeat some of what Deputy Dillon said I am doing it more from the point of view of trying to make a nett summary of this point rather than trying to reiterate what he said.  The point is this.  Is there justification for an enactment which specifies that a public authority must be sued for its act of neglect or default within six months of that act of neglect or default, and if it is not sued within that period, is it right that the public authority should be completely immune from action?  Under the interpretation of that Act as I understand it you must sue within six months of the ceasing of that act of neglect or default whether that is simply a single act of neglect or default or whether it is a continuing process.  The public authority must be sued within that period, and I think that the Leader of the Opposition was one of the leading counsel in the case that decided that here in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it did but that is, so to speak, the guts of it.  Is that a fair position to have?  Actually as I recall the case it was a case where a county council were repairing a road; a steamroller caused some change in the ground surrounding a house and damaged the foundation or the ground upon which the house was lying.  The damage did not become apparent for <Col N="165" /> a matter of some years afterwards but the actual act which occasioned that damage had ceased long before the damage became apparent.  The first time the plaitiff had any idea that he had anything to sue about at all he was too late within the terms of the Act to succeed.  That is as I understand the case in a very broad way. Is that a fair type of situation to have? Is there any justification for it? Frankly I think there is not.  I have known a case where that same section has been the cause of actions never being brought, people consulting a solicitor too late and on taking advice, finding they had wakened up to their cause of action too late and that in fact they could not even take the initial steps.  In that way many actions which should have been laid against the public authority have, in fact, not been brought and the person injured has been left without redress.  I think many practitioners on both sides of the profession have had that experience and for the residue all we have to judge by after that are the tested cases.  But the point I would like to interject at this stage is that such cases as the Carroll case which I referred to, and were reported upon by no means represent the totality of the injustices that have resulted from this Act.  In other words, it is not an answer&mdash;I do not anticipate this answer but it is no harm that I should make the point&mdash;to say you can go through the report and turn up so many instances and that it has only worked injustice in a few cases.  I would estimate that it has worked injustice in a greater number of unheard cases that never even got to the court than it has in the cases which reached court, because the cases which reached court were only the cases where the advocates involved were able to put up a case that they could have some reasonable chance of fighting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Carroll case there was a very excellent argument put up and acknowledged as such in the Supreme Court by the Chief Justice.  Nevertheless, the Chief Justice and the court found itself constrained to adhere to the view of the previous case&mdash;I think it was Carey's case to which Deputy Dillon has referred&mdash;and that was that.  The <Col N="166" /> case failed.  If there is that background, it certainly is a question for examination&mdash; even the one simple and straightforward case, and it is only one case, that can arise under it of a county council doing something on a road.  No damage is apparent to me or my property for some time, but, after six months have elapsed, it becomes apparent to me that I have suffered and am suffering damage. After the six months, I am debarred from action and have to take it, whereas, against a private individual, I would be in a position to have my remedy and to get justice.  Is there a case for that?  Frankly, I have always found it very hard to say that there is. I can see certain administrative reasons advanced, and I can see the argument put up that a public authority wants to know where it is.  In the case of a county council, the rates have to be struck, notice given, and so forth.  I have always felt, however, that the answer to that argument was that the county council will go on from year to year, and it is not a matter of such paramount importance what year the charge is levied, especially when it is weighed against the question whether a plaintiff is to have redress at all or not.</P>
    <P>The other points in the Bill are of some importance, I suppose, but I think the kernel lies in this question of the six months' period&mdash;the question whether there are to be party and party costs or solicitor and client costs is, to my mind, incidental.  Personally, I would probably subscribe to the view that party and party costs would probably be more correct, but the fundamental matter is the six months' limit.  I have yet to be convinced that there is a case at all for it, but, suppose there is a case for some sort of time limit or projection&mdash;suppose we say there is an administrative reason, that there is a particular risk to a public authority that a public authority or public body is more vulnerable in litigation, just because it is impersonal, than the private individual.  We have all heard that kind of argument advanced.  Suppose we say that there are arguments with regard to the provision of evidence, difficulties in regard <Col N="167" /> to proof and so on.  These may constitute a case for some protective legislation, but they certainly do not constitute a case for this rigid period of six months.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister's attitude is that he is sympathetic but is not prepared to repeal the Act as such, but to consider it from the point of view of drastic amendment.  If that is so, I wonder what can we consider. There are, for instance, the provisions in the Workmen's Compensation Acts. There, there are two provisions in regard to time&mdash;the time for commencing an action and, I think, the time for making it known, although I have forgotten the exact details.  Both of these provisions differ from the provision here in that there is provision for reasonable cause for not taking an action, an escape clause which enables the court to entertain an action if reasonable cause or something to that effect is found.  I think, too, that something similar will be found in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which has been the subject of some rather severe interpretation.</P>
    <P>There may be alternatives, but I wonder if, in the long-run, they are good alternatives.  Each of these provisions&mdash;perhaps more so than this provision&mdash;has been the cause of all sorts of interpretations as to what is and what is not reasonable cause for delay.  Because of the flexibility of the enactment, more cases get to court and there is much more on the record than there is under this Act.  The net result still is that you have a number of sometimes conflicting decisions with a state of uncertainty for the litigant, a state of uncertainty which, in practice, will frequently involve him in additional expense because it means additional research and advice.  I have always felt, speaking personally, in regard to the Workmen's Compensation Acts, anyway, that, in practice, you were nearly in this position, that either you had to interpret it more or less rigorously, as to some extent was done in regard to the Landlord and Tenant Act, or it had to be watered down so much that the provision did not mean an awful lot at all, and might as well not be there for all the good it did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> I mention these things here because the net problem which will arise, if we agree that this provision, as such, must be so radically modified as, in effect, to go, but that there would be some need for protection for local authorities, is that we then have to weigh up what kind of practical protection can we give and, in the long-run, will that practical protection be fair to all parties, and, if it is, will it be worth while putting in at all.  These are the difficulties that arise and naturally, having no proposals before us as to what the alternative would be, it is not possible to go any further.  This much, I think, we can say, that it is time this matter was considered and this provision, as it stands, radically altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With less information in a sense than Deputy Dillon has on this matter, I understand the position to be that Deputy Dillon's proposals are proposals for repeal.  The Minister's attitude is that he is in agreement on the fundamental point in regard to the section, that it will be necessary radically to amend it, but he wants to look into it from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It has no greater force and effect than a repeal, in a sense.  I can see that there may be other limitations in the background. There may be all sorts of things in the background to which I have not adverted&mdash;other Acts and so forth&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to special limitations, but addressing myself specifically to the Public Authorities Protection Act, <Col N="169" /> 1893, on which the Deputy based his whole case, the Bill is just the equivalent of a simple repeal.  Leaving out what I might call special common law development in regard to corporations, and there has been some, and leaving out other enactments in the same sense, you have the position wherein, at the passing of this Bill in 1893, a corporation was in the same position as an individual.  The Bill conferred privileges.  Its repeal would remove these privileges and to that extent put the corporation back in the position contemplated by Section 1.  It is in that very simplified sense I am now considering it.</P>
    <P>The form of the Deputy's first section in this Bill raises yet another important matter for examination.  I do not intend to go into the particular matter at the moment, but I would suggest that this is not the best way in which to achieve the Deputy's object.  Let us examine the specific pre-1893 position of, first of all, a public body. If we were to examine thoroughly that position now we might find ourselves unduly complicated in our examination. As far as the main issue is concerned, it seems to me that the Deputy's main object is a simple repeal.  It may be necessary&mdash;I say &ldquo;may be&rdquo;, because I have never been able to see any very cogent arguments as to why it should be necessary&mdash;to have some protection for public bodies either by way of the time limit I have already mentioned in reference to other Acts or in some other way.</P>

There may be reasons and I think the best approach now, having got the measure of agreement that we have because all Deputies, irrespective of whether or not they are lawyers, appreciate the point involved, would be to have this question examined objectively by the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the Minister finds as a result of that examination that there is no reason for any particular protection a simple repeal can be dealt with and the matter can be finalised thereafter. To say the least of it, I think it is premature to introduce the Bill in the form in which it has been introduced to-night.</P>

      <P>Should it be necessary to make provisions for some protection in lieu of the protection that exists at present I think it would be better to do the job as a whole and not do it piecemeal.  I have not examined all the implications of Section 1 but the naïve&mdash;I do not use that word in any derogatory sense&mdash;phraseology of the section suggests to me that there is in local government a body of legislation in relation to common liability which should be examined before we can accept Section 1.  I doubt if it <Col N="171" /> would be safe for us to pass the section as it stands without having the position formally examined by somebody such as the Minister and his Department or a Committee of this House.  There is agreement in principle but I think we ought to see the other side of the picture and if there is need for compensatory protection for a public authority I think we should at least debate that before we proceed to pass the Bill even in the preliminary stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the proposals in this Bill introduced by Deputy Dillon.  The principal proposal is to repeal the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, and to enact that, so far as public authorities are concerned, they will be subject to and have the same rights as private individuals in their actions against private individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a body of law dealing with the limitation of actions by private individuals against private individuals or corporations which do not come within the scope of the Act of 1893.  Most of that body can be found in the Common Law (Procedure) Act. That is not similar to the Statute of <Col N="172" /> Limitations in England.  As far as the laws are concerned in relation to this matter they do require examination, particularly from the point of view of deciding whether or not they are appropriate to modern conditions.  I had intended that this particular Bill would be introduced by the Government of which I was at one time the head.  I had also intended that other matters, such as the Statute of Limitations, Lord Campbell's Act and some others, should be examined and the law modernised.</P>
    <P>I think this particular Act with which we are dealing now is in need of urgent repeal.  In my view it is a relic of the bad old days of privilege and class, the days when the landlord and the rich merchants were the principal ratepayers and it was in their interest that a measure of this kind should be enacted in the British Parliament in the extraordinary and rather peculiar manner outlined to-night by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>I find no principle underlying this Act.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Dillon, and he has been supported in his argument by Deputy Major de Valera, this Act has worked in particular cases the grossest injustice. Deputy Dillon has pointed out that the father of this measure was the late Lord Halsbury.  His dead hand has reached out from the grave to our Supreme Court and it was a dictum of Lord Halsbury that was followed by a majority of our judges in the Supreme Court in the case of Carroll and Kildare County Council to which Deputy de Valera has referred.  That particular decision was given by a majority of three to two.  The position of the unfortunate plaintiff was that he was the plaintiff in an action for damages because of the negligence and default of the Kildare County Council in connection with steamrolling operations outside a small public-house in County Kildare.  So far as my recollection serves the action lasted for something over a week.</P>
    <P>My colleague was the late Circuit Judge O'Connor, then Mr. Art O'Connor.  A jury decided in favour of the plaintiff.  An appeal was taken by the Kildare County Council because <Col N="173" /> the plaintiff got a verdict under the direction of Mr. Justice Martin Maguire and in the Supreme Court the case lasted for more than a week as far as I remember.</P>
    <P>The argument went deeply and subtly into the construction to be put upon one particular phrase, or two or three words in a section of the Act.  In the end the whole case of the Kildare County Council was resolved upon the dictum of Lord Halsbury, whose iniquitous measure this was.  Unfortunately, three out of five judges decided to follow him.  Therefore, the plaintiff&mdash;Mr. Carroll&mdash;had to forgo his claim and to pay costs.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned cases in which damage was proved to have been caused by a local authority to a private individual.  It was not ascertained and was incapable of being ascertained until after the expiration of the period of limitation provided by this Act.  Therefore, the action could not be brought against the local authority and, if brought, involved the unfortunate sufferer in a liability for solicitor and client costs, which, for the benefit of Deputies in the House who may not be familiar with these matters, meant a very considerable additional burden.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to go into all the matters that have been dealt with by the two previous speakers.  It appears to be accepted that this is an iniquitous measure that is long due for reform.</P>
    <P>The number of bodies that have been endeavouring to bring themselves within the ambit and scope of this iniquitous measure is astonishing. Córas Iompair Éireann tried it out for a good while.  Fortunately, they were not successful in their efforts.  We have documents upon the files of the court in connection with actions brought by private individuals who were injured through the negligence of bus drivers or otherwise.  However, because the actions were not brought within a period of six months after the injuries were received, Córas Iompair Éireann was not held liable.  My recollection is that we put into the Transport Act. 1950, a provision making it definitely clear that such a procedure was not to <Col N="174" /> be possible for Córas Iompair Éireann, although this body, being kept alive by the taxpayers' money, is, to a very considerable extent, a public authority. I do not think that the Electricity Supply Board ever made the case that they are a public authority, although they might very readily have done so. I think I am correct in saying that they never tried to bring themselves within the ambit of this Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has referred to the provisions in other Acts.  He seems to think that some limitation ought to be put down for the protection of public bodies.  I agree that the same limitation as applies to private individuals should be applicable, where practicable, to public bodies.  They should stand in relation to the community in exactly the same position as the ordinary citizen, enjoying no greater or no lesser privilege.  The Deputy referred to provisions in the Workmen's Compensation Acts and in the Landlord and Tenant Act.  He knows that the statutory limitations in those Acts cause grave injustice from time to time. The more of those statutory limitations one puts in, the more injustice is being done to humble individuals.  Mr. Carroll, who brought an action against a Kildare County Council, was a humble man with a very small holding, and he was involved in liabilities that must still be an immense burden on him.</P>
    <P>I see no justification in principle for having a limitation for public authorities other than the limitation that applies to private individuals.  I am speaking from recollection, but I think that Section 57, sub-section (7), of the Local Government Act, 1898, provided that actions against local authorities where the claim, if it had to be made, was payable out of the poor rate, had to be brought within six months.  That worked out in practice to be such an injustice that the then Legislature, and our own Legislature since we took over control of the State, brought in amending legislation providing that the period could be extended.  It is my opinion that the injustice has been wiped out by the provisions of the local government legislation passed within recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> The periods of limitation put in by statute caused hardship and injustice in the case of the Landlord and Tenant Act.  I was engaged in one of those cases to which Deputy de Valera referred&mdash;the Burke case.  There is no doubt that, through no fault of their own, great injustice has been caused to litigants.  Perhaps the clerk overlooked to serve notice, although instructed to do so or, perhaps, the party bringing the action was ill.  The period of limitation passed, and they were deprived of their right.  All experience goes to show that, while stale demands should not be given any hearing, this House ought to be very slow to re-enact any provisions which will give further privileges to local authorities.  It is said that there are administrative difficulties.  Deputy de Valera thinks so.  My idea would be to give the same period of limitation to local authorities as is given to private individuals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy as well as I is familiar with cases in which a number of private individuals had good cases against local authorities but shrank from bringing them in because of the appalling liability that would be theirs if the cases did not go well. They were thereby deprived of their just rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has been even worse than that.  There have been cases which were certain to succeed and where it has been said: &ldquo;You are a month out and you have no action.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We have also got examples of individuals who have good cases but who are afraid to run the risk.  It is suggested that public authorities are more vulnerable. Perhaps they are.  Perhaps the jury takes the view that the broad back can bear a heavy burden.  Against that I want to emphasise that, in bringing heavy litigation against public authorities, private individuals take immense risks.  Public authorities have very <Col N="176" /> much bigger resources and enjoy greater facilities for the conduct of litigation than do private individuals.</P>
      <P>It was said that the justification for the provisions such as those in Section 57, sub-section 7 of the Local Government Act, 1898, was that the ratepayers should be the persons to pay for a claim in the particular year in which it was made.  That cannot be used as a justification for the provisions, because it is correct to say that no proceedings can be brought within a particular fiscal year owing to the necessity for awaiting courts; no High Court action can be brought to a conclusion within the fiscal year in which the action comes up.</P>
      <P>The administrative difficulties to which Deputy de Valera referred, if they exist at all, which I doubt, are more than counterbalanced by the fact that local authorities have big resources at their disposal and have greater facilities than have private individuals for the conduct of litigation. I feel that the Minister would be only doing what justice requires and what the general public approves if he arranged that public authorities would stand as regards actions in exactly the same position as private individuals.</P>

      <P>I presume that I shall get credit for the three minutes of time which the Minister has now wasted and that they will be taken off the time which is usually allowed to a Minister to reply.  I raised, as you have just said, this matter of the Minister's <Col N="178" /> impudent evasion of the queries I put down in these 18 questions because it is a matter of supreme public importance.  I intend, as I have said, because of the limited time available to me to-night, merely to cover in broad outline only some of the matters to which I referred in the course of the questions I put down on the Order Paper to-day.  Fortunately, there will be other occasions on which the matters can be brought out in greater detail and with more force and effect. The people who have to pay taxes to provide the interest on the loan, those people who have entered into commitments or who are preparing to buy their houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, those people who invested in previous National Loans and those people who hereafter may invest in subsequent National Loans have a deep interest in every single item contained in the questions I put down to-day.  May I say that these questions were put down in the fullest realisation of the responsibility I bore to this House, to the people in my constituency whom I represent here and to the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>I have received, as I am sure Deputies of all Parties have received, complaints both from people who hoped to purchase their dwellings under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and from people who have subscribed to previous loans.  I received even reproaches from people who have purchased holdings in previous loans that they had been let down by the very attractive provisions of the recent loan. I have certainly received many expressions and statements calling attention to the unnecessarily high rate of interest that was given to the subscribers to the recent loan.  It is for these reasons, in order to probe out the whole position so that the public and, in particular, those people who are most interested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have had, instead, a general tirade on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.  He has not directed his remarks to any specific question of the 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is two more minutes to which I am entitled.  The Minister has now wasted five minutes. I said at the outset of my remarks that I was going to indicate the topics which these groups of questions dealt with. The remarks I am making are directed to these groups, each of which I shall deal with.  I referred at the outset to the taxpayers who will have to pay interest to the subscribers to the recent loan.  Questions Nos. 41 and 42 are framed in their interest and, as I was about to say when I was interrupted by the Minister, these questions are put down for the purpose of eliciting information and of probing the situation in order that the public may judge as between the case made by the Minister or to be made by him, and the case made by me and by my colleagues, in reference to the terms of the recent loan.  We have stated publicly that the terms granted by the recent loan were unduly attractive and unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>I asked in Question No. 41 if steps had been taken on behalf of the Minister or of other persons to secure that units of the recent loan would not be sold at a premium on the stock exchange and, if so, what were those steps.  In Question No. 42 I asked whether any units of the loan were purchased by or on his behalf, or on behalf of his Department, or on behalf of any other Minister, Department, board or other authority under his control and, if so, whether any of such units have been sold, agreed to be sold, or otherwise disposed of since the opening of the market on the stock exchange for the sale of units of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not clear to every Deputy what the purpose behind these questions was?  These questions, as I have said, were directed to get information <Col N="180" /> which I believed, and still believe and assert, would have demonstrated the measure of the error of the Minister in launching a loan at a rate of interest of 5 per cent.&mdash;an unduly high rate of interest and one unwarranted by the circumstances on the stock exchange or our own conditions here.  It became quite apparent after the close of subscriptions to the loan, that when units of the loan would be put up for resale on the Dublin Stock Exchange, these units were going to go to a premium. It was believed that every £100 of stock would have gone to at least £103 and if these units had been allowed to reach that 3 point premium, then it would have been apparent that subscribers to the National Loan had been given at the expense of the Irish taxpayers a present of a sum of £600,000. Now what I wanted to find out in these and in subsequent questions was: Were any measures taken by the Minister to prevent that National Loan when it came upon the stock exchange from going to a premium and, if so, what was the purpose of it?</P>
    <P>My information is that the Government stockbroker did sell portion of the stock in order to prevent the loan from going to a premium.  The purpose was twofold: the purpose was to prevent the loan from going to a premium and also so that it would not be apparent, at least for the present until the storm had died down, that the Minister had given an unduly high rate of interest.  If it had gone to 3 points a clear present of £600,000 would have gone to the subscribers to the loan at the expense of the taxpayers. It had gone to 1 point yesterday, which meant a present of £200,000 to the subscribers.  My information is that it went to 1¼ points to-day, and if that is so it means that a present of £250,000 has been given to the subscribers to the National Loan at the expense of the taxpayers.  That is where the taxpayers' interests are involved in the questions which I have put down.</P>
    <P>Their interests are also involved because not only was that present given unnecessarily but it is quite apparent that the loan would go to a premium and will go to a premium if <Col N="181" /> it is let.  That interest of 5 per cent. is unduly high even in the circumstances which confronted the Minister because of his failure to go to the people for a loan last year at a time when stocks of National Loan were at par and at a premium at a rate of interest of 3 or 3½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister or somebody else on his behalf kept down the premium for his own purpose. Why does the Minister not answer?  It is evasion to say that it is necessary to decide how far the public interest was served by the publication of detailed information which was liable to misuse in uninformed quarters.  Are those uninformed quarters the taxpayers who will have to pay for his efforts?  Are those uninformed quarters the people who bought National Loan, who bought any of the three loans which Deputy McGilligan so successfully launched, and who will be affected by the Minister's efforts?</P>
      <P>If my information is correct&mdash;and I assume that my information is correct because of his evasion to-day&mdash;he has prevented it from going to a premium. Everybody knows that the previous loans issued by the Government and which had the approval of the Dáil had appreciated for a few days or for some time at all events before the launching of this loan.  The capital appreciation to the holders will be minimised because the previous National Loans would go up in sympathy with the premium price payable for this National Loan.  I put it to Deputies: were those two questions not relevant in the interests of the taxpayers and in the interests of the holders of previous National Loans who have the right to know how they have been let down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister giving a long statement, such as his impudent answer to the questions I put down to-day; there is no use in his saying that the only obligation of the Government towards those people was to repay them at the end of their term. As every Deputy knows everybody <Col N="182" /> cannot wait until the end of the term. They may suffer a depreciation in capital they know, but what they did not expect was this action of the Government's in coming in for another loan and by the effect of that action in itself bringing about a depreciation of the previous National Loans.  That is what happened in this case.  I put down a question which was relevant on that point.  I wanted to know whether the Minister had been purchasing any of the previous National Loans during the period prior to the initiation of this recent loan.  It would appear to an outsider looking at the movements of the stock exchange for some days or some weeks before the opening of the last loan that the previous loans were being maintained and supported.  I do not suggest for a moment that it is the duty of the Minister for Finance or of the government of the day to support at all times and in all circumstances previous National Loans or any National Loan, but it is habitually done and it would appear that it was being done for some time before this loan was initiated.</P>
    <P>Because of the Minister's support the loan was being maintained and suddenly it flopped and disastrously flopped.  It has somewhat righted itself recently but it has been prevented from fully righting itself by the action of the Minister in selling the last loan for the purpose of preventing that loan from going to its fullest premium.  I can deal with that only in very short outline in the time I find at my disposal.</P>
    <P>I put down Questions Nos. 45, 57 and 58 in order to find out how many foreigners took advantage of the taxpayers of this country in order to get this extremely attractive loan.</P>

      <P>I was told by the Minister in his impudent observations in reply to supplementary questions that we were envious of the loan's success.  Last July in Cork before I knew what the terms of the loan were going to be I publicly asked support for any National Loan in the interests of this State because that was our policy.  It was not our policy or the <Col N="183" /> policy of any Party on this side of the House to do what the Minister and his colleagues did at the time of the Second National Loan issued by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;to plaster the walls of this city with the sign of the pawnbroker, the three golden balls, saying that the credit of this State had been put into pawn.  That was not our policy.</P>
      <P>We wanted to maintain the credit of the State and we did not want to damage it if we could help it.  &ldquo;Very attractive&rdquo; were the words I used at Mountmellick on the 26th September when I knew what the terms of the loan would be.  We did not want a disaster to the State.  That loan was gilt-edged and if it failed the credit of the State would be destroyed for many years.  I said in Mountmellick&mdash; I quote my exact words from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 27th September, 1952:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The terms of the loan were more than favourable and the stock was such a great bargain that it would be well if ordinary Irish investors saw to it that it was taken up by them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To-day I asked Questions Nos. 45, 57 and 58 to see how many foreigners had taken possession at the expense of the Irish taxpayers of portions of the loan.  I emphasised at Mountmellick that I hoped that the Irish people would take up the loan so that the foreign investor should not come in, take it and scoop the pool.</P>
      <P>I put down Question No. 53 in order to expose the fraudulent policy of the Minister when he said that it was the policy of the Government to repatriate our external assets.  I put down the question to see the estimated amount of realisation of British stocks, shares or securities by Irish nationals or Irish corporations for the purpose of investment in the recent National Loan.</P>

      <P>I want to make one more point, although I have a very great deal to say on this subject: I hope I shall get a chance of saying it on another occasion.  I asked Questions Nos. 47, 48 and 53 for the purpose of directing attention to the matter of overdrafts.  Did the Minister direct the banks not to give or to give overdrafts to their customers for the purpose of purchasing units of this stock?  When Deputy McGilligan launched his three loans he definitely instructed the banks not to give an overdraft.  I assert that millions were given by way of overdraft to customers of Irish banks to enable them to invest that overdraft in this National Loan at a time when the business people of this country are suffering from the severe credit restrictions imposed upon them by this Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they were intended to criticise the fact that the loan tended to go to a premium.  Others of the questions were drafted to blame me because, in fact, the previously existing issues had not been kept at a premium.  Deputy Costello was trying to face both ways.  It was easy for him to take out an insurance in advance and to go down to Cork and recommend this loan in the terms in which he recommended it because, after all, he could have it both ways.  If it were a success he could pursue the policy which he has adopted since its success has become apparent to everybody, that is, he could go out and say that we have given the investors too good value.  Let us, however, consider this question a little further.  What is Deputy Costello really driving at? Does he favour the establishment of a premium on a public issue&mdash;as some of his questions on the Order Paper to-day seems to suggest that he does? Does that mean that he thinks that investors should get a special reward for their courage in investing in an Irish Government issue?  If, on the other hand, as Questions Nos. 41 and 42&mdash;to which he has made some, reference&mdash;would seem to suggest, he regrets that the new loan is standing at a small premium.  If he criticises us for that and regards it as blameworthy, why did he not flagellate himself in public in 1948 when the first issue of Exchequer Bonds established itself at a premium of three points?</P>

      <P>But, of course, nobody can hit the bull's eye just exactly.  All we do know is that within a comparatively short period, the credit of this State, while it was under the control of Deputy Costello, so declined that when next he issued at 3 per cent. an Exchequer Bond loan it failed to fill&mdash;so that Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Finance, for that reason, refused to give me the information which I asked for in March, 1949.  Deputy Costello's conduct in this matter may have serious repercussions on the credit of this State and he ought to reflect more deeply before committing himself further in his attempts to belittle the success of the loan.  The series of questions to which he put his name&mdash;I do not know whether or not he is responsible for them&mdash;has given rise to serious apprehension elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The State has no duty to either the public or the Dáil to disclose &lsquo;identity of subscribers&rsquo; as requested in a query of Costello's at opening of Dáil.  Irish people are opposed to such disclosures.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked no such question as to identity, whoever your nationalist correspondent may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend that observation to Deputy Costello's consideration. The loan has been a striking success, not so much because of the favourable terms of the issue but because public confidence in the credit of the State and in the management of the public finances has been re-established.</P>

      <P>Let Deputy Costello and Deputy MacBride and the other members of the Opposition be content with that and make the best of it.</P>
