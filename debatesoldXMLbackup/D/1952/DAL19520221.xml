      <P>The most suitable figures to measure the numbers of non-agricultural employees would appear to be the estimated average number of persons insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts actually at work in each year, which estimate is based on the value of contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. The estimated figures, 341,300 for 1949 and 355,600 for 1950, were given by the Minister for Social Welfare in reply to a question by Deputy Larkin on 13th February, 1952, in which it was stated that the particulars for 1951 would be available in about a month.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the hardship caused to shopkeepers throughout the country by the operation of the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Act to the extent of abolishing the limits on the hours of trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to a somewhat similar question, addressed to me on the 6th December last, I have already entered into consultations with interested parties on the need for a change in the hours of trading which have been fixed by law for shops.  The consultations have not yet been concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>I think that certain changes are desirable but I could not indicate what these changes may be until I have considered the submissions and observations received from all the organisations.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, under the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 267) Personal Clothing and Wearing Apparel Order, 1951, articles of personal clothing and wearing apparel will be permitted to be imported under licence without payment of duty or at a reduced rate of duty in cases where the articles concerned were ordered or in transit prior to the 10th December, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no power to permit the importation of the articles referred to at any lesser rate of duty than that which was chargeable at the date on which the goods were imported.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of permitting the goods to be imported free of duty, the fact is that duty free import facilities have not, for many years past, been granted in respect of articles of personal clothing and wearing apparel. The Deputy will, I am sure, agree that it would be most inequitable that persons who imported such goods on the 10th December, 1951, the date on which the increased duty became operative, should be allowed to bring them in free of duty, whilst a person who imported similar classes of goods on the previous day had to pay duty at the rate then prevailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with the last portion of the Minister's reply because the operative date makes all the difference between bringing goods in which were ordered prior to that date and bringing them in subsequently, but in the Revenue Commissioners' notice they state that licences will be granted for a remission of duty <Col N="907" /> or a reduced rate of duty and that appears to me to be misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an increase in duty.  I have no power to give a licence to permit goods to be imported at the old rate of duty; I have power to permit goods to be imported free of duty&mdash;which should not be done under the circumstances because duty free licences for these goods have never been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but in the notice from the Revenue Commissioners it is stated that goods may be imported at a reduced rate of duty or that the duty may be remitted entirely. A number of people who read the Order are under the impression that if they made application to the Department the duty would be reduced or remitted for goods ordered prior to the date in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in connection with his reply to a question on 22nd November last, he is aware of the continued unsatisfactory position in the worsted spinning industry at Tullamore involving short-time, reduction in staff and curtailed production; and, if so, whether he has any statement to make in the matter, and what further steps he now proposes to take to have the very unsatisfactory state of affairs in this industry rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduced employment and short-time working now in operation in the worsted spinning mills at Tullamore is directly due to a continued falling-off in orders for worsted yarns from the firm's main customers, the Irish woollen and worsted mills. The factors responsible for the present position of the industry were indicated by me on the 31st October last, in reply to Dáil questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps have been taken to rectify the position of this and other firms and to <Col N="908" /> offset the effects on employment of the heavy stocks of worsted cloths imported last year by a drastic reduction of the import quota for woven woolen and worsted tissues, and by reimposing, with effect from the 9th November last, the tariff of 33? per cent. on yarns of the types made at Tullamore.  An expansion of orders for worsted yarns may be expected when the trade of the woollen and worsted mills revives following on the disposal of abnormal stocks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any communication from the Tullamore Trades Council requesting him to summon a conference of all the interested parties for the purpose of dealing with the questions of low production and employment?  Is he aware that the position is gradually getting worse since last October?  Whereas 700 people, men and women, were in full employment last October, only 340 were employed for three days last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received that proposal to summon a conference but I have not yet considered whether I should act upon it.  There are no obvious advantages to be gained, in view of the facts relating to this industry, by holding such a conference. I would require to consult the firm as to their view on the proposal that their business should be discussed at such a conference and there are other difficulties also.  The Deputy, I think, will not be unconscious of the fact that the summoning of a conference on the lines proposed would create a certain problem.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he would make inquiries in order to satisfy himself and his Department that the management of the Tullamore spinning mills is in no way at fault?  There is a rumour in the area that the mills are <Col N="909" /> not being properly managed and an inquiry into the working of the mills is necessary.  In fact if the Minister takes other branches of the industry from the point of view of short working time and the number of staff laid off he will find that the number is very small in comparison with the large number of workers, hundreds of them, who have lost their employment or are retained on short time in Tullamore. Would the Minister make the inquiry so as to ascertain whether those mills are being properly managed and worked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that one of the difficulties as far as this particular industry is concerned is the fact that so much rayon has been allowed into the country?  That provides serious competition to these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  Of course rayon in the ordinary meaning of that term is not in competition at all with the products of this mill. There is, however, a product called rayon wool which is becoming available, some quantities of which have been imported in recognition of the fact that it does not affect the output of their own business.</P>

      <P>The increase in the total is due mainly to valuations of new buildings. Higher valuations of existing buildings, partially offset by the deletion of the valuations of buildings found to be in ruinous condition and by reductions in the valuations of buildings reduced in value, contributed to the increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as tractors and locomotive vehicles are concerned, the Department of Justice and the Department of Local Government from time to time have issued instructions stating that where the tractor or locomotive was used purely for the purpose of conveying the farmer's produce to the market or for other transport operations of the farm, no proceedings were to be taken.  If, of course, the farmer starts using his tractor for the purpose of distributing, acting as a retail distributor, then quite a different situation arises.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that some time ago necessitous persons in receipt of blind pensions, unemployment benefit, old age pensions and home assistance allowances, received vouchers for butter, bread and milk which were later withdrawn and a cash allowance substituted and that many of those now in receipt of vouchers for turf which they themselves have to carry from depots, often a considerable distance from their homes, would prefer these vouchers to be withdrawn and a cash allowance substituted, so that they could purchase fuel delivered at their doors; and, if so, if he will favourably consider the suggestion and thus eliminate the hardships now being borne by the weak, the aged and the infirm, or, alternatively, have arrangements made for the voucher fuel to be delivered to their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the cheap fuel scheme is to ensure that a supply of cheap fuel will be made available to specified categories of necessitous persons.  I do not consider that the objects of the scheme would be met by the substitution of a cash allowance for the present voucher system.  As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, an arrangement has existed in the Dublin area for some years under which the fuel is delivered to the recipients' homes by private carriers at a small cost to the recipient. I am not aware that any demand <Col N="914" /> exists for delivery to the homes of recipients in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if he changed the voucher to cash, people could buy the fuel at their own doors instead of having to travel long distances in wet, windy and cold weather, and carry it in many cases on their backs?  If the Minister were to give them cash, certain people engaged in the business could call at the halldoor and, for a couple of pence extra, deliver the fuel into their rooms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to answer that question.  The position is that on the 17th April, 1951, and again on the 14th November last, the Deputy was informed that the Land Commission had decided not to acquire these lands.  The position now, I understand, is that the lands have been sold.  The fact that the lands have been sold does not necessarily mean that I am going to accept the point of view that the Deputy is urging on me in this House. The fact that the lands have been sold does not alter the situation that, in fact, a decision had been come to and that the decision was come to in the light of the circumstances then existing. I have no evidence that the circumstances as regards the conditions of the local people have changed.  The practice of putting pressure in these instances on individuals who have purchased land, whether their case be good or bad, does not commend itself to me nor does it commend itself to the Land Commission.  Their attitude in these matters is that the persons who own these lands are perfectly entitled to dispose of them and I think the majority of Deputies would not countenance a situation under which pressure could be brought to bear on such people.  As I have said, the matter has already been decided and the Deputy has not brought any new facts to my notice or any new evidence to show that there has been any change in the situation since last April.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement.</P>
      <P>(1)  The determination of the fixed rents referred to is a matter for the city manager primarily.  On 25th November, 1946, housing authorities were informed by circular letter issued in connection with the arrangements for the payment of grants from the Transition Development Fund that no precise formula could be laid down in regard to the fixation of rents.  The rents policy has, however, followed the principle that the annual outgoings on loan charges on a 50 year basis of repayment together with maintenance and administration costs should be divided in equitable proportions between the State, the local authority and the tenant, the rent however being first fixed on a basis which would have regard to the normal capacity of the tenant to pay.</P>
      <P>As regards costs, final figures are not yet available for all the schemes but I am obtaining from the city manager and will forward to the Deputy a statement in respect of all the schemes for which final costs have been ascertained.</P>
      <P>(2)  It has been ascertained from the local authority that the rents of the schemes in question, inclusive of the statutory increase in lieu of the current rates, are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will indicate why grants from the Transition Development Fund have not yet been allocated to the cork Corporation for 212 houses at Ballyphehane No. 1 scheme and the amount per house which it is proposed to pay; further, whether any payments from the Transition Development Fund have been made in respect of Ballyphehane No. 2 and Baker's Lane No. 3 schemes; and, if so, if he will state the total amount and the amount per house which it is proposed to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants totalling £47,242 have been provisionally allocated in <Col N="925" /> respect of the scheme of 212 houses at Ballyphehane No. 1.  This is equivalent to a grant of £249 for each of the 190 houses concerned.  The scheme includes 22 &ldquo;reserved houses&rdquo; each of which will qualify for a grant not exceeding £250 under Section 27 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.</P>
      <P>Grants amounting to £27,791, or £339 per house, have been provisionally allocated in the case of the 82-house scheme at Ballyphehane No. 2, and grants of £79,200, or £400 per house, in respect of 198 houses in the Baker's Lane No. 3 scheme.  In the case of the Ballyphehane No. 2 scheme revised rent proposals have recently been submitted to me by the corporation. These proposals are at present under consideration and, if agreed to, will affect the amount of the grant provisionally allocated.</P>
      <P>Payments on account of grants amounting to £111,080, have been made in respect of the schemes at Ballyphehane No. 1, Ballyphehane No. 2 and Baker's Lane No. 3.  It is not possible to apportion between the individual schemes the amounts so paid on account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate in what way the rents affect the grants?  Does it mean that the grants will be reduced?  I understood him to say that the grants will affect the rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposal is to reduce the rents, it will increase the amounts of the grants available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister last week that the rents were before his Department waiting to be sanctioned.  Am I to understand now that the grants will be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must understand that the matter of the fixation of the amount paid per house is now closed since the 1st April last and also that a number of factors enter into the determination of the amount paid in respect of each house.  The amount of the rent charged, the contribution that is made from the rates, and so forth, are factors that determine the amount per house that will be charged. <Col N="926" /> If the rents fixed originally are on the high side and result in the amount of grant being reduced, and should a proposition come from the local body concerned to reduce the rents and should such a proposition be sanctioned by the Department then that would have the effect of increasing the amount of the grant per house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the higher the rent the manager fixes &mdash;not the local authority, because the manager out-vetoes them&mdash;the smaller the grant which the Cork Corporation will get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the rent is not the only factor in determining the grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the amount received from the fund is dependent on the rent fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had put it the other way round he would be correct.  The amount of rent charged, plus the contribution made from the rates towards the cost of the house, are two factors which contribute largely in determining whether or not the maximum grant will be paid from the fund.</P>

      <P>A lay-out plan for a scheme of 13 houses at John Street, Dingle, was finally approved by my Department on the 26th November, 1951.  The Kerry County Council were also informed that the erection of four houses on the opposite side of John Street was in order.  It is understood from the council, however, that the sites already approved will not accommodate sufficient houses to meet the full needs of Dingle and that negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of a larger site.  The council have been <Col N="927" /> requested to expedite the submission of their further proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that certain milk producers in the Cork area are seeking an increase in the price of milk and if, when reviewing these prices, he will take into consideration the fact that this supply is restricted to certain producers and that a large number of producers are willing to supply the Cork area but are prevented from doing so by the Cork Milk Board, which is controlled by a limited number of producers and distributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain milk producers in the area of the Cork District Milk Board are seeking an increase in milk prices.  The Deputy may take it that when milk prices are being reviewed all the relevant factors will be taken into account.  The Deputy is, however, not strictly accurate in ascribing to the Cork District Milk Board the decision of preventing certain producers from selling milk in the Cork area.  The area from which the Cork milk supply is at present obtainable is defined in the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Acts, 1936 and 1941 and the Orders made by the Minister for Agriculture under those Acts and the Cork District Milk Board merely administers those Acts and Orders in so far as they relate to its area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to state that farmers from outside that area have been denied the right to send milk into the city in the summer months when milk is available but that they may do so during the winter months <Col N="930" /> when it suits the farmers and the milk board in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The milk board area is already defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the threats of some milk producers to reduce the supply of milk unless they receive increased prices, he will increase the number of suppliers in the Cork Milk Board area so as to ensure the supply of milk to Cork City; and whether he will give representation to consumers on the Cork Milk Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, suitable measures would be taken if the need arose, to ensure sufficient supplies of milk for the Cork District Milk Board area. The nature of such measures would depend on the particular circumstances of the situation.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Acts, 1936 and 1941, under which the Cork District Milk Board operates, do not provide for consumer representation on the board. Consumers are, of course, at liberty to make representations to the board or to the appropriate Minister and have in fact done so in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

That may be a mistaken impression which a careful check would correct.

      <P>The agreed official statement which was published at the conclusion of the conversations gave a fair summary of the proceedings. These conversations were arranged to give an opportunity to the representatives of the two countries to exchange information and views on financial and trade matters that were of mutual interest.  They did not go any further. It would not be proper for me, I think, to give the information supplied or the views expressed by the British Ministers in these discussions.  On their part, the Irish Ministers gave information concerning the balance of payments position and Government policy on the same lines as those which were given in the Dáil and in the country during the last few months.  They took the opportunity to stress the value of the contribution towards a solution of these problems which could be made by improved deliveries of certain classes of goods from Britain. Arising out of this, it was stated by the British representatives that the planned deliveries of coal during 1952 would not fall below the minimum which was provided for in the Trade Agreement of 1948.  As that is a full statement really of what happened, I do not think there is any need for any further statement or that any purpose <Col N="934" /> would be served by any further statement.</P>

The Taoiseach will understand that a very considerable amount of interest and anxiety has been created in the country recently in relation to these talks. Even if it is only a statement which <Col N="935" /> will cover such an amount of ground as will allay the anxiety in the minds of the people and the Dáil, a formal statement covering as much ground as is possible to be covered ought to be made to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is really driving at.  The result of the conversations and the views that were exchanged has simply had the effect of confirming us in the views that we already had in regard to certain matters and, in so far as the time for action develops, it has not changed us in the slightest.  There was no need for any public anxiety.  Certainly nothing that the government did gave rise to anxiety.</P>
      <P>There was an attempt made by certain people to try to create public anxiety.  The fact is that these discussions were confined to an exchange of views and to the giving of information on matters of common interest. It was stated here that the sterling position was a matter of interest to us.  As any Deputy who knows anything about the matter knows, it is a matter of interest to us.  It is also a matter of interest to the British and to any others in the sterling group. There is no nation within that group which is compelled to take any particular action except that which it thinks wise in its own interest.  The more information one gets on these matters the better.  If you have studied the matter carefully, you will understand that it is not likely on these fundamental matters that you will get a great deal of information which is not fairly common property.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could dispose of a point which I should like to raise now on the Money Resolution.  There is a very substantial amount of money being provided here for the development up to, I think, 1956.  There is one point which, in my opinion, ought to be a little more fully reviewed because of its impact on the cost of electricity development. I understood from the Minister's statement on the Second Reading of the Bill that he will be introducing a Bill dealing with turf development very shortly.  I think that the matter could, perhaps, be more profitably and effectively discussed on that Bill, but at column 419 of his statement on the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister stated that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy may take it that all the plans for additional turf burning stations have been prepared in full agreement with Bord na Móna and they have committed themselves to completing their development in each area in time to ensure the delivery <Col N="941" /> to the Electricity Supply Board of the full quantity of turf necessary to achieve these outputs I am quoting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there has been a very considerable amount of dissatisfaction in the synchronising of the turf development plan which the Electricity Supply Board is depending on for some of its stations such as the Portarlington station and that the lag in the development in the turf supply on the one hand, and the costs of production on the other, have been a very great source of concern to the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister will have examined the figures that have been quoted as the anticipated cost of turf production, say, in the Portarlington station.  In 1946, the cost was 20/- and 25/- a ton. Actually, in 1948 it was 38/- and in 1949 39/6.  In 1950&mdash;whether an agreement has been come to or not yet I do not know&mdash;I understand the cost of turf was 46/5 a ton, and that there was considerable difficulty with regard to the moisture content of the turf.</P>
    <P>As to the proposal with regard to the use of milled peat, a number of questions have been asked here in the House as to whether expert technicians of various kinds are fully satisfied with the proposals for the use of milled peat.  We have had a certain amount of experience in the past of the development not coming up, in the matter of time and quantity, to expectations, with, on the one hand, the moisture content being difficult, and on the other with the cost being very substantially in excess of what was anticipated.  It would appear that past experience in that respect has not been altogether overcome to the satisfaction either of the management or of the engineering side.  Can the Minister give us any more information as to what steps are being taken to harmonise, and make more effective, agreement between the technicians on the turf producing side and those on the electricity producing side, and say whether there are matters which are still unsatisfactory from his point of view or from the point of view of anybody?</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that such substantial amounts of money are being <Col N="942" /> provided for this development&mdash;and if things are still unsatisfactory with regard to a mutual understanding and mutual agreement&mdash;will he undertake to have them examined in such a way that, by the time he comes to deal with the Bill for the further development by Bord na Móna, he will be able to satisfy the House that things are clear and are better understood as between all the technicians in the matter?  I say that because there has been a loss of money and a loss of effort in the past.  If we are now branching out on this very substantial development and are making available a very appreciable amount of money for expenditure during the next four years, it is desirable that we should all be satisfied that, on the technical side of things, there was the fullest possible understanding and agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to turf to be consumed at Portarlington, the Minister, in estimating the total cost of turf, gave a price of £2 1s. Od. per ton.  Did he take into consideration, in estimating the cost of all the turf required to operate Portarlington, the fact that up to 50 wagons of turf per week have been drawn to the Portarlington station from places in the West of Ireland over the past three months, and that every sod of that turf was carried by road four miles from the bog to the railhead?  I do not know how many centres in the West of Ireland were providing turf on that scale for transport to Portarlington&mdash;I have personal knowledge of only one&mdash;but I am perfectly certain that the delivery price at Portarlington of that turf was substantially in excess of £2 1s. Od.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to be able to tell us what percentage of the total quantity of turf to be consumed at Portarlington is being drawn to the station from places other than the immediately adjacent bog and, in respect of the turf drawn from other places, what it is costing on the average, including freight charges from the bog to the railhead and from the railhead to Portarlington, and whether the cost of such turf is taken into consideration in forecasting the average cost of turf fuel at the station at <Col N="943" /> £2 1s. Od. per ton, or whatever was the last figure mentioned by the Minister as being, in his judgment, the figure at which turf was a cheaper fuel from which to generate electricity than coal or oil.  He said that after mature reflection very deliberately in this House.  It is an interesting declaration and I think he should clarify it in respect of one facet which I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>From time to time, it has been advocated that workers' representatives be appointed on the management committees or boards of semi-State bodies.  Recently, our Party had occasion to make representations asking that representation be given to workers on these semi-State bodies and the Minister replied that he was sympathetically disposed towards it.  I wonder if he could give the House an assurance that, so far as this Bill is concerned, in the appointment of the board workers' representatives will be included.</P>

      <P>I have made no changes in the membership of the Electricity Supply Board and it will be interesting to see if the Labour Party have more influence with me in regard to its membership than they had with the Coalition.  I want to say to Deputy Mulcahy that his source of information <Col N="944" /> concerning the Portarlington station appears to be a slightly prejudiced one.  The position was not as described by him.  He will recollect that that station was planned upon a basis which involved Bord na Móna in the obligation to deliver 120,000 tons of turf per year and Bord na Móna made its plans for the development of the bog on that basis.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Supply Board constructed the station, and, when it was completed, found that it was of a larger capacity than was originally intended and that it was possible for it to use that station to produce more electricity than had been assumed and that consequently a greater annual consumption of turf was involved.  The situation, therefore, in which Bord na Móna found itself when the capacity of the station was realised was that it had to undertake the delivery to the Electricity Supply Board for that station of a substantially larger quantity of turf than the quantity for the production of which Clonsast bog was developed.  I think it can do that, either by an extension of activities at Clonsast or by linking in with Portarlington station other bogs in the vicinity which it is developing.</P>

It will be remembered that there was a strike of Bord na Móna workers about this time last year, during which the stockpile of turf at Portarlington was run out.  I instructed Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board to replenish that stockpile, even though it meant bringing in by road supplies of turf from outlying areas at a higher cost than locally produced turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was partly a precaution against some exceptional situation arising this winter and partially due to the knowledge that with the extended demand upon local turf supplies for the running of the station it would be difficult <Col N="945" /> to build up the stockpile except by bringing in supplies from outside areas.  The Deputy's information about turf cost to the Electricity Supply Board at Portarlington must, I think, be based on some assumptions of which I am not aware.  Bord na Móna's published report gives the all-in cost of turf produced at Clonsast at 40/6 a ton.  Undoubtedly, if the cost of the turf that was brought in by road from outlying areas were taken into account and an average figure struck, the cost of turf to the Electricity Supply Board at Portarlington last year would be higher; but in so far as the economics of the whole project are bound up with the cost of producing turf there, the cost on which decisions must be based is 40/6 per ton.</P>
    <P>As I explained to the House, the average cost of all the turf produced by Bord na Móna last year was higher, but that was partially due to the fact that the average was influenced by the cost of producing turf at bogs which are not yet fully developed and where the incidence of the capital charges per ton is consequently higher than it will ultimately be.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister does he think it satisfactory that the Electricity Supply Board should take five years to plan a station and that they should not be able to estimate its maximum output before they built it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the exact answer to that question.  I should say, first of all, that there is a certain conservatism in estimating the output of a station and secondly, in this case at least, the answer is that the very enthusiastic engineers of the Electricity Supply Board who were straining themselves to justify a peat-fired generating station at Portarlington did, in fact, surprise the headquarters of the Electricity Supply Board by the results they were able to achieve there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand that the generating sets installed at the station are provided by manufacturers outside the country, who themselves state what the performance of these sets will be and it is to be assumed that reputable manufacturers will also tend to underestimate the performance of their equipment.  Bord na Móna was under contract to deliver 120,000 tons of peat per year and during the course of the year the Electricity Supply Board came to them and said: &ldquo;We now want and can use 160,000 to 165,000 tons&rdquo;&mdash;and the board is endeavouring to supply that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a recent conference in my Department, agreement on the utilisation of milled peat was reached by everybody concerned.  The Electricity Supply Board have now got to make a choice between certain types of furnace equipment which have been suggested as suitable for the burning of milled peat, with a view to getting the most suitable type of equipment.  They are in process of making that choice now and to enable them to arrive at the <Col N="947" /> right answer they have in mind the erection of a pilot plant at Allenwood. Whether, in fact, the erection of a pilot plant will be necessary is still an open question.  If the Electricity Supply Board think that is a necessary precaution to enable them to ensure that they will build later stations of maximum efficiency, I will have no objection.</P>

      <P>Peat is so important in the economy of the country that I feel the Minister ought to help us more to realise the technical aspects of the uses to which it is being put The members of the Oireachtas are entitled to a certain amount of information on the technical side of its use. I feel the time has now come, particularly that we have this new development and with further legislation on the way to develop Bord na Móna, when some of the technical information with regard to the uses of turf should be put together and made available in a White Paper for the use of members of the Oireachtas.  I do not want to go back over the past <Col N="951" /> except to point to some of the matters which happened then and to say that they should quicken our sizing up of the situation.  The Minister referred further to the fact that my information must come from prejudiced sources. With regard to Portarlington, the Minister has indicated that the difficulty is that the generating capacity developed at an unexpectedly rapid rate.  I am talking of the turf production and where would the Minister say the prejudice comes in the sources that have provided us with figures such as these.  Take Clonsast.  It was officially estimated that, say, from 1943 on, after Clonsast had been worked for quite a number of years, the annual production would be 150,000 tons and that that would be the annual production during each of the years 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the lack of synchronisation on the technical side.  I do not know whether it was lack of equipment or lack of proper technique which was responsible for that.  A definite estimate was put before the House and it was said that a certain amount of turf would be produced.  However, instead of 150,000 tons being produced every year only 107,000 tons were produced in the year 1949.  It is quite obvious that there has been a lack of dovetailing of plans in the past, and I would ask the Minister does he not now think that the House has to be more satisfied with regard to the complete agreement in matters of detail, of synchronisation of work and of the accuracy of the estimates that have been made both in regard to cost and in regard to production.  I suggest to him that between now and the time he introduces his measure for the development of Bord na Móna, the House should be given more persuasive information on the matter of production and on the uses of the money allocated than we are getting at the moment. Particularly now that the question of <Col N="952" /> the technical use of turf has been raised in a pointed way with reference to the use of milled peat, I feel that some kind of literature should be issued from the Ministry on the technical side on the use of turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that it is obviously essential that there should be complete harmony between the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  The Electricity Supply Board was, in a sense, faced with a new problem with the decision to utilise peat because they now have to carry out their plans in conformity with Bord na Móna's plans.  A turf-burning steam station is obviously a different proposition from a coal steam station.  In the case of the turf-fired stations, the development of the station must proceed side by side with plans for the development of the turf production designed to feed the station.  I have already taken some steps to ensure that the elements of friction that may have arisen in that regard are eliminated and that there will be that necessary co-operation of planning by both bodies.</P>

      <P>I am a firm believer in the use of turf for electricity generating, especially since the experiment at Portarlington has established the suitability of turf cut in sod form for the firing of such stations.  We are now being introduced to a new process, that is the use of milled peat for firing similar stations.  So far we have had no experience of that method for the firing <Col N="953" /> of electricity stations in this country. I am anxious that a miscarriage of plans should not create revulsion in the public mind against the possibility of firing electricity stations by turf produced in any form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may have misled the House to some extent. There is no doubt about the combustibility of milled peat.  There is no doubt that a boiler could be established and furnaces designed to use it.  The only question that will have to be answered is will it give the maximum of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I can understand it being so in respect of boiler plants.  When one knows the degree of heat that may be generated to produce 200,000 kilowatts, one may be in an entirely different field.  The Minister and I could go to the bog.  I could come home with turf that could light a fire and the Minister might bring home turf that would not light a fire.  The success of this whole scheme depends on the quality of turf produced, its moisture content and its suitability for the work generally.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if the Electricity Supply Board are satisfied from what they have seen elsewhere that this scheme has all the ingredients of practical success and that the recommendation is not merely from those who are interested in selling boilers.

The motion before the House now is to approve the expenditure of £25,000,000 sterling on electricity development.  The Minister, I think, has marshalled general goodwill in principle behind that proposed output.  The only apprehension I would have is that the particular method of developing electricity may fail in its purpose.  Everyone wants the light on the best method, and if there be a best method associated with the user of turf, to alight on that method.</P>
      <P>Would it be reasonable to suggest that at some stage of this legislation a Committee of this House, either on the Committee Stage or the Report Stage, would be afforded an opportunity of hearing experts of Bord na Móna and of the Electricity Supply Board; in other words, that technicians might be at the disposal of a select committee representative of the House at some stage of our consideration of this Development Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that in a country like Sweden people give in a casual kind of way quite a lot of ordinary technical details of nearly every aspect of its technical life that can be fairly well grasped by any person with any kind of general education.  In their parliamentary system, their Deputies in the House are able to sit down with the Government side and the official side and examine questions because their system is based on that way.  I do not think that the average member of the House here is in any way less educationally equipped to sit down in committee and talk and appreciate these things than, say, his prototype in Sweden.  So I do not think the Minister should give us a flat &ldquo;no&rdquo; as a point of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were not outside the scope of this Bill I would suggest that some kind of parliamentary committee would be established as a kind of pre-audit machinery for such a large amount of money as this when there are so many technical aspects.  However, I feel it <Col N="956" /> would be outside the scope of the Bill and would not be in accordance with our general technique here.  But we have at the present moment a Committee of the House sitting on a Defence Bill and I feel it would not be at all inappropriate if members of the general headquarters staff or various officers of the Army gave evidence of one kind or another before that Committee.</P>

      <P>I merely want to make a brief reference to this.  In Mayo, there is a lot of bog held by the Land Commission and if this bog were divided among tenants, giving them an <Col N="957" /> acre or two each, that would facilitate the hand-won turf scheme.  I think that is a matter the Minister should take up with the Land Commission at this stage.  He will recall that during the emergency our county was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, engaged in hand-won turf production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the possibility of utilising some of our coal for the purpose of generating electricity?  I asked his predecessor, Deputy Morrissey, whether he would consider the feasibility of erecting a power station at Arigna and utilising the coal deposits there in order to generate electricity.  The reply I got at the time was that the Electricity Supply Board had the matter under consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pop this question suddenly to the Minister but I think if the Electricity Supply Board carefully considers the suggestion it will find that there are sufficient coal deposits available there to keep a power station going for as long as any station can be kept going in other areas by the use of turf.  The Minister has himself pulled me up on occasions in connection with the amount of coal available in Arigna.  I am afraid his figures and mine do not agree.  According to my source of information, and I believe it is a fairly good one, there are considerable reserves of coal in that locality.  There are a number of areas in which there are coal deposits but no real effort is being made to expand the industry.  I think there are two main reasons for this lack of expansion: firstly, lack of suitable means of transport to and from the locality and, secondly, lack of money to develop the area properly.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies are well aware of the fact that Arigna coal was used to a far greater extent at one time than it is to-day.  It has earned a bad name in recent years with certain owners because sufficient care has not been taken by those responsible for mining it to ensure that only the best article was put on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the solution to this problem of Arigna coal production is for the <Col N="958" /> Electricity Supply Board to acquire the mining rights on payment of reasonable compensation and then utilise the deposits there for the purpose of a generating station.  Apart from that I am convinced that under the coal deposits there are unlimited deposits of iron ore.  Several experts who have visited that locality have stated that there is an unlimited supply of iron ore 200 feet below the third coal seam.  I do not propose to discuss this matter extensively now but, if the Minister has the information available, I want him to let us know whether the Electricity Supply Board has reached a decision to utilise the Arigna coalfields for the purpose of generating electricity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one submission to make.  The Electricity Supply Board is at the present time and will continue to be one of the largest consumers of turf.  Would it be possible for the Electricity Supply Board to acquire surplus turf left on the producers hands?  Yesterday the Minister was asked if he would give an assurance to private producers that if they produced the maximum they would be sure of a market.  It is desirable in the national interest that the maximum amount should be produced by private producers.  In the event of there being a surplus I think the Electricity Supply Board, as a very large consumer of turf, should be prepared to take it over in so far as sod turf is being used for electricity generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the point about the feasibility of having a generating station at Arigna has been raised.  The matter was brought up before, as the Deputy said, and there were certain discussions at the time.  I gathered then that the Electricity Supply Board were having the possibilities examined.  I do not know whether or not it would be an economic proposition but I think it is the only hope of any future prospect for the Arigna coalfield.  When other fuel is available anyway freely it is very difficult, if not impossible, to sell Arigna coal outside a certain small area or on any sort of decent scale. Until the matter has been examined fully by those qualified to determine <Col N="959" /> and decide whether or not it would be an economic proposition&mdash;and I am not speaking now of economics purely from the point of view of the Electricity Supply Board but from the national point of view taking all the factors into consideration&mdash;it should not be determined that the project is not a feasible one until we have evidence that will convince even the Deputy who represents that area.</P>
      <P>All Parties, so far as I am aware, are in favour of producing our maximum electricity requirements from turf.  The utilisation of our turf resources for the generating of electricity ought not to be regarded as a relief scheme.  It is not a relief scheme.  We, like the Government before us, did not look upon it as a stop-gap or something to provide employment.</P>
      <P>It has been said that turf is a most costly form of electricity generation. I do not subscribe to that view.  Ton for ton at a particular time it may cost more than oil or coke but there is more than the mere cutting, saving and burning of turf to be taken into consideration.  The reclaimed land and its value to the State is a major consideration in calculating the cost to the State as distinct from the cost to the Electricity Supply Board.  In passing, may I say to Deputy Cogan that the Electricity Supply Board, operating as it does at the moment under statute, could not do what he suggests in relation to surplus turf?  One of the things we are inclined to forget, apart altogether from outside, is that the Electricity Supply Board has to operate on a commercial basis and has to make ends meet.  Not only has it to make ends meet but it has to make good on its charges with 5 per cent. in addition to the State.  If it were necessary, in order fully to develop and exploit our own resources, to give some liberty in relation to the cost to the Electricity Supply Board to take them out of the straitjacket which the statute puts on them at the moment I think that is something that might be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> With regard to the question of milled peat&mdash;I am sorry I was not here in time to hear him&mdash;the Minister went a little further or, perhaps, conveyed more to the House in relation to that particular project than he meant to on the Second Reading.  I do not think the experiment&mdash;it is not yet out of the experimental stage&mdash;enables us to be in any way emphatic as to the future of milled peat.  I am not to be misrepresented there nor do I want it to be in any way thought that I am questioning the work at the moment.  Certainly, I should like to give it every possible encouragement because, if we can produce milled peat successfully and if it can be fed successfully into the stations at a cheaper rate and with a lower moisture content than the ordinary sod turf, then that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>I would, as I say, ask the Minister to be fully satisfied himself that the question of putting a generating station at Arigna is an impossible one before he would allow the matter to drop.  I again suggest that if it is necessary&mdash;and I am not in any way reflecting on the technical advice and assistance at our own disposal&mdash;to bring in outside expert, technical experience, our view on that matter is that it ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to get an assurance&mdash;I know that Bord na Móna have been working along the right lines in relation to what I am going to say now &mdash;that every possible care will be taken in regard to the bogs which are now being developed for the generating of electricity in relation to the land which is being reclaimed.  I think very considerable parts of those reclaimed areas can be made first-class agricultural land.  Those parts which will not carry agricultural produce can, without any difficulty whatever and without any very large expense, be made entirely suitable for afforestation.  I would suggest to Deputies, who may have some quite genuine and sincere doubts as to the wisdom of proceeding with the turf development in relation to electricity and on the question as to the cost per ton of turf as against the cost per ton of coal or oil, that they ought not to lose sight of the value to <Col N="961" /> the nation of the land which would be so reclaimed.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of criticism&mdash;I am not going to go into that now&mdash;because we allowed other stations to be built&mdash;coal and oil stations.  I do not think that was a mistake at all. At that time, we were facing a position, in so far as we could see it, that, working at full capacity, we would not have increased our generating power to the point of meeting the consumption demand within ten years.  The Minister knows quite as well as I do that the demand was growing at an annual rate equal to the output of a fairly substantial generating station.  The annual rate of increase in any one year would be greater than the total output of, say, Clonsast.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which we will get further opportunities of dealing with but I feel that the board has, under very great difficulties, carried out its job remarkably well.  There has been criticism in the past, mainly by the Minister himself, at the rate of progress in connection with rural electrification and, of course, a considerable amount of the money, which we are providing under this Money Resolution, will be required to meet the additional cost of that.  The Minister talked on many occasions about not keeping up to the schedule of ten years.  The Minister knows quite well that when that ten year period was set it was set under conditions completely different from those which afterwards developed.  I think it is known to him also that, apart altogether from the scarcity and the difficulty of getting most of the materials which are required, the biggest snag we were up against was the scarcity of trained personnel.  People competent to carry out that sort of work are not trained overnight.  I think, in all the circumstances, that the rural electrification scheme has been going ahead as rapidly as could reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the times.  There is no doubt that it has brought into the rural areas, which have been fortunate enough to have obtained it up to date, very great joy and has certainly done a great deal to remove some of the <Col N="962" /> drudgery from rural life.  May I say that its greater progress will also be helped by the dwindling of reluctance on the part of many people living in rural areas to agree to take it in when they are being canvassed to do so?</P>
    <P>I think that turf policy in relation to electricity ought to get every encouragement. It certainly got it from me.  I would say further to some of the people outside the House, who have criticised it on the question of cost and on the question of the rate of delivery into the State, that they are being unreasonable.  I remember it was put up to me, during my time as Minister, that it was not unreasonable to ask Bord na Móna to quote a price per ton in relation to the development of Boora bog which was then supposed to come into operation in 1954 and to quote on delivery what X tons per day or per week would cost; that if they were not prepared to give that information and that undertaking in relation to the year 1954, then they were acting unreasonably and were not approaching this question in a commercial way.  The answer to that, of course, was very simple.  The answer I made was that I had no guarantee whatever in relation to any other fuel, either oil or coal, as to the quantity, if any, which we would get in 1954, 1955, or 1956 or as to price.  Those were the factors which were completely and entirely beyond our control while for our own fuel it could at least be said that it would be largely, if not entirely, within our own capacity with regard to the rate of supply and the price to be paid for it.</P>
    <P>I can only conclude by saying that I am perfectly satisfied that the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna are doing a good job and that the money which is being asked, although, comparatively speaking, it is a huge sum for a country as small as ours, is a sum that the House, I think, can vote without any question or doubt.  I believe that it is a very good investment which will give an excellent return not merely to the nation but to the individual citizens of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer to the policy of the Electricity Supply Board in connection with generating stations <Col N="963" /> in the Gaeltacht districts.  I know that the Electricity Supply Board is an autonomous body.  Heretofore, their policy appeared to be to concentrate on areas adjacent to large industrial towns and generating stations were established in the areas mentioned by Deputy Morrissey such as Clonsast. Even with this huge sum of money, I feel that unless the Minister insists on a change of policy, then the Gaeltacht districts, particularly the one in which I am interested in, South Kerry, will meet with the same fate as they have met heretofore.  I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey that the Electricity Supply Board showed initiative or anxiety to develop the &ldquo;hinterland&rdquo;, as they would call it.  During the last two or three years, they were not inclined to assist the rural or Gaeltacht districts as far as generating stations are concerned.  I feel confident, however, that the Minister will insist on a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies to rural electrification. Parishes in County Kerry were listed six or seven years ago but since then we found that adjustments were made and that other areas were selected while these areas were slipped off the list.  There is a feeling in Kerry that that is not a fair policy.  I am not saying that; there may be reasons for it like valuations and the economic price of such a scheme.  I would like to have that system examined to see if there could not be some adjustment in the policy of rural electrification in Kerry.  They held that they were unable to extend their normal schemes to Cahirciveen and other Gaeltacht areas in South-West Kerry.  We put an alternative to them: a turf-generating station.  They said that the difficulty was cost and remoteness.  I could see no encouragement from the Electricity Supply Board.  Instead of being a national entity and encouraging industrial development, their policy, whether designed or accidental, was the opposite.  I feel confident that the Minister will change all that and indicate to these people that they will not get these millions unless they change their policy.  They built a coal-generating station in Cork, I understand, <Col N="964" /> at considerable expense.  If there were no coal supply to-morrow or next year that would be a white elephant, whereas they could use native fuel if that plant were designed as a turf-generating station.  I submit that was bad policy on the part of the Electricity Supply Board and lack of foresight. I place my plea before the Minister so that the Gaeltacht districts in Kerry may have more attention in the future than heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>While I generally concur with the remarks of congratulation to the Electricity Supply Board on this colossal scheme of electrical development and on their attempt to cope with the huge and welcome increase in the user of electricity among our people, there are a few remarks I wish to make of an adverse character.  If we have the privilege of voting millions of pounds for the development of electricity, while we must, of course, appreciate that they are established by statute on a commercial basis, we may say, I think, that they are trying to be too successful from the commercial angle to the utter disregard of complaints from certain of our citizens. Once we vote money in this House, I do not think that that is the last say we should have in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would refer to the charges in different areas in the country.  The scale of charges was fixed years ago, one for Dublin, one for Cork, one for townships, small cities, large towns and rural areas.  That has been proven by statistics by people competent to prove it to be very harsh to Limerick and other places of that kind&mdash;I speak for Limerick as I know it best&mdash;with regard to the development of industry. Notwithstanding years of agitation and deputations to the board, they have utterly refused to give ear to those pleas.  They scarcely acknowledge them except to condescend to receive a deputation at some time.  We were promised a general overhaul of the charging system in the country. That was promised by the chairman of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then three or four deputations went to the board from my own part of the country but that promise has not materialised.  They happen to have <Col N="965" /> a monopoly of electricity.  They are doing a successful job.  People are becoming more electricity-minded. Electrification is proceeding throughout the rural areas.  I do not think the fact that they have a monopoly entitles the board to ignore reasonable claims for adjustment of charges if those claims can be substantiated.  I do not know what means we have of getting a sympathetic hearing except by comment in this House.  I hope the Minister will be able to have a word with the Electricity Supply Board on that subject because they are getting a bit out of hand, if I may say so.</P>
    <P>The latest development in Limerick is that in respect of housing schemes the board promised to put in the light if the corporation would erect the poles.  It is scarcely the function of such a board to ask the local authorities to erect the poles before they will supply the wires for the houses.</P>
    <P>The two items that I have mentioned illustrate the attitude taken by the board.  They are definitely causing great hardship to commercial, domestic and industrial users in the smaller cities and bigger towns throughout the country in comparison with what they are doing in Dublin.  There is one rate for Dublin, a higher rate for Cork and a still higher rate for Limerick.</P>
    <P>We used to think that, being situated beside the base of the power of the Shannon scheme, which means that there are no transmission losses, would be in our favour but we are told that the charge is based on consumption and that there is larger consumption in the bigger areas.  Now that the network is extended to the entire country and that it is a national scheme for which this national Parliament votes millions of money, something more than the mere commercial success of the undertaking should be considered.  A reasonable claim, which has been substantiated by figures and by accountants, ought to receive more reasonable consideration by the board than has been given so far.  Above all, the board ought not be allowed to ask <Col N="966" /> local authorities to do the job that they are appointed to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should assure Deputy Morrissey that the development of the investigation into milled peat has proceeded considerably beyond the point at which it was when he was in contact with it and that I think we now have the situation where all concerned are pulling together in the same direction.  I hope, therefore, that progress will be all the more rapid.</P>
      <P>With regard to Arigna, I do not know what investigations the Electricity Supply Board undertook but a station there is not in their present programme.  The suggestion was made to me by a deputation I met recently of coal producers and others from that area that there should be a power station there and, while I was interested in it, I saw various difficulties, although it did not occur to me that there might be difficulties of a technical character.  I am quite certain it is possible to have a power station utilising the local coal supplies and producing power economically, at some price for the coal.  In fact, the Electricity Supply Board is buying Arigna coal at the present time for power stations in Dublin.  The main difficulty I saw in that regard arose from the fact that the power station would be dependent upon regularity of supplies from a large number of private producers.  In the case of a turf station there is a turf bog adjacent to the station where a State organisation is producing turf for that station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that the Deputy is right there.  I think independent producers working on a small scale in the special circumstances <Col N="967" /> of Arigna will produce coal more economically than any large-scale organisation would be able to achieve. Personally, I have been surprised to learn, having regard to the high price of coal prevailing, that there was any difficulty in disposing of Arigna coal during the past year and the fact that there was difficulty suggests that there must be some technical reason relating to uniformity of quality or other things required by consumers.  I think, however, that ordinarily there should be in this country an industrial market for Arigna coal.  There certainly was before the war and there is no reason why there should not be one now.</P>
      <P>May I say, as regards the report that there are valuable iron ore deposits, that I believed that myself once and persuaded the Government 20 years ago to spend £30,000 investigating them? We got a report which suggested that, while there were undoubtedly small pockets of ore throughout the whole area, there was none large enough to justify commercial working.  I must try to get a copy of that report for the Deputy.</P>

    <P>With regard to Deputy Cogan's suggestion about surplus turf, I must express myself in complete disagreement. I am not thinking now of the Electricity Supply Board in that regard.  I think it would be fundamentally wrong to give any guarantee that all hand-won turf produced will be bought by somebody.  I am speaking now from very considerable experience of handling this problem of hand-won turf production.  I believe that if you give a guarantee that all turf produced will be bought by somebody, the interest of the producer to produce good turf and to save it properly will diminish. In fact what we say to the turf producer is:&ldquo;If you produce good quality <Col N="968" /> turf and sell it at a reasonable price you are certain to sell it, but we give you no guarantee that any turf you produce or anything you produce that you wish to describe as turf will be purchased.&rdquo;  I think that is the line on which to proceed, not merely in the interest of the community as a whole, but also in the interest of the private turf producers.</P>

      <P>I have, naturally, considerable sympathy with Deputy Flynn's point of view, while I could not at all agree with him that economic considerations must not be predominant with the Electricity Supply Board.  The price of electricity enters into every industrial process in the country and the board must be under obligation to make it available at the lowest practicable cost.  I think economic considerations are going to make the Electricity Supply Board go to the West of Ireland to a far greater extent than previously.  There is in the present programme a hydro-station in Donegal, two turf stations in Mayo and a hydro-station in West Cork and, as I mentioned, an intention to supplement the programme by a number of smaller hydro-stations, many of which will be in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a social problem to be solved in certain parts of Kerry and other parts of the West&mdash;and I think there is need, or there would be in certain circumstances, to provide a market for good quality hand won turf&mdash;in the solution of which the Electricity Supply Board could co-operate, then I think we should try to get their co-operation but we must not regard it as primarily an obligation on the <Col N="969" /> Electricity Supply Board to do that. It is an obligation on the Government, perhaps, to organise some such scheme and to ensure that the Electricity Supply Board plays its part in it.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that that idea which I mentioned on Second Reading will prove to be practicable.  If it is, it will be of benefit to the areas concerned but, honestly, I do not think it will contribute very much to the total output of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill has for its main object the granting to milk boards of the power to use their funds <Col N="971" /> to operate schemes designed to encourage increased production of milk in their areas.  The Act of 1936 empowers milk boards to use their funds, with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, to contribute towards schemes for the encouragement of increased utilisation of milk but not production. A typical scheme which was operated from time to time under the existing powers was the &ldquo;Drink More Milk&rdquo; campaign of the Dublin District Milk Board which aimed at stimulating increased consumption of milk.  In view of the difficulty of maintaining at all times of the year adequate supplies of milk in milk board areas, experience has shown that it is desirable that boards should be allowed to use their funds, with ministerial approval, to contribute to schemes to encourage increased milk production in milk board areas.  These schemes should include an artificial insemination service, milk recording, soil testing and veterinary facilities, but it would, of course, be open to boards, if they thought fit, to design other beneficial schemes.</P>
      <P>The most advantageous of these schemes would be that relating to artificial insemination.  It is intended that the two existing milk boards&mdash;at Dublin and Cork&mdash;will, on enactment of this Bill, establish sub-centres to two of the existing main artificial insemination stations, providing the necessary capital and running expenses.  Both of the main stations in question are run by the Department of Agriculture; one at Grange, County Meath, and one at Clonakilty Agricultural School, and the semen for insemination would be obtained from them.  An adequate artificial insemination service in the area of the Dublin Board would involve about four sub-centres to the existing main station at Grange, and in the Cork Board area one sub-centre to the station at Clonakilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin board already arrange, with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, a certain amount of service for producers by way of soil testing, silage demonstrations, etc., but such services cannot be put on a proper basis and fully developed without statutory authority.  The Bill will <Col N="972" /> enable the board to meet the cost of these and other such services out of its own funds and to expand or intensify them if the need arises.  It is also envisaged that the board may, in time, undertake the provision of milk recording and veterinary facilities for milk producers as a further contribution towards increased and more efficient methods of milk production.</P>
    <P>The funds of milk boards are derived solely from levies on sales of milk for liquid consumption in their sale areas and the utilisation of these funds for the purpose of stimulating milk production would undoubtedly be to the advantage of producer and consumer alike.</P>
    <P>While, as I already mentioned, the foregoing is the main purpose of the Bill, the opportunity is being taken of embodying in permanent legislation certain provisions already being operated for many years past by means of Emergency Powers Orders. One of these is the power of the Dublin District Milk Board to regulate the supply of creamery milk to Dublin so that such milk may be utilised to the best advantage over the year. Another such provision which is incorporated in the Bill is that under which creameries supplying milk to a milk board area are relieved of the obligation imposed by the main Act of entering into yearly contracts.  The quantity of milk required from creameries varies from time to time and it is, therefore, not practicable for creameries to make long-term contracts for such milk.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Bill to which attention might be called is that relating to highest grade milk.  Milk boards have already power to license the purchase by wholesalers and retailers of highest grade milk from producers who reside outside the area from which milk supplies can normally be drawn.  Such licences, however, can at present only relate to specific quantities of milk at specific periods and it is proposed to extend this power to enable licences to be granted without limitation as to quantity or period.  The purpose of this is to give certain producers of highest grade milk a measure of permanency of supply and, in the interests of public <Col N="973" /> health, to encourage them to continue and expand production of such milk.</P>
    <P>Another provision at present in Emergency Powers Orders which is being transferred to the Bill is the power of the Dublin District Milk Board to engage, with the Minister's consent, in the buying and selling of milk and the laying in of reserve stocks of condensed and dried milk.  The object of the provision is to enable milk boards to deal adequately with acute surpluses or shortages of milk.  Such powers are necessary from the point of view of both producer and consumer alike.  The Dublin Board has had these powers under Emergency Powers Orders since 1942 and has on many occasions in the past applied for and received the consent of the Minister to utilise the powers for specified periods and, in fact, as recently as last Thursday has written to me again for permission to utilise the powers.  The Cork District Milk Board passed unanimously a resolution in 1948 asking for similar powers and on 28th January last again wrote asking me to use my good offices towards ensuring priority in this House for all stages of this Bill in its present form, which, in the board's view, would enable the best handling of the Cork milk supply problem.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these direct requests from the two milk boards, it has been suggested that the provisions of the Bill to which I have just referred have either been completely misunderstood or deliberately misinterpreted in certain quarters.  Also, in the course of the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, this provision was opposed by some Senators who purported to represent the views of milk producers generally. It was alleged that the powers being given to the boards were much too wide and could be used by a board to combat, for example, a strike of milk producers.  As I have already mentioned, the Dublin Board has had these powers for the past ten years and the Cork Board asked for them four years ago.  Milk boards are democratically elected and the producers have the majority representation on them.  For this reason, it would be impossible for the powers in question to be used to <Col N="974" /> the detriment of producers.  In point of fact, the powers could be very much to their advantage in periods of surplus.  Furthermore, the necessity of having to obtain the Minister's consent provides a final safeguard against any action being taken which might react against the interests of milk producers generally.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the tribunal of inquiry into the milk supply for the Dublin sale district in the report which it furnished in 1945 recommended that the Dublin District Milk Board should have, in addition to the powers conferred on it by the Acts of 1936 and 1941, all the powers which were conferred by Emergency Powers (No. 247) Order, 1942, and such other powers as might be necessary to enable it to organise and direct effectively the production, distribution and sale of milk in its area.  I trust, therefore, that Deputies in approaching this Bill will have these facts in mind and will realise that it is fundamentally a non-controversial measure, requested by producers and sponsored by the previous Administration as well as the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister started off by saying that the main purpose of this Bill was to provide a means by which the funds of the board could be utilised for the betterment and encouragement of milk production. Those powers are contained in Section 3 and I do not think the Minister will find the slightest difficulty with anybody in the House in agreeing with him that that is so.  So far as that is the main purpose of the <Col N="975" /> Bill I think everybody on both sides of the House will be in entire agreement with the point of view put forward by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should have liked the Minister to give us some indication, apart from the matter of the artificial insemination sub-centres, how he hopes the board will utilise their funds and how he hopes the board will utilise this new power which they are going to get.  It is a power which is desirable and which we would all give gladly.  I am sure the Minister has some idea in his mind as to what is intended and I think it would assist the House if the Minister would give us an indication as to the mode of operation that is intended, apart from the setting up of artificial insemination centres.  So far as those centres are concerned, I think we all agree that they are entirely desirable and that the setting up of the existing main centres at Grange in Leinster and down in County Cork has proved a very considerable boon to the farmers who are in reach of them. These new sub-centres will mean that the number of milk producers who can take advantage of the facilities offered by these centres will be very greatly increased.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks &mdash;I presume, believing that attack is the best method of defence&mdash;launched out on an attack on those who had criticised Section 4 of the Bill.  There is a lot to be said for the fact that sometimes attack is the best method of defence&mdash;always provided that when you choose to attack you have your facts correct.  Since the Minister started to discuss this question of the powers that are given by Section 4, he has on more than one occasion stated that the Cork Milk Board asked for these powers.  I have no knowledge of the working of the Cork Milk Board and I do not propose in any way to enter into such a thorny question as to how they carry on their business in Cork.  That I leave to the Cork Deputies, who seem always to be able to tell us in no uncertain way how they do things down there.  I propose, however, to make a few statements on the Dublin Milk Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> On many occasions, the Minister has said that the producers have a majority on the Dublin Milk Board.  At present the Dublin Milk Board consists of 14 members.  The board is set up in pursuance of Section 8 of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936. Under that Act, the members of the board, and the proportion of the various interests from which the members of the board are drawn, are determined by Order of the Minister. There are 14 members at present&mdash; seven producer members and seven other members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Any consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No consumers.  It is news to me, if there are seven producer members out of 14, that that number is a majority of 14.  As a matter of fact, that is not the whole story.  There are seven producer members, three wholesale members and three retailer members, making 13, and there is a chairman who is appointed directly by the Minister.  Therefore, there are seven on each side.  But there is also a provision that the chairman has a casting vote.  Therefore, the position would appear to be, as I understand the position, that the seven on one side, with the assistance of the casting vote, can overrule the other seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, even apart from that, there is another aspect of the position which I do not think was put quite fairly by the Minister.  The present representation on the board is fixed by ministerial Order.  The Minister could overnight change that representation.  There was an occasion previously, as well as I remember, when the composition and the personnel of the board were changed in a rather sudden manner. That can be done by ministerial Order. What the Minister is asking here is, not to deal with the matter by Order. but to deal with the matter by legislation, and where the composition of a board is determined purely by Order and not by legislation, then I suggest to the Minister that to base his whole argument on the composition of a board is not a valid argument.  If the composition of the board was equally fixed by legislation and was in the proportions which the Minister has <Col N="977" /> suggested, then I could understand the validity of his argument that the producers need not bother about the matter at all because they had the majority.  The majority, if it exists&mdash;I understand it does not exist&mdash;is one that exists purely by an Order which could be changed in the morning and is not therefore a valid basis upon which to found the case put to us by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the sale of milk, we all agree that it is entirely necessary that the Dublin District Milk Board should have powers for the purpose of ensuring that they will be able to handle surplus milk.  In that circumstance, they must have the power contained in the section for the purpose of being able to cope with the flush period that regularly arises.  The objection which I have is an objection which I will argue in greater detail with the Minister when it comes to the Committee Stage.  That objection is that the powers which are being given to the board are powers to engage in general trading, not merely powers to engage in the ancillary business of disposing of surplus milk which would be required for the purpose of evening out the flow and ensuring that the production would be disposed of in a regular and proper manner.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of the purchase of milk by the board is concerned, that is a power which should be only utilised and should be only required in the inverse ratio to the surplus; in other words, where there is a shortage.  The way that the board should operate in regard to that should be by a temporary extension of the area to cover the shortage period.  As I read the section, and as I think everybody must read the words in the section, the board is being authorised to engage in the ordinary business of buying and selling milk.  It is entirely undesirable that the board should go into that business either in competition with the producers or in competition with the existing businesses.  The board could go into competition with the producers by switching milk from one area to another if it was felt that the producers in that area were charging too high a price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> I do not think that that is the function of the board; I do not think the board should be given power to do it. The board could go into competition in a very obvious way against existing retailers; and, again, I do not think that is the function of the board.  The function of the board, in so far as dealing in milk is concerned, if I may use that phrase&mdash;I think the Minister will understand what I mean&mdash;is to even out the shortage and the surplus.  If, as the Minister has indicated both in the other House and even here to-day, that is all he wants power to do, then that is all he should ask the House to give him power to do.  The section before us asks the House to give the Minister very much more power than that.</P>
    <P>There is another point in that section which I will mention now so that the Minister can have it considered by his advisers between this and the Committee Stage.  I am in some doubt as to whether the meaning of the section, as drafted, is that the Minister merely gives one consent and that that consent operates for all time.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is what the Minister intended.  The drafting of the section does not make it perfectly clear that the consent of the Minister is one that must be given <i>ad hoc</i> for the particular occasion, the particular place, and which can be revoked at a later date.  It seems to me that the section can be read, if the Bill passes in its existing form&mdash;I hope it will not be passed in its existing form, with all deference to the Cork Milk Board&mdash; that the board could then say to the Minister: &ldquo;We want to engage in the business of selling milk&rdquo; and, if the Minister says &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; thereafter the Minister has no power good, bad or indifferent, to determine that power to sell, to determine it in point of time, or in point of place, or in any way to qualify it at all.  I do not think that is what the Minister intended in drafting his Bill.  It is the way I read the section and I ask him to have it considered by the people who will ultimately have to be responsible for interpreting it, should it become necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the tribunal set up in 1945, as far as I remember. <Col N="979" /> They took evidence anyway in 1945 in the Dublin sales area and presented a report in 1946.  I noticed in the report of the Seanad debate that a learned Senator purported to give a quotation from the evidence of one of the witnesses before that tribunal. The witness who was quoted by the learned Senator gave evidence that was entirely and absolutely different from the quotation.  The quotation makes it appear that the gentleman in question, who was a member of the producers' organisation, wanted something in the nature of this Bill; but the quotation which was given by the Senator stopped at a most crucial point because, as reported in column 755, Volume 40, of the Seanad Debates, having set out certain preliminary remarks by the witness in question, the quotation given by the Senator finished up with:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board should be in the position of an active participant in the milk trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator used that as the basis of his argument that Section 4, as it was, was a sound section, but in the evidence that was given by Mr. Mullen, the producer's representative, he used the words given by the Senator.  These were followed immediately by:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not want it, however, to compete for the business of the existing interests...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is precisely because we feel that Section 4, as it is, does compete with existing producers and with existing business interests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;We do not want it, however, to compete for the business of the existing interests, but the necessity exists to provide a buffer between the producer of milk and his distributor. We think it would be better to make contracts with the board for the sale of our milk and they, in turn, to contract with the distributors. <Col N="980" /> This is desirable as it avoids the difficulty of having differences directly with the distributors of milk over matters such as shortages, sour milk, surplus, etc.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>From a report of the statement of evidence that was given before the tribunal on a date in April or May, 1945.  The evidence that was given before the tribunal at that time dealt specifically with shortages and surpluses.  I do not know whether the Minister has read the evidence or not, but if he reads it he will find that the evidence which was put up by the producers' association was divided into deliberate sections.  The chairman of the association dealt with one aspect, the vice-chairman with another, while a member dealt with a third aspect.  Finally, there was Mr. Mullen who, in dealing with the question of shortages and surpluses which had been made quite clear in the vice-chairman's evidence, said these were the two big problems with which the producers had to compete.  When giving his evidence before the tribunal, Mr. Meredith, the vice-chairman, made it abundantly clear that shortages and surpluses were two of the producers' difficulties. Equally, it was made quite clear from the board's angle that that was what they had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to turn up the memorandum which was put in by the milk board itself to that tribunal. On page 4 of that memorandum he will find there the statement that the new board, which the chairman of the milk board was then recommending, would be an organisation which would not sell milk retail but which would confine its operations solely to sales to traders.  There is no such restriction <Col N="981" /> as that, as far as I can see, in Section 4.  As I said initially, the power that is contained in Section 4 is infinitely wider than the power which I believe the Minister has really in his mind as being required.  But it is a common practice for every Government Department, and for the personnel in Government Departments when they are coming to this or to the other House, to look for power to do something which they have in their minds and which they want to do, to extend, as they come along here, that power to cover all the aspects that could conceivably arise, quite apart from the one which arose in their minds at a particular time.</P>
    <P>That is what has happened in this case.  The point, however, about it is this, that the Minister is trying to stand over that instead of making up his own mind as to what power is required to restrict the operation of the section to that required power.

    <P>I did not quite follow the Minister when he was talking about this Bill being requested by the boards.  I understood him to say&mdash;I am open to correction if I misheard him&mdash;that he had recently received a letter from the Cork Milk Board requiring the passage of the Bill at an early date in its existing form, and that he had received no representations to the contrary from the Dublin Milk Board.  If that was not what he said, am I to understand that the Dublin Milk Board is against the Bill?</P>

They are not, and we will renew that discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this Bill from the point of view of the supply of milk in Cork, and all the other Deputies from that area are concerned with it.  It is a well-known fact that a discussion on the supply of sour milk to the people of Cork in the summer months is a hardy annual here. I am disappointed that the consumers are not getting representation on the milk board, even if they were only to hold the balance of power which Deputy Sweetman says does not exist on the Dublin Board.  There is no doubt that a milk board should be responsible for the supply of good milk to the people who are paying for it. That should be the primary concern of such a board.</P>
      <P>It should be their responsibility to see that the milk is good and that the people to whom they give licences carry out their duties properly. Repeated resolutions have been sent to the Minister, to the milk board and other bodies with a view to improving the supply of milk in Cork, but without any success.  On the whole, the people of Cork are satisfied with the milk they are getting, but for three months of the year, the hot summer months, the milk is very often sour, with the result that people find themselves without milk for their breakfast and must have resort to other means of satisfying their needs in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be impossible for a board like the milk board to ensure that a twice daily delivery of milk will be provided for the people during these months.  We have tried to get that year after year and have got nowhere with the Cork milk producers. It is a common thing to see the once-a-day delivery of milk in Cork taking place at 2 o'clock in the day.  Here in Dublin where I stay, the milk is delivered before 7 o'clock in <Col N="985" /> the morning.  In Cork, the people sought to get pasteurised milk because there was no other means of getting fresh milk for their families and the corporation passed a resolution in favour of it which was forwarded to the Minister.  The county council refused to pass the resolution and as a big portion of the Cork Milk Board area is in the county, the corporation's resolution had no effect whatever, because nobody will set up a pasteurising plant to supply the people within the county borough alone.  It looks to me as if the people of Cork will have to be satisfied with sour milk every summer.</P>
    <P>The corporation asked for representation on the milk board and failed to get it.  The people who are paying for and consuming milk should have some voice in the matter, should have some say with regard to whether the service given by certain people is a good and suitable service and they should be entitled to tell the milk board that such and such a person should not get a licence.  That is the principal grievance in regard to the Cork milk supply and surely the Minister or anybody else will not tell me that it is an unreasonable request to ask that there should be some law to prevent the milk board from giving licences to people in the Cork Milk Board area who are not prepared to give a decent supply of milk to the people.</P>
    <P>I hope that due consideration will be given to the consumers in any revision of prices and that due consideration will be given to the fact that there are plenty of people anxious to supply milk to Cork who only get permits to do so during the winter period.  There are at least 50 or 60 who are asked to supply milk in the winter, but who are not allowed to supply it in the summer. The Minister should look into it very carefully, because milk is a very important form of food.  It is a form of food which can contain many unhealthy ingredients, if not properly looked after, and a form of food which should not be served in a sour condition. Even when it is supplied sweet, it surely should be able to remain in that condition until the next supply is available.</P>

      <P>I think it is a bad practice, but if my successor wants to shelter behind my person, I am quite prepared to protect him from his own supporters, in so far as that may be necessary. I do not think my recollection is at fault when I tell the House that this Bill was not drafted and approved by me for submission to the Government while I was in office, but I agree with the proposals in this Bill.  I think one is bound to ask oneself: What is the purpose of a milk board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the purpose of the milk board correctly, it is to secure in Cork or in Dublin that there will be an adequate supply of good milk for the citizens.  That is the primary duty.  If my recollection serves me aright, when I took over the Department of Agriculture that was the only duty that either milk board appeared to conceive itself as being charged with; and, apart from an annual representation to the Minister for the time being as to the maximum price, I think they engaged in very little other operations.  The Minister mentions that the powers contained in Section 4 are merely the statutory implementation of powers taken by Emergency Powers Order in 1942. Would the Minister tell the House what was the occasion of taking those powers in 1942?  Does the Minister know?  I think he does himself no service in trying to maintain the absurd pretence here that Section 4 does not provide the board and himself with efficient powers to maintain the milk supply in Cork or Dublin in the event of an attempt being made by the suppliers, the wholesalers or the retailers to hold up supplies from the city.  If my memory serves me aright, this question came under review in connection with the panic caused in Cork last Christmas when, strongly against my advice, preparations were made to establish municipal depots for <Col N="987" /> milk.  I think that was undertaken with unnecessary hullabaloo and, in fact, it proved ultimately quite unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 12 months last Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  However, the matters outstanding were settled amicably and the milk supply was maintained.  That is quite a while ago and I cannot remember the exact position.  I think the Department was then conscious of the fact that it might take certain measures in Cork to meet a certain emergency but that the legality of those measures could very easily be called into question.  I think the Department had in mind that some of the measures taken when a similar situation arose in Dublin had served a very useful purpose in maintaining the milk supply to the City of Dublin but that their legality was very doubtful.</P>
      <P>I wonder what was the date of the occasion when it became necessary to take emergency measures to maintain the Dublin milk supply, or was it the Cork milk supply on a previous occasion, when there were depots opened; and another occasion in a provincial area when it became necessary to set up milk depots, which were administered by the county manager.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us the dates on which these emergencies arose and the circumstances in which the Emergency Powers Order of 1942 to which he refers was made.  Having gone fully into that story, I would like to be present when he then assured the House that Section 4 had no purpose in view except to provide facilities wherewith to dispose of any temporary surplus milk or to fill any transitory shortage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Minister ashamed of coming before the House to equip himself with powers which every reasonable Deputy will agree that he ought to have if there is to be a milk board at all, and if it is to maintain the milk supply to the cities?  If he would have courage to get up and tell the truth and shame the devil he might find a considerable measure of agreement <Col N="988" /> if he would restrict the powers of the Bill to a situation where he certified, as a prior condition of using those powers, that he had good grounds for apprehending that the supply of either city was imperilled and that it was necessary in order to maintain it that the powers contained in Section 4 should be used so long as that danger continued.  I cannot see that it is at all likely that either milk board would wish permanently to engage in retail or wholesale distribution unless the existing machinery were used to starve either city out of milk.  Then, I think, they ought to have the powers to collaborate with those in authority to see that the children in this city or in Cork will not be starved of milk while some legitimate trade dispute is proceeding between suppliers and distributors or between distributors and the board.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that, if I were Minister for Agriculture, no body of suppliers in this country, no body of wholesalers or retailers, would hold me up to ransom by saying to me: &ldquo;If you do not toe the line, we will see that the children get no milk.&rdquo; I would not hesitate to take powers&mdash; and to insist on having them&mdash;to say: &ldquo;While I fully recognise the right of the suppliers and the wholesalers or retailers to bring whatever pressure they like to bear on me, so long as I pretend that there is a milk board in existence they will not bring pressure to bear on the children, the maintenance of whose health depends on an adequate supply of milk.&rdquo;  On reflection, I do not think any responsible Deputy would claim that right and from that follows, by conviction, that if the Minister were frank with the House and were prepared to confine the board's right to use these powers with his consent to circumstances in which he had certified that he had good grounds for apprehending the failure of the Dublin or Cork milk supply, undoubtedly certain Deputies in the House would not be so reluctant to pass the Bill with Section 4 amended as I suggested by the insertions therein.</P>
    <P>I had no consultation with Deputy Sweetman about this or his reaction to <Col N="989" /> the restriction which I propose, and I am not in a position to answer for his view.  I am merely stating my own view, and not anyone else's.  I will vote for Section 4 as amended, and put neither cap nor cloak on it that I think the Minister ought to have the power to use the machinery of the board to protect the population of either city from a milk famine precipitated from an ulterior motive.</P>
    <P>They should make no apology for seeking it.  Deputy McGrath seems to make a mystery out of the inability of the Department of Agriculture, when I was at the head of it, to get the milk supply from Cork City pasteurised.  I am a great believer in persuasion and patience and when I first asked the Cork milk suppliers to help me in getting the milk supply of Cork City pasteurised, I knew they were suspicious and that they felt there was something in this proposal which might reduce their margin of profit or involve them in some liability, the exact nature of which they could not discern.</P>
    <P>I thought the best way to go about that was to try gradually to persuade them that there was not a nigger in the woodpile, that everyone wished to protect their legitimate interests and, without creating any scandal, to ensure that certain grave defects in the Cork milk supply would be put right without anybody's feelings being hurt.  I laboured at that for two years. Deputy Lehane and Deputy Corry, by a series of manoevres and conspiracy, succeeded in trading on the fact that I was resolved to be patient and they managed to postpone the business until I went out of office.  I wish my successor better luck than I had.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Cork milk suppliers&mdash;I tried to cover it up for two years but I will cover it up no longer &mdash;in certain respects the position was a scandal.  I appealed to the Cork milk suppliers to help me to set right that scandal and not to take their profits at the expense of burying their neighbour's children.  I say that the man who definitely knows that tubercular milk is going into his neighbour's house which may fatally infect <Col N="990" /> his neighbour's child is worse than a man who commits murder in cold blood.</P>
    <P>I informed the Cork milk suppliers that there was no effective means whereby to prevent the distribution of tubercular milk except the pasteurisation of the entire Cork milk supply. Even though they were possessed of that knowledge, it is now nearly three years since the proposal to pasteurise the Cork milk supply was formulated and we are to-day as far away from pasteurisation there as we were three years ago.</P>
    <P>I want the House to know what the nature of the proposal was.  It was that if the Cork milk suppliers wanted to form a co-operative, they could pasteurise their own milk and use their own co-operative to distribute it wholesale to their retailers and to the consumers; or, if they did not feel equal to that responsibility, the Dairy Disposal Board would do it for them and they might rest assured that in no circumstances would they be put into the hands of one, two or three licensed pasteurisers with the knowledge that if they did not pass their milk through the hands of these gentlemen they could not sell milk in Cork at all.</P>
    <P>Finally, this proposal was made: &ldquo;It is fully understandable that you may be reluctant to embark upon such a large undertaking.  The Dairy Disposal Board will go to Cork, establish the pasteurising plant; they will build it, equip it and work it, on this understanding, that any day you like the Cork milk suppliers can form a co-operative society and walk away and purchase the pasteurising plant and organisation at the very penny that it cost the Dairy Disposal Board to establish it and operate it.  If you do not want to take it you need not, but if you feel the Dairy Disposal Board is not serving you well all you have to do is form a co-operative, raise the capital, and,&rdquo; I said to them, &ldquo;I will help you to get the capital and I guarantee to you that the Government will consent to a margin, not necessarily that will give you a profit on pasteurisation but that will ensure that the Cork milk suppliers will be at no loss from pasteurising their milk and they will continue <Col N="991" /> to enjoy the same margin of profit as they have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say the Cork Corporation, after some persuasion, passed a resolution in regard to pasteurisation, but the Cork County Council was persuaded not to pass it.  If I had been returned to office I would have come to Dáil Eireann to seek power to force the Cork County Council in this matter whether they wanted it or not. I was reluctant because I did not want to disclose facts which I did not think ought to be disclosed, but I challenge the Cork milk suppliers now to publish the tests that are in existence of some of the milk that was collected and tested in the Cork distribution area.</P>

      <P>I did all I could to try to get it done.  I think it would have been much better to get it done by consent and I think it would be much preferable to have the pasteurisation of the Cork milk supply done by a co-operative representing the producers, so that they would have the handling of their own milk, but if they will not do it, I think the Minister for Agriculture ought to get the powers, however radical, in order to get it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scandal that in this day and age milk should be sold to the people <Col N="992" /> of Cork City which constitutes a grave danger to the health of some of them and especially to the health of children.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill is the section which is particularly dear to my heart. I invited the Dublin Milk Board to undertake, not only the supervision of the milk supply on behalf of the citizens of Dublin but the expansion of the demand so that the producers would have better milk and, on the other side, I offered to assist the producer by providing expert advice on the production of milk more economically, to provide them with equipment on credit terms and finally to provide them with access to artificial insemination facilities which would bring within their reach bulls that cost up to 2,000 guineas at the Shorthorn auctions in Great Britain and Ireland.  The first reaction was that the Dublin milk producers wanted none of these things, that they kept fine herds, that artificial insemination did not matter a damn and that they did not want money wasted on it. They claimed that they knew blooming well how to produce milk without being told how and, generally, that any proposal of this character was an insolent intrusion into the autonomy of the people.  Deputies will not have any serious difficulty in guessing the source of these complimentary observations which were made at meetings of public bodies in every county comprised in the Dublin milk-supplying area.  However, despite the co-operative attitude of these public representatives, I am going to suggest to the Minister for Agriculture now that he should continue all the processes on which we embarked during the past three years, namely, artificial insemination, ensilage, pasture instruction and advice and the provision of equipment such as milking machines, milk coolers and the like on attractive credit terms for purchasers.</P>
    <P>I feel the time has now come when the Minister might, with perfect propriety, consider going a step further.  Nothing is more fundamental to the maintenance of the milk supply on tolerable terms for producer and consumer in this city than that it should be produced from cows who give a reasonable <Col N="993" /> yield.  When milk producers in the Dublin milk area found their industry on the 350-gallon cow, inevitably their need for an excessive price resultant on the inadequate yield of such cow will become an intolerable burden on city consumers.  I, therefore, suggest to the Minister that, when he charges himself to supervise the quality and the price of milk to be supplied to the city, he has a right in equity to say to licensed producers of milk for local consumption in the city: &ldquo;One of the conditions of having your cowhouses licensed for the production of milk for local consumption in Dublin and Cork will be that you join a cow testing society operated by your own milk board.&rdquo;  All the stringency attaching to the cow testing regulations laid down for grading up in the Department's register need not be necessary. Farmers can have that if they want it. Should they find it burdensome, however, a simpler cow testing system could be introduced, based on the monthly test for the purpose solely of establishing the milk yield of each supplier's individual cow.  In this way a farmer would know that he had a number of uneconomic cows of which he should dispose so as to replace them with animals which would give an adequate yield for the food given them.</P>
    <P>I know what the reaction of some Deputies in the House will be.  They will say, first of all: &ldquo;Does not the farmer know what milk his own cow is giving?&rdquo;  The answer is that he does not, and it has been established in Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and in this country that there is not a farmer living who knows the yield of his own cow unless he belongs to a cow testing society, and takes the trouble to find out.  The farmer himself is frequently the most surprised man in the parish when he gets the return of his own herd.</P>
    <P>The second objection that will be raised is this: &ldquo;If the farmer does find that he has two uneconomic cows in the paddock, what can he do about it? If he goes out and buys two more, they may be worse.&rdquo; The answer is that they may be worse. I ventured to meet that objection in the parish of Bansha. We examined every cow in that parish and indicated to every <Col N="994" /> farmer there that he had certain uneconomic cows, and that if he wanted to get rid of them we would give him £40 apiece for them or else a three-year-old heifer in calf to a 2,000-guinea bull. Owing to the exceptional craze at the present time for boned, rolled, frozen, boxed beef in the United States of America, I feel that circumstances are such that, without any cost on the producer or on the consumer, a scheme could be operated from Grange to facilitate milk suppliers in the Dublin area, and from Clonakilty, to facilitate milk suppliers in the Cork area, for the killing off of uneconomic cows and for the processing of the beef. Surely if the board is in a position to come to the suppliers and say: &ldquo;Look, at the end of lactation&mdash; and no one is going to compel you, you can see for yourself&mdash;if you have any uneconomic cows in the byre&mdash;that is, cows giving less than 500 gallons apiece&mdash;you can write to the milk board and say: &lsquo;Give me £40 apiece for them or else a three-year-old heifer in calf to a 2,000-guinea bull.&rsquo;&rdquo; No farmer to whom that offer was made would have any reason to complain. The milk board could buy the uneconomic beasts, slaughter them and ship the meat to the United States as prime manufactured beef and get a price for that beef through the canneries. The canneries might be reasonably required to collaborate in such a scheme which would enable the Minister or the board to operate the plan&mdash;preferably the Minister&mdash;without costing anybody a one-penny piece.</P>
    <P>I know it sounds queer that in this day and generation the story of Aladdin should be re-told and we should be able to go into every parish and offer new lamps for old without any charge on the Exchequer, without any charge on the consumer, and without any charge on the producer. But circumstances are such  the present time that it is possible to do that.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to consider providing that facility in these two areas as one of the services envisaged under Section 3. Given that he is prepared to offer that amenity I think he has a duty to say to the suppliers: &ldquo;A <Col N="995" /> condition of your cows being licensed for the production of milk will be that you are also registered as a member of your own cow testing society and when the yield of your cows has been established there will be no other liability; the only claim made upon you will be that you will at least comply with that one monthly weighing which will fix you with notice of a pretty good approximation of the true milk yield of all the cows you own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will vote for this Bill, but I think in the Minister's own interest he should discard the pretence that he does not foresee the possibility of Section 4 having to be used in certain circumstances and he should tell the House frankly now that he intends to use it in defence of children should that necessity arise while conciliation and negotiation are in process of resolving any dispute which has interrupted the city milk supply.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will indicate in his concluding observations that he will propose an amendment in that sense restricting the user of that power conferred upon him here and the board to a time when he, the Minister, being the absolute judge, certifies that he is satisfied that the milk supply of the city is about to be put in danger, I cannot conceive of any rational person objecting to that. Though I have not very much sympathy with it I can foresee wholesalers who have large capital investments in big premises organised for the wholesale distribution of milk and conceivably, too, producers whose suspicions and anxieties can be played upon, will have some kind of ground for apprehension that the chairman of the milk board will set up depots and try to short circuit them. I had exactly the same experience when I tried to monopolise the market for the inshore fishermen. The people for whom the market was being orgainsed suspected they were being had. There is no use getting hot under the collar and saying that something is unreasonable and that we must act reasonably. Nobody is reasonable in this world. If everybody was reasonable this world would be a close approximation to paradise. It is <Col N="996" /> because everybody is unreasonable in his own particular bailiewick that we live in a vale of tears and experience sorrow and woe. Therefore, I never get cross when people are unreasonable, and I think one will often bring them to reason in moderation by saying to them: &ldquo;I think your apprehensions are fantastic but if it is possible for me to meet you without destroying the essential elements in my Bill I will meet you.&rdquo; That course of conduct very often brings a man to a realisation of the fact that he has been acting-up, and he will be the first to turn round and give you a hand to settle whatever problems are outstanding.</P>
    <P>If I am correct in my diagnosis of the situation I invite the Minister to say when concluding that he will restrict his power. If he prefers it I will very gladly put down an amendment proposing such a restriction, and I will withdraw that amendment in favour of one proposed by the Minister giving effect to the same consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>For a long time we have been trying to get a clean milk supply for Cork City. Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, went a long way towards achieving that. Every encouragement was given to the milk suppliers in Cork City to supply clean milk. Every case that could be made was made against pasteurisation. It was said that we could get a clean supply by having a number of producers who would give us good clean milk.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the report of our medical officer of health in relation to our milk supply in Cork City I do not intend to give any figures or describe the condition of the milk supply. Deputy Allen said we could get clean milk through our health services. Our medical officer of health has been doing his part for a number of years to get a clean milk supply. Evidently there is no way of getting that except by pasteurisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, Deputy Dillon knows, and some of the milk suppliers know that there was a group of men anxious to take over the job. These men were prepared to do it because they would make a profit out of it. Deputy Dillon, <Col N="997" /> as Minister for Agriculture at the time, suggested to the milk suppliers that they should start a co-operative society as producers and do the work themselves. He gave them every encouragement in regard to capital. When that was done the question arose as to where one would go to get £150,000 to start this pasteurising plant. It was asked would the municipal authority take it over. We still have a bad milk supply in Cork City. Deputy McGrath spoke about the conditions in the summer months. The same state of affairs will arise in the coming summer. I suggest the present Minister should go on from where the last Minister left off and ensure that the Cork people get a clean milk supply.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the personnel of the Milk Board for Cork City but for a number of years some of us have been advocating representation for the consumers on that board. I was a member of the corporation for a number of years and I advocated, with some others, that the corporation should have a direct representative on that board.</P>
    <P>The corporation are a body elected by the votes of the citizens of Cork, and is it too much to ask that the citizens of Cork who are consumers&mdash; 85,000 of them both from the city and suburbs&mdash;should have a member on that board representing them? I hope that the Minister will not take dictation from any other source. I hope that he will do the right thing by the people and give the consumers a representative on that board. I think enough has been said on the subject. All the files relating to what took place during that period are in the Minister's office. From inquiries made during the past fortnight, I know that every effort is being made to delay the project of the pasteurisation of the milk supply to Cork City. I heard that certain developments were going to take place in a town not far from Cork. I made inquiries and I was told that we would not have pasteurisation of the milk for a long time because you had people who were too much taken up with their own interests.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to use the powers he holds at the moment to <Col N="998" /> give the citizens of Cork a clean milk supply, which they have not got for a long time. Deputy Dillon knows about the position in relation to the supply of milk for the City of Cork. It would alarm anybody. I would appeal to the Minister not to take dictation from vested interests or from myself, as representing certain interests, and to see for himself that the consumers are entitled to have a representative on the milk board in the Cork area.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that there is no compulsory milk pasteurisation for Dublin City which has a far larger population than Cork and which is a city to which a considerable quantity of Cork milk is sent.

About <Col N="999" /> three and a half years ago Deputy Dillon got a lecture on milk costings taken in Cork by Professor Murphy. He found that the average production of those local T.B. cows kept by the farmers who were producing and sending milk into Cork City was from 565 to 650 gallons per cow. Those are the T.B. cows! Those are the dirty cows kept by the dirty farmers of Cork!</P>

      <P>Cork Corporation&mdash;and indeed every corporation&mdash;have the power and frequently make use of it to deal with any producer sending dirty or tubercular milk into a city. That power is there. There are, I think, in Cork City something between 15 and 25 officials looking after the milk of Cork to see that milk is clean. That is their job. Nobody is going to persuade me that pasteurisation will make dirty milk clean. It will not. That has been proved everywhere else in the world, except where manoeuvres were on behind the scenes to help a bunch of gentlemen in Cork to get rich quickly. That is what is behind the pasteurisation manoeuvre from start to finish.</P>

We hear all about the dirty, bad and sour milk that is being supplied.</P>
      <P>A pretty considerable number of the farmers supplying Cork City have gone to the expense, within the past couple of years, of putting in special plant for cooling the milk&mdash;plant costing anything from £150 to £350. That plant has been installed by those farmers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not a notion of it. The Minister was quite correct when he stated that the Cork Milk Board looked for this Bill in 1948. I do not know whether the file with that application in it shows the purpose for which it was looked for, that is, in order to increase the production of milk for Cork City by the purchase of Friesian bulls so as to get rid of the departmental policy which has been carried on for the past 30 years and which has transformed a fairly decent milch cow giving three or four gallons a day into a one-and-a-half-gallon animal.</P>
      <P>The Cork Milk Board looked for the right to use the funds given to them by the farmers supplying milk to Cork city for the purpose of getting Friesian bulls so as to increase the milk yield and in order to endeavour to set back in some way the mad progress of the Department of Agriculture in their advocacy of beef. That was the first purpose for which we wanted an opportunity to use this money : to buy what Deputy Dillon described in this House as a &ldquo;Pekingese&rdquo; bull. It is all very well for people to talk about cow-testing and all the rest of the paraphernalia attached to it, yet those people who talk about improving milk yield see the Irish taxpayers' money paid in premiums on Herefords, premiums on Pol Angus and premiums on an animal, a kind of mongrel, called the dairy shorthorn. At the same time those people refuse to give assistance&mdash; they retard them as well as they can and put all the obstacles possible in their way&mdash;to farmers who endeavour to build up herds with a milk yield. That is what is wrong. That is the reason why the Cork Milk Board decided in their wisdom to look for the powers contained in this Bill, and I am sure they will make good use of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 4 that all the noise is about, I suggest that we, in Cork, are a practical, commonsense body of men. Section 4 is practically in full operation in Cork for a number of years with the difference that it is not operated by the Milk Board. Through the good offices of the dairy science section of University College, Cork, the surplus milk in Cork is <Col N="1003" /> pooled at the university and redistributed. That gets rid of the rather nasty position where you had a man rushing along with three or four gallons in the bottom of a churn, running into a laneway and tossing it upside down into the churn of another man who happened to be short.</P>
    <P>The farmer who has surplus milk going into Cork to-day will deliver it to the Cork University, and it is there given out to the distributors who are in short supply. So that Section 4, to all intents and purposes, is at present being operated successfully in Cork.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dillon speaking about the furore that there was in Cork last Christmas twelve months owing to there being some idea of a milk strike and the establishment of milk depôts. He said he disagreed with them. If the Minister disagreed with them, there were two officials of the Minister's Department who called on the Cork City Manager and the Cork City Manager had to inform the gentlemen that were sent down, very much against the will of the Minister, as he said&mdash; I do not know who sent them down if he did not&mdash;that his officials were not going to be used as strike-breakers.</P>

      <P>The gentleman who disagreed completely with all this furore, as he described it, was the gentleman who sent down two men to form milk depôts and to get ready to smash the farmers. That kind of humbug is all very well. I notice that at first Deputy Dillon claimed to own the Bill, that is was brought in by himself. Apparently, Deputy Dillon is anxious to claim the good patches in it and to let who likes claim the bad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as giving us in Cork an opportunity to improve our herds, to improve the yield of our cows and giving us a better chance to produce good, clean and cheap milk for the citizens of Cork. There is contained in the Bill an opportunity for doing that.</P>
      <P>We hear about the powers of the milk board but I would like to say one thing about it. While Deputy Dillon was monarch of all he surveyed, the milk board sent about seven or eight unanimous decisions on price which were all very faithfully ignored and turned down. The profits on which the farmers were going to do a lot of things had completely disappeared about the middle of 1948 and were turned into a loss during 1949, 1950 and part of 1951. As a matter of fact, suppliers of milk in Cork City are still producing milk at a loss. That is the position.</P>
      <P>When one speaks of cow testing, one must have regard to one aspect that applies to farmers who supply milk to Cork City. As any farmer knows, there is a plentiful period and a scarce period in the matter of milk production. About the middle of September, the farmer who has contracted to supply a definite quantity of milk to the city every day has either to have his cows coming in calf or to go down to the nearest auction yard and purchase cows. The majority of the cows that are brought there for sale are bought from people who produce cattle mainly for beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate farmer is compelled to purchase a cow there that would give him a milk yield such as was very noticeable during the period of <Col N="1005" /> office of the former Minister, namely, one and a half gallons a day. That is the difficulty that these farmers are faced with and these are the obstacles against which we have to endeavour to supply the citizens of Cork with milk. There should be no difficulty whatever in the people of Cork City getting a decent supply of clean milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting it or, if they are not getting it, there is a bunch of officials paid by the Cork Corporation who are not doing their duty and it should be the duty of the members of the corporation here to see that they do it. If they do that, there will be less noise about dirty milk in Cork. You cannot expect a farmer who has spent from £300 to £400 in putting in milking machines, cooling plant and everything else necessary to supply clean milk to Cork, to travel twice a day in summer into the city in order that he may be seen knocking at the housekeeper's door. If he has gone to the expense of providing machinery which enables him to produce milk that will remain sweet for two days, if treated properly when it is received, there should be no necessity to do that. That is the difficulty you are up against.</P>
      <P>I take it that there is a Health Act in force in Cork City and under that Act corporation officials have power to deal with tubercular milk or dirty milk that is not in good condition when it is being delivered. That power is in existence and has been in existence always. Therefore, I cannot understand this wild drive on the part of a former Minister for Agriculture and his few supporters in different places in this House for pasteurised milk for Cork City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister got the bright idea, very early in his infant stages as Minister, that it would be a great thing to try it on the dog, so instead of introducing enforced pasteurisation for Dublin City, he decided to introduce it for Cork. As I have already <Col N="1006" /> stated, there is more milk from County Cork coming up here to supply Dublin City to-day than there is going into Cork City itself, more non-pasteurised milk, so that if there is something specially contaminating about Cork milk, surely it should have its ill-effects on the citizens of Dublin. It does not seem to have had that effect. I am sorry for having taken up the time of the House for such a lengthy period, but in view of the statements that were made here, and in view of the fact that the passage of this Bill was used to make an unprovoked attack on the hard-working suppliers of milk to Cork City, I considered I had a duty to perform in putting an end to the vendetta started by the late Minister for Agriculture in revenge for things which happened 50 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the object of this Bill is to provide for the better utilisation of the funds available to the milk boards. In so far as that is the general principle of the Bill, I think all Deputies will accept it. It is, however, true that in the Dublin milk supply area particularly, there is a feeling of misgiving amongst producers generally in regard to the effect of the Bill. I think the Dublin District Milk Producers' Association have expressed that misgiving on various occasions and will continue to do so. They are not opposed to the general principle of the Bill, but they do fear that some abuse might be made of the powers conferred under Section 4.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has met the Dublin Milk Producers' Association to discuss this Bill with them. If he has not done so, would he have any objection in meeting them before the Committee Stage of the Bill is reached? Like Deputy Dillon I am altogether in favour of patience, forbearance and conciliation in dealing with matters of this kind. I think that the Minister will find that the Dublin Milk Suppliers' Association is a body of very reasonable men and that, if he discusses this matter with them, he will have no difficulty whatever in reaching agreement in regard to the exact wording of Section 4 or in regard to any safeguards which they might consider necessary to prevent abuse of the powers in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> It has been asked what possibility is there of the Dublin District Milk Board abusing its powers. It has been said that the majority of the members of the board are milk producers. In actual fact, the majority of the members of the board are not milk producers but, even if they were, there is the difficulty that the Dublin Milk Board, on which the producers have considerable representation, meets probably only once a month but the chairman sits every day. There are many things that a chairman, who is a permanent paid official, can do in the course of a month or from month to month which it is always very difficult to supervise. Those of us who are members of local authorities know the considerable powers exercised by county managers in between meetings of county councils, apart altogether from the reserved functions which they enjoy. The Minister may, or may not, be aware that at present the relations between the Dublin milk producers and the chairman of the milk board are slightly strained. It is only natural in those circumstances that people who are engaged in the production of milk should feel very uneasy when they see additional powers being put into the hands of an official in whom they have not, to put it mildly, complete confidence.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this particular section which deserve close attention. It is agreed, and I think will be agreed, that the milk producers are a trade association. As such they have the right to negotiate in regard to the price of milk and in arranging terms and conditions with the wholesalers and others with whom they have to deal. As a trade association they have the right to withhold supplies in default of agreement. As a trade association they are very anxious to protect their rights. No labour union would like to see its powers in regard to strike action curbed or restricted in any way and I do not think any trade association dealing with milk producers' rights, and anxious for the protection of these rights, would like to see any curb put on their powers of negotiation or their power to secure a fair price for their produce. In these <Col N="1008" /> circumstances it is only natural that a Bill of this kind should arouse a certain amount of suspicion in the minds of producers.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that if the Minister, who is a reasonable and approachable man, were to meet the producers in open conference he would be able to reach agreement with them, not only in regard to the general principles of the Bill, which are accepted, but also in regard to the details. I think it very desirable that such a conference between the Minister and the producers should be held before this House is asked to deal with the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one matter, I think, in regard to which there is a certain amount of misgiving. It is acknowledged that there are certain funds in the hands of the Dublin District Board. These funds are derived from a small levy on each gallon supplied. I understand that there is power under existing legislation to increase that levy. In that way it might be possible for the Milk Board to build up a very substantial fund and to use that fund in a way which might be detrimental to the interests of the producers. I hope that the Minister will deal with this matter when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if agreement is reached in regard to Section 4, and that if the misgivings of the producers are removed, there will be no difficulty in getting a speedy assent to this stage of the Bill. Certainly the Bill has many good points. I understand that there has been a persistent demand in Cork for the passing of this Bill. It is desirable from every point of view that funds which have accumulated in the hands of the milk board should be used to provide cleaner and better milk, and more efficient production and distribution.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to provide for the extension of artificial insemination centres and subcentres, and I think there is general agreement that that is desirable. Perhaps I am an optimist, but I have always been inclined to believe that there is a great hope for future development in the dairying industry, and I feel that through artificial insemination <Col N="1009" /> some of the difficulties which have hitherto been encountered in grading-up the milk yields of cows will be overcome. Certainly it will ensure that both the small and the medium-sized farmer in the milk-supplying areas will have available to them for their stock the services of the best bred and most expensive bulls that are to be had. Over the years that should improve the milk strains of cows in this State, and particularly in the milk supply areas covered by this Bill. In the same way, I think the Bill should be used to eliminate uneconomic and low-yielding cows.</P>
    <P>I am in complete agreement with Deputy Dillon when he suggested universal cow-testing in the milk-supplying areas. It is absolutely essential, and the machinery to eliminate all low-yielding cows should be put into operation as quickly as possible. That is a step which is overdue, and it is one which the milk board can help to bring about.</P>
    <P>The milk board provides a service in regard to soil-testing. I have often wondered whether or not there is overlapping in a service of this kind. We already have provision for soil-testing through our local agricultural instructors. I have often wondered whether it would not be better to ensure that these officers would concentrate on that purpose, instead of running the risk of overlapping by the provision of that service by other bodies to farmers.</P>
    <P>I am all for raising the milk yield&mdash; and, of course, raising the milk yield means lowering the costs of production. Anybody who has the interests not only of the farmer but also of the consumer at heart, is anxious to see the costs of production lowered, because that would be beneficial both to the farmer and to the consumer.</P>
    <P>There ought to be no question whatever in the minds of Deputies in regard to the matter of cleanliness. Everybody who supplies milk for human consumption must make up his mind that absolute cleanliness must be a condition of his continuing to supply milk. It should be a rigid condition of registration as a milk supplier that the farmer who is supplying accepts without question any <Col N="1010" /> inspection or any tests that may be required in order to ensure that the milk is absolutely clean.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Milk Board, through the funds which they possess and the powers which may be provided under this Bill, should undertake the elimination of disease, and particularly of tuberculosis. I may be wrong, but I believe that bovine tuberculosis is much more prevalent than most people realise and that, perhaps, to some extent, it is more dangerous than the ordinary lay person accepts. The building up of tuberculin-tested herds should be one of the functions to be sought and achieved under the powers provided by this Bill. I realise that that is not an ideal that can quickly be achieved, but it is an ideal which should be striven for. In this connection, I have often wondered why such a healthy breed of cattle as the Kerry breed is not more popular. I think that that breed got rather a bad name as a beef breed or as a breed for store cattle purposes, but I do not think that it deserves that bad name. I think that, in the poorer districts of the country, and particularly in mountainous districts, it is a breed which gives good results, and I have heard of very satisfactory results which were obtained from that particular breed.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister that assurances given by him during the passage of this Bill through the House are hardly sufficient to allay the misgivings of the producers. I think that any assurance he may wish to give to the producers, to the effect that the powers contained in this Bill will not be used against them, should be incorporated in the Bill. We had an unhappy experience a few years ago in connection with the Irish News Agency Bill which was passed by the Oireachtas. Under that Act very far-reaching powers were conferred on an independent body.</P>
    <P>The Minister promoting the Bill gave the most solemn assurance to the House that these powers would not be used to enable that board to compete with those at present engaged in the newspaper business. Yet, when the Bill became law and that board was <Col N="1011" /> set up, the board calmly ignored the assurance given by the Minister and proceeded to act on the powers conferred on it under the Bill. There is just the same danger in regard to this Bill. The Minister may have the best intentions in the world, but there is always a danger that the powers which he is conferring on the milk board may be abused to a certain extent and he should take all the steps necessary to safeguard the producers' interests in that respect.</P>
    <P>As I said, the producers, particularly in the Dublin district supply area, are a reasonable body of men. They are a body of progressive and intelligent farmers and they are prepared to give the board all the powers that are necessary to improve the milk supply for the area. They are not, however, prepared to give the board any powers which are not required for that purpose and which might be used against the milk producers in the case of any trade disagreement. I, therefore, ask the Minister to meet the Dublin Milk Producers' Association in a friendly way and I am satisfied that, after a friendly exchange of views, agreement can be reached in regard to the details of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill except to ask a few questions concerning the health side of it. From my own experience during the recent years, I must confess that I received a considerable degree of co-operation from the former Minister for Agriculture in regard to the provision of a good milk supply for the people generally. There was invariably, however&mdash;I presume there is still&mdash;a rivalry between the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture in regard to the provision of a milk supply. In the Health Department, we were concerned with providing a safe supply. In the Department of Agriculture, they were particularly concerned with the production, as it says in Section 3, of an increased milk supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is perfectly natural and understandable. I should like to know to what extent this safe milk aspect has been protected in the Bill&mdash;I presume <Col N="1012" /> it has gone around the Department in the ordinary way&mdash;and to what extent the Department of Health's recommendations have been considered and incorporated or provided for. Possibly under Section 5 it may be protected by the reference to the purchase of the highest grade milk, etc., which may mean that any milk bought by this board will be of a particular standard.</P>
    <P>One must bear in mind that you may get the attitude of mind shown by Deputy Corry in which he dismisses the necessity for the pasteurisation of milk and suggests that the acquisition of coolers, etc., would be sufficient to protect milk against carrying dangerous diseases such as bovine tuberculosis. That aspect from the health point of view must be emphasised and we should aim at trying to provide a safe milk supply, an aspect which might be overlooked by the farmers, naturally would be overlooked by the farmers, because their main concern is to provide sufficient milk to meet the demands.</P>
    <P>I should like to know to what extent the health aspect has been protected. It might be of interest to Deputy Corry, who always has been a very militant guardian of the ratepayers' interests in the Dáil&mdash;as long as I have been here I have admired his conscientious care of these matters&mdash;to know that a lot of the ratepayers' money goes to the maintenance of institutions and sanatoria in which many children suffering from tuberculosis are cared for at the ratepayers' expense. It might appeal to the ratepayers that in this way they could reduce the incidence of this disease by its prevention and thus reduce the expense which they are at present bearing.</P>
    <P>The best illustration of that is in Norway where, instead of pasteurising the milk, they adopted the expedient, suggested, I think, by Deputy Dillon, of carrying out a tuberculin test of their cattle and slaughtering those which were positive. The result of that policy has been that tremendous strides have been made there towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. In that way, although considerable expense was involved during the carrying <Col N="1013" /> out of that policy, they are now reaping considerable dividends owing to the reduced incidence of bovine tuberculosis and the shutting down of many of their tuberculosis institutions.</P>
    <P>I should like to know in that regard whether any consideration has been given to that aspect of the problem, the provision of a safe milk supply by farmers; whether any encouragement is being given to them to see that pasteurised milk is made available in the urban areas and, ultimately, in the country areas as well. The fact that milk remains sweet for two days, as Deputy Corry suggested, has nothing to do with the question of whether the milk carries these dangerous bacilli. Consequently, it is important that that idea should be eradicated from the minds of those who might become members of this board and who might have that completely erroneous idea. A sweet milk supply, or a pleasant-tasting milk supply, could easily be a very dangerous milk supply. My approach to this is purely from the health point of view. I think there should not be anything but encouragement given to a Bill which might increase the quantity of milk made available to cities and towns as long as it can be assured at the same time that that increased quantity will be a safe increased quantity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as legislation is designed to improve the quality of a vital human food and give an adequate supply, it should be supported and approved. This Bill is designed for that purpose and, consequently, the House should give its approval to it. I am not impressed by the statement that this legislation is being pushed ahead mainly at the request of the Cork Milk Board or any other such body, rather than as a Bill designed for the citizens as a whole. Perhaps their interests will fit into the general scheme subsequently. Legislation is being asked for by a board without consumers' representatives. However, in any criticism we make we must ensure that we shall guard against damaging a vital industry by wild or unwarranted and exaggerated statements and that our approach to <Col N="1014" /> it shall be in a sensible, measured way. In regard to this particular Bill we have heard about things which are not in the Bill, things which are being read into it. We had references to the possibilities of the various sections, particularly Section 4, and of its implementation when the Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>Now, reference has been made to certain difficulties that have arisen from time to time. We had the question of a threatened milk strike in Cork over a year ago. Reference was made here to certain measures which were being taken, and my name was mentioned in that regard. At a very critical time during that threatened strike, it is true to say that departmental inspectors came to Cork and called to the City Hall. They went to the city manager. When it came to my ears, I said that my approach to the matter at that critical stage was an entirely different one, and that I thought anything of that type would only fray tempers and aggravate the position. That night, instead of starting out to establish milk depots, I arranged a meeting with the retailers and producers, and, following that, I came to the Department in Dublin, where the matter was fixed up without any more ado, and without any setting up of depots or anything of that kind. I did that because I am one of those who believe that, instead of allowing a position to continue where strike action is threatened, if these things are handled in time and handled by consulting both parties, it is much easier to fix them up than to wait until the situation has developed into a breach when they would not be easily fixed up again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, there has been a good deal of talk about the milk supply to Cork. Apart from the very warm summer we had one and a half years ago, complaints, even though there may be some, are not very general. Take the month of May in that particular year. Undoubtedly, in any city, you will have people going out early to work. They want a good supply of milk. They want it also, of <Col N="1015" /> course, for their children, and it is a matter of considering how that supply is going to be got. In the first place, we want clean milk. Pasteurisation will not cure that. It will not remove dirt from milk. Deputy Dr. Browne has spoken of safe milk. Pasteurisation is the best remedy, apart from selecting cows free from tuberculosis, that can be applied to that. It is the best remedy, but it is not a perfect one. I have read in reputable journals of tests which were carried out both in the United States and in Scotland, and the results proved that certain important vitamins are removed from the milk through pasteurisation, vitamins which are beneficial in cases of ulceration and complaints of that kind. Therefore, they had to provide certain medicines to supply that deficiency subsequently.</P>
      <P>Medical men in general feel that, in this country, the only way to provide safe milk for children, when we have not tuberculin-free herds, is to have the milk pasteurised. A certain amount of the milk supplied to Cork is pasteurised. We see from time to time orders made by the city manager giving licences to certain people in the city to buy pasteurised milk. It is there for people to buy in the ordinary way if they look for it. But even the medical officer of health himself has said that if he could get good clean milk he would prefer it to the pasteurised milk&mdash;that it is the milk he would use. Here in Dublin we also have pasteurised milk on the market. We have perhaps some high-grade milk, grade A milk, which is from tuberculin-free cows. It is on the market and the people have a choice in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why one particular city should be picked out. If this is considered good national policy, then it should apply generally to all cities, because the people in Limerick, Waterford, Drogheda, Donegal, Galway and Sligo are just as important to the nation as the people of Cork. Why not make general a policy if it is considered good policy? That is why I criticised at the start the suggestion that we are pushing this through evidently at the behest of the Milk Board in Cork, <Col N="1016" /> which has no representative on it from the Housewives' Association, formed there recently in connection with prices, or of anybody who may be particularly interested in the consumption of milk in the homes, rather than in the retailing of milk.</P>
    <P>During that particular month, when there were so many complaints, a conference was called and, as Deputy Hickey has stated, all points of view were put forward there. It was proved, through certain experiences that pasteurisation itself was not a complete remedy. The suggestion was made by Deputy Hickey, as a result of places he had visited, that instead of putting up one complete plant, a plant would be put up to deal with, say, 5,000-gallon quantities, so that if something went wrong in one particular section, if there were some defect, it would not apply generally but would be confined to that particular unit. All these matters were gone into. The question was discussed from all angles. The suggestion was then made that the city health officers would be invited to visit the dairies in the contiguous area because there was no permanent health inspector there.</P>
    <P>It was entirely beyond the power of the temporary man who was there to visit the dairies and cowsheds with any kind of regularity. That was refused. The university authorities found that even pasteurisation did not get rid of, I will not say, impurities&mdash; dirt, of course, is, I presume, an impurity in itself&mdash;and they had to go out to the particular farms. Their plant was able to show that there was something defective which had come in from the various farms. They visited places and helped to get in coolers and there was undoubtedly an improvement. The county council then appointed a permanent health officer. The corporation appointed another, but, of course, he will have to look after the various other health services in the city as well as the milk supply.</P>
    <P>As far as this measure is concerned it does not provide for pasteurisation. It provides for certain other matters and gives the milk board much more power than it previously had. Whether <Col N="1017" /> that power is going to be used generally, or is there just to meet an emergency situation, is a matter on which everybody will have his own opinion. At any rate, it will be there in permanent legislation and it can be applied just as the authority for the time being wishes to use it. However, I think that, in general, there is nothing very objectionable in the Bill, and, apart from the points which I have raised because reference was made to me, I do not think there is anything more that I need refer to at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the discussion which has taken place on this Bill, I hope to make my contribution as short as possible. I will pass over the approach made by Deputy Corry. I think everyone in the House will agree that I should do that.</P>
      <P>If we ignored Deputy Corry's approach to these matters at all times, he might then come to realise that no one, either in his own Party or in any other Party, wishes to see that line of approach in the Parliament of the country. Without being personal to anyone, I want to say that I did expect Deputy MacCarthy to go more fully into the matter. It is a matter which we have discussed in Cork before now. We all know that the only section in the Bill that may give rise to any great discussion is Section 4, which gives the milk board power to go outside the area to purchase milk and also to give licences to milk producers outside the present restricted area. That section, in itself, is good, if it gives to farmers outside the present Cork Milk Board area an opportunity of selling milk in the city at a higher price, instead of having to send it to a creamery, as they may have to do at times. It gives them an opportunity of deciding for themselves which line they want to adopt, but in that connection there are two points which, to me, seem rather vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that the board may give licences to people outside the area and naturally it imposes on such farmers certain obligations. It does not say that it will give them; it merely says it may. I am not anxious to look for trouble, but we had certain <Col N="1018" /> discussions some four years ago and I want to ask if there could be a danger that any particular farmer, because he might not be friendly with the personnel of the board, could be refused a permit to sell his milk in the city. I am sure that many Deputies, having their own obligations to the people in their own constituencies, are probably browned-off hearing so many of us wasting, as they might think, the time of the House speaking about Cork, but I had occasion, when Deputy Dillon was Minister, to give him certain facts with regard to the activities of the milk board in Cork City. There was one notable case of a farmer a few miles outside the city who had not a licence under the 1936 Act to sell milk in Cork City. For a certain period of the year, he was allowed to bring milk into the premises of a city firm engaged in the sale of milk, and he got 1/7 or 1/7½ per gallon.</P>
    <P>When the period of scarcity passed this farmer was politely told by the officials of the milk board that he would be allowed to bring the milk into a depot which was roughly a mile and a quarter from the city centre, and that, instead of the 1/7½ he was getting, he would get 1/1 or 1/1½ per gallon. At the same time, the distributing firm were told that they could collect the milk at the depot, but that they had to pay 1/7 or 1/7½ per gallon. That was roughly 6d. per gallon the farmer lost through having to leave it at the depot.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, Deputy Corry did not give us any information as to the amount of money the Cork Milk Board have gained by the levy which they have placed on these people who are dealing in milk over the years. I cannot say definitely how much it is, but I believe that the amount of money available to the Cork Milk Board at present, through the collection of levies, is substantial. That may perhaps be their own business, to a certain extent, but, because we are dealing with a Bill which gives them greater powers, we must question these points. I know that they have expenses in regard to staff and offices, but I believe that their own levy is sufficient to cover these expenses and leave them a nice profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> My worry, then, would be whether it would be possible for the milk board officials to refuse the right to a farmer outside the area to sell milk inside. I maintain that the rights of every farmer should be safeguarded. I know of one farmer who is sending milk into the city and getting the city rate, while across the road from him another farmer outside the area must send it to a creamery. I am sure the Minister will make it clear that the section will give a direct right to every farmer to send milk in, and that a farmer will not be precluded from selling his milk in the area because of some grievance which an official may have against him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made some references to which I consider it worth while to draw attention. Listening to him as one Corkman listening to another, I say that the false accusations he made against the people of Cork City were the most disgraceful I ever heard in this House. I am not speaking for Cork City. Politically, it means nothing to me because I come from the country, but I want to say that it ill becomes any Deputy from any part of the country to speak in such terms&mdash;he talked about the housewives in Cork City with the dirty jugs&mdash;of these people. If an inspector of the Department of Health were to inspect the homes of the working people and of others in Cork City he would find that there were at least as clean and decent as those in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry knows, although he may wish to evade the issue, that there have been many prosecutions against milk vendors. We do not want great publicity about this and we would rather remedy that situation than make accusations, but the plain fact is that bad milk has been sold in Cork City; that sour milk has been sold there. Milk is dear enough for the working people without being supplied with milk at 2 o'clock in the day which they cannot use and which means that in the morning, when the men of the house have to go to work, the housewife must go out to borrow a drop of milk for their breakfasts. These are plain facts and Deputy Corry knows <Col N="1020" /> that they are plain facts, but, as usual, he makes a charge and leaves the House. That action speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Pasteurisation has been referred to during this discussion and there is no need for me to go into it except to say that, from my own knowledge, Deputy Dillon was quite correct in his approach to all that happened in connection with the correspondence and the discussions between him as Minister for Agriculture and the Cork Milk Board, and it is well that the present Minister should understand the position.</P>
    <P>We are happy to be able to discuss this Bill away from politics, on a higher plane than that of trying to point the finger of scorn at one Party or another. The present Minister would be well advised to consider all that has happened in regard to this question. Deputy Dillon proved conclusively during his term of office, as the Minister will find in his files, that he did all possible to bring about full co-operation, based on the ultimate pasteurisation of milk for the Cork City area. Unfortunately, all these efforts were wasted, because there was no sense of co-operation at the other side. They had the excuse all the time that, because of the restriction of the milk board area, people had to be short of milk at times. I know full well that, while they were able to evade the issue, they were able to say: &ldquo;We would welcome an extension of the milk board area&rdquo;, but at the same time they were determined to see that the area would not be extended. Perhaps it may be a human reaction to anything that may lead to ultimate profit personally, yet these are the facts.</P>
    <P>As regards pasteurisation, when this matter was discussed in the Cork County Council they came to a decision not to go ahead with pasteurisation. It is by mistakes we learn. On that occasion I moved for the pasteurisation, but, as I pointed out then, there are two sides to every story. If we make mistakes and can see our faults, it may lead to an improvement in the future. Deputy McGrath mentioned the use in America of other items of food to make up for certain deficiencies in pasteurisation <Col N="1021" /> isation. We discussed all that in the Cork County Council. I said there that it is strange that, in Northern Ireland during the emergency, the American authorities, although they had Grade I milk, demanded pasteurised milk for their own troops. Those troops were given it, and prepared, perhaps, as one might prepare prime beef for slaughter; yet they did not wish them to be slaughtered by tuberculosis, and decided that pasteurised milk should be used. Personally, I never drank a drop of pasteurised milk, but I did not avoid the ulcers Deputy MacCarthy was speaking of. Had I used pasteurised milk, I might have escaped that.</P>
    <P>Pasteurisation would mean an improvement in Cork. If the policy mentioned by Deputy Dillon were carried out, the farmers would have a full opportunity of working on a co-operative basis. What profits were made would be theirs. There was no question of get rich quick gentlemen stepping in, such as Deputy Corry mentioned. I can see a danger as the years go on, that if the Cork producers do not wake up to their responsibilities, the Departments of Health and Agriculture will insist on an improvement in our milk supplies and we may see some other body acting for pasteurisation in Cork and then the farmers will regret it. I would prefer to see the farmers wake up to the position now, in their own interests, and then they would be fully satisfied with the results.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath mentioned the hours of delivery in Cork. Deputy Corry tried to misquote him by saying he demanded that milk be delivered at 7 o'clock. There is a great grievance in Cork City and suburbs regarding the hour of delivery. Pasteurisation would bring about an improvement and benefit both to farmers and consumers. The farmer could then bring the milk in during the day and after pasteurisation it would pass on to the consumer in the morning. At present, neither consumer nor producer is satisfied.</P>
    <P>In regard to inspectors, Deputy MacCarthy said our present question is that of the appointment of a full-time inspector. We went through all this <Col N="1022" /> discussion in Cork and found that if an inspector were employed full-time and were to inspect every dairy in South Cork, he would have to work seven days a week and Christmas Day also, and even then he would not have made an adequate inspection. The biggest weakness at present is that, even with inspectors, they do not get to the root of the trouble. Deputy Corry insinuated that they are falling over each other in Cork City. Instead of taking a sample of the milk in the churn in the city, they should go to the root of the trouble, which lies very often elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a supplier from that restricted area who has not enough milk to meet the demand of his customers, must go outside the area and it is in the outside area that the trouble may exist. I state here with full responsibility that I have been informed of a case of a farmer outside that area who, when the inspector was about to call on him to inspect the stalls, happened to get a post card the morning before stating that he would be calling the next day. That meant that the farmer had the place in the best of trim, he had whitewash on every wall and a brush leaning against every door, giving the impression that everything was right, and they finished up by having a fine breakfast and probably a drop of poteen afterwards. These points must be drawn clearly, to show that the present system of inspection cannot be the success we want it to be.</P>
    <P>We want to have the milk delivered in a really clean and decent manner. The milk some producers are selling in Cork City is a disgrace to themselves. We want that eliminated. If, through any discussion here, we can improve the milk supplies for human use, we will be doing well. If the Bill gives scope to the producer who is denied the right of entry into that market at the present time&mdash;and many are anxious to enter that market and are prepared to put the best quality milk into it&mdash;it will get from me as from all others the welcome it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we have been at a disadvantage here in not knowing what funds are available <Col N="1023" /> in the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards. I did not hear the Minister give any indication in his opening statement as to the amount of money available. Not knowing that, it is difficult to make suggestions as to how it should be spent, which is what this Bill is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this Bill should be very welcome, and I am sure this stage will be passed unanimously. I must pay tribute, from my knowledge at any rate of the workings of the district milk board, to the great work done by them over the years. It is true that at first, of course, they concerned themselves with ensuring a supply of milk all the year round for the city. That was very necessary. Now that that has been achieved, surely it would not be amiss to request them to use some of their funds towards ensuring a supply of clean, pure milk by a tubercular testing of herds, through the medium of pasteurisation, by taking every precaution they possibly can with regard to cooling the milk, and so on. Not knowing the extent of the funds at the disposal of the board it is very difficult to make suggestions along that line. However, if they have not sufficient funds I see no reason why they should not be given grants towards carrying out the tubercular testing of herds and for the installation of first class cooling plants. In years past the board concerned themselves too with the price of milk, both wholesale and retail. It was part of their activities in addition to ensuring an adequate supply of milk. Little has been said here on this Bill to-night about the price of milk, but I must take it that every Deputy who spoke was satisfied with the price except Deputy Corry. There is one way in which the price of milk can be made economic, and that is, as was already said by Deputy Dillon and other speakers, by having higher yielding cows. If each cow could give a bigger supply of milk at very little increased cost we would then be able to sell the milk at a lower rate. Thus yields in the Cork District Milk Board and every other area in Ireland could be increased. At the end of last year I got from the Department of Agriculture the average milk yields of <Col N="1024" /> each of the 26 counties, and they amazed me.</P>
    <P>I thought them to be absolutely uneconomic and I am satisfied now that if they were uneconomic last year they are more so this year. We have an opportunity now under this Bill of using funds to be contributed by the milk boards towards schemes designed to ensure the increased production of milk. I am one of those people who believe we can increase the milk yield either by getting pure milk-producing breeds of cattle or getting the highest possible milk-producing breeds that are to be found in this country. I would like to refer specially to the first-class pure Dairy Shorthorn or the Friesian. I hold that we in the Cork District Milk Board area should get an opportunity of supplying ourselves with the highest yielding cows by means of artificial insemination. An artificial insemination centre is to be set up there shortly, I believe. I should like to get a definite statement from the Minister, first, as to the amount of money for disposal, and secondly, as to how it is going to be disposed of. I certainly do not agree that, for example, any of it should be devoted to soil testing. I feel satisfied that we have in County Cork a first-class staff, 50 per cent. of their salary being paid by the rates and 50 per cent. by the Department, for this purpose, and that it would only be duplication if some of the funds now for disposal were to be used for soil testing. I would prefer to see them going towards providing a purer milk supply, an increased and cheaper milk supply. When replying, I should also like the Minister to guarantee that we will be free to improve our milk yield in the best manner we consider fit and that our hands will not be tied in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long. The speeches I have heard have disclosed one fact, and that is, the need for a consumers' representative on the milk board and especially a woman representative. I earnestly hope that the Minister will give consideration to the claim of women to go on the board so as to help towards safeguarding the health of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I would suggest that the Milk Board should have a representative of the Infant Aid Society, the Child Welfare Society, or the Housewives' Association. The members of these societies are splendid women and they give very valuable help towards safeguarding public health. It would not be very difficult to get one of these able representatives to give the Minister very valuable help in this direction. I will go so far as to say that the representatives from Cork should claim to have a representative of their corporation on the board. We in the Dublin Corporation have not asked for any representation on the board; we are being safeguarded and we are paying for the best quality milk that money can produce. The Dublin Corporation, through its various boards, contribute to the Child Welfare Society and to the Infant Aid Society. Under the Schools Meals Act I suppose we are the biggest purchasers of milk in the City of Dublin, if not in Ireland. We pay for an average of over 4,000,000 gallons per year and, perhaps, the figure is nearer to 5,000,000 gallons. Our Public Health Report, recently published by the Chief Medical Officer, says that we gave out under the Child Welfare Scheme over 7,250,000 bottles of milk, each bottle holding one-third of a pint. The Infant Aid Society gave out another million bottles of milk. From that point of view I earnestly hope the Minister will consider giving public representation on the board to the women who contributed so handsomely to the purchase of milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this Bill as it went through the Seanad I was pleased, because I saw in it the possibility of a very big improvement as far as the supply and the distribution of milk in Dublin City is concerned. There is no necessity for any Deputy to say that milk is a valuable food. Not only is it a valuable food but it is a very dangerous food if it is not produced and distributed under the very best conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see a provision whereby the board may engage in the business of selling milk. I thought that was a very valuable development and I sincerely hope that that will be the <Col N="1026" /> beginning of a new phase of activity for our milk boards.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties that I see in Dublin&mdash;and it must to some extent affect the price of milk&mdash;is the competition that there is in distribution between the several dairies we have here. We have dairies of repute like the Merville Dairy, Dublin Dairies and Hughes Bros. Those are what I might term the bigger organisations that are distributing milk. I have often felt there must be a wastage when the particular firms are engaged in competition in distributing milk on the same streets or on the same roads. By a proper zoning of the city between these dairies&mdash;and I think the dairies themselves are anxious for that and, in fact, in an unofficial way are endeavouring to bring it about&mdash; considerable wastage may be avoided and the avoidance of that waste could affect the price of milk somewhat. I hope that that will be the next development and it is just as well that it should be mentioned in the House.</P>
    <P>It is a disgraceful state of affairs when a dairy, purporting to be a big dairy, is brought up in the District Courts and charged with offences in regard to their milk. I think that any dairy that is convicted of selling milk that is bad should be taken over for the time being until it is properly reorganised by the milk board, or, at least, it should be put in the position where it could not do harm to the citizens. It would be very interesting if the Minister would look over the records of prosecutions brought in Dublin City, say, in the last ten years in connection with the quality of milk supplied, dirty milk, milk containing excess water and things like that, not against individuals running a small dairy business but against people in a big way of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind where they get it. What I am saying is that when these firms get milk and put it through their own processes, that milk should be fit for human <Col N="1027" /> consumption when it is delivered in bottles to the consumer. Unfortunately, that has not been so and I take the opportunity of referring to it. If it only happens once a year it is too often. It should not happen at all. It has happened and I think it is regrettable to read in the evening papers of a particular firm charged with the supply of contaminated milk, dangerous milk, and not only charged with it but convicted of it.</P>
      <P>I am not going to get into this question that I have spoken so often about, higher yields from cows. It has been mentioned in the House this evening and it has been mentioned often enough, that if a higher production of milk per cow were achieved, milk would not be as dear as it is at the moment; and milk is really too dear in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I know the producer of milk is not getting anything like the price the consumers have to pay for it and if the average family, a family of eight, were to take, say, a pint of milk per head per day, that would amount to a gallon of milk at a cost of 4/- a day. No family can afford that out of the average wages and that is the position in regard to milk in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I know it is the Minister's policy and I know it must be the policy of any person who is really concerned with this aspect of our agriculture that there should be a substantial improvement in the yields of our cattle and the sooner it is brought about the better. If the price can be reduced somewhat it will lead to a bigger consumption of milk. It is a valuable food, as I have said, for the people who consume it and a bigger consumption must inevitably be better for the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the big cities like Dublin and Cork the time for selling milk out of cans is passed. This idea of coming up with a can and emptying through the <Col N="1028" /> spout a pint or a quart of milk is completely out of date. It is too dangerous. There are places where that probably can be done and where dangers may be avoided, but there are too many posibilities of contamination in a city to have that permitted. I certainly hope that the day is not so far off when no milk will be sold in the cities except milk that has gone through all the necessary processes to remove the possibility of contamination or disease and that milk will be sold in sealed containers to the consumer. As I say, I welcome the Bill because I think it is a big step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>As a doctor, I cannot possibly permit any measure brought in to improve the milk supply generally to go through without adverting to the question of the purity of the milk supply. So long as we have cattle suffering from tuberculosis, the pooling of milk and the non-pasteurisation of milk we shall have impure milk and milk of an utterly unsatisfactory quality coming into the city. What steps does the Minister intend to take to deal with that situation? A number of Deputies spoke in support of pasteurisation. I am not sure whether, if we bring an amendment forward in that respect, they will support it. Again I repeat, so long as we have infected cattle, pooling of milk and pasteurisation of only certain quantities of milk we will not have a proper milk supply. That is a matter that must be tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was introduced as a non-controversial measure and I had no idea this afternoon, when introducing the Bill, that we would have so much controversy on it. Somebody raised the hare of dirty milk and that hare has been chased all over the House for the past two or three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has nothing to do with dirty milk, pasteurised milk or a clean milk supply. All these matters are dealt with under specific Acts. This Bill deals solely with the production of milk and the disposal of a surplus of milk. It is obvious that many Deputies who have spoken here this <Col N="1029" /> evening did not take the trouble to read the Bill. Had they done so their remarks would have been more relevant to it than they were over the past three hours.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the important section in the Bill. It deals with the disposal of certain moneys accumulated over the past few years through the medium of the levies collected from the milk producers. For a time some of that money was used in promoting a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; scheme. That was not a success because of shortage of milk. In the case of the Dublin Milk Board the sums accumulated amount to £25,000; in the case of the Cork Milk Board they amount to £10,000. It is suggested now that these funds can be utilised for the purpose of helping the milk producers by way of new schemes such as artificial insemination, soil testing, lectures on the production of more milk and cleaner milk, and possibly a scheme for tuberculin tested cows, in an effort to eradicate tuberculosis. All those schemes can be included. It is a matter of the amount of money at our disposal. If there is sufficient money those schemes can be implemented. Anything that will help the producers to produce more milk is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with registered wholesalers and retailers purchasing milk from outside the district. There is a district in Dublin and another in Cork. The district in Cork comprises an area within a four miles radius of the General Post Office. If there is an individual outside that area who has a high grade dairy herd, such as a Jersey herd, he is permitted to take his milk into Cork City, even though he is outside the area. The same thing applies in Dublin. Registered dairy herd owners can send their milk in here because they are registered, even though they are outside what is known as the milk district.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the purchasing of milk from the creameries. It does happen on occasion that there is not a sufficient quantity of milk within an area and it is necessary to go outside. In that case an arrangement can be made with the creamery to supply the necessary milk for a short period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> Had the sections of the Bill been examined closely we would not this evening have spent our time running around the highways and the byways. The section that has caused all the trouble is Section 4. That section deals with emergency powers already in existence. Where there are emergency powers such as those mentioned in this section and those powers are regarded as necessary, it is the policy of the Government to embody such powers in legislation should the necessity and the opportunity arise. In this case the necessity arises now because we have seen over a period of years that these powers are necessary. Irrespective of whether or not the section is accepted or rejected, the powers will still remain and the Minister will and must retain the powers in order to dispose of surplus milk or provide for a shortage should it arise. Do those people who are anxious that the section should not pass as it stands suggest that the emergency powers should be revoked? Is it suggested that Emergency Power No. 247 should be revoked, the result of which would be to leave any surplus milk produced in Dublin on the hands of the producers? Is that the suggestion? I do not believe it is.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an ulterior motive behind the other suggestion that it is the intention at some date in the future that the Dublin Milk Board will go outside the milk district to break a milk strike should such an eventuality arise. The composition of the milk board is seven producers and six others, with a chairman. Is it seriously suggested that the chairman will give a casting vote against the other members of the board? Even if he did give a casting vote it would still have to be sanctioned by the Minister for Agriculture, and he is responsible to this House. Would any Minister for Agriculture take such an action against a decision of the board to go outside? This House must remember that if an emergency exists the Minister must take responsibility for supplying milk wherever it is needed without any reference to the milk board. Any Minister who stands here will take that responsibility. It is immaterial, therefore, whether that section is there or <Col N="1031" /> not because the Minister has the power already. The only reason why the section is put there is to embody the Emergency Powers Order already in existence in legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not think any points of importance have been raised. We have travelled over ground that is not covered in the Bill. I repeat that this Bill was sanctioned by the previous Administration. Deputy Dillon denied that. The proposals for the Bill were approved by Deputy Dillon in 1949. They were approved for drafting on 9th November, 1949, so Deputy Dillon's memory is as short as his imagination is vivid.</P>

As far back as that they were looking for the Bill. More recently still, I had a letter from the Cork District Milk Board. This letter, which is dated the 29th January, 1952, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My board is apprehensive that it may not be in a position to have its projected A 1 facilities established in time for the present season, and has directed me to ask you to convey to the Minister its earnest appeal for the use of his good offices with the Government towards ensuring priority in Dáil Eireann for all stages of the enabling legislation&mdash;&mdash;the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) (Amendment) Bill, 1952.</P>
      <P>The board greatly appreciates the attention which the Minister has so far given to the need for this legislation and feels that the Bill in its present form will enable the best handling of the Cork milk supply problem.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 4 enables the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards to dispose of a surplus when they have it. They may have to go outside those areas and set up depots to get rid of it. I had the experience this year, when coming back from the West, of arriving at a town in the Midlands where I was told by a deputation that there would be no milk the following morning. There was not a strike in that town, and this state of affairs did not obtain because the price of the milk was not sufficient. It was because there was a scarcity and shortage of milk. If I had not been passing at the time, the possibilities were that the milk would not have been available for the following day. Luckily, I was present, and was able to get in touch with the Department, with the result that nobody suffered since we made the milk available for the people on the following day. If we had such an occurrence outside the Dublin District Milk Board area, the board must go outside and set up those depots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody complained&mdash;I think it was Deputy Dillon&mdash;that at one time in Cork it was necessary to set up depots. It is suggested that they should be set up. An occasion may arise in any town at any time when the Dublin or Cork District Milk <Col N="1033" /> Board may be asked to take precautions arising out of a scarcity or shortage of milk in a particular area, with the result that depots may have to be set up. Occasions may also arise in the summer time when you have a surplus of milk in Dublin and Cork. In this event, the board must go in and make provision for the sale of the milk. It may happen, for instance, that you have one milk wholesaler who has a surplus of milk and another who has a shortage.</P>
    <P>It is a question for the board to equate things and give each a sufficient supply. It may also happen that milk may have to be sent out of the City of Dublin because of a surplus during the summer time or taken, perhaps, to some chocolate crumb factory or creamery. But the board must get the powers to do these things. They already have them under an Emergency Powers Order, but we want to have them embodied in the Bill. That is what Section 4 is asking for and because of the necessity for Section 4, I am asking this House to agree to the Second Reading as it stands.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £120,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Habours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1947, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); for expenses in connection with the issue of Medals and Certificates; and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Vote is for the purpose of making certain payments to the Great Northern Railway Company. The House will remember that towards the end of 1950 the Great Northern Railway Company announced that because of the financial difficulties resulting from a marked deterioration in their operating results they were about to curtail transport services and to make drastic reductions in staffs. Following that announcement, at a joint meeting between the representatives of the Governments here and in Belfast with the company, the company agreed that <Col N="1035" /> the dismissal notices, which they had issued to their staff, would be withdrawn on an assurance being given by the two Governments that they would accept responsibility for losses incurred in maintaining services and employment, while negotiations for the purchase of the undertaking were proceeding. Both here and in Belfast there was an undertaking to give these assurances. There was not then, may I say, any further or more detailed arrangements with the authorities in Belfast and no discussion at that stage regarding the division of the liabilities that were undertaken.</P>
    <P>A written assurance was issued on 11th January, 1951, to the company to the effect that as the company might find it necessary in the immediate future, in order to maintain existing services and appropriate employment, to incur liabilities in the ordinary course of business, pending the completion of arrangements for joint acquisition, the Government undertook in association with the Six Counties Government, that in so far as the resources of the company might prove insufficient to meet these liabilities, they would be met out of public funds. It was added that, if necessary, an Estimate would be submitted to the Oireachtas, and at the same time a similar letter was issued by the Six County authorities. An Order under the Emergency Powers (No. 157) Order, 1942, added the Great Northern Railway Company to the list of undertakings whose borrowings could be guaranteed by the Government. There were discussions with the company as to their immediate requirements, on 12th May, and the Minister for Finance gave a guarantee as to principal and interest for borrowings by the company from their bankers to a sum not exceeding in the aggregate £40,000 at any one time for a period ending September 30th, 1951, as required for the maintenance of the existing services and the employment appropriate thereto. The Six County Government proceeded on a different basis; they took a supplementary estimate and have been making periodic cash payments to the company on the basis of weekly returns since then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> Because of the guarantee that was given here of borrowings up to £40,000 and the provision which was made by way of Estimate in the Six Counties the Great Northern Railway decided to implement a number of wage awards and maintain its existing services. Later a list of materials and equipment which were required in the opinion of the company for maintenance and renewal works was submitted to both Governments and the appropriate expenditure was approved by them, but the company decided not to place orders for these materials and equipment on the ground that they could not enter into commitments which they might not be able to meet when they matured. It was pointed out that, as far as the Government here was concerned, responsibility under the guarantee was limited both in amount and in time and that that guarantee might have expired by the time the goods were delivered. We considered that to be a reasonable case and on 17th August the Minister for Finance guaranteed borrowings by the company without time limit up to a maximum of £125,000 for the purchase of materials and equipment necessary for the maintenance of the undertaking and subject to the prior agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the items of expenditure. The company placed an order for its materials and equipment following that undertaking but to date, due to delays in delivery, not more than £21,000 has been withdrawn from the special account which was opened in connection with that guarantee of £125,000 to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In October, the original guarantee of £40,000 given in respect of operating expenses was extended to 31st December last and in December the amount was raised to £75,000 and the period extended to 31st March next. The company have recently indicated that its overdraft with its bank against that guarantee exceeds the limit of £75,000 and that the bank has requested that an arrangement be made to reduce that overdraft.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that at the time when the joint proposal was made to the company. There was no discussion <Col N="1037" /> concerning the division between the two Governments as to how the liability should be divided. When recently we were able to conclude the provisional agreement with the Six Counties Government for the joint acquisition of the undertaking we discussed also this matter of the division of liability arising out of this undertaking and it was agreed that any losses arising should be met to the extent of 60 per cent. by the Six-County Government and 40 per cent. by us.</P>
    <P>Any method of endeavouring to estimate how a charge of that kind should be divided, having regard to the character of the system, would give roughly a 60-40 per cent. division; that represents the division of the mileage of line between the two areas and of the gross receipts arising in the areas. We, however, stipulated, as an offset against any charge that might arise upon public funds here, that there should be an adjustment in the amount payable by us which would give us full credit for any profit derived from the company's road services which are entirely within the Twenty-Six Counties area, and also for any increased revenue derived from our sanctioning of increased rates and fares. The fares charged by the Great Northern Railway Company in respect of traffic originating in the Twenty-Six Counties were increased at the same time as Córas Iompair Eireann charges were increased, as we considered it preferable to meet the problem of the rising costs of the Great Northern Railway Company by increasing charges rather than by contemplating a higher subsidy.</P>
    <P>On the basis that we are responsible for 40 per cent. of the cash deficit of the company, after taking credit for the road services and for the receipts attributable for the rates and fares, it is estimated that we are responsible for a payment in respect of the 15 months from January, 1951, to March, 1952, or a total of £117,466, and, as Deputies will note, on the back of the Estimate that is the amount provided &mdash;at least it is rounded up to £118,000&mdash; the amount to be paid to the company <Col N="1038" /> in respect of operating losses and revenue charges. I should say that there is a considerable element of estimation in these calculations and that adjustments may be necessary later in the final accounting with the Six Counties Government. The figure for losses would have been considerably larger if the company had not deferred placing orders for materials and equipment.</P>
    <P>The fact that any charge arises on public funds here, I know, will be a disappointment to some Deputies because they may have been under the impression that the Twenty-Six County part of the Great Northern system was producing a profit or, at worst, breaking level. That was true up to last year, but it is no longer true. The increased wages and salaries which came into operation last year increased the company's operating charges in a full year by £370,000 and there have also been increases in the cost of coal and oil. Furthermore, Deputies will recollect that there was a prolonged strike on the company's omnibus services which diminished earnings from that source, and its earnings were also affected to some extent by the strike on the Córas Iompair Éireann system.</P>
    <P>Against these increased wages and salaries which came into operation last year, the rates and fares were increased in September, the average increase being 16? per cent. on rates and 12½ per cent. on fares, the same increases as were effected on the same date by Córas Iompair Éireann. These increases are estimated to bring in £212,000 for a full year. So, it will be noted that the full estimated increase in revenue from the higher rates and fares will not be sufficient to offset the increased charges on the company arising from higher wages and salaries alone, apart altogether from the increased cost of fuels and materials. Nevertheless, the company consider that they are the highest increases that the traffic will bear and that to attempt to raise them further would not increase their revenue but might cause a loss through a diversion of traffic.</P>
    <P>These increases operated in the Twenty-Six Counties area only. There was no increase made in the local <Col N="1039" /> charges in the Six Counties area because the company's charges there are already in line with those of the Ulster Transport Authority and, in the company's view, have to be maintained in line with those charges.</P>
    <P>That is a brief statement of the reasons why this Estimate is required.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that, following the discussions which proceeded between the Minister for Commerce in Belfast and myself, a joint statement was issued indicating that both Governments had found it possible to agree on a basis for acquiring the Great Northern Railway and for its operation by a joint board. Legislation to give effect to that agreement is in course of preparation. I cannot yet say when it is likely to come before the Dáil. It is obviously in our interest to speed it up as much as possible but there are some matters of detail for decision before it can be completed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should hope so. I shall certainly endeavour to ensure that, if possible. There is one further item in the Supplementary Estimate to which reference should be made. The House is aware that the Dundalk-Newry and Greenore railway, which has been operated by the Great Northern Railway on an agency basis, ceased operations in December last. The British Transport Commission had borne the annual loss which arose from the operation of that railway and had announced that it was not going to meet that loss after that date. The property of the company was due for disposal and included in that property was the Greenore Hotel. An announcement appeared that the Greenore Hotel was to be sold by auction. We have reason to believe that an important industrial project can be arranged for Greenore and that the prospect of the development of that project at Greenore depends upon the availability of the hotel or, at any rate, that the prospect of getting the project proceeded with at Greenore <Col N="1040" /> would be subject to the availability of the hotel and the adjoining harbour and railway property.</P>
      <P>We are, of course, most anxious that there should be some development of alternative employment at Greenore and, in order to ensure it, considered it desirable to take steps to ensure that the property would not be broken up because, if it was broken up and passed into different ownership, it would make industrial development there more difficult, if not impossible.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Government decided to authorise the Great Northern Railway Company to purchase the Greenore Hotel and golf course, which it did for a sum of £17,000, and authorised it also to take an option on the adjoining harbour and railway property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Great Northern Railway were informed that any expense that was incurred by them in connection with these transactions would be recouped from the special guaranteed account and it is now necessary to obtain the sanction of the Dáil for that arrangement by including in the Estimate provision for the repayment of the purchase price of the property with cost to date amounting to £17,500. If that industrial project to which I have referred should materialise&mdash;and I would not like the Dáil to be under the impression that all difficulties associated with it have been overcome yet&mdash;but if these difficulties are overcome and the project materialises, then those who are promoting the project will be charged with the full purchase price of the hotel, with interest on the amount of the purchase price and any incidental costs for maintenance that may be incurred in the meantime.</P>

      <P>Yes, and operated by the Great Northern Railway Company. The hotel is still open and it is intended that it should remain open because it would prevent its deterioration. It is intended, however, only that the Great Northern Railway Company should hold the property until satisfactory arrangements can be made for its future utilisation for industrial purposes. There may be some losses incurred by the Great Northern Railway Company in the operating of the hotel and refreshment room until that happens but, if so, it is intended that these losses should also be recouped in the price at which the property will be transferred to anybody taking it over for industrial purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be undesirable. The Deputy will understand that. Nothing has yet emerged from the negotiations which are proceeding which would justify pessimism or a conclusion that it will not develop. In any event, even if the project that is now under discussion <Col N="1042" /> did not develop, the group of buildings and the harbour facilities at Greenore are, I think, eminently suitable for some important industrial development. I think it would be undesirable to allow parts of the property to pass into different ownership, which would preclude that possibility indefinitely. If, of course, no such project should develop, then we might have to be satisfied with half a loaf arrangement, but while there is a prospect of a major development, we ought to ensure that no impediments are put in its way. It was for that reason this proposal was made to the Great Northern Railway Company and agreed to by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Estimate in the calm atmosphere of to-night does not give an adequate picture of the anxiety which the employees of the Great Northern Railway Company felt when the company announced through the Press the crisis that had been reached in its financial affairs, some 18 months ago. At that time, the Government here and the Government in the Six Counties announced after discussion that it was their intention to meet the operating losses, and so prevent any avoidable unemployment. Consequently the anxiety which the workers and their families felt was allayed. Since then, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has, on behalf of the Government here, successfully concluded the negotiations. I believe that he should be congratulated on bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion. I say that because at one time I had some contact with the matter, and I am very pleased that it has been brought to a successful conclusion, not only for the sake of the Great Northern Railway Company and the employees of the company, but because of the goodwill which agreements of this nature generate between the people of this part of the country and our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties. The goodwill which has been generated by a number of agreements of this nature&mdash;the Erne electricity agreement, the Foyle and Bann fisheries agreement, and the Great Northern Railway agreement-must inevitably <Col N="1043" /> have reactions on the ultimate reunification of the country. In fact, I am convinced that the solution of that problem is to a far greater extent dependent on negotiations of this sort than on certain other methods or of probably any alternative approach. Consequently, I believe that the satisfactory conclusion of these negotiations augurs well for the future. For these reasons, the House welcomed the announcement made some months ago that agreement had been reached, and will no doubt assent to this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>There is not much in connection with the Estimate that requires to be discussed. It is, of course, unfortunate to say the least of it that the second major transport concern in the country requires to be assisted by a State subsidy and the time has probably arrived when serious consideration will have to be given to the question of the extent to which the State can continue to subsidise transport in the absence of any remote, not to mention immediate, possibility of public transport concerns being in a position to pay their way or being placed by legislation in that position. However, the responsibility of maintaining employment in the Great Northern Railway transcended any question of the extent to which the drain on public finances would make that course undesirable and the decision to provide by way of direct Exchequer contribution the operating losses of the Great Northern Railway was reached when it was obvious that the maintenance of the employment and the livelihood of those concerned depended on some action being taken by the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate has been arrived at on a division of the liability between the two Governments and, from what the Minister said, it appears a reasonable division. Up to last year, the portion of the Great Northern Railway Company operating within our jurisdiction was run at a profit. It was obvious for some time that if wage awards and other increased liabilities were assumed by the company, that position would not continue for long. Apparently a stage <Col N="1044" /> was reached some months ago when the portion of the line operating in this part of the country ceased to pay its way. It is, however, a fact that the road services of the Great Northern Railway Company are operated at a profit. Of course, they are exclusively within our jurisdiction and consequently credit will be claimed for the profit made on that part of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The other matter included in the Supplementary Estimate is the purchase of the Greenore Hotel and property. I believe it is a wise decision to purchase that property on the assumption that the property and the harbour there may be made available for an industrial undertaking. I should like to know from the Minister on what basis the price of £17,000 was agreed.</P>
    <P>The only other matter in connection with this Estimate which I think is worthy of mention is the question of the employment position in the Dundalk workshops and the future of these workshops because, from previous experience, the workshops there had insufficient work to keep them going and were obliged to seek work outside the company. Provided work is available, conditions can operate satisfactorily but, with the development of a workshop in Belfast and the fact that Córas Iompair Éireann have workshops in Inchicore, the future of the Dundalk workshops was by no means certain. With the establishment of the new board and the operation of this company as a joint company by representatives of both Governments, the integration of the Dundalk workshops and the work carried out at the workshops for Córas Iompair Éireann may be on a better basis than was possible when these undertakings were operated entirely separately and without any consideration to the economics of the two companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the negotiations which have led to the joint purchase of the Great Northern Railway have proved satisfactory and that we can now look forward to the operation of the railway as a joint undertaking between the two Governments. I do not say that that <Col N="1045" /> is the ideal solution of the problem. Last year, when our Government and the Six-County Government were faced with the problem of keeping the Great Northern Railway open, our difficulties were caused by reason of the fact that the Great Northern Railway was losing heavily in the Six Counties while on the Twenty-Six County portion of the line there was at that time a substantial surplus. We realised that the line was an essential one and that the surplus would not be possible on the Twenty-Six County portion for long if the line were severed at the Border. We decided at the time that it was essential to keep the line unsevered (1) because it is a vital railway; (2) in order to preserve the employment of the workers in the industry and (3) because we were anxious to promote a more comprehensive organisation of our whole transport system. For these reasons we suggested at the time to the Six-County Government that we would be prepared to set up a national transport authority for the whole country to operate railways, canals and road transport, and that that authority should be a single authority for the 32 counties. That proposal was made (1) because it was sound from an economic point of view and (2) because it was one of those independent steps which, ultimately, we must take if we are ever to secure the union of our country from the standpoint of a reunion of minds and hearts as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making that offer to the Six-County Government, I think that the Government here at the time acted in a broad-minded and generous spirit. It is obvious that they were, perhaps, putting a great deal into the pool, from a material point of view. However, we took the view that our transport services should operate as a single unit and that it was only on the basis of a single unit that they could ultimately be rationalised to provide stable employment for those men who have spent so many years of their lives in the transport industry and, at the same time, provide the efficient services which are so essential if our railways are really to be an efficient aid to our industrial and commercial activities. I was sorry <Col N="1046" /> that the Six-County Government did not see the matter in the same light, and, in view of their attitude at the time, nothing further could be done then to proceed with the project of establishing a national transport authority to operate our railway services as a single unit. The next best step was to purchase the undertaking jointly in the hope that at some later date the Six-County Government would see the wisdom of permitting their portion of the line to go in with the railway services in the Twenty-Six Counties and to be operated by a single authority and as a single unit. When we were engaged in these negotiations it looked as if, at one stage, the Six-County Government desired to operate the undertaking as two separate portions of a severed Great Northern Railway. I and my colleagues were strongly opposed to any such proposal. We felt that the minimum we ought to get was joint ownership of the Great Northern Railway as a single entity. It was on that basis, and only on that basis, that we consented to purchase the Great Northern Railway. I am glad that the Six-County Government recognise the wisdom of the joint purchase and joint operation of the Great Northern Railway. The notion of severing the railway and of operating one section of it to the Border and the other section after that would have given us a chaotic method of transport.</P>
    <P>The agreement to sell the Great Northern Railway to both Governments, in joint ownership as a single unit, removes for ever, I think, the possibility of severance of the Great Northern Railway into two units. I hope that, in the course of time, the fact that both Governments now own the Great Northern Railway jointly will induce both Governments to recognise&mdash;I have no doubt the recognition will be speedily forthcoming from this side of the Border&mdash; that the railway line is of a character and a size which would well merit its integration with the remaining transport services of the country and its operation as a single transport system for the entire country. The fact that these negotiations have been brought to a successful conclusion is a matter <Col N="1047" /> of congratulation for all those concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that there was no question of resorting to a subsidy by both Governments to keep the line going. A subsidy of public money to a privately-owned undertaking such as this could not be justified on any grounds and I for one was strongly opposed to any idea that the public cheque book should be used to write cheques for a privately-owned undertaking. The feeling was widespread that in the circumstances of the Great Northern Railway public ownership was inevitable and that it was only by bringing the line under public ownership and operating it at least jointly by both Governments that you can ever get a satisfactory service or ever get any confidence behind the railway which might ultimately result in its operation being put on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cosgrave, I feel pleased that these negotiations have been brought to a satisfactory conclusion and that both Governments have wisely recognised that joint ownership is the only effective solution for a difficult problem. I hope that joint ownership is just the first step and that it will not be long until the entire transport service is operated for the benefit of the entire country so that we may, by single ownership and operation of our entire transport service, give a clear example of the obvious advantages which would follow from a reunification of the national territory in other spheres as well.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Greenore Hotel and the surrounding accommodation have been purchased and I think the purchase price indicates that there is not likely to be any loss involved so far as the State is concerned. Greenore is a port which has many obvious advantages, advantages of a kind which could be utilised to our particular benefit. It can easily be made a port through which a substantial number of cattle can be shipped to Britain. If its possibilities in that respect were developed, the overcrowding at other ports would probably be obviated and the considerable amount of traffic which now takes place from <Col N="1048" /> outside our Twenty-Six Counties could be attracted to the port. I am glad that the Greenore property has been saved and I hope, whatever its ultimate use may be, that that use will take full cognisance of the desirability of exploiting to the full for the nation's benefit the obvious advantages which Greenore offers.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a very clear case for the acceptance of this Supplementary Estimate and proved, I am sure, to the satisfaction of Deputies that it is being brought in merely for the purpose of implementing a provisional agreement entered into between the Government of the Republic and the Six-County Government. Pending the introduction and passage of the necessary legislation, I hope that nothing definite will be done at the port of Greenore to prevent it from being used at some future date, as Deputy Norton suggested, for the shipment of cattle and goods.</P>

      <P>Records will prove that previous to the coming into operation of the Railway (Amalgamation) Act of 1924 the port of Greenore was a very prosperous one. I have some knowledge and a little experience of the working of that port, and I hope the Minister will advise those concerned not to interfere in any way with the very valuable cattle lairages there, which have been used to great advantage in the past on occasions of emergency. The Minister should look up the records previous to 1924. There is another period which will prove that Greenore was used to considerable advantage by the people interested in the export of live stock from this country. When the shipping companies in the port of Dublin decided to close the port and lock out their workers, these exporters used to the fullest possible extent the port of Greenore, for the purpose of keeping up the flow of live stock to Great Britain. Anybody who knows anything about the geography of the place will agree that it still can be used and, in my opinion, should be used for providing shipping facilities, probably by some of our own Irish ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> I am fully satisfied that Greenore was frozen out as a matter of policy from the time the Border was created many years ago. If the Minister does not know it, his advisers can tell him that even during the last emergency traders complained to his Department, and complaints were made through the Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Irish Manufacturers that traffic over a period of years was not coming into the country within a reasonable time from the purchase of that port by the people who were interested on this side of the channel. The reason given was that the traffic could not flow as rapidly as it should between the port of Holyhead and the port of Dublin. If Dublin ships were made available, as they could have been, instead of being diverted to Larne and Stranraer and Belfast and Heysham, and were used on the normal route for which they were built, and if the port of Greenore had been used during that period, there would be no necessity for complaints of that kind.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, the Minister will take the necessary steps to see that the valuable property, such as cattle lairages and other equipment, at Greenore will be preserved until some final decision has been taken in the matter. The property should be preserved irrespective of the development which he indicated in introducing the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I hope his prophecy in regard to the provision of a new industry in Greenore will turn out to be correct. Apart from that, I hope he will bear in mind that Greenore could be used as a suitable port for the shipment of all classes of traffic from our eastern counties. Previous to the coming into operation of the amalgamation, inducements by way of secret rebates were given by competing companies in the North to induce live stock and other traffic to go via Derry and Belfast ports to the detriment of Greenore and the port of Dublin. The Minister knew something about it even during his own period as Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the purchase of the hotel was one of the best bargains ever made. It is a very valuable and fairly up-to-date hotel. There is no doubt that it would <Col N="1050" /> be fully occupied during the summer holiday period. I am not a judge of the value of property, but I think it has been got for a &ldquo;song&rdquo; so far as the price provided for in this Estimate is concerned.</P>
    <P>In any other centre in the country that hotel would fetch anything from £50,000 to £75,000. I agree that the Minister has made a very clear case for the acceptance of this Estimate, and I hope that the legislation to implement the provisional agreement arrived at between the Government of the Republic and the Six County Government will be brought before the House at an early date, and passed before we adjourn for the summer holidays.</P>

      <P>I join in the congratulations to the Minister on the successful conclusion of the negotiations. At the same time, I know that the Minister will be gracious enough to permit me to couple with those congratulations the name of Deputy Cosgrave who, in the early days, carried on, more than half-way, the negotiations that have now been brought to a successful conclusion. I should like to put on record our appreciation of Deputy Cosgrave's services, as well as those of the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I would hope, with Deputy Davin and the other speakers, that use can be made of Greenore in the future. I am told that use could be made of it as an important industrial centre, and that there is room for an extension of industry at Greenore. It has a fine harbour, and perhaps with good management and the expenditure of a little money it could be equipped to take our own ships. I cannot recollect how many years it is since passengers used to travel from Dublin to Greenore and cross to the other side. Perhaps I could be told how long ago that is.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my gratification at the expressions which have been voiced of satisfaction with the agreement made with the Great Northern Railway Company. I think I should say that that agreement was the product of a general desire, shared by the Government in Belfast with the Government here, that a practical solution should be found for the difficulties of the Great Northern Railway position, and that a workable arrangement should be made for the carrying on of the services provided by the Great Northern Railway Company.</P>
      <P>The agreement was not easily reached. We might have preferred a somewhat different arrangement and so probably would Mr. McCleery and his colleagues, but we found, after a detailed examination and much discussion, that it was possible to reach an arrangement which both of us could accept. I am grateful to Deputy Cosgrave for his references to my part in the matter. I would like to say, too, from my own knowledge of what happened, derived from reading the record of the Department, that he personally put enough work into the negotiations to deserve success, and that it was not his fault that he did not achieve it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the proposal which was put forward during the course of these discussions for one national transport authority. In case that might be regarded anywhere as an agreed policy, I would like to say that I am not sure that I agree with it at all. I am not sure that, if Partition ended and there was no political difficulty in giving effect to it, I would advocate it as a sound idea for transport policy. However, it is only an academic question at the present time, and there is no point in discussing it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that an agreement has been made with the Belfast Government for the taking over of the Great Northern Railway and the operation of services over the Great Northern Railway system under the <Col N="1052" /> direction of a joint board, it is not by any means certain that the difficulties of the Great Northern Railway or its successor can be regarded as over. Any transport system that is losing money must always be regarded as being in jeopardy. I cannot say what the policy of the joint board may be in relation to the undertaking, or what view it may have concerning the carrying on of the services now provided in either area. The agreement provides for the making of decisions by the appropriate authority in either area regarding the operation of uneconomic services, provided the authority making the decision carries any losses arising, but it will be clear that the position of the Government here, in relation to the Great Northern Railway and the services provided by it, will be different from its position in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann. So far as Córas Iompair Éireann is concerned, it is a matter for ourselves to decide to what extent we are prepared to call upon the general taxpayer to make good its losses. So far as the Great Northern Railway is concerned, the decisions will be taken in the first instance by the joint board and will not rest solely with us.</P>
    <P>The price paid for the Greenore hotel was, I agree, a low one, having regard to the value of the property as a hotel. It was reached in this way. The hotel property was put up for auction and £17,000 was the best bid at the auction. The property was withdrawn. While the arrangements with the Great Northern Railway were being discussed, a further and a better offer for the hotel was received by the owners, that is by the Dundalk-Newry and Greenore Railway Company. The owners decided that it was more in their interest to sell the hotel to the Great Northern Railway at £17,000 and to give an option on the other property than to sell the hotel separately, leaving the other property to remain on their hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made some observation about Greenore to which I think I should refer. He said that nothing should be done about the cattle lairages and other fixtures there until some final decision was made. Final decisions have been made.</P>

      <P>Final decisions have been made regarding the Dundalk-Newry and Greenore undertaking. The decision was made by our predecessors in October, 1950. I reexamined the matter, following the change of Government, and found no reason to advise my colleagues to reverse the decision which our predecessors had made. The Dundalk-Newry and Greenore railway was losing money very substantially. The total cost of operating the undertaking was more than three times the gross receipts earned.</P>
      <P>There is no point in talking about the future of Greenore port, if one has in mind the operation of regular services for the carriage of passengers or freight. Passenger services from Greenore ceased away back in 1924 or 1925. There has been a weekly sailing by a cargo vessel until recently. You cannot operate any shipping services through a port without ships. The ships were provided by the British Transport Authority and they decided to withdraw them. I feel that there may be a future for Greenore port as an adjunct to an industrial undertaking in the vicinity, but there is, in my view, little likelihood of regular scheduled services for the carriage of goods being operated from Greenore port again.</P>
      <P>I visited the port recently and inspected the premises. My visit was made at the instance of local interests who were concerned with the preservation of the railway, but I must say that it left on me the impression that it would be far wiser to try to get some modern, efficient and profitable industry into these buildings, which are very extensive and very substantial, than to continue using them as an adjunct to a decrepit and unprofitable railway undertaking. I was very happy when the industrial project to which I have referred began to emerge and the promoters of that project displayed the interest in Greenore which I expected they would display when they became aware of the facilities available there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I can say that, if that project goes ahead at all, it will go ahead in Greenore. The only outstanding questions to be answered regarding it do not refer to its location. They turn upon the practicability of the undertaking in any location. I am hopeful that it will proceed, but even if it does not I am confident that the facilities at Greenore, the buildings which will be available at a fraction of what it would cost to construct them, and the exceptional port facilities, will in any event be sufficient to attract industrial activity to the town.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Shannon Flooding&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the drainage of the River Shannon should be undertaken in order to relieve the great plight of the many landowners who cannot use their lands and that pending the completion of the scheme and in view of the grave hardships caused to the farmers concerned suitable compensation should be paid to the landowners who cannot use their lands owing to continuous flooding in the area.&mdash;(Deputies O. Flanagan and Finan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>A position has been reached with regard to the Shannon in which no possible hope can be held out to the people who live in the flooded areas that a comprehensive drainage scheme will be initiated in our lifetime. That is the conclusion reached by the Parties on both sides of the House, and, as I have already said elsewhere, I am glad that we have, at any rate, reached a final decision with regard to this problem. The people in these areas can now expect alternative arrangements to be made for their relief. That is the least they might expect when there is no longer any hope held out to them that a large-scale drainage scheme will be carried out in these flooded areas.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any need for me to dwell on the actual hardships that have been suffered by the people in close proximity to the Shannon. A few words should be sufficient to bring home to Deputies the terrible hardships which these unfortunate people have suffered. It is not this year or last year that this has taken place but for years back their lands and homes have been subject to flooding during the winter months. Last year, this country did a very noble thing in helping to relieve flooded areas in Italy. The State made a subscription and many private individuals also helped. All credit to these people for their sincerity and charitable action, but the time is now ripe for showing a little charity at home, to the people in our own country, who, not this year or last year but for many years past, have suffered from flooding equally as bad as that suffered by people in Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I could give plenty of examples to the Parliamentary Secretary of entire holdings being flooded from last November until a couple of weeks ago, with six to 12 inches of water in the kitchens and bedrooms of the dwelling-houses. That position has obtained since last November. It was impossible for children in these houses to go to school in many cases and impossible for the people to move out of their houses except by using boats. These are actual facts, which are on record, because the flooding in these areas has been photographed by people who came from Dublin specially to see it. The present situation cannot be tolerated much longer. Those who have suffered from the flooding are tolerant and patient, but their patience cannot last much longer. It is the duty of the State, as I suggested last night, to remedy their plight, now that no hope is left that a drainage scheme can be carried out. The steps that should be taken are that within the next few months a complete survey should be made of the flooded area and those who wish to leave the locality should be given an opportunity to accept other holdings as near as possible to their present locality.</P>
    <P>I do not think the second part of the motion should be considered. I am not in favour of devaluing the land, as that would mean a repetition of the problem in 10 or 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion will have been useful to this extent, that by the time other speakers have had their say the Parliamentary Secretary will be in a stronger position to influence his colleague the Minister for Lands, so that that Minister should be able to direct the attention of the Land Commission to the urgency of this problem. We do not want to see it shelved this year to next year. It is quite on the cards that the flooding will occur again next year. Surely it is not too much to expect of the Land Commission that, with its huge organisation and staff, it should carry out the necessary scheme to remove these people within the next 12 months? I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will have good news from his colleague the Minister for Lands in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the question of the Shannon drainage was dealt with in the Report of the Drainage Commission of 1940. In view of the terms of this motion, one must assume that the proposer and seconder have not made themselves familiar with the observations of the commission. The commission pointed out that to remove the flooding after abnormal rains on the Shannon would run into colossal sums of money, due to the huge area of the Shannon basin. If Deputies consult the report. they will see that this has been dealt with in some detail by the expert body which examined the whole drainage position of the country. For example, with regard to Lough Ree, it is pointed out that, in the opinion of the commission, due to the control which is exercised by the Electricity Supply Board a good amount of relief has been given; and to the extent that it has not resulted in complete elimination of the flooding difficulty, they believe that the affected lands being scattered in isolated patches over a long shore line, any works designed for further prevention of flooding would not justify the expenditure. They went on to refer to the Athlone to Meelick portion, an important zone of the river. Referring to two alternative methods of dealing with the excess flooding, by excavation or by embankment works, they pointed out that in both cases the expenditure would be so great as to render the adoption of either of these methods impossible.</P>
      <P>They stated also with regard to this area, that the control exercised by the Electricity Supply Board also had had a mitigating effect on the incidence of flooding in summer and harvest time and they suggested certain remedies in removing restrictions on the main channel and reducing the navigation level, by which further improvement and mitigation could be effected.</P>
      <P>Referring to the area below Meelick, they stated in paragraph 230:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Having regard to the control system now established in connection with the hydro-electric works, no <Col N="1058" /> amelioration of drainage conditions is practicable between Meelick and the tidal waters. Compensation had been paid for permanent damage where lands have been adversely affected by the Shannon power works. Below Mellick, about 13 miles of embankments have been built and pumping plant has been installed to give complete immunity from flooding to all the lands on the west side of the river from Meelick to Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>In considering the complex problem presented by the river Shannon as a whole, we are satisfied that it would not be possible to provide complete protection for the lands liable to periodic flooding except at altogether prohibitive cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They referred to the fact that in the comprehensive scheme of improvement substantial sums have been provided, amounting to about £700,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>They made certain recommendations, but I do not see any reference to that. They said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The removal of the fixed crest in Keelogue weir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>which may be what the Deputy is referring to; it has been already done, apparently</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and its replacement by lifting boards, together with modifications to the Keelogue and the New Cut sluices, have brought about a definite though small improvement in flood water levels between Banagher and Meelick, and under no conditions has the drainage position in this area been worsened by the Shannon Power Scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputies who are interested in this matter would do better to approach it, if we are to get results, from the point of view advocated by the Parliamentary Secretary, that is to say, to examine what alternative means remain to us <Col N="1059" /> to improve the conditions of the landholders whose lands are periodically flooded by the Shannon. Over a period of time the Land Commission has been alleviating the position and has made very considerable improvements. For example, in the area near Clonfert, about 30 tenants in all have been taken, for some years past, from the flooded areas and transferred to holdings set up for them on estates acquired by the Land Commission, while they were allowed the use of their old holdings. As well as providing those tenants with new holdings, buildings were erected. In the poorer cases the Land Commission supplied the buildings and in other cases they gave a free grant.

      <P>I want to give the Minister and the House an assurance that I raise this matter with my colleagues respecting Leix-Offaly, not in a political spirit but in the spirit in which we believe we are anxious to direct the attention of the Minister to the seriousness of the situation which at present prevails in Tullamore. It is only right and proper that note should be made of the fact that some years ago, when the present Minister for Industry and Commerce occupied a similar position, that he played a good part in assisting the establishment of this industry at Tullamore, in which the local Deputies at the time&mdash;among whom was Deputy Davin, who is now in the House&mdash;figured very prominently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Tullamore has benefited <Col N="1060" /> from this well worthwhile and very good industry since it was established, and I am sure the Minister can safely agree with this, that it is the only manufacturing industry in that provincial town. It is an industry which has kept the home fires burning in many of the 700 homes which are gravely concerned. Seven hundred workers were employed in the mills in Tullamore. Most of those were local boys and girls, and when I say that the seriousness of the situation affects the town of Tullamore principally, it is right to say that it affects the towns of Mountmellick, Daingean and Clara, and the villages of Kilcormack and Clonaslee, because for a radius of 20 miles around Tullamore this industry employed every available girl and provided transport to bring them to their work daily and return them to their homes. Seven hundred people were employed at the best possible rates of pay and under the best possible conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>That staff of 700 has been reduced to 320 approximately and those men and women who were the pioneers of the establishment of this industry and who went to England to become experts in the business now find that they are forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I consider that it is the duty of the Minister to endeavour as far as possible to see that the services of such expert people are retained in our own country. It is a most deplorable and alarming state of affairs and calls for immediate action on the part of the Minister to see that some steps are taken to have employment provided for these key men so that they will not be forced, as they are being forced, to emigrate.</P>
    <P>In this district employment of this nature is very scarce. Of the 60 girls who were employed from the town of Mountmellick, the majority of them have now emigrated as there is no alternative employment. Business houses in Tullamore, where all these people spent their wages, have been adversely affected. As far as I can see from the gravity of the situation the town of Tullamore is slowly becoming and will become, unless some steps are taken to prevent it <Col N="1061" /> from happening, similar to a wayside village.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there are other concerns giving employment in Tullamore but it is well known that the principal provision of employment in that town came from the spinning mills. The loss of wages affects the town very seriously. It affects practically every home in the town. The 340 people who are at present employed are employed for only halftime, whilst the other branch of the industry, the weaving end at Portlaoise, is working full-time and overtime. It is something certainly which needs some explanation.</P>
    <P>I raise this problem because of the seriousness with which the members of the urban district council at Tullamore view it, with which the clergy of Tullamore view it, with which the trades council and citizens of Tullamore view it. Because Deputies of the Opposition are raising it, I would like the Minister to understand that we are raising it with very genuine and sincere motives to be helpful to him and it is in this light that I am directing his attention to the position. He has already received a resolution from the trades council and from the urban district council and he knows that the loss by such a large number of persons of their employment, both boys and girls, must very seriously affect the town.</P>
    <P>As one who is very anxious to help the Minister in this situation and to assist the workers who are concerned, I would ask him to accept the request which has been made by the trades council to call a conference of the management and the workers with an independent chairman, say, from among the senior officers of his Department, or himself, in order that some steps may be taken for the purpose of increasing the production in the mill. My only concern is to see that we get that mill back on its feet again so that full-time employment may be restored to all the workers.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to detain the House on this subject, as Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Davin are anxious to contribute, but I view with the gravest possible concern this situation and I <Col N="1062" /> ask the Minister to take action before it is too late. The good workers are leaving the country and the mill at present is of little use to Tullamore where you have 300 people employed out of 700, with the 300 people only on half-time. The traders of the town are affected as are all branches of life there. The town of Tullamore is one of the most thriving, the most sucessful and prominent business towns in the Midlands and unless something is done it will be reduced to a wayside village. We do not want that to happen and we hope we have the support and co-operation of the Minister in endeavouring to solve the problem that has arisen in Tullamore. We will be grateful for any assistance the Minister can give. I am not raising this from political motives. I am anxious to help the workers by having the Minister's attention drawn to the plight in which the workers of Tullamore are placed at the present time.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say anything now that will prejudge or prejudice in any way the decision of the Minister upon the requests he has received from the Tullamore Trades Union Council on this matter. Since the 2nd October last I have been present at many private meetings and conferences in connection with this very serious state of affairs. In company with other colleagues I met representatives of the workers in Portlaoise on the 29th October. I subsequently met members of the urban council together with representatives of the workers and other interests in the town. Last Sunday we were all summoned by telegram from the Tullamore Trades Union Council to meet representatives of the workers. When my colleagues and I turned up we were met by hundreds of employees, some of them working short time and others out of work, all of whom were waiting to hear what we had to say. I made a suggestion, which was agreed to by my colleagues and eventually agreed to by the trades union council, who had summoned the conference, that it was undesirable to talk in public on a delicate situation of this kind, that I came for the purpose of having a conference with unions covering all classes of <Col N="1063" /> workers in the town, and that I did not think it would serve any useful purpose to address the workers in the circumstances. I discussed the matter privately with members of the traders union council and the representatives of the unions concerned. They eventually decided that the Minister should be requested to use his good offices and his personal influence, if necessary, to summon a conference representing the management and the unions catering for the workers concerned to be accompanied by the Deputies for the constituency and the chairman and secretary of the trades union council. I understood from the Minister's reply to-day that he has not yet given a decision with regard to that matter. I am not going into the merits or demerits of the concern, as I have no expert knowledge in regard to its working. However, I have reliable information from those associated with the management side and with the workers' side.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my views to what has been said by Deputy O. Flanagan and by Deputy Davin. I feel certain that the Minister appreciates the importance of this industry to the town of Tullamore, to County Offaly as a whole and, in fact, to the entire constituency we represent. The fact that this matter has been raised here by three Opposition Deputies is not any indication that <Col N="1064" /> there will be any peculiarly political approach to this grave problem. I recall that on the 9th June, 1949, a Fianna Fáil Deputy representing the constituency of Laois-Offaly raised, by way of parliamentary question, a matter relating to this industry because at the time there was some fear that workers might be leaving Tullamore. The question was properly raised because the industry is of the utmost importance to the town. We are not discussing that or concerned with it now, but the situation as it exists at present, however it was caused, is serious in the utmost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the number of workers who have been laid off and the number who are working short time, the most serious feature is that trained workers are leaving Tullamore and being lost to the country. Should the factory, say, in a month's time, endeavour to open its doors again it will find considerable difficulty in replacing the labour which has been trained over a number of years. I was shocked to learn last week that the laying-off of the overseers employed in the factory has already started. That is a most serious step, and it means that the only door open to these men is emigration. This means a loss of employees who have been trained over a number of years. Whatever decision the Minister may come to I urge on him to realise, and I am sure he will do so, the complete feeling of dismay which has been caused in Tullamore in recent months because of the situation which has arisen in Salts, Limited. All the inhabitants of the town have an interest in this factory, be it monetary or otherwise. They feel that the industry carried on there is part of the town and any suggestion that Salts, Limited, might be in difficulties means a suggestion directed against Tullamore itself. Deputy O. Flanagan, Deputy Davin and I have been concerned in recent weeks with regard to the problem which has grown up. As Deputy Davin stated, it has been suggested that, perhaps, some fact-finding conference might be convened at the instance of the Minister. I do not know whether or not that course would commend itself to him. However, I would urge <Col N="1065" /> upon him that some action of that kind should be taken. It may be that a conference could not remedy whatever working difficulties beset the industry, but it will restore the confidence of the workers.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is such a lack of confidence at present that even the men still working in the factory are applying for passports, with a view to going to England. Even these men who are lucky enough not to be let off feel that there is no future in the industry, and they are seeking employment outside the country. They have no information as to what is happening to the industry and, consequently, lack the confidence necessary to face the future. A conference would at least remedy that situation. It would explain to the employers and the employees the difficulties with which the industry is faced and would enable both management and employees to work together to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any curtailment of output or loss of employment in this industry is, naturally, of very grave concern to the Government. As soon as it appeared likely to develop, the Government took all the action within its power to endeavour to remedy the position, both by curtailing imports of worsted cloths of the kind that would be woven from yarns produced at Tullamore and by imposing a customs duty on yarns of that type also.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke about a fact-finding commission. I do not think we need any commission to find the facts. The Tullamore concern is at present working upon short-time and has been compelled to lay off a substantial number of its workers because it is not getting enough orders for its products to keep it in full production. It is not getting enough orders because of the conditions now prevailing in the woollen and worsted industry due to the trade recession, and, in a special way, to the abnormal stocks of woollen and worsted cloths in the country. The woollen and worsted mills are themselves working to less than capacity and they are the customers of Salts for yarn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> It has been said that one worsted concern in Portlaoighise is working full-time. I am delighted to hear that, and the employees of Salts ought to be delighted, too, because the fact that one concern in that industry is working full-time is an indication that a revival in trade and in the industry will come and with it a flow of orders into Salts which will permit of increased activity there.</P>
    <P>The firm of Salts, like other firms, might have continued to employ workers producing for stock against the time when orders would be resumed. I understand they did so and that they are now holding heavy stocks; but their position was further complicated by another fact of which I think Deputies ought to be aware. In September or October of 1950 Salts were requested by Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, through the Industrial Development Authority to carry more than their normal stock of wool tops. Wool tops are the raw materials used by spinning mills. They were asked to carry four months additional stock of wool tops and in compliance with that request from the Government conveyed to them by the Industrial Development Authority Salts made a purchase of wool tops to that extent. Unfortunately they bought at the top of the market. As the House knows the price of wool began to fall from that time on and has continued falling ever since. The price of wool is now 30 per cent below what it was before the Korean war started. The carrying of these heavy stocks by Salts involved it in a very substantial loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling you the position as it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>And their dividends went up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the existence of these stocks carried at the request of the Government and on an <Col N="1067" /> undertaking given by the Industrial Development Authority that if the price should fall they would be protected against loss by some action of the Government, I advised the Government to reimpose the customs duty. Salts ordinarily sold their products at world prices but the process of liquidating these exceptional stocks makes it impossible for them to do so now and their yarns are at the present time slightly above world prices; yarns sold for weaving into cloth for home consumption are sold at slightly above world prices. That may also have an effect upon their sales although I do not think it can be appreciable.</P>
      <P>It was recognised that Salts would have to carry themselves the corresponding loss upon their normal commercial stocks so that the situation which has developed generally affecting all branches of the woollen industry has hit Salts particularly severely.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to forecast when this position may rectify itself. Sooner or later it certainly will rectify itself. By stopping imports of woollen and worsted cloths and restricting, as we have, imports of yarn we have created a situation where the revival of Salts' trade depends entirely upon internal conditions. The whole of the market for worsted yarns and cloths woven from these yarns is reserved for Irish producers. Normally one would expect a revival of trade in the woollen mills to begin now. The spring period is usually the busiest period in that industry. The existence of these exceptional stocks on the hands of traders undoubtedly complicates the position and there is no means of finding out to what extent these stocks are being reduced or disposed of. The woollen trade throughout the world is still very much depressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an opportunity of discussing that position with the president of the Board of Trade in London this week. He was making representations to me concerning the restrictions we have imposed upon imports from that country and it is obvious that, bad and all as the position has been here because of the recession in the sale of <Col N="1068" /> woollen goods, they have been worse hit in other countries. In fact Salts themselves claim that they are working to a higher proportion of their capacity than is their spinning mill in England. On the other hand, the woollen manufacturers, some of them at least, have told me that they are beginning to get orders again, that they are hoping to expand their production and get back to normal working soon. If that is so then, subject to whatever stocks they may be holding, orders to Salts may be increased.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the request I received to summon a conference. It is obviously no matter of difficulty for me to summon a conference and appoint an officer to preside over it. I would do so if I thought it would do any good. On the other hand, I would not do so if I thought it would do harm. None of the Deputies who spoke in this debate made any suggestion as to what that conference might do. I will discuss the position with the management. I will be quite frank. I notice that in the request I was asked to summon representatives of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Ireland. I understand the management of Salts have an agreement with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. I have seen Press reports which suggest that the Workers' Union of Ireland are now recruiting members amongst Salts' employees. Every Deputy here knows that the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union might refuse to attend a conference at which the Workers' Union of Ireland is represented.</P>

However, as I have said, I have no objection to summoning a conference if there is any reasonable hope it will do any good. I cannot decide on that issue without giving the management an opportunity of expressing their view. They may hold the view that it would do more harm than good to have the intimate affairs of their company discussed at a conference at which political representatives as well as trade union members would be present.</P>
