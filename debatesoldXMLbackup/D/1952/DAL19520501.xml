      <P>In your absence from the Chair last night, Sir, Deputy Killilea stated that in my speech yesterday I referred to a Fianna Dáil meeting held, according to Deputy Killilea, &ldquo;in a hole at Glenamaddy, County Galway&rdquo;.  I drew the attention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the fact that I had not made any such statement.  My statement was &ldquo;in a hall in County Galway&rdquo;.  I verified this later, but Deputy Killilea still persisted that he had got it from the Official Report.  He was asked by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at the time to withdraw the statement, but he did not do so, and so I seek your protection in the matter, and ask that the Deputy be called on to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries in connection with this matter last night and was informed by the official reporters that the document in which the word &ldquo;hole&rdquo; appeared was an uncorrected report and that the corrected report would show that the word &ldquo;hall&rdquo; was the word used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. The statement made by Deputy Killilea definitely throws a slur on the official reporters in giving the impression that a change of words has occurred.  Such is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been a change.  Deputy Killilea has implied that there has, in order to bolster up his own misstatement.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get notice of this, and I should have got notice of what the Deputy intended to raise, so that I would be in a position to understand what he is referring to. If the Deputy wishes to raise any matter, he should give me notice and raise it afterwards in the course of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that when I proved that a statement which was <Col N="755" /> definitely untrue was made in the House, the Deputy making it, even at this stage of his life, would have sufficient honour to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I was dealing last night with the question of industrial revival and pointing out that Fianna Fáil were the people who started the real industrial drive in this country. That industrial drive was interrupted by the last war, which made it impossible for us to obtain raw materials. Immediately the war was over, we resumed and we were getting ahead as fast as we possibly could, in face of the limitations confronting us, with the industrial drive.  No one will deny that we had all the machinery available by way of legislation to proceed with the work of drainage and bog development. That was one of the things in which we had gone a long way, but of course turf development happened to be a Fianna Fáil scheme and the inter-Party Government held that it should not proceed and they killed it overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accusing Deputy Blowick of anything at all.  I would like to accuse sensible and intelligent people; I do not make accusations against people who are irresponsible.  The peat scheme was closed down for the time being and so was the farm improvements scheme. They were closed down for no reason and the result was that all this led to our people not being in a position to produce more peat and more beet and more agricultural produce from the soil.  Then, after Deputy Dillon had a harum scarum canter round the country they brought in a number of what they called new schemes.  In some cases I admit they had made a little improvement on the old ones but in quite a number of other things they wasted an enormous amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of capital development we are told that our Budget has not made any provision for capital development.  When we were doing all these things years ago we budgeted for capital development and we met our debts from day to day, and we did not leave anything over to posterity. When we were budgeting in days gone by we had set a headline to any future Government as to how a country should be run, showing there was no such thing as packing the pawn office with a lot of essentials.  When Deputy McGilligan came in as Minister for Finance for the inter-Party Government he discovered that the Budget he would be introducing would have to jump up from £70.7 millions, as it was in 1947-48, to £123.5 millions for the Budget he was bringing in.  In order to blind the people, to hoodwink and fool them, he divided it under two headings and said: &ldquo;This is only the normal Budget and all the rest is for capital development.&rdquo;  He wanted to try to convince the people that the Budget had not jumped from £70,000,000 to £123,000,000.  Those excuses <Col N="757" /> succeeded, I suppose, in fooling the people for a certain length of time but day after day they got wise to it and began to see through them.  Eventually the people got an opportunity and they decided that that Government was not a fit one to run this country any longer; and again the onus was thrown on us.</P>
    <P>We came in here having to face the huge bill, the trail of destruction left behind, in the same way as we had to face something similar before.  This was not the first time in our life that we had to face terrific responsibilities. When we took over from Fine Gael&mdash; or Cumann na nGaedheal, as it was then known&mdash;in 1932, we had to face a similar position.  We had to try to build up then without the co-operation or assistance of any of the individuals sitting in the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches or any of the individuals supporting them at that time.  As we went along with our national policy, making every effort to develop the country both nationally and economically, we had to fight against the everyday effort of destructive criticism from the Opposition. I need not go into what happened during the economic war.  It does not arise, anyhow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan backed us during the economic war and said we were right, but he has been bought over by Fine Gael, and has become now even a greater rotter than those in the Fine Gael Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to face up to these things, and now we have to face up again to a trail of destruction. Everyone must admit that the cost of public services has been and is going up.  We have had to make provision for pensions, for children's allowances, for wages and salaries of public servants.  All those have been increased.  There are other things that were thrown on top of us&mdash; interest on sinking fund and so on.  We have had to make our minds up as to the best way to get over those things. We decided that further borrowing <Col N="758" /> would be destructive.  We decided that we had to face up to this job, and had to do it as quickly as possible, in order to get the people a clean sheet as soon as we could, and put them in a position to go ahead with further developments. As I pointed out last night, all we might have expected was that the Opposition would at least be truthful and, if they could make any little effort, be honest in their criticism.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Donnellan was telling us yesterday evening about what happened in the hall in Glenamaddy, I noticed that he told the Independent Deputies who support Fianna Fáil that he had nothing to say to them.  I wonder what would any of those Independent Deputies say had they been listening to Deputy Donnellan in Tuam last Saturday night fortnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is an honest effort to overcome the country's difficulties.  It has taken a really strong Government to give us this Budget.  The Minister for Finance deserves praise for having the guts to face the Party and the House in his endeavour to set this country once again on the right road.  He has made an effort to put us in a solid, sound financial position.  Once again we will pay our debts and pay as we go, <Col N="759" /> instead of throwing on future generations the obligation of meeting something which we ourselves are able to meet.  In that way the country will once again be on the road to prosperity and we will find ourselves in the happy position we were in when we handed over to the Coalition Government a few years ago: prosperity facing our people, and in a very short time an industrial revival.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget may be described as the child of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I suggest, however, that it owes its conception to the report of the Central Bank and to the wishes of a Tory Government in Britain. Early in the winter of 1951, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and for Finance, in the heated atmosphere of the luxury hotels of Dublin, in a fragrant cigar-smoke scented atmosphere, amidst odours of rich food and wines, at dinners given by rich industrial magnates and manufacturers' associations, thought fit to advise the working people of the country that they must work harder, produce more, and accept a lower standard of living if they were to continue as they had been in the past.  It is very strange that most of these pronouncements on austerity and requests for retrenchment are given to our people from amidst those luxury surroundings in the presence of people who have enjoyed these things in the past, and who, as far as we can see, will enjoy them in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank in its report indicated to anyone who had the intelligence to read it correctly that the food subsidies should be withdrawn, that consumer goods should be cut down, and that unemployment should be used as a weapon to prevent the workers from enjoying the standard they have had in the past.  In this very House the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured the people of Ireland that it was not the intention of the Fianna Fáil Government to follow that programme, but, significantly enough, Irish Ministers were <Col N="760" /> called to Britain for consultation.  On arrival back they copied the British Government in announcing an earlier date for their Budget, and they copied the British Budget by reducing food subsidies, by taxing consumer goods, and by gilding the pill of these reductions and taxes with a coating of improved children's allowances.  Surely there are very few people in the country who have not noticed the significance of those things.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to the meanest intelligence in Ireland that there is some connection between the Central Bank report, the visits of our Ministers to England, the similarity of our Budget to the British Budget, and the fact that the Minister for Finance said here in his introductory speech that the object of our austerity was to save the £ of our principal customer.  It is a far cry from the day when we were told that we should burn everything English except their coal to a Minister for Finance in an Irish Parliament justifying a hairshirt Budget by saying that it was an attempt to save the British £.</P>
    <P>Deputies in the House and newspapers throughout the country have quoted tables showing the effect of the taxation, the reduction of food subsidies and the improvement in children's allowances on families of different sizes.  I suspect that each family has worked out exactly how much it will lose, because that there will be a loss to all families goes without saying.  The Budget has been described as harsh, cruel, unjust and crushing by one side and by the other as courageous, bold, honest and necessary, but no one has attempted to say that it is an easy Budget.  All of us, no matter on which side we stand, agree that it is going to be more difficult to live this year than it was last year&mdash;but we are told that we must save the British £.</P>
    <P>There are two questions which I should like answered.  First, is there any assurance that the ordinary people of the country will have in the year to come a sufficiency of the ordinary foods used in everyday life in their homes&mdash;bread, butter, tea and sugar? If there is that guarantee will they be <Col N="761" /> available at prices within the people's reach?  I ask that because to my mind the ending of rationing in this country at this time of emergency would be a dangerous step.  Is there anything to indicate that next winter, when the home supplies of milk will be at a minimum, butter will be available even in the rationed amount to every Irish working man?</P>
    <P>Is it not correct to say that there is no such guarantee and that the man with the money can buy up every available lb. of butter in any shop, if he so desires?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>He would have a big job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>He can use it extravagantly. It can be bought by the tourists who flood in here. It can be taken across to Britain and over the Border.  There is no guarantee that there will be reserved for the Irish working man even 1 lb. of butter per week for himself and his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>A ½ lb. is all you allowed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even a ½ lb. is guaranteed now.  There is no guarantee of any sort that even a ½ lb. of butter per head will be available. There is no guarantee that sugar will be available.  Those of us who are connected with certain industries know that butter, milk, chocolate crumb, confectionery, sweets of various types and sweetened fat are being manufactured in huge quantities for export.  In the manufacture of these commodities, sugar is the main ingredient. The manufacturers of these commodities, if this Budget becomes law, will be entitled to secure sugar at a reduced price.  Is there any guarantee that even a minimum amount of this essential commodity will be reserved for the children of Ireland?  In regard to flour, we have been told by the Minister for Agriculture that the amount of wheat sown last week, compared with the same week a year ago, shows no improvement. Is there any guarantee that, with the higher extraction flour, there will be sufficient bread to feed the children of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> It is to be hoped that these scarcities will not occur but I would prefer that the working people should have a definite guarantee of a minimum amount.  Even if these amounts are guaranteed, is there any guarantee that the prices charged will be within the means of the ordinary working people to pay?  In assessing the prices of these foods which are essential for the working people the old controlled price has been taken plus the amount of subsidy that will be withdrawn and the total has been given as the new price.  I suggest that that is merely the price that obtains at the present time.  There is nothing to say that within the year to come, whether as a result of developments outside or difficulties at home, the price of butter, sugar, bread, flour or tea will remain anywhere near the price now listed because it is well known that if this matter is left to the law of supply and demand the scarcer the commodity becomes the dearer the price becomes.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies who may be contemplating supporting this Budget that they will have that responsibility upon them and they will have to face up to the fact that it is their fault if, during the winter to come, Irish women and children have to do without food in a country which should have full and plenty and if they have to do without it in order to uphold the value of the £ sterling.</P>
    <P>There is a further point to which I would like to draw the attention of Deputies.  In this Budget the ordinary people are being called upon to subsidise hoteliers and guest-house proprietors. In future the proprietors of such establishments will be able to offer meals to their guests at a cost to themselves much less than would have been the case if this Budget had not been introduced.  Butter, bread, sugar will be available to them at a reduced price.  Will that benefit be passed on to the hotel guest?  Whether it is or not, the ordinary working people will not get the benefit of any reduction in that direction because the workers who leave home for a day must take with them their mid-day dinner in their pockets or in a basket.  It usually consists of a pint and a sandwich.  Therefore, the ordinary plain people will <Col N="763" /> have to subsidise reduced prices for hotel guests and tourists or increased profits for guest-house owners and hoteliers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said that the £100,000 which he could get by continuing the dance tax was scarcely worth the trouble.  It must be gratifying to the old people of Ireland, to the widow and to the orphan that a Minister of State, who declares that he is badly pressed for money to run the country, can so contemptuously reject £100,000.  It is difficult to believe that he could impose a tax on the working man's pint and smoke and at the same time fail to see that as much as possible would be raised from those who engage in dancing as an amusement.</P>
    <P>Money could be raised from the people who attended Punchestown yesterday and the day before and at race meetings throughout Ireland all the year, at the cinemas of Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick each evening of the week and at all sports meetings throughout the country, no matter under what code they play.  If that effort was made, if these things were taxed to their true capacity, and if additional taxes were placed on the broader shoulders that are better able to bear them I, as a Labour man, perhaps, would have no complaint, but while things are as they are I feel that I would be lacking in my responsibilities to those who elected me if I did not in this House protest in their name against this unjust Budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan looked for an assurance.  Surely he must have heard every Labour man who spoke decrying the withdrawal of the food subsidies. I make this statement in the name of the Labour Party, that should the day come when we have an opportunity of putting any Government into office, and we decide to put a Government into office, we will not do so without a direct guarantee that the subsidies on food shall be restored.  That is pretty clear Labour Party policy.  It did not need to be stated by me or anybody else.  But, in case any wrong impression may have been caused by <Col N="764" /> the series of questions asked by Independent Deputies, I am saying that for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Independent Deputies who may be undecided as to how they vote have a responsibility placed upon them to which they must face up.  There is no such thing as a middle way.  You vote either for or against the burden on the Irish working people; you vote either for unemployment or employment. If they vote for this Budget, they will be voting for an increase of unemployment.  It is their responsibility, but I ask them to give serious thought to it, and may God direct them as to how they should vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Budgets being introduced for practically 40 years.  I heard Budgets being introduced in the British Parliament and in this Parliament.  This is the most vicious Budget ever introduced into an Irish or a British Parliament. Its attack on the way of life of the Irish people is something to be deplored. From the very moment a person gets out of bed in the morning he is being taxed by the Government. The food subsidies were referred to by the last speaker and other Deputies. It is just as well that some of the Independent Deputies should put forward their views on the food subsidies question.  I join with those of the group of the last speaker and the Independent Deputies in what they put forward to the present Government and to the Leader of the Opposition.  I put it to Deputy Costello, or to somebody speaking for him, that it should be made clear to-day that, should they get back to power and form an inter-Party Government, the first thing they will do is to restore the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that that demand should come from those who would be anxious to build up an inter-Party Government such as we have had for three and a half years.  As an Independent Deputy, I want to assure the public, if my voice can get out to them, that the inter-Party Government was the best Government ever.  It gave representation to all sections.  Labour men could make their demands on that Government for what they thought was <Col N="765" /> reasonable and they were always met very fairly and in a friendly way.  The farmers' representatives could do the same and they were met fairly and squarely.</P>
    <P>I hope that the present Government will see the light before this debate is concluded, admit that they have made a mistake and give an assurance that the food subsidies will be restored. Deputy Costello, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy have assured the House that the present Government have estimated for £10,000,000 more than is necessary.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has admitted that there may be a certain percentage of over-estimation, possibly to the extent of 10 per cent.  That 10 per cent. would more than restore the subsidies on bread and butter.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy McQuillan in appealing to both Parties to come together and do something big for the country.  I hold that the bread and butter, the tea and the sugar, the ordinary necessaries of life of the people, whether they be small farmers, workers in industrial centres, or tenement dwellers are being unduly taxed and I say that the food subsidies should be restored.  I hope that the Leader of the Opposition or somebody for his Party will give us some encouragement to believe that that will be one of the first items of their programme when they get back to office in a very short time, because back to office they must get if this Budget goes through.  It is an attack on the way of life of the ordinary individual.  We all know the hospitality of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>If you are passing through a country village and you ask for information at some house you are generally asked: &ldquo;Will you not come in and have a cup of tea?&rdquo; The cup of tea is generally accompanied by bread and butter.  It will be a blot on the Irish people if the Government do anything to prevent that hospitality being continued.</P>
    <P>After the inter-Party Government were deprived of office&mdash;they were entitled to office according to the number of votes cast for what the people believed would be an inter-Party Government&mdash;we had the gloomy speeches <Col N="766" /> of Minister that predicted the downfall of the whole country.  Nobody could understand why they started their gloomy speeches, telling the people not to buy.  When they told the people not to buy, they did not buy and industries started to go slow.  The result was unemployment.  There is more unemployment and emigration in this country than there has been for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>None of the economists so far in this House&mdash;and I am not one I can assure you&mdash;has told us yet the value per head of our best exportable assets, apparently, and that is human beings, boys and girls of 20 and 21 years of age. If I could get from some economist information as to what is the value per head of every person of 21 years, fully reared, educated and ready to go into any employment market in the world, it would be well worth putting on record.  I would like to know from the educational and the training points of view, what the value is of each person who leaves this country, whether they be in professions, in trade or whether they be unskilled workers.  To put it in another way, I would like to know what is the loss in cash value to the country when these people emigrate.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise that food subsidies, so far as bread and butter are concerned, must be restored. It would be well to know from both sides of the House before the Vote takes place what is the view of certain respected members who have not spoken yet, and whose opinion is always worth hearing.  It cannot be that we are going to vote rather blindly without having the knowledge of both sides that it is their intention to consider seriously, if they cannot <Col N="767" /> give a definite guarantee, the restoration of the subsidies.  Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy have stated that the Budget has estimated for £10,000,000 more than is necessary, and Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, has admitted that there may be a certain percentage of over-estimation to the extent perhaps of 10 per cent.  If that is so there is sufficient to restore the subsidies on bread and butter, and we ought to have that guarantee.</P>
      <P>I have not gone into any of the details of the other taxes.  They are all a great burden on the people.  As one Deputy said last night, it appears to be a crime to mention anything about the pint in this House.  The pint is a valuable food to men who are engaged in heavy work.  I would like you to go down to the North Wall and see a man standing on a railway wagon, and a half-ton bucket swinging on the crane.  On tipping over that bucket he must shut his mouth tightly and his eyes when the slack and the gas come from the bucket that is being emptied.  Is that man not worthy of his pint in order to clear his throat because of the work he is engaged on?  The pint is now recognised as a good and valuable food, and I do not know why people criticise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few Deputies have made attacks on the licensed trade for reasons I cannot understand.  It is a good, clean, honourable trade.  There are many farmers' sons engaged in the trade and they are all men of good character. Before they get their licence their character is investigated by various authorities and recommendations must come forward.  There is a very good type of young men working in the licensed trade and they are in danger of losing their employment.  I heard of a case only three weeks ago in which a charge hand in a certain licensed house, who was married and had two children, had entered into certain commitments of house purchase. He put down £120 to buy his house.  This man accepted a commitment of £2 per week to a building society.  Recently he was told by his <Col N="768" /> employer that, on account of the decrease in sales brought about by this Budget, he would have to be dismissed. This man has to seek employment elsewhere but where is he to get it; the other houses are similarly situated. The only hope for that man is to emigrate.</P>
    <P>Our drapery houses are also dismissing hands.  There have been one or two men dismissed from every drapery house within the last six months due, I say again, to the gloomy and depressing speeches by Front Bench members of the Government.  Their speeches have created unemployment and hardship. Only last week the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, made a speech and in that speech I noted with great interest the words: &ldquo;If we are to save ourselves we must be more frugal, we must be more thrifty, we must work harder.&rdquo;  Is there any man in this House who would have the courage to stand up and tell the old age pensioner that he must be more frugal; to tell the retired teacher who is on a small pension, the retired postman, the retired Córas Iompair Éireann official, the retired civil servant, that he must be more frugal?  He has not sufficient to buy the ordinary necessaries of life at the new prices and his clothes are brushed threadbare.  There are some 100,000 of that type who are on the lowest possible income.  How are they to live more frugally unless they purchase less goods, less food, bringing about malnutrition and hardship? These people ought to be considered. No matter where the Government get the money to carry on I appeal to them not to obtain it at the expense of the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>Other members have suggested looking around in order to find luxuries that can be taxed.  I do not know what luxuries there are that are not taxed at the moment.  It is not my job to know.  My job, and I will continue that job, is to put forward grievances every time I get the chance.  I will leave it to those who are in power, and who have excellent men at the head of their staffs to give them advice, to suggest ways of bringing about taxation that will cause the least possible hardship.  This Budget <Col N="769" /> is bringing about the maximum hardship that it was possible to impose on any people's shoulders.  I was speaking quite recently to a man&mdash;Deputy Briscoe was speaking to another or produced a letter in a similar case&mdash; who said that he was 5/11 short of getting the ordinary necessaries of life, allowing for all the concessions given. I was speaking within the last week to a railway worker and he was one of those men, too, who brushed their clothes threadbare because they could not afford to buy a second suit of clothes.  He felt that as prices were, he would be able to provide for his family with the wages which he had. Due to the taxes imposed by this Budget, he has to do with three packages of cigarettes less.  He informed me that he would have to find 9/6 per week extra in order to give his children the ordinary necessaries which he was giving them before the present Budget came into operation. Circumstances such as these will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Government whether they have anything in mind that will produce employment.  Some thousands of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16 leave the ordinary schools and the Christian Brothers' schools every year.  I would like to know what is in store for that type of person.  Have such people to face the emigrant ship? Are those boys and girls going to leave the country and are we going to lose the benefit of their brains and their abilities, which would be so useful in building up the strength of this country?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House much longer, but I would ask the Government, if possible, to restore the food subsidies, especially on bread, on butter, on tea and on sugar.  When that has been done, it will be a matter for the Government to devise ways and means of getting the money to carry on the affairs of the country. Everybody admits that a certain amount of money has got to be procured in order to carry on.  Bearing in mind that the 2 lb. loaf will be increased from 6½d. to 9d., the butter from 3/- per lb. to 3/10 per lb., the sugar from 4d. per lb. to 6½d. per lb., and that we do not know what tea is <Col N="770" /> going to cost, I feel that this is the most vicious Budget ever introduced into an Irish Parliament.  Therefore, I appeal to the leaders of the Front Bench Opposition to give us some idea of what their intention is, if they get back to power at an early date, with regard to the restoration of the subsidies, so that bread and butter can be sold at their present price.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister for Finance presented his Budget proposals to the House some weeks ago, a lot has been said from the Opposition side of the House against the proposals he intends to put forward. A lot has been said from this side of the House in favour of what he intends to do.  I suppose, no matter how I <Col N="771" /> try to avoid it, I will inevitably find myself travelling, to some extent, at least, the ground already covered by many of the previous speakers. However, I feel I should not let the occasion pass without putting forward my views in respect of the Budget.</P>
      <P>If we, as a community, deem social services and other services to be necessary, if we consider we must have social services in order to fortify weaker sections of our people against the ordinary perils of life, and if we are in agreement on that issue, we are automatically committed to find the necessary money to finance expenditure incurred by these services.  If it takes a certain pool of money to pay our current expenses in respect of social services and other services, I feel that, no matter how you try to juggle with figures, you cannot reduce the minimum pool of money which is required to pay for these services.  I say from business experience with authorities they cannot segregate successfully particular items under particular headings by reducing the original amount.  In fact, if you try to juggle with figures, the ultimate amount that will emerge will be enlarged rather than reduced by any juggling or any segregation of the particular items.  I would, therefore, say, as far as this Budget is concerned, to all those honest people who believe in paying their lawful debts and honouring their financial and other commitments no detailed explanation is necessary.  To the people who do not believe in paying their debts and honouring their financial commitments no explanation is possible.  We have been charged by responsible members of the Opposition of under-valuing revenue and over-estimating our expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an endeavour made to substantiate that statement by many prominent Opposition speakers.  I regard this, and many people for whom I speak regard this, as a trick statement of a cunning lawyer, and we feel that there is no real foundation whatever for it.  I will admit that there are decent people who fully realise the necessity for this Budget and who fully <Col N="772" /> realise that the burden that must be placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers will have to be a heavy one, but they are not altogether in agreement as to how that burden has been distributed.  Many alternative proposals have been put forward by Opposition speakers with regard to the distribution of the Budget.  Suggestions were made that bicycles should be taxed, that an additional tax should be put on wirelesses, and there were other suggestions put forward.  It seems to me that there were not any real concrete proposals put forward by any members of the Opposition as to how alternative sources of revenue could be arrived at.</P>
    <P>I say that this Budget is not as hard as would strike the eye at the first glance, and that steps have been taken to cushion its impact on the poorer, weaker and most needy sections of our community.  Those people in receipt of children's allowances will find that these allowances will be substantially increased from a date after the 1st July.  Let us take, for instance, a man with a wife and four children's.  At the present time he receives annually an income from children's allowances of £13.  He will find that, after the 1st July, his annual income from this source will have increased to £27 10s., that is an increase of over 100 per cent. That will, to a very great extent, help to offset for a man with a wife and four children the increased burden to which he will have to face up when the increased prices come into operation. The old age pensioner will find that his allowance has been increased to a sufficient degree, on the basis of present consumption, to offset the increased charges which he will have to face as a result of the withdrawal of certain subsidies.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have mentioned the racing industry as a source from which very substantial revenue could be derived.  I can speak with a fair amount of authority as far as wagering, and so forth, is concerned.  The position at present is that if a man goes into a starting price office and puts down £6, six to four on, and if he wins, he is entitled to draw £10.  When he goes to draw his winnings he finds that no less than 15/- out of his wining <Col N="773" /> nings of £4 is deducted for the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a fairly substantial amount of tax to have to pay.  I do not believe there is any real scope there for any further increase of tax.  As a matter of fact, an increase in the betting tax might have the effect of curtailing betting activities rather than increasing revenue.  Let us examine the position from the point of view of the course bookmaker who attends six meetings a week and bets at six races at every meeting.  He would not be a very substantial bookmaker if he was holding £50 a race.  Whether he wins or loses at these races, he finds that after a week's attendance at the race meetings he owes a sum of £45 to the Racing Board apart altogether from whatever other overhead expenses he may have to meet.  That is a substantial sum of money for a bookmaker in a small way of life to have to pay to the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that the tax is already very heavy and that it is obvious that there is no possibility whatsoever of deriving additional revenue from that source.</P>

      <P>I suppose that the matter of the remission of the dancing tax can be described as having been worn threadbare.  I should like to cite a particular case in point.  A tax collector who lives in Limerick City motors to the Dingle Peninsula, in West Kerry, to ensure that a group of small fishermen there who hold a dance observe the dance-tax regulations.  I wonder if the revenue derived from such small functions compensates for the expense incurred by the tax collector in travelling down to small towns in the Dingle Peninsula&mdash;Ballydavid and so forth&mdash;in order to ensure that the fishermen there will not evade <Col N="774" /> the dancing tax.  Surely that is a cumbersome way of obtaining revenue. I do not think a real argument can be put forward in favour of the continuance of the dancing tax.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a rotten feature of that dancing tax.  It sometimes happens in small towns that people may decide to hold a dance and to devote the proceeds to charity.  We all know that, no matter how honest we may be in other spheres of life, we are all inclined to evade the dancing tax.  Many citizens whose integrity is unquestionable in every other respect are tempted to evade that tax, and if they know you when you are going into a dance hall they will give you a ticket without a stamp.  There was wholesale evasion of the dance tax, and it was a tax which tempted people to be dishonest.  For these reasons, I think the dance tax was most undesirable. Some other method should be devised whereby revenue can be obtained from the managements of dance halls, because the system which has been in operation would not commend itself to anybody.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the Opposition side of the House have described this Budget as a rich man's Budget.  In that connection I should like to refer to the matter of income-tax.  It is estimated that 188,000 people in this country pay income-tax.  Under the proposals in this Budget, 170,000 persons out of the total of 188,000 who pay income-tax will obtain relief.  Not alone will the remaining 18,000 income-tax payers compensate for the relief which is being provided to the other 170,000 persons but, in addition, they will contribute over £750,000 additional revenue to the Exchequer.  That is a very fair wallop, if you like, at the higher income groups.  I do not think that this Budget can, in fairness, be described as a rich man's Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to us all that there was an easy and a popular way of escaping the criticism which the presentation of this Budget has caused.  If this Fianna Fáil Government had not had the moral courage to face its obligations, it could have adopted the easy way out and continued to live on our capital.  That is the solution which the Coalition Government had.  I do <Col N="775" /> not think that any country could continue to live on its capital for very long.  No business establishment or anybody in a commercial line of life could continue such a system indefinitely. It is obvious that a crumbling must inevitably set in with a consequent breakdown in the economic fabric of the State.  I am certain that those people who are now loudest in their condemnation of this Budget would be the spearhead of attack when the affairs of this country would become chaotic and the people reduced to an abysmal pit of misery as a result of the foolish policy of living on one's surplus moneys.  When that crumbling would take place the people who would suffer most would be the poorer sections of the community.  I should not like to be associated with any Government which would pursue such a shortsighted policy.  I should break away from such a Government at the earliest possible moment rather than allow myself to be roped into the company of people who, for the sake of political popularity, would pursue that line of policy.</P>
    <P>If that crumbling I have referred to did not take place, if there was not a breakdown in the economic structure of the State, there would be only one other side to it and that would be the sacrifice of the national integrity of our people.  I do not think the latter would commend itself to any Government, even to an inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about capital development.  I want as a Deputy to see the capital development programme go forward without any retarding or frustration.  If we desire it is it not worth while to make a little sacrifice to ensure that it will continue?  Is it not worth while practising a little self-denial to ensure its success?  The Government at present is asking the people to do that.  May I say with all sincerity that if I have to vacate office on any issue, I should like to do so on the issue of the Budget because I could recall with pride in future years that I fell on an honest proposal?  I hate public meetings and I detest holding up people at chapel gates as they come out from Mass but while <Col N="776" /> this Budget controversy continues I shall take every opportunity of defending it in public, presenting it as it is in its true form and of explaining why as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party I support it.  I shall accept without reserve the decision of the people when they have an opportunity of registering their feelings in connection with it.</P>

      <P>A lot has been said about unemployment. I hate to make personal remarks in this House or anywhere else, but we had two Dublin lawyers down in my town of Abbeyleix some short time ago, shedding crocodile tears about the unemployed, but these people did not tell their listeners that they increased the national debt of this State to the tune of £70,000,000. In the constituency of Leix-Offaly, the biggest constituency in all Ireland, embracing an area from the River Barrow to the River Shannon, and from the borders of Westmeath to the borders of North Tipperary, during the period that that £70,000,000 was recklessly dissipated, not one new industry was established.

      <P>The people who allowed in 8,500,000 square yards of manufactured cloth and the people who supported that Government were the spearhead of the agitation when the workers' destiny was thrown into jeopardy and endangered some few months ago.  Such dishonesty, such inconsistency, such insincerity, has tended to degrade the status of the people occupying public office in this country.  I think it is an appalling thing that it should happen.  I do hope that public life in this country which seems to be passing through a transition period at present, will eliminate that kind of undesirable practice.  It is a pity that it should happen, that anybody should wish to play on the feelings of the gullible sections of the people who have not the full facts before them to enable them to make up their minds as to what is good for them or what is bad for them.</P>

    <P>Deputy MacEoin said here the other night that some of the younger members of the Fianna Fáil Party, if they could divest themselves of their Party ties, would not hesitate to go in with the Opposition to vote against this Budget.  I believe that I am the youngest member of the Fianna Fáil Party, though I am not quite sure, and I can say that could I divest myself of Party affiliations and divorce myself entirely from everything that happened for the past three and a half years and, if the facts were presented to me as I see them now so far as this Budget is concerned, even if my <Col N="778" /> political career and my existence depended on it, I have not the slightest doubt that I would not hesitate to go in and vote in favour of the proposals the Minister has made.  I say that believing it to be true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen cited the case of a county council in the operation of its finances when he was speaking here the other night.  I think a belief has grown up amongst our people that we can juggle with figures, that we can avail of hire purchase facilities and other facilities and live in this way beyond our means and permanently improve our position.  That is not so. I want to cite a particular case as I experienced it on a local authority in County Laois.  We there were presented some few months ago with the question of laying off some men, a thing that is not desirable.  We did not want to do it but the pool of money we had was not sufficient to maintain the number of men we had in our employment.  I just want to cite this incident to illustrate a practice which has grown up amongst some of our people.</P>
    <P>We decided to mortgage the incoming rates, the rates for the year 1952-53, and we did that to the extent of £16,000 in order to avoid displacing men during the winter months of the year.  When it came to the question of funding that debt that we had incurred with the full knowledge of what we were doing, the Labour element in the council&mdash;at least one of them&mdash; said: &ldquo;Why should we pay, why not defer it?&rdquo; That sort of attitude is responsible for a lot of the cheap political nonsense that is going on in this country.  That attitude is being promoted amongst the rank and file members of the Labour Party.  All sorts of hares are kicked up that you can do this and do that on credit.  You have, however, to face the plain fact, the courageous one, that you must pay your way or else dishonour your debts. If you do not do that, the inevitable result is there waiting for you.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the increase in the price of the pint.  The 3d. increase in the price of the pint will bring in a revenue of £2,400,000. That amount would be a little more <Col N="779" /> than one-third of what is required to service the sinking fund and interest on the national debt.  It would take an increase of 9d. to pay for the antics and the bad debts incurred by our predecessors. The increased revenue on tobacco, amounting to £5,500,000, would not be enough to pay for the jump from £4,000,000 to over £10,000,000 in the servicing of the sinking fund and interest on the national debt.  I do not think, therefore, that the people who constituted the inter-Party Government can face the people with a very positive front in the belief that they were doing the right thing, and that if they had been allowed to continue their policy they would have conferred lasting benefits on our people.</P>

      <P>We could do what our predecessors did.  We could provide a Budget that would afford easements to the toiling masses, but we will not do that for the sake of political popularity. We will not adopt a system of book-keeping under which we will put current expenses under the heading of capital expenses and shackle posterity to such an extent that posterity might well wonder why our people ever fought for freedom.  That is what would happen if we were to impose the economic burdens on posterity that the inter-Party Government <Col N="780" /> tried to impose on them.  We are giving posterity a chance to compete at least on equal terms with other countries when their time comes. We are not going to pass the baby to them.  It is our intention to pay our way, and if the people decide we should not pay our way we will accept their verdict.  I have no doubt whatsoever that thinking people will throw their weight whole-heartedly behind those who are advocating this policy of paying one's way and not going, hat in hand, to every moneylender and financier who is prepared to tie us up so long as the borrower's bargaining position is worsened and so long as the lender can dictate the conditions under which we may live and get his full lb. of flesh in the end through the medium of the surrender we would be forced to make had we allowed the people now in opposition to drive the country into that situation.</P>
      <P>We will take our stand on this Budget.  If we fall we will accept the verdict.  Deputy Byrne has asked the Leader of the Opposition to make a statement in relation to food subsidies. I can tell Deputy Byrne now that he will get no such statement.  If he is depending on that statement to cast his vote and if that statement is one that will help him to make a decision and to vote either for or against this Budget, I have not the slightest doubt but that he will vote for Fianna Fáil, because that statement will not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Because of its administration public life will no longer be reduced to the low level to which certain efforts that were made would have reduced it.  We will stand or fall on this Budget.  I am wholeheartedly behind every syllable the Minister uttered in his Budget speech.  I do not like public meetings, but I shall miss no opportunity of going before the <Col N="781" /> public and defending this Budget because I believe I have something worth while to defend; I have something honest, something sincere and something right.  This is a serious endeavour to repair the economic fabric of the State and put it back in the fortified position in which it was some three and a half to four years ago.  This Budget will require a little self-denial. It demands a little sacrifice.  I believe the people will rise to the occasion and there will be no doubt about the benefits of a permanent nature that will eventually flow from it.  The people will be enabled to maintain their present standard of living.  It will be possible to achieve better standards in relation to the development of our national resources, in relation to the development of our bogs, the financing of rural electrification, the rehousing of our people and the many other State services we all desire for our people, and our people deserve.  In order to ensure their continuance we must apply corrective measures now so that development will not be retarded or held up in any way.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his fearless and honest Budget.  I am confident it will be successful and I am equally confident that it will be beneficial to our people.</P>

      <P>I can quite sympathise with Deputy Maher in his objection to public meetings, after-Mass meetings and all that sort of thing. I can sympathise with him even more when he goes on this proposed tour of public meetings, particularly if he takes the line he has taken here to-day and talks about public integrity and political honesty and morality, if he has present at his meetings any of those who participated in the election some 12 short months ago: he may have some who listened to the Minister for Finance when he gave the most emphatic pledge ever given by a public man that if Fianna Fáil were elected his Government would not contemplate the reimposition of duties on beer, spirits, tobacco and all the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Deputy Maher not recollect that?  Was Deputy Maher one of the cheer leaders at the back of the crowd and did he then go down to Abbeyleix <Col N="782" /> and say: &ldquo;These are the men that I am proud to soldier behind and, if necessary, fall and die behind&mdash;these men, who never broke their word, with a sense of integrity in politics and careful of morals in politics.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were votes to be got then, hundreds of thousands of votes.  After the election it was not a case of hundreds of thousands of votes.  Political success, the achievement of power, the capture of office did not depend on hundreds of thousands of votes.  It then boiled down: it depended on two or three votes.</P>
    <P>The campaign of some of those two or three Deputies had ranged round the vital question of food subsidies. One had even gone so far as to advocate increased food subsidies.  But, whether those people, with a high sense of national integrity and so careful of honesty in political life, that Deputy Maher is so proud of, would achieve office or not depended on the votes of the people.  They claimed at the election to have them elected for the maintenance of food subsidies and even for increases.</P>
    <P>The leaders that Deputy Maher is now so proud of, that he is so proud to follow and fall behind, had such a great sense of honesty in politics that they did not rely on a speech by Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Lemass, in which emphatic pledges were given, but they had to bring out a manifesto with 17 points which was published in every newspaper up and down the land.  Point 15 in that manifesto, that declaration of policy, that so-called, and accepted, honourable declaration of intentions by honourable men, pledged the leaders of whom Deputy Maher is so proud to maintain food subsidies.  When the food subsidies are reduced, and when the pledges with regard to beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco are swallowed and trampled on in the dirt and in dishonour, this Deputy comes in and sticks out his chest, bulging with pride to be behind leaders who dishonoured those pledges and trampled on that manifesto.</P>
    <P>So much for the fudge.  You can create a fog with any kind of talk and nonsense.  We have had that fog all over the country for the last 11 <Col N="783" /> months.  I have never accused the people opposite of stupidity.  I have never accused them of not being politically alert.  They were on this side when we were the Government, and they were the best attenders that ever were in opposition in this country. There was no official document ever issued that was not studied with magnifying spectacles and under a microscope.  Those men, week after week, and month after month, were aware of the financial position of this country, of the American loan and its expenditure, and of how it was being expended, the balance of payments, the Estimates and the Exchequer receipts.</P>
    <P>When the general election came, they were in possession of all that information.  They knew very well what the financial position of the country was.  Was there any hint of drastic crushing taxation?  Was there any hint of reimposing and increasing the taxes on beer, cigarettes and tobacco?  Was there any hint of reducing the food subsidies and of increasing the price of the loaf by 3d. and of butter by 10d. per lb.?  Far from that, there was an emphatic pledge given from every Fianna Fáil platform that such would not be done.</P>
    <P>I myself made a speech in the City of Cork, in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency.  He remembers the answer.  I have it here.  When I suggested that, when Fianna Fáil were in office before, they imposed taxes on beer, cigarettes and tobacco and I asked my hearers to be careful that, if they let them back, they would not do the same again, it was not sufficient to leave it to candidate Lynch, candidate McGrath, candidate MacCarthy or candidate Furlong to contradict me and repudiate that suggestion, but the deputy-leader of the Party, the present Tánaiste, had got to be brought down specially to Cork City to ram that suggestion down my throat, and to tell the public in Cork that they had no intention whatsoever, if returned to power, to reimpose those duties, and that at a time when they knew thoroughly well the whole financial <Col N="784" /> position of the country and its inherent soundness.  In case the Parliamentary Secretary may not remember the date, it was the night of the 12th May, 1951.  The speaker was Mr. Seán Lemass, and his references were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister had said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would increase the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Why should such taxes be necessary?  There is no such reason why we should reimpose those taxes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is no truth in the promise.  With regard to this Budget, I would say to those Deputies who are perturbed with regard to the new taxes, the subsidies, etc., that we have in it a clear contrast between the policies and outlook of the present Government and the past.  We have running through this Budget, in comparison with the Budgets of the last four years, a clear picture of the policy and the outlook, the social outlook, of the two Governments.  Here you have, in the main, a Budget that is going to scoop in big money, and that is going to scoop it in easily, without labour and without cost, but in gigantic amounts.</P>
      <P>The only way to get that money easily, the only way to get that money in greater amounts without labour and without cost is by putting the hand into the trouser pocket or the purse of the poorest people to get it; get it from the many rather than from the few and, above all, get it through articles which the public cannot avoid buying, beer, tobacco and cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an advocate or champion of the heavy drinker, but I do not think that the moderate man or the man who can even be regarded as an abstemious man or the moderate <Col N="785" /> smoker should be the targets for the Minister for Finance.  Here we have the masses of the people being mulcted to the tune of many millions of pounds in their beer, tobacco and cigarettes. In addition to that, we have the huge drawback on the poorest people in the land by the reduction in the subsidies, particularly the subsidies on bread and butter.</P>
    <P>I have spent 30 years as a professional man, and I have been in and out of the houses of the poor throughout the greater part of that period. I know how they live.  Apart altogether from statistical researches and returns of diets according to financial standing and according to social status, everyone knows that the lower down you go on the wealth scale the more the family depends on bread and the higher you go up the scale of wealth the less the family depends on bread.  In the wealthy household, in the well-to-do household, and even in the middle-class, household, you have meat, vegetables, puddings, fruit and eggs.</P>
    <P>The more alternatives you have in the way of diet the less you depend on bread.  In the house of the workers and the poorer people dessert, puddings, the 6d. egg and the uncontrolled meat are things rarely if ever seen.  They have three meals a day, three meals of bread and, perhaps, one of bread and butter.</P>
    <P>The very movements of population make that more and more pronounced apart from the financial factor.  As we build on the flanks of the Cities of Dublin and Cork, the more we root workers out from the centre of the city and send them to Crumlin and Kimmage in Dublin or to Spangle Hill in Cork the more you have workers trekking in over fair distances to their work but trekking in such distances that they cannot get back for lunch. They are forced more and more to partake of bread and butter or the bread and spread diet.  In so far as bread is used by the wealthier classes it is white bread, better looking bread. In this Budget you are actually subsidising the wealthier classes at the expense of the poor.  That is being done by a Party whose leaders gave every pledge, oral and written, that <Col N="786" /> there would be no interference with subsidies and that there would be no new tax on beer, cigarettes and tobacco.  When any Deputy bulges out his chest at such dishonoured pledges and does it as a young man new to public life, one is inclined to ask what will he bulge with pride for before he is finished?</P>
    <P>As I have said we have a contrast in policies.  What was the policy of the previous Government incorporated in one, two, three and four Budgets? What was the policy of the previous Government which lost the support of very many of its most influential supporters?  That is well known to those opposite.  It was a policy of keeping down the cost of living at any cost politically.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that we faced up to a bakers' strike rather than allow bread to increase by ½d. a loaf.  Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary had some idea at least in the City of Cork of the loss of political support, but rather than allow the price of bread to be increased by ½d. we faced up to the situation.</P>
    <P>The next thing was a threatened butchers' strike, and rather than let the price of meat increase we faced the same situation.  Right on through four Budgets there was no increase in the price of the necessaries of life. Fuel did increase in price.  We had the election campaign, fought to a great extent on the increased cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>Butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the 2d. on butter.  That was 11 months ago. What would people give to get back to the prices that were in operation last June?  I should like to remind the Government that when you increase the price of tobacco, cigarettes, beer or porter on the poorer classes you do not make them teetotallers.  I am not talking about the hard drinkers.  I am talking of the two pints a week man, the ten cigarettes a day man and the ten cigarettes a day woman.  What is the first effect?  That little luxury, if you like, will cost more.  There is something less for somebody behind the line.  There is something less in the home.  There is something less for the <Col N="787" /> woman of the house, and if the woman of the house gets something less there will be something less for the children.</P>
      <P>But if in addition to that you increase prices by decontrolling meat and bacon, you increase the price of butter, and on top of all that you increase the price of bread, and cause another huge increase in the price of butter.  You increase the price of tea and the price of sugar.  How is that met?  Many Deputies opposite could answer that question.  Any medical man opposite could answer that question.  When the prices of foodstuffs go up or when income goes down in the poorer home what is the result?  The result is less food and less purchasing.  There must be less.</P>
      <P>I have been in and out of the houses of men in employment, men who went sick or came out of employment.  The weekly income fell.  What steps were taken?  What is the first step in most houses?  To buy a lb. of meat less that week; to buy a few ounces of butter less that week; to buy half a pint or a pint less milk and make it up in the jug with water.  When the money is not there to buy, you must stretch further what can be bought, but the end result is less food, less nourishment, less nourishing types of food.</P>
      <P>Here we have a country in which one of the bigger courses is tuberculosis, where we have a range of malnutrition amongst children and where the corrective stage is in the early days and where two of the biggest correctives, if not preventives, are milk and butter, and we shoot up the price of butter, first by 2d., then by another 2d. and finally by 10d.; put 3d. on the loaf of bread, a couple of pence on sugar, a figure unknown on tea and tax the pint, the packet of cigarettes and the ounce of tobacco and close our eyes to the family behind all that. There is the contrast in policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have no nonsense talked. There were four Budgets by the previous Government with none of these things interfered with.  We had a régime where the political mills opposite got feeding through the political loss of the previous Government due to its ruthless standing over the <Col N="788" /> prices of the essentials of life and friends who fell away from us found champions over there.  Now, the end result is that the poorer families must be sacrificed.  Sacrificed for what? Sacrificed for a political catch-cry that was uttered cheaply last July.  Politicians got so enmeshed in their own political catch-cries that they became entangled and could not escape so that they had to give an appearance of reality to the speeches made.</P>
    <P>As I say, last June they knew the whole financial position.  It was there on record&mdash;borrowings, spendings, revenue, expenditure.  Was there any hint of drastic steps having to be taken?  On the contrary, there was every assurance that there would be no new taxation, no interference with subsidies, and then the first round of the political circus was when they played ball with their more powerful friends in the financial sense and prices began to rise week after week, with more increases in the cost of living than in the previous three years.  What was the cry then?  &ldquo;Oh, the stack of price recommendations left on the Minister's table by his predecessor.&rdquo; That could not be nailed at the crossroads. Every Deputy over there was making the same speech.  It could only be nailed here but the Dáil was not in session.  When the Dáil did meet, a question was put down&mdash;what recommendations were there lying waiting?  Canned peas and beans, newspaper advertisements and coal in one provincial town&mdash;but there had been three months of lies spluttering up and down the country, three months in which the back boys in every town and village had something to throw at their political opponents.  It did not matter if it turned out to be a political falsehood&mdash;it served its purpose for the time being.</P>
    <P>The next thing was that the Horseman of the Apocalypse came out and doom, catastrophe and disaster, an appalling gigantic adverse balance of trade, financially, the bottom of the barrel scraped bare and bankruptcy ahead were suddenly discovered.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and every one of them were off to the same tune at the same moment, all marching to the <Col N="789" /> beat of the drum, absolutely in step&mdash; left, right; left, right&mdash;down through the country.  The Royalettes were never as well drilled as the boys behind in the Fianna Fáil Party.  We had these gentlemen in every village in Ireland talking about sterling balances, the adverse trade balance and the loss of sterling assets and many of them did not know but that sterling assets were some new kind of vegetable.  They were all on the same note, however, all together and all whistling the same tune.</P>
    <P>They were all pointing to Great Britain, to France and to different European countries, with their austerity budgets and their heroic efforts to avoid bankruptcy, and making it appear to simple, honest people that our position was the same as theirs&mdash;war-blasted countries, emerging from war, even though victorious, bleeding, crippled, bankrupt and broke, with their whole economies disrupted, with their powers of production blasted, their trade gone, and their recuperative powers entirely in abeyance.  Such countries had to take the most drastic steps&mdash;austerity, stop spending, and have your people producing not for themselves but for export&mdash;to steady up the adverse balance of trade, with taxation to avert bankruptcy.  It is unforgivable for anyone to suggest that that was the position in our country.  Such a suggestion undermines confidence and credit.  We were one of the two strongest, most credit-worthy countries in Europe, one of the three strongest, most credit-worthy countries in the world.  We escaped the war.  We made money out of the war, big money, undreamt of money; and our only complaint was that we could not spend it, that we could not get the things that were required and that money would buy.</P>
    <P>We could not get the wherewithal for building.  We were going without houses, we were going without hospitals, we were going with tumbledown schools, because we could not buy building materials.  Our land was going hungry, getting weak and debilitated, becoming rapidly nonproductive, because we could not buy heart for the land, because we could <Col N="790" /> not buy fertiliser.  Our industries were beginning to work at half-cock.  We could not buy machinery.  Transport was defective, backward, nearly primitive, because we could not buy it.  On the land we had none of the modern equipment, because it could not be bought.  But what had we?  We had a growing, growing, growing mountain of pounds; we had a huge pile of banknotes with dry rot in the centre, deteriorating at the rate of 1/- per £1 per year, so that over a period of ten years the value of that money had crumbled by practically 50 per cent. The money was lumping up, but the goods could not be bought.  That was our position.  Unlike all the other countries referred to, we had too much money, too little goods&mdash;two ample factors for production&mdash;but the facilities were not available.</P>
    <P>Then we reached the time when these things could be purchased, when we could get people the houses, when we could build hospitals, when we could build schools, when we could get fertiliser, machinery, tractors, transport.  That paper money, that mountain of money, as far as was required was converted into those necessaries.  As rapidly as could be, we got building materials, we got tractors, we got fertilisers, we got coal, we got machinery, we got timber, iron and steel; and that mountain was reduced in size.  When that process was going on there was, naturally and necessarily, an adverse trade balance.  It was retrospective buying, resulting in a temporary adverse balance of trade.  On top of that, you had the serious turn some 20 months ago in the Korean war and you had more threatening clouds coming over Europe.  We had the present Government, from these Opposition Benches, denouncing us for our timidity with regard to stockpiling and we had question on the Order Paper week after week to the effect that we were not doing sufficient.  We did a reasonable amount of precautionary stockpiling, retrospective buying, sensible and prudent stockpiling.  Then at the back of that we had a plan for increasing, and increasing rapidly, the production of our land so as to boost up our exports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> What is there to cry about there? What is there to whine about there? Was there anything unsound, financially or economically, in that policy? The only regret is that it could not be done sooner and that it could not be done on a larger scale.  Mind you, that work is continuing, but while they are continuing our work they are blackguarding us because we did it better and more efficiently than they.</P>

Then we come to this &ldquo;financial bankruptcy&rdquo; and we have even to-day this heat, this innuendo with regard to the United States of America, that we should not take a loan from the United States of America if we are to safeguard our independence.  We had the false heat yesterday of the Minister for External Affairs repudiating that, saying that such a suggestion was scandalous.</P>
      <P>Did he read the speech of the Tánaiste, I think it was down in Wexford, where he said that we could easily lose our independence through participating in loans?  Did he read Deputy Vivion de Valera, speaking somewhat similarly?  We had one of the full-blooded sisters of the <i>Irish Press</i> quoted here yesterday, the <i>Derry Journal</i>; and the <i>Derry Journal</i> did not put a tooth in it when they said in that article that, because we had accepted money from America, or if such money were to be accepted, the money would be so conditioned that the sovereignty of this country would disappear.</P>

      <P>Every time the little ship here rocked, the steadying hand was reached across the Atlantic, and it was never anything but a helpful hand and a friendly hand.  It is disgraceful that we should have reached <Col N="792" /> the day when either front benchers or back benchers of a Government Party would bite the hand that so often fed them.  Yet we have that; we had it yesterday evening and we have it to-day.  In the course of this debate we had a lot of suggestions that if we were the Government we would do the same as the present Government, that we would cut subsidies and tax the things that they taxed.  In view of some of the things I have just read, some of the pledges, some of the protestations, in view of this manifesto sent out by Fianna Fáil on the eve of the election of the Taoiseach pledging themselves to maintain the food subsidies, in view of the declarations when there were a few votes which might be caught, the clear and emphatic declarations by the present Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce that they would not reimpose the taxes on beer, stout, tobacco and cigarettes, in view of the fact that those pledges, given orally and in writing and circulated through every newspaper in the country, are not yet 12 months old, and when you have a Budget such as this, well may you repeat the phrase from the speech of the Minister for Finance to the effect that the people were being asked to decide whether politics in Ireland were to be a dirty game, played by confidence tricksters who are prepared to promise anything so as to dupe the people into voting for them. That should be framed in every homestead.</P>

      <P>So much for the promises regarding subsidies.  All I <Col N="793" /> can say is that performances are and should be much more convincing than promises.  In our four Budgets there was no threat, no encroachment, no removal or reduction of the subsidies on food.  One thing which we stood for and fell for was that we would not allow an increase in the cost of the necessaries of life.  You had the bakers' strike and the butchers' strike but no increase was allowed.  After the change of Government, however, you had decontrol: &ldquo;Charge what you like, boys.&rdquo;  There you have the difference in policy and in outlook. We were conscious of the fact that subsidies were a heavy drain on the national purse but that they were necessary so long as high prices prevailed and they will be necessary so long as high prices continue to prevail; make no mistake about that. Whatever the case for subsidies at the beginning, it is more real, more true to-day.</P>
      <P>What was our line regarding subsidies? We have been condemned and denounced for it.  Our line, our policy, our plan was that subsidies had to be given, that they were a heavy drain on the taxpayers but that as far as possible you should make the rich carry the poor on their back rather than the poor carry the rich.  We blasted and throttled the black market.  Every one of us remembers when tea was £1 a lb., when white flour was as precious as gold dust, when you felt like a successful smuggler when you brought home a lb. of butter at any price.  Those were the conditions which prevailed when we became the Government but we got that black market by the throat and harnessed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bacon was being processed in all kinds of filthy and insanitary holes and sold to the public for its weight in gold but that was harnessed.  That black market was taken by the throat in the interests of the poor in order to provide part of the cost of the subsidies. We gave the subsidised bread in the same ration as before; we gave the subsidised butter in a very much increased ration; we gave the subsidised tea in an increased ration and we gave the subsidised sugar as before.  We introduced, however, <Col N="794" /> a higher grade whiter bread. We said that anyone with money who liked the look of a whiter loaf and who was prepared to buy it at a price should be let have it, the money going towards the cost of subsidising the bread for the poor.  It was the same with sugar and tea.  Was that not a more humane outlook than that which we have here?  Now the poor will carry the rich on their back.  In the rich household nothing has been bought but white flour at a very high price. After July the only bread will be the 80 per cent. extraction bread.  The poor will pay 3d. per loaf more and the wealthy household will get cheaper bread.  As we must have subsidies &mdash; and I say that we must so long as high prices prevail &mdash; was our outlook, our plan, our policy, not more humane, more Christian, than the policy announced in this Budget?  We should have to be faced with dire disaster, almost with the termination of our existence, before a Budget of this type could be justified.  There is no justification for it and no case has been made for it.  Its background is one of steadily-circulated falsehoods: &ldquo;An adverse trade balance,&rdquo;&ldquo;bankruptcy,&rdquo;&ldquo;the bottom of the barrel scraped bare,&rdquo;&ldquo;overspending by the Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;extravagance by the Government.&rdquo; Those were the charges.</P>

    <P>We had these charges of extravagance. For the last 12 months they were levelled.  Where were the economies?&mdash;a larger Army; a far more expensive Army; a larger police force; a more expensive police force; public services up in cost.  What have we in the Book of Estimates in the year coming?  If we were extravagant, <Col N="795" /> then we have gross extravagance outlined for the coming year.  It is because of that, and because of the well-drilled, regimented troops that propagated falsehood for the last 12 months, that I say, with meaning and with conviction, that a Budget of this kind, conceived in dishonesty and put through with inhuman brutality, can bring nothing but disaster to its architects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this Budget is a severe Budget and a harsh Budget.  It is ridiculous to ask the people to contribute approximately £100,000,000 for the administration of the country.  I have listened very carefully to the speeches made both by the Government and the Opposition as to the reasons for this Budget.  I believe that a number of the speeches that were made were not made sincerely or genuinely.  A number of speakers dealt with the grave problem that we have to face from the point of view of the way in which they could get their speeches reported in the local provincial Press rather than discussing sensibly and objectively the serious problem that is before the members of this House.</P>
      <P>I have sought the truth.  I have heard assertions made from the Government side that certain commitments have to be met.  I have heard the Opposition refuting those statements. I have listened to most of the speeches and those that I have not heard I have read carefully.  I believe now that the best description of the position was contained in the statement issued on 22nd April by the Trade Union Congress.  I believe the Trade Union Congress approached this matter more as economists than as politicians and not with a view to what the local newspaper would report.  The Trade Union Congress said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Firstly, it is necessary to discover whether or not the figure of £15,000,000 constitutes a gap in the current Budget.  We do not doubt for a moment, despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various Estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately <Col N="796" /> as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an objective statement.  I certainly do not agree for one minute that the chairman of the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance are in the pocket of Mr. Butler, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain.  I believe the chairman of the Central Bank is an honest, decent Irishman who, according to his lights, makes suggestions in the interests of and for the welfare of this country.  I believe that the Revenue Commissioners have not been bought by Mr. Butler and I believe that they have considered this matter as experts and economists.  Even though we may not agree with their conclusions, we at least must give them credit for honesty of purpose and honesty in the recommendations that they have made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is an outrageous Budget.  It is ridiculous to expect 3,000,000 people to contribute £100,000,000 for administering their own affairs in one year. The Government is largely responsible for the extravagant cost of administration, but the Opposition cannot say that they are blameless.  The position that at present obtains has obtained for some years past.  We have, on the one hand, Fianna Fáil going around the country promising this, that and the other thing, and, on the other hand, the Fine Gael-Labour Party promising better or as much.  This Budget, if it does nothing else, at least serves the purpose of letting the people appreciate the fact that neither the Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, nor Deputy Norton, Leader of the Labour Party, has a private gold mine from which to distribute moneys amongst the people.  The people now appreciate that all the glorious promises that were made by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party are promises to give the people something that they will have to pay for themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary asked what I told the people.  That is what I told the people, and that is what I will tell the people again.  As long as there is competition between Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael-Labour Party as to who will give the greatest amount of free this and free that, codding the people that they are giving them something for nothing when the people will have to pay for it eventually, we must expect ridiculous, heavy burdens on the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I believe that the previous Budget was not a sincere Budget.  I believe the last Budget introduced by Deputy McGilligan was an election Budget. There were certain charges which Deputy McGilligan fully appreciated should have been met in the last financial year.  The Social Welfare Bill was introduced.  The Second Reading of that Bill was discussed in this House on 2nd March and yet, in a Budget introduced in May, there was no provision, good, bad or indifferent, for social services.</P>
      <P>It was well known that the arbitration board was sitting, which would increase the cost of the Civil Service. I understand that that arbitration board submitted its report in April. Yet, in the Budget in May, there was no reference to or provision for the increased cost that that would impose on the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you.  I understand that the decision of the board was available late in April. The Budget was introduced in May, but there was no provision made for the increase that that award would impose on the Exchequer.  Even if the report of the board was not available, it was quite obvious that provision should have been made for this commitment which was to be made retrospective.</P>
      <P>I want to protest against the attitude of certain Parties who are fomenting and creating industrial strife by their ill-considered statements, having very little regard for the national welfare.  They are made to gain a small passing political advantage. I also want to protest against the action of certain papers which are normally known as conservative papers and which are also fomenting that uneasiness and strife in industry.</P>
      <P>In my view, this is a harsh Budget, a severe Budget, and I believe that the people should not be asked to provide £100,000,000 to administer the affairs of this country for a year.  But if it is defeated, the person who will be most embarrassed will be Deputy McGilligan because he is committed to all the expenditure included in this Budget.  After the very clever but indefinite statement of Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that the food subsidies will be reintroduced, that the tax on liquor will be abolished and that the social welfare scheme introduced by Deputy Norton, which Deputy Costello has taken as his scheme and Deputy O'Higgins has called &ldquo;our scheme&rdquo; will be put into operation, Deputy McGilligan will be in a very difficult position, if he is already committed to the expenditure &mdash; as I believe he is &mdash; included in this Budget, if he also has to find money for the more expensive Norton or Fine Gael or, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins says, &ldquo;our welfare scheme&rdquo;, and to find money to take the tax off beer, spirits and tobacco and to carry on the food subsidies to the full extent to which they have been carried on in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> A number of Deputies complained very seriously about this volume of taxation.  But, while they spoke for ten or 15 minutes protesting against it, two minutes afterwards they advocated increased taxation.  One Deputy last night bemoaned the fact that it was costing £100,000,000 a year to administer this country, but immediately afterwards he wanted the old age pensions increased to 30/- and the means test abolished.  We have heard other Deputies complaining of the serious increase in rates.  We have had serious increases in the rates.  We have had a number of increases in the rates which were due primarily to Orders made by Deputy Norton and Deputy Costello before they left office after the election was announced. These Orders imposed an additional rate of 1/8 in the £ in County Cork.</P>
    <P>There is no use in coming in here and blowing hot and cold.  I do not believe there is any difference between the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Parties.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that it is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Ryan, boasts that this year we are spending £22,000,000 on social services.  Deputy Costello says that that is not enough, that they would spend more on these services. But he also said at one time that social services are not necessary in this country, that social services are nothing more than a row of medicine bottles.  In 1951, Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton were telling us that the country was never better off, that the farmers were never so well off, that the traders in the towns were never so well off&mdash;Deputy O'Gorman new tells us that people are coming in to pay bills that were due for years&mdash; that there was never less unemployment, that anyone who wanted work could get it, that the country was never so prosperous.  Yet at that time Deputy Costello, who feels that social services are a row of medicine bottles, brought in this social service scheme, and he is not now satisfied with the expenditure of £22,000,000 that the Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) is boasting he is spending on social services.  I cannot see any sense or <Col N="800" /> reason in the attitude of these two Parties.  I heard that Deputy Dillon boasted here of spending $5,000,000 in one afternoon, and that his only regret was that he could not spend more.  There is a competition in spending between the Opposition and the Government.  As long as that continues we can expect severe and harsh Budgets.  At one time it was illegal to bribe voters.  That was when voters were very limited and there was a certain amount of bribery going on. But a much better system has been found by the big Parties on both sides of the House, and that is to bribe the people with their own money.  But it is a most costly affair for the people, and the people are finding that out now when they have to face this Budget.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister for Finance was wrong in removing the tax on dance halls.  It may be true that the cost of collecting that tax was heavy.  However as a matter of principle, I feel that the tax on dance halls should be retained, particularly after the letter which the Tánaiste got from the Ballroom Proprietors' Association. I also think that a tax should be imposed on luxury goods.  It is all very well for Deputy Briscoe and others to ask what are luxury goods, and to ask what will be the cost of collecting the tax.  I believe, as a matter of principle, that if the cost of essential foodstuffs has to be increased, a serious effort should be made to tax non-essentials.  I would not go as far as Deputy Corry went and say that the ladies have £5 worth of warpaint on their faces, but I feel that there are various unnecessary commodities, including cosmetics, luxury cars, washing machines and one hundred and one other things that could bear a tax.  I do not know whether or not Deputy O'Leary is travelling for Coco Cola, but if he is, this Budget does not seriously affect him.  In my view, if essentials are being taxed and the tax on certain non-essentials removed a serious effort should be made to provide whatever revenue could be gathered from luxury and unnecessary commodities.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about Marshall Aid.  Personally, I have been <Col N="801" /> very nervous about Marshall Aid for a long time and, on more than one occasion in this House, I expressed my doubts about the advisability of Marshall Aid.  Two or three years ago, at a meeting of the inter-Party groups, I expressed the same view.  &ldquo;Marshall Aid&rdquo; is not new.  In olden days, people feared the Greeks when they brought gifts.  Some years ago the English gave loans to the Egyptians.  The result was that they got a strangle hold on Egypt and were able to subjugate the economy of the country.  The results of the &ldquo;Marshall Aid&rdquo; that was given to the Egyptians a very long time ago are still being felt.  Personally, I would not like to see this country pawned to America for a smear of lime.  I will deal with this lime question later, however.</P>
    <P>The principal reason I got to my feet was because of certain comments that were made by Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Hickey, Deputy Corish and others.  Deputy Dr. Browne said in Volume 131, column 199, of the Official Report of the 23rd April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, I wonder if there is any attempt on the part of the Government to try to find some way of getting more money from the farmer?  ...I think it is unquestioned that the farmer does very well for himself even under this Budget. He gets the advantage of children's allowances and is not very seriously hurt by removal of subsidies on either the bread or the butter.  He gets the annual advantage of paying little or nothing in income-tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said in Volume 131, column 350 of the Official Report dated 24th April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is not the farmer subsidised for practically everything he lays his hands to, whether it is desirable or not?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the fact that there was an increase in industry and reduced production in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would like to reply to these few points.  First of all I will refer to this alleged subsidy for lime that is being given to the farmers.  In fact, that is not a subsidy to the farmers. It is a subsidy that was put down in the accounts and given as a subsidy <Col N="802" /> to farmers, but it is very largely, in fact, a subsidy to a bankrupt transport firm.  The farmers are getting the name of having this £300,000 of a subsidy on ground limestone which is, in fact, a subsidy to a bankrupt transport company, namely Córas Iompair Éireann.  We are told by Deputy Corish that the farmers are subsidised for everything.  The reverse, of course, is the case.  The price of barley has been depressed to 75/- a barrel in this country.  We are prepared to pay the Poles £5 3s. a barrel but we are depressing the price to the Irish farmers to 75/- a barrel.  Does Deputy Corish call that subsidisation?  The price of milk in this country is 1/4 a gallon while the price of milk across the Border is 38.14 pence per gallon &mdash; over 3/2 per gallon.  The price of eggs in this country, where we are being subsidised, we are told, is 2/6 per dozen while the price across the Border and in England is 4/6¾d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote what you said from Volume 131, column 350 of the Official Report dated 24th of April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is not the farmer subsidised for practically everything he lays his hands to, whether it is desirable or not?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pointing out what the position is with the Irish farmer.  He is getting ¼ per gallon for his milk.  Where does a subsidy come in there?  His brother across the Border is betting 3/2 per gallon.  While the Irish farmer is getting 2/6 per dozen for his eggs, his brothers across the Border and in <Col N="803" /> England are getting 4/6 per dozen.  The same applies to a lot of other goods. On the other hand, everything which the farmer buys in this country is greater in cost for the simple reason that he has to buy from the protected industries in this country and the price of his requirements is higher than the price of the requirements of the man in the Six Counties and in Britain.  Yet, we are still told that we are subsidised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey is terribly worried as to why agricultural production has not increased while industrial production has increased to some degree.  The sooner we appreciate one fact the better.  Irish industrial production has an advantage of a tariff or a tax of from 50 to 100 per cent. and anybody who is producing an industrial product in this country will have protection against the English produced article to the extent of from 50 to 100 per cent.: whereas the reverse is the case as far as agricultural production is concerned. The man producing a gallon of milk in the Republic of Ireland will get 1/4; a man producing a gallon of milk in the six occupied counties or in Britain will get 3/2.  Is it not quite understandable then that industrial production, which is put on such a favourable basis, should increase and that agricultural production has remained more or less stagnant?</P>
    <P>It seems to be a popular policy at the moment to advocate income-tax for farmers.  That is nothing new.  It is something that has been thought about by Ministers for Finance for a very long time and Ministers for Finance have thrown it up because they found it is not worth dealing with.  I want to point out this, that the farmers of this country are paying colossal taxes. They are paying taxes on every requirement, every raw material that they use in their business.  They are paying heavy taxes on that because they can only buy from a small sheltered home market while they must produce their commodities for export in competition with world prices, when they are allowed to do that; but they are not allowed to do that in many cases because there was a serious restriction put on the export of hides.  If you take <Col N="804" /> the hide of an animal weighing 50 lb. while it might be sold in the Six Counties or in Britain at 4/- a lb. it was pegged down to 11d. a lb. here in order to give another subsidy to the tanneries of this country.</P>
    <P>Apart from that and apart form the taxes they are paying in restrictions on the price of the commodities they produce, which compels them to sell those commodities at less than their world value, in addition they have to pay considerably more for their requirements and they are paying taxes in that direction as well.  They are also paying what are called land annuities.  There is no such thing as land annuities at the moment.  The land annuities so called are purely a land tax and the farmers are paying the land tax because annuities have been finished.  They were finished by a certain agreement made by this House.  There are no land annuities in existence at the moment and what are called land annuities are nothing else but a land tax.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, since this agreement that we made with Britain some time ago and since it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Britain will settle all this land question and they will give us the ports in Cobh on payment of £10,000,000&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>the Irish farmers are still paying land annuities.  Every beast exported from Ireland is carrying on his tail 5/- per cwt.  That never existed until after this arrangement was made.  Every fat beast going into England is being paid for at 5/- a cwt. less than is being given for the home produced animal.  That is an innovation that was introduced when we were told we were getting rid of the land annuities.  The point is that farmers are still paying the annuities in that tax and, as well as paying the annuities in that tax, they are paying the land tax that is called annuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne thought that the farmers were much too prosperous.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is only fair that the farmer should pay a fair contribution to the national purse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have tried to point out already, in reply to the statement of Dr. Browne, that the farmers are making a very <Col N="805" /> considerable contribution to the national purse.  They are also paying considerable sums in the way of rates. It has been suggested that there is a certain rebate in the rates as far as farmers were concerned.  There are certain reductions from a huge bill. There is a discount, if you like, given, but the farmer has to pay very considerable rates.  The gentleman living in town with an income of £2,000 or £3,000 a year lives in a house with, possibly, a valuation of £15, whereas the farmer who would have an income of £500 a year might have a valuation of £100.  The farmers are paying very considerably in the way of rates to the local exchequer.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Corish, Deputy O'Higgins and some of the Fine Gael Deputies, and the financial adviser to Fine Gael, Professor George O'Brien, want to increase the commitment on farmers, I would like to read an opinion that was given on the 27th April, published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of the 28th April by a very well-known sociologist, that is, Dr. Lucey, Coadjutor Bishop of Cork. His view is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I deplore, above all, the fact that there is no living in farming, the genuine mixed farming of the small holding, or in fishing, comparable with that obtainable in the Civil Service, the professions, industry, commerce and the rest.  The young people here are alive to that; hence the flight from the farm.  I do not blame them for going.  It is the system that is responsible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement of Dr. Lucey, Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, speaking in Bantry lately.  Dr. Lucey is not a man who is going to talk irresponsibly.  He is not a man who does not know what he is talking about.  He has been a member of the emigration commission which has not yet presented its report, but Dr. Lucey has the facts and the evidence that was given before that emigration commission before him.  As a member of the commission he knows what he is talking about.  I am sure the Bishop considered that statement carefully before he made it.  That should be an answer to Deputy Dr. Browne, to Deputy Corish and to <Col N="806" /> Professor George O'Brien and to anybody else who feels that the agricultural community are not being taxed heavily enough.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane stated a few moments ago that some Fine Gael Deputies stated that the farmers were being let off too lightly.  He also said that Senator Professor George O'Brien is financial adviser to the Fine Gael Party.  I am sure Deputy Lehane will admit that Senator Professor George O'Brien is not a member of the Fine Gael Party. Further, no member of the Fine Gael Party ever advocated that the farmers should be mulcted for income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you want another quotation?  Have you ever heard Deputy McGilligan advocating income-tax for farmers?  To come back to the Budget, I believe that, generally, the taxation is too heavy on the people. I put a great deal of blame on the Government and I also put a great deal of blame on the Fine Gael and the Labour Parties.  I believe that so long as the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party are outbidding Fianna Fáil, and so long as we are auctioning the people to themselves, the only result will be increasingly savage Budgets on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that we are spending too much money by establishing embassies all over the world.  We are sending too many people round to <Col N="807" /> see what is happening in other countries when, in fact, we have plenty to do in the way of cleaning up the mess that exists in our own country. I think there is no justification for the colossal increase in the Civil Service staff in this country.  It has been increased in a few short years by about 33? per cent.  I consider that we cannot afford to turn ourselves into a State where a big percentage of the people are civil servants.</P>
    <P>I believe that this country cannot afford the luxury of a Córas Iompair Éireann.  If Córas Iompair Éireann is going to extract millions of pounds from the taxpayer then we shall have to say to Córas Iompair Éireann: &ldquo;We can do without you because the people of the country cannot afford to provide the millions of pounds that you require for the inefficient manner in which you are operating a service which is of doubtful benefit to the country as a whole.&rdquo;  I believe that there are hundreds of ways in which we could economise and that our first economy should be in relation to the presidential establishment.  It is important that the President of the country should have all the necessary facilities for carrying out the functions of his office in the proper way.  However, when we have to inflict a harsh burden on the people of the country I think we should ask the President to give a headline and that he should take a reduction in the Vote for his establishment. If we are still here after to-day, and if that Vote comes before this House, I intend to move that, as a gesture to the people of the country, the Vote for the President's establishment be reduced.</P>
    <P>I cannot put full blame on the Government and I cannot put full blame on the Opposition.  So long as there is a competition to buy the people and to buy their votes with the people's money we have nothing to look forward to but harsh Budgets which, ultimately, will have a very serious effect on the poor of this country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker in his assertion that the Trade Union Congress statement <Col N="808" /> is the nearest approach to objective criticism of the Budget proposals which, so far, he has seen.  The statement by the Trade Union Congress was, I think, the first of the few which sought to make some attempt to indicate to the Minister for Finance how he might explore alternative avenues as a means of obtaining revenue.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Trade Union Congress statement accepted that there was a gap of at least £15,000,000 between expenditure and estimated income at existing tax rates.  I do not want to quote what has been said in that document in reference to the £15,000,000 extra taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot find the quotation at the moment.  I think, however, that it can be accepted that the statement took for granted the assessment of the Minister and his financial advisers of the probable gap between estimated expenditure and revenue at existing rates.  The Trade Union Congress statement made some attempt to suggest how these extra millions might be brought to account.  Despite that fact, the Fine Gael Party, assisted by Deputy MacBride, have tried to indicate that the Minister and his advisers, either deliberately or by accident, have miscalculated to the extent of £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that these attempts were largely nefarious tactics in order to undermine the confidence of the people in the institutions of the State, in the institutions that have existed since the inception of the State for the purpose of advising the Government and the Minister for Finance as to what revenue and expenditure might amount to in any particular year.  As well as that, I believe it was an attempt to evade answering questions that are now being pertinently asked as to what they would do if they were faced with this gap. By trying to establish that there is no such gap, they can very well say: &ldquo;There is nothing we need do&rdquo; but, nevertheless, they have not, in any <Col N="809" /> degree to my satisfaction or the satisfaction of the Independent Deputies or other people who are posing these questions, established that there is a miscalculation to the extent of £10,000,000 or even to the extent of £5,000,000.  If they admit that there is a gap even to the extent of £5,000,000 they have not indicated how they propose to make up that deficit.</P>
    <P>Frequent reference has been made in the same connection to the statement of the Tánaiste in which he mentioned figures of 5 or 10 per cent.  I think it is better that, like the statement of the Trade Union Congress, the statement of the Tánaiste should be quoted in its full context.  Speaking on the General Resolution on the 3rd April as reported at column 1290 of the Official Debates he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this time of the year, it is not possible to calculate to the last penny the probable cost of a variety of Government services or the probable yield of a number of taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He takes together the cost of services and the yield of taxes and he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.  Even if we assume that it is in this year as great as 10 per cent. it is obvious that a very substantial addition to the revenue must be secured by higher taxes or alternatively that expenditure must be drastically curtailed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Right through the tenor of his speech and the context of that statement there is, on the one hand, expenditure and on the other revenue.  If there is a mistake to the extent of 10 or 5 per cent.  I believe that what the Tánaiste had in mind and what the Revenue Commissioners had in mind was that a mistake on one side would be counterbalanced by a mistake on the other.  If it is possible to miscalculate revenue to the extent of 10 or 5 per cent. surely it is possible to miscalculate expenditure to a similar extent? I do not think so much play should be made on that statement of the Tánaiste, particularly in view of the <Col N="810" /> fact that this is a situation which might arise in any particular year. The experience is that one balances the other and therefore generally speaking the Estimates that are given to the Minister must be taken to be as nearly correct as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is no harm to remember that we have established a fairly expensive machine for the purpose of making these calculations.  I am sure the method of recruitment to whatever staffs are here necessary to make these calculations are very competitive and that only the best brains are allowed into the services.  I am not saying that by way of palavering the people concerned.  I want to say that these are people trained in statistics, and by reason of achieving that grade and of learning something about statistics, they must necessarily be among the very best mathematical minds in the country.</P>
    <P>We recruit these persons into the Civil Service and surely we, as responsible people, must accept their opinions as those of responsible and qualified technicians.  Therefore, even though Deputy Costello and Deputy MacBride have had some short experience of Government and the means of examining these accounts in detail, I do not accept for a moment their contention that they feel they can pit their ability against that of the experts employed by the State.  Therefore, like the Trade Union Congress and like the vast majority of normal thinking people in this country who are trying to make an honest approach to these Budget proposals, I accept that there is a gap of £15,000,000.  Deputy McQuillan as an Independent Deputy, and Deputy Lehane &mdash; I did not hear Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll but I think the same statement applies to him &mdash; accept that there is a gap and they posed the question to Deputy Costello, the ex-Taoiseach: &ldquo;What in fact would he do in the event of his return to power in the immediate future, in order to meet this necessary expense?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to remind Deputy McQuillan and any other Deputy who expects answers from the ex-Taoiseach that, even on the statement <Col N="811" /> of the Labour Party which was the biggest Party supporting Fine Gael in the Coalition Government, the ex-Taoiseach has no right whatever to speak on their behalf.  I assume similarly that he would have no right to speak on behalf of Clann na Talmhan or on behalf of what is left of the Clann na Poblachta Party.  Therefore, any statement no matter how categorical, from the ex-Taoiseach or from one of his ex-Ministers, could not be taken, I suggest, as indicative of what any Government that could be formed out of the inter-Party group would do in certain circumstances.  They are not in a position to make such a statement, unless before making it, the representatives of the various Parties come together and issue it as a joint statement. As well as that, the Trade Union Congress decided that their parliamentary branch or their parliamentary wing would have no power to coalesce with any inter-Party group without a mandate from the Trade Union Congress or its executive council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let it pass.  I am sorry that Deputy Keane should try to misrepresent the situation.  I have given the facts.</P>
      <P>Before the interruption I was dealing with the point as to whether or not there was a gap of £15,000,000 in the moneys to be raised by existing taxation and the sum necessary to meet the present bill of expenditure. Assuming it is necessary to raise £15,000,000, apart from making suggestions as to what other fields of taxation could be explored, the Trade Union Congress suggested that we should budget for a deficit in the coming year and that, as well as that, we should not be alarmed as to whether or not there continues to be a gap in our balance of payments position.</P>
      <P>I think both are interrelated.  I think there is a relationship between a deficit Budget and permitting an adverse gap in our balance of payments and I suggest that both are in turn linked with the provision of Marshall Aid.  Let me illustrate it in this way.  When Marshall Aid was first introduced it was introduced deliberately by the Americans because they foresaw in certain European countries a huge deficit in what these countries could collect by way of taxation and the amount necessary to meet the ordinary expenditure of these States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was particularly true in the case of Great Britain where the people had parctically spent themselves in providing materials to fight the last World War.  Then a new danger arose, a danger to the continuance of American dominance as one of the greatest world powers.  The western democracies were <Col N="816" /> menaced by the Soviet Union and America foresaw that England, like all other European countries, could very easily fall a victim to Communism unless certain help was forthcoming from America, she being about the only country that could give such help.</P>
    <P>This help was given by way of Marshall Aid.  It was given because since the country could not pay its way it was foreseen that investment in industry in that country and in the development of the country generally would practically cease.  There is very little likelihood of a bankrupt country, any more than a bankrupt concern, attracting outside capital.  In order to preserve a certain balance the Americans presented England with as much as they could afford to bridge the difference between income and expenditure there.  That is how I interpret Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>For that reason I maintain that a deficit Budget would be equally bad for this country.  It would undermine the confidence of investors and they would cease to invest their money in worth-while projects of capital development. Therefore, unless we could establish ourselves as a credit-worthy nation and one willing to meet its revenue commitments out of revenue resources, it would mean that the present trend towards unemployment would be considerably accentuated in the future, possibly to such an extent that it would subsequently take many years to arrest it.</P>
    <P>There is, admittedly, a certain amount of unemployment, more than we have experienced for a considerable time, and more than is good for the country.  Nobody denies that.  But it is useless to suggest, as attempts have been made here to suggest, that that is entirely due to the fact that Fianna Fáil Ministers made certain forecasts of what our financial position was likely to be at the end of the year when the accounts came to be made up. Deputy Alfred Byrne, who is very anxious to believe anything uncomplimentary about Fianna Fáil, reiterated that point of view this morning.  He said that these gloomy forecasts were responsible for a large measure of the unemployment that we have now.  He <Col N="817" /> went a little further and quoted the Tánaiste as saying that the people ought to cease buying goods in the hope that prices would be depressed. I think that Deputy Byrne is about right in the effect of his quotation, but that he applied it to the wrong man. If he throws his mind back about four years, he will remember that is exactly what Deputy McGilligan, when introducing his first Budget as Minister for Finance, advised the people to do.  He advised the people to cease buying in order to bring down prices.  I believe that was the first seed sown in this unfortunate recession of trade which is now being experienced in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It took some time to develop, certainly, but Deputy Morrissey knows that there was a certain amount of credence given to that statement, and that a certain falling off in purchases by the people took place at that time.  I understand from businessmen that that statement did have some adverse effect on sales at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to suggest that that was the total cause of the present rate of unemployment.  It has been suggested elsewhere that, even though we were not concerned in the war, we could not escape the natural economic consequences of it. Situated as we are just on the fringe of Europe, we were, to a certain extent, part of Europe's overall economy and, therefore, we could not escape the recession in trade and in employment which has been taking place in England and in Europe and even throughout the whole world. Therefore, this unemployment phase is, I hope, a passing phase.  It is a world-wide phase, and I am sure that it is one that is bound to pass within a very short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to some other suggestions which were made by the Trade Union Congress, such as the methods <Col N="818" /> by which money could be found, they suggested the reimposition of the excess profits tax.  Deputy McQuillan last night read from a book which, I think, is entitled <i>Irish Industry.</i>  He said the editorial in that publication was the only statement that he had read in favour of the Budget, and he expected that this publication spoke authoritatively on behalf of a general group of Irish industrialists.  So far as I know, that publication is the property of one individual and, generally speaking, it is not accepted by industrialists as being their mouthpiece. That is my information about it.  I see that Deputy Morrissey nods approval and so, therefore, I accept that as a fact.  Nevertheless, I do not agree that, just because a person happens to be called an industrialist, he is to be the butt of every politician or of anybody who seeks to speak on behalf of working men.  If we had not a certain number of industrialists in this country, there would be no working men.  Without a certain number of men who had the courage and the initiative to put their money into worth-while industries, employment would be denied to many of our people, and many more of them would be forced to go abroad than are going at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am told, too, and I believe, that to reimpose the excess profits tax would put an unnecessary and an undesirable brake on the desire of those industrialists to expand, that there would be no initiative to improve methods of production or to improve overall production in any industry.  Without these initiatives and without that improvement in productive capacity, there would be no means of improving the amount of employment to be made available in existing industries.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think it is well to point out that it is not all jam and honey for the industrialist who puts his money in jeopardy.  I, personally, am aware of a group of Irish industrialists at the present time who are trying to open a new field.  They have placed all their available money at the disposal of the company which they are trying to set up.  They have pledged almost every shred of their credit and resources, <Col N="819" /> and still find themselves faced with a deficit of some tens of thousands of pounds in order to complete the building of their project.  They are at their wits' end to see where the money can be found.  I think that if profits are eventually to accrue to those individuals who have sunk their money, their credit and their resources in a worthwhile industry, in an industry that is bound to help the country generally in its overall economy, in bringing down the adverse balance of payments, and, above all, in providing employment for people looking for employment, they are entitled to those profits, and people like them should not be made a butt for irresponsible attacks by anybody, whether inside or outside this House.  If, however, undue profits are made because inferior goods are put on the market at too high a price, then by all means let them be taxed; but, generally speaking, there is such competition in trade at the present time that very few commodities find their way on to the market and into the houses of consumers unless they are put there in a competitive form as regards price and quality.</P>
    <P>Another method suggested in relief of the present Budget is that we should rely on borrowing.  Well, our capital programme for the coming year is of the order of £35,000,000 to be met by way of the loan which it is expected will be floated and from the ordinary savings of people.  Well over half that amount will have to be collected from the people to finance these capital projects, but these projects are dependent largely on what can be got from borrowing. I do not think it could be seriously suggested that the sum of this bill of £101,000,000 should be met by some of the moneys which it is hoped to raise by borrowing. No one has suggested that our capital development programme should be cut down. The difficulty will be to find within the capacity of the people sufficient money to finance our capital programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, making his first appearance in the House since his illness&mdash;I am glad to see that he appears to have preserved all his old vigour&mdash;made a long speech about the <Col N="820" /> effect of the subsidies.  He apparently came into the House in order to try and allay any fears that certain Independents might have with regard to what the Coalition would do with regard to the food subsidies if they got back to power.  I listened carefully to him but I could get no categorical statement to the effect that these subsidies would be maintained.  I took a note of what he said on the occasion which was to this effect: &ldquo;So long as we have high prices there should be subsidies and there is more reason for them now than when first introduced.&rdquo; He did not say anything which would satisfy either of the two Independent Deputies who were listening to him that his Party or any Government of which he would be a member would ensure that the subsidies would be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit I was out of the House for a while.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins made a few statements which were not quite in accordance with the facts.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins is an astute politician.  He is a vigorous speaker and he has the knack of bringing with him and enthusing people who are willing to see his point of view. He apparently enthused those who sat <Col N="821" /> above him to-day but I suggest that in at least one instance he implied that the Tánaiste, Mr. Lemass, before the last general election, made certain statements which he construed as promises which were flagrantly violated and that the Tánaiste had an opportunity of putting them into effect.  I refer in particular to a statement attributed by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins to the Tánaiste that there was no reason why we should reimpose these taxes.  He was referring, of course, to the taxes on beer, tobacco and cinema seats.  There are many ways of misrepresentation but misrepresentation by implication is, I think, one that should not be resorted to under any circumstances.  The thing to do is to see exactly what the Tánaiste, Mr. Lemass, was reported as having said at the time.  In order to give the statement in its full context I will read it out.  I think it will be quite clear what he said and meant when he made the statement attributed to him by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. Quoting from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 13th May, 1951, which Deputy Dr. O'Higgins referred to, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, is reported as having said in Cork:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister had said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would immediately increase taxes on beer and tobacco.  That suggestion seemed to emanate from guilty consciences. Why should any increase in taxes be necessary?  The Coalition had presented the Budget for the present financial year before dissolving the Dáil.  Mr. McGilligan had claimed that it would yield a small surplus of revenue at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>If it was an honest Budget based on <i>bona fide</i> expectations of expenditure and revenue working out as Mr. McGilligan had estimated, then it was clear that no further increases of taxation of any kind were necessary. Why then should Coalition Ministers be forecasting a need for higher taxes?  No Government would increase taxation for the fun of it. Did they allege that Mr. McGilligan's estimates had been phoney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking it for granted that the <Col N="822" /> Budget Estimates for expenditure and revenue that year were correct there would be no question of an increase in taxation of any kind, much less on beer or tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not quite clear that the Tánaiste&mdash; he was then Deputy Lemass&mdash;charged the Coalition Government with estabishing whether or not the Budget which they introduced was, in fact, an honest Budget?  He said that on the assumption that expenditure and revenue were as indicated by the Minister for Finance there would be no necessity for an increase of taxation but since the suggestion was made by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, that Fianna Fáil would reduce these taxes if they got back into power, Mr. Lemass suggested that that intimation came as a result of a guilty conscience and that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, knew well that the Budget proposals were not honest and knew that there was a certain deficit budgeting and if commitments which had been entered into for expenditure were to be properly met that some form of taxation would be necessary.  That is what he meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins also referred to the policy of the inter-Party Government while they were in power.  He said that four successive Budgets were devoted almost entirely to keeping down the cost of living.  He said that during that period they faced two threatened strikes in two essential food industries, a strike from the bakers and one from the butchers who were seeking increased prices for their produce.  I forget the circumstances of the threatened bakers' strike.  I take it that it took place when he said it did and that there was some agitation for increased prices all round.  I have certainly a recollection in connection with what happened at the time of the butchers' strike.  When Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was Minister for Industry and Commerce, he accepted the butchers' figures that a certain increase was necessary but rather than make an Order that meat was to be a certain price from that date in excess of what the controlled price was and in order not to face criticism which might be forthcoming by permitting an increase in the price of meat, he told the butchers they could go and charge a price which they considered would give a fair profit and even if it did exceed the controlled price there would be no prosecution.  Is that an honest attempt to keep down the cost of living?  It was certainly not honest and it was certainly not being honest with the butchers or the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to one or two other statements I heard uttered during the past few days.  Deputy Coburn, speaking last night, made some reference to the unemployment position.  He said that Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance during the 1920's, showed great pre-vision in regard to the erection of factories.  He said that if his advice had been listened to on those occasions there would not be the same number of factories in the country now working on short time.  I think it is well to recall also what Deputy Norton had to say about Deputy McGilligan at that particular time.  I have not got the quotation but I can get it if I am asked to produce it.  Deputy Norton referred to Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and <Col N="824" /> Commerce, as an industrial tank going around the country levelling one industry after another.  I do not think that policy could be referred to in any way as showing vision.  If it is vision, it is very bad vision.  It showed a complete lack of foresight when more and more industrialisation should be achieved side by side with more agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I said I believed that the recession in trade we were experiencing, which is a world-wide trend and which is largely responsible for much of the unemployment we are suffering from, is bound to pass.  Industrialisation is proceeding apace in this country.  New factories are being built and methods to develop the resources of our country are being devised and put into effect.  This Government have a big scale capital development programme in hands.  The rural electrification programme is being pressed forward.  Side by side with that and part and parcel of it is the development of our turf resources.  In one instance alone it is hoped in the course of a couple of years to give employment to at least 800 people in developing bogs and preparing them for two generating stations which it is hoped to erect in County Mayo, one of the areas in which employment is most needed by the people.  Our fisheries are being expanded.  Then we shall have the social welfare scheme which was publicised, I should say, by the Coalition Government but never brought into effect.</P>
    <P>I could refer to many more projects and many more developments which the Government have achieved and which they have in hands which will increase the resources of the country and the productive capacity of the country.  But, as a forerunner of all of them, we must have an honest Budget and honest financing of the country.  We must be able to show investors, whether from at home or abroad, that we are a credit-worthy country, that we are able to pay our way and that we will not try to dupe people into thinking that we can have everything by way of social services and other amenities such as drainage, housing, hospitalisation, unless we can afford to pay for them.  I agree that a certain amount of capital expenditure <Col N="825" /> is necessary to finance some of them, but there are many recurring items of expenditure which must be met out of revenue.  Unless they are met out of revenue, people who have money to invest in the country will not be prepared to do so.  Unless we can get investment in the country, investment based on confidence in the country to pay its way and to see that the country is properly developed, unemployment will not only increase but will go to such an extent that the very existence of our population will be in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The policy of deluding the people into the belief that we are better off than we are really will eventually lead to the destruction of our economy, to the undermining of our credit and of our reputation at home and abroad to the detriment of the country in the long run.  Therefore I believe that the people are willing to bear a certain amount of hardship at present.  They appreciate now more than ever that, if certain benefits are to be given, it is the people themselves who will have to pay for them.  The Government have no hidden sources from which to find the necessary money to finance expenditure on the capital resources of this country.  It is true that the poor people will have to pay more for bread, sugar, tea and butter.</P>

      <P>That is one side of the picture that has been presented from the other side of the House.  It is one side of the picture presented by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  It was in order to present the other side of the picture that I mentioned it now.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said that the dual-price system was introduced to relieve the poorer section of the people.  Can any Opposition Deputy point out to me any poor family which did not on some occasion or another, and I believe more frequently than they would care to admit, have recourse to buying at the higher prices?  Tea had to be bought when there were certain shortages of rationed tea.  Butter had to be bought at the higher price and, particularly in the rural areas, bread had to be bought <Col N="826" /> to an extent that imposed a great burden on the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will not be denied that there were no families, even city families, that did not have occasion frequently to go into the Government black market to purchase necessary commodities.  I live in an area in County Cork which is not very wealthy.  There are very few families there who did not have occasion to resort to this means of keeping enough food on the table.  They will now get their food and they will not have to pay black market prices.</P>
      <P>As well as that, in order to present a true picture, it should be remembered that subsidies naturally had to be provided by the people themselves.  It cannot be denied that poor people were providing subsidies for wealthy people who did not have occasion to buy bread, tea or butter to the same extent as the poor people.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said that bread and butter were the staple diet of the poorer section of the people.  That is true. But many of the richer families could afford to buy alternatives and they often bought far less than the amount of the weekly ration permitted them to buy because they could buy other more expensive means of sustenance. Therefore, the obligation of the poor people to pay subsidies for the rich people's food will be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we have the increased social welfare benefits which will come into operation simultaneously with the proposal to remove the subsidies. I have some figures here which I worked out.  Accepting that the average family in this country is a family of husband, wife and four children, a <Col N="827" /> working man, an insured man, is getting £13 per year by way of children's allowances.  After the 1st July, he will get £27 6s. per annum, which is more than 100 per cent. increase, and which I think everybody will agree is a rather substantial increase.  An unemployed man with four children at present gets £1 4s. for himself and his wife and 2/6 extra for two of his four children, bringing his weekly income to £1 9s. From 1st July onwards he will get 2/10 for himself and his wife and 10/6 for his four children, 2/6 for the second and 4/- each for the third and fourth, bringing a weekly income to £3 0s. 6d.</P>

Of course, he will not agree that it is enough but it is an increase of more than 100 per cent., which surely goes more than halfway in offsetting whatever disadvantages he will suffer by the withdrawal of food subsidies.  I am sure he will agree with me that they are the weaker sections of the community and those are the people to whom assistance should be given out of any revenue that the State is bringing in.  If the food subsidies have to go he must agree that the benefits given in these particular instances are far better than the maintenance of food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not that innocent.  Referring to the rich man reminds me of a point I intended to make and omitted to make, and that is in reference to income-tax and excess profits tax.  The net result of the income-tax proposals in this Budget is that almost £1,000,000 extra <Col N="828" /> per annum will accrue to the Exchequer. I think it is a significant fact that 170,000 people will have to pay considerably less income-tax in the current financial year.  One hundred and seventy thousand out of a total of 188,000 people must surely imply that the ordinary person will get the benefit and only the wealthy persons will have to pay.  But included in the 18,000 people will be the big farmers who will, perforce of these impositions, have to pay more out of their annual profits; therefore, to impose excess profits tax on top of this increased taxation on these 18,000 people, amongst whom are these big farmers, would tend to cripple any initiative that might be left to those farmers to expand production and provide employment.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters I could refer to but I am sure I would be covering much the same ground as has already been covered, but by and large, I believe that even though some extra taxation has been imposed, the people are willing to bear their share. They do not want to pass burdens on to posterity.  Deputy Hickey said yesterday that borrowing did not mean prosperity or would not bring prosperity or something to that effect, if he was properly quoted in the papers to-day.  The people realise that the nation's housekeeping account is much like their own housekeeping account. Outgoings must be paid for so far as possible from current income, otherwise a state will have been reached when the house can no longer exist. That state could soon be reached and I believe sooner than we could expect if past trends had been continued, if we continued to live out of borrowings and put our country in jeopardy by way of political or other ties.</P>

      <P>It is very easy to criticise but to cure the ills is another matter.  However, this Budget is an honest attempt to cure the ills from which we are suffering at the present time.  It is an honest Budget and a fearless Budget.  It is not trying to hoodwink the people.  There is no attempt to make them feel they are better off than they really are.

      <P>I have listened to or read most of the speeches which have been made on this resolution during the past ten days.  We appear to be agreed that this Budget is a very severe Budget.  Every person on all sides of the House will agree on that. But we disagree as to the necessity for it.  The main argument for it by the Government is that it was necessary on account of the spending of its predecessors.  That appears to be the main argument of the Government speakers.  Let us cast our minds back over the past 12 months.  After all, we are living in a democracy and, prior to the introduction of a Budget, a Book of Estimates is published which members on all sides of the House have an opportunity of studying. I remember when Deputy McGilligan introduced his Budget last year I never heard a word of criticism from the then Opposition&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no opportunity, Deputy.  You remember, there was a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even bearing that in mind, I never heard on the public platform or in this House a word of criticism about the spending of that Government, but I did hear a lot of <Col N="830" /> criticism about its lack of spending of money on arms, police force, luxury hotels, transatlantic airlines, and about the high cost of living.  These were the main arguments of the then Opposition against the Budget of 1951. Prior to the present Government taking up office and after the general election, the Government published their policy, and I now quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 5th June, 1951, point 15 of that policy: &ldquo;To maintain subsidies, to control the price of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities&rdquo;.  That was immediately prior to their taking office.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for Finance then knew what was budgeted for in Deputy McGilligan's Budget of 1951 and despite that fact he still said, on 5th June, 1951, that they would continue subsidies.  If the Minister was honest, immediately he took over office he would have introduced a Supplementary Budget if he found there was underestimation in the 1951 Budget. But he did not do that and we never heard one word of complaint about subsidies or otherwise until the Central Bank Report was issued.  Then, of course, Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, warned us and prepared us in many ways for the hardships which are now being imposed upon us.  I remember reading in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 15th May, 1951, an extract from a speech made by the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A number of people in the licensed trade were spreading the rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power the tax imposed on drink by the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed.  There is no truth in such a rumour.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find just now that not only have the taxes of the 1947 Supplementary Budget been reimposed but that, in many respects, they have been doubled.  Yet, we are asked to accept the fact that this is a courageous Budget. I say that it is a dishonest Budget. The Minister was aware of the position in 1951 and he should have exposed it if what he states now is the truth.  We have also been told that <Col N="831" /> there has been no constructive criticism from this side of the House.  One person to whom relief has been given is the dance hall proprietor.  The excuse put forward for that is that it cost too much to collect the revenue which was obtained from this tax.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is a simpler method of collecting that tax, and that is by increasing the duty on the licence issued to the dance halls through the District Court.  I feel that if the Revenue Commissioners had every dance hall in this country revalued, imposing a stamp duty on the dance hall proprietor when the licence is renewed in September, and had that imposition in proportion to the poor law valuation of the hall, a considerable amount of revenue would be brought in.  Further, we would be making the proprietor of the hall pay &mdash;the person deriving the revenue&mdash;and not the partisan.  The Revenue Commissioners could use their old trick and ask the solicitors to collect the tax, and it would not cost the State anything.</P>
    <P>Take the box of matches.  I am sure there is nobody who would object to pay an extra halfpenny per box. There would be no outcry, and a considerable amount of revenue would be derived from that source also.</P>
    <P>I feel that bicycles should also be taxed.  I know the argument will be raised that it would cost too much to enforce the law whereby each cyclist would have to take out a licence.  I think it would be a simpler method of collecting the tax if the Revenue Commissioners made the assembler or the manufacturer pay 10/- or £1 on every bicycle manufactured or assembled.  Nobody would object. One only buys a bicycle now and again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot afford to snigger at these things, because they are all bringing in money.  A considerable number of bicycles are manufactured in this country, and if a tax of £1 or 10/- were imposed on <Col N="832" /> each, something would be done to ease the burden of the poor taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I think it is outrageous that beer should be taxed.  I am in full agreement with the tax imposed on spirits. It is a luxury drink and, in my view, it could bear even higher taxation.  I think it is very unfair that the working man must pay more for his pint of beer or ale.  We could surely have left that as it was.  The present Minister for Finance gave a guarantee that he would leave it as it was before the 1947 Supplementary Budget.</P>
      <P>In my view petrol could bear a higher tax.  Hackney men and other such people should get a certain ration but once that ration had been exceeded the increased price should be paid for any surplus petrol required.</P>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister that this Budget has done more harm, and will do more harm, to the congested areas in Ireland, and particularly to the Gaeltacht areas.  It has done more harm and will continue to do more harm to the question of emigration than has been done for the past 25 years.  In the majority of the congested areas in this country, there is a lack of employment.  How are the inhabitants of these areas going to bear the additional burdens imposed upon them as a result of this Budget? I am afraid emigration will be their only solution.  I feel that something should be done by the Minister to encourage our emigrants to remain at home.  This Budget will only give them an excuse for leaving the country.</P>

However, the people outside did not need to have great recuperative powers to recover <Col N="833" /> from these attacks because they realised that the Opposition were not fighting a clean battle.  The people outside realised that the Opposition were not fighting for the country's interests but only fighting for their own political advantage.  I could keep on that subject for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the tactics of Deputy Dunne.  He would like us to believe that the people who walk down Westmoreland Street have criminal minds and that if they look at a picture in the <i>Irish Times</i> window they can read backwards.  One of his main contributions in this discussion was that the people who would look at a photograph could read backwards or upside down.  He accused the Minister for Finance of being a very vain man. However, it is well known that he was seen in the corridor with this famous photograph in his hand.  I take it he was arranging to have his own photograph taken, and it appeared that night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>In this general connection, I would refer the Deputy to the article entitled &ldquo;Statistics of Emigration and Passenger Movement&rdquo; on pages 76 to 84 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> of June, 1951, in which the relative values of the different sources of statistics of migration are discussed. As was stated in that article, the number of new travel documents issued cannot be taken as equivalent to the number of emigrants.  In official statements issued since the article was published it has repeatedly been made clear that the number of travel documents is not true measure of net emigration.</P>
      <P>In the earlier years after the institution in 1939 of the travel permit system, the statistics derivable from this source could be regarded as a substantially accurate record of emigration to Britain but, as time went on, the usefulness of these statistics for the assessment of emigration steadily deteriorated to the point that in the last few years they have become seriously misleading.  This is illustrated by the fact that in 1950 gross emigration to Britain and the Six Counties was estimated at 73,000 from the passenger card inquiry and other records, whereas the number of new travel identity cards and passports issued to persons who stated that they were going to employment or to permanent residence in Britain and the Six Counties was only 12,768.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal defect in the travel permit and identity card statistics as a measure of emigration was that they related to new issues only, i.e., predominantly to migrants travelling for the first time.  Nothing was known as to emigrants travelling for the second, third, etc., time to Britain.  These are known to be numerous.  Furthermore, the travel documents did not indicate the number of persons returning from work in Britain, which, in 1950, was estimated as being as great as 36,000, whereas the number going to employment was about 73,000, as already <Col N="835" /> stated.  It is probable that numbers of persons who declared on their applications for travel documents that they were tourists, etc., in fact accepted employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>The only firm records of migration are those derivable for intercensal periods and these relate to net emigration (or the excess of emigration over immigration).  The principal disadvantage of this source of information is that censuses are taken only at extended intervals of time, so that they cannot be used to compile statistics of emigration for yearly or shorter periods.  As explained in the article to which I have referred, the passenger card sample inquiry, in conjunction with global statistics of passenger movement into and out of the State, classified by origin of journey, furnishes estimates of emigration to and immigration from Great Britain.  The main disadvantage of this method of estimation is that, as pointed out in the <i>Journal</i> article, it is subject to a large error of estimation, since it is based on a relatively small number of passenger cards.  Furthermore, this method cannot be used as a basis of estimation for the classification of emigrants by sex, age, occupation, or county of last residence.  The passenger card inquiry was designed primarily to estimate tourist, etc., expenditure in this country, as well as Irish tourist expenditure abroad, for balance of international payments purposes, and may be regarded as furnishing reasonably satisfactory results to this end.</P>
    <P>For many years the net passenger movement, representing the difference between the number of passengers in and out by sea, rail, road (motor omnibus) and air was used as an estimate of annual net emigration.  Comparison of the results of this assessment with those derivable for recent intercensal periods shows that this method was not reliable, principally, it is thought, because it did not take into account passenger movement by road across the Border other than in public service vehicles.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, it may be <Col N="836" /> stated that the importance of deriving accurate and comprehensive statistics of emigration is fully realised. The present position is that complete and accurate statistics of emigration by sea to countries out of Europe are being compiled, and it is hoped that the corresponding figures for transport by air will be available in the near future.  The prospects are not so propitious for the measurement of migration to and from Britain.  Accurate statistics of gross emigration and immigration for annual or shorter periods, classified by age, sex, occupation and county, could be derived only by the institution of frontier controls similar to those in other countries. Having regard to the freedom of travel to which passengers have become accustomed between this country, the Six Counties and Britain, and the huge volume of passenger traffic &mdash; the number of passenger journeys per annum into and out of the State is approximately three million each way &mdash; the formidable difficulties of instituting controls can be appreciated.  In this connection, it will be borne in mind that the numbers of emigrants and immigrants, though large in the absolute, are very small fractions of the total passenger movement, and passengers generally would be liable to resent controls designed to measure migration only.</P>
    <P>An annual count of heads of the population would furnish annual statistics of net emigration classified by sex and county of residence in the State.  It would not show gross emigration and gross immigration separately, which is a disadvantage since the estimates I have quoted for 1950 show that both emigration and immigration (mostly of Irish persons returning from jobs in Britain) are of large dimensions.  Furthermore, such an inquiry would not give any information as to ages and occupations of migrants.  An annual count of heads of the population is virtually a census as far as enumeration is concerned, and, it goes without saying, this is a formidable task.</P>
    <P>It will accordingly be realised that the establishment of a fully reliable and comprehensive system of emigration statistics would be a major undertaking. <Col N="837" /> The matter can, however, be further considered in the light of any relevant recommendation that may be made by the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems.</P>

That statement was confirmed in a letter from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the local people say there is no market for hand-won turf.  Would the Minister cause some representations to be made to the Electricity Supply Board with a view to ensuring that it will take hand-won turf, especially in view of the reply previously given?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, with reference to Note 1 in Table V of Tables in connection with the Financial Statement, 1952, whether the liabilities gross total can properly be read as £162,941,853 and £173,112,059, after having made allowance for double reckoning referred to; and, if so, what consequential adjustment should be made in corresponding total assets figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The note referred to by the Deputy draws attention to the inclusion in the total of gross liabilities of both the following items: (i) the equivalent of the proceeds of dollar borrowings under the United States loan agreements; and (ii) the Exchequer liability in respect of Ways and Means Advances obtained from the American Loan Counterpart Fund. The relevant figures at 31st March, 1952, were: (i) £40,671,086 and (ii) £40,500,000; in other words, of the counterpart of dollar borrowings from the United States Government at that date namely, £40,671,086, the sum of £40,500,000 had been lent to the Exchequer in the form of Ways and Means Advances which are repayable to the American Loan Counterpart Fund.</P>
      <P>When both parts of Table V in the tables in connection with the Financial Statement 1952, are read together, no adjustment is necessary on account of the double reckoning to the extent of £40,500,000 in the figure of total gross liabilities.  This double reckoning is offset by the inclusion in the figure of total assets of the full proceeds of dollar borrowings, whether represented by cash, by investments in mortgage bonds of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or by Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer.  As the Ways and Means Advances from the American Loan Counterpart Fund feature in the table in both the liabilities and the assets statements, a true figure of the net excess of gross liabilities over assets is obtained by subtracting the totals as shown in the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> As the note points out, it is only when the liabilities statement alone is being considered that it is proper to make the adjustment suggested by the Deputy.  If this adjustment is made, it is necessary to make a corresponding adjustment in the assets statement by excluding from the &ldquo;balance of American Loan Counterpart Fund&rdquo; the Ways and Means Advances from that fund to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that they were shedding tears at that meeting, at the Labour Party Conference and in this House regarding the reduction in the food subsidies. I am not sure if what Deputy Norton said in 1947 on food subsidies has been quoted before.  It will be noted from what I am going to read that the Labour Party were never very happy about food subsidies.  Deputy Norton, speaking in the Dáil on 15th October, 1947, at column 435, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The highlight of the documents put before us is, I take it, the subsidies to reduce the prices of tea, bread and sugar.  I think these are sham reductions.  I do not think they make any perceptible contribution to relieving the plight of the ordinary <Col N="854" /> working people to-day and they make a less perceptible contribution in the circumstances in which they are offered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious that they were never very happy about them.  They voted against them.  I will go further than that and say that neither were their Coalition colleagues.  I propose to refer them to the report of their own &ldquo;Flour and Bread Inquiry &mdash; interim and final report&rdquo;.  They need not tell me that they did not adopt it.  I know that they did not, but it clearly shows that the writing was on the wall.  I quote the following from page 8 of that report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In actual fact, the annual expenditure on subsidy has never been less than £2,000,000 since 1941-42, and as we have already pointed out, is likely to remain at the level of £5/6,000,000 per annum unless there is a change of policy regarding the level of flour and bread prices.  In view of the exceptionally low level of these prices, as compared with the prices of other essential foodstuffs, and having regard to the substantial increases in income received by most sections of the community in recent years, we are satisfied that the present considerable expenditure on flour subsidy is not justified.  We, therefore, strongly recommend that flour and bread prices should be increased in gradual stages towards their economic levels so as to bring the subsidised prices more into line with the prices of the other major food items, and at the same time to reduce the heavy burden of the flour subsidy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that they did not adopt that report, but it is obvious the line they were going on that it would be only a matter of time in 1947.  This is their own report signed by eminent people such as Mr. Justice Cecil Lavery, Mr. E.T. McCarron and Mr. A.T. McMahon.  We must assume that they are intelligent, sane people.  There can be no question about that.</P>
    <P>We can see from that report that the Coalition group, combined with the Labour people, were not altogether happy on this question of the flour subsidy. I have no doubt that is the <Col N="855" /> reason why no member of the group opposite can at the moment give a definite statement as to what they would do on the question of food subsidies. We all know full well that subsidies create artificial prices.  I think it was mentioned here before, and I think there will be general agreement on it that they do create artificial prices. Their removal should not create undue increases, especially when food is plentiful.  I am informed that tea has come down in price on the international market since the subsidy was reduced in Great Britain.  I am also informed that butter production here at the moment is quite good.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that we will have quite a good supply of butter.  It is also safe to assume that the same will be true in regard to tea and milk.  With a reasonable chance of plentiful supplies prices would not be as severe as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is well known in Dublin, and I am sure throughout the country, that we have been subsidising butter which has been sent out of the country, and smuggled out of it.  Nobody can deny that.  Why, therefore, should we pay a subsidy on butter and allow it to be sent out and to be smuggled out?  That is not right, and I am sure nobody would attempt to condone it.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to introduce anything new into this debate.  It is no harm, however, to point out that people who have been buying tea and flour off the ration have been paying more for them than the ration price. I represent a working class district in Dublin.  I know well, and most shopkeepers will tell you, that many of my constituents have been buying this Government black market tea and sugar and other commodities.  They could not exist on the ration; they had to go outside it and pay these extra prices.  I suggest that things will be better under this new system.</P>
    <P>I think that a better approach to this whole problem would be for every Deputy to try and bring home to the people, as I have tried to prove from the Flour and Bread Report and the speech of Deputy Norton, that food subsidies were never intended to be a <Col N="856" /> permanent feature in this country.  It must have been obvious to everyone that rationing would have to end some time or other.  To my mind, there can be no denying this, that the end of rationing has been welcomed by the business community and the people generally.  I know one shopkeeper, who never drank in his life, who said that he would go off on a good burst-up the day they got rid of these ration books and of all the work he had to do in regard to keeping his accounts in order.  The public themselves would be better pleased with the present system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good man's fault.  The Deputies opposite have boasted about having a sense of responsibility.  All Deputies have boasted of the fact that they are imbued with a terrific sense of responsibility. If we accept all that they must agree that reduced taxation means reduced expenditure.  If we agree on all that we must then realise that to have drastic cuts in expenditure will interfere a great deal with existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the Deputies opposite, who have been so loud in attacking this Budget, have made any suggestion to reduce the old age pensions, family allowances, the remaining subsidies and the wages and salaries of civil servants, teachers, Gardaí, the Defence Forces, or the local government officials to whom Deputy Corry referred here.  Do they suggest that we should reduce the salaries of those people?  If we do that we will certainly reduce taxation.  Should we not discharge the arrears on the fuel subsidies and payments in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann and to the <Col N="857" /> Great Northern Railway?  We have got to pay for those items.  Does the Opposition suggest that we should not pay the interest due on the Marshall Aid loan?  The Coalition Government did not make provision in their last Budget for some of the items I have mentioned.</P>

I did not believe at the time that it could be done.  Clann na Poblachta made some wild suggestion that they could reduce the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Labour and Fine Gael claimed that this Budget was framed in favour of the better-off section of our community. They have laboured on that a great deal.  I must look upon that as not true.  I could say it is a deliberate falsehood but to be charitable I will let it go as not being correct.  Rich and poor have benefited by the subsidies. I am sure that Deputies will agree that the poor contributed, through Deputy McGilligan's devices, the taxes which paid for those subsidies.</P>
      <P>The position now is that we have reliefs to ease the load on the less well-off.  We hear quite a lot about the rich but I do not know whether there are very many rich persons.  The rich now lose the subsidies but they still pay the higher taxes.</P>

Nobody has denied that.  They have read the figures given by the Minister for Finance and it is obvious that they could not get away with it by pointing out that this Budget was framed for the better-off section of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out by previous speakers, <Col N="859" /> there are provisions for children's allowances, the aged and increased social services for the lowly paid.  I heard Deputy Alfred Byrne speak &mdash; very shrewdly making his speech in time for to-night's <i>Evening Herald</i> for his Dublin constituents.  He spoke about the Budget but he did not say one word about the increased children's allowances and increased old age pensions about which he cries so much.  He should be consistent in these things. Incidentally, I think that he, or his son, who, I hope, is on the road to recovery, voted against the food subsidies.  He comes here now and tries to make out that we are doing this for fun or to affect the poor people of Dublin.  That is entirely wrong.  Nobody, knowing the people who are at the head of Fianna Fáil, could suggest that we have ever tried to be harsh on the poor.  That may read well but a lot of people know it is not correct and the people who make those statements are not being sincere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish was worrying about motor cars and companies.  He should know that companies are now paying higher tax on their profits.  If that does not satisfy the Labour Party, I do not know what they want.  These people have not been forgotten by the Minister for Finance.  He has taxed the companies and they are paying much more on their profits.  Even those with the high-power cars are also contributing through the petrol tax. They are paying a higher petrol tax. They do not get away scot free, as was suggested by Deputy Corish.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get away from anything.  I have no intention of hiding my personal views. Deputy Corish was also worried, because he thought this Budget might hold up housing.  I can inform him, as a member of the Dublin Corporation, that we are worried about housing. Owing to the action taken by a Coalition Minister in January, 1951, a circular was sent to the Dublin Corporation regarding the submission of plans and other regulations.  As a result, we now find ourselves in the <Col N="860" /> position that, instead of building 2,500 houses, we can only build 1,400.  That is what we are worrying about.  We have been informed by the city manager that there is enough money to keep up the Dublin Corporation housing programme for many years to come.  Therefore, Deputy Corish has not a great deal to worry about in that respect.  The action taken by the Coalition Minister in 1951 certainly upset our plans a great deal.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary is worried about my reaction to the entertainment tax and the tax on dance halls.  Deputy O'Leary should remember the outcry which we had from the Labour Benches when the cinemas were taxed.  Any Labour Deputy who is interested in the trade union movement should realise that the cinemas and theatres in Dublin are providing a great deal of employment and first-class conditions for the workers.  If we increased the tax on cinemas and unemployment resulted, we would have an outcry from the Labour people.</P>

      <P>In 1947, you were not too happy when Fianna Fáil put the tax on cinemas The cinemas are giving a great deal of employment and if we tax them further we would hear a great deal from the Labour people. It may please Deputy O'Leary to hear that I am not altogether happy about the removal of the tax on dancing.  But, as has been pointed out, the Revenue Commissioners, who are very important people, have suggested time and again the removal of this tax, not alone to the present Minister for Finance but to Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Finance.  They have recommended that this tax on dance halls should be removed because it gives endless trouble in collection and, as has been pointed out by Deputy Maher, there was wholesale evasion of <Col N="861" /> it.  I agree with the Deputy who said that the Minister might at some later stage consider some method of getting revenue from dancing.</P>
      <P>Great play was made about the dance halls in Dublin.  One of the big dance halls in Dublin is controlled by a Labour organisation.  I do not dance myself, but I know a little about the dance halls.  Those who run the dance halls are not as wealthy as one would imagine.  The dance halls are controlled by Irish people who are trying to make a living and they are doing the best they can.  It is better to see these Irishmen controlling the dance halls properly than to have outsiders coming in.  As I said, I think the Minister at some later stage should consider some other method of getting revenue from dancing.  Now that it has been removed, I hope that the younger people will be allowed to attend these dances at a reduced price.</P>

      <P>Finally, I would point out to Opposition Deputies that we in Fianna Fáil are not fools.  We realise the political implications of this Budget.

      <P>We realise the political implications of this Budget and we are not one bit afraid to face the situation.  That is what the Coalition should have done.  They should have faced the situation instead <Col N="862" /> of squandering the people's savings. They went very deep into debt instead of facing the situation fairly and squarely.  They should have faced up to the obligation of paying for the services to which we have become accustomed.  As a Dublin Deputy, immediately the details of the Budget were made known, I went into the very heart of my constituency.  I went amongst the poorer type of people and explained the position to them. Naturally, they were a bit sore about the increased prices of food.  I pointed out the other advantages and the reasons for the increases.  They faced up to the situation fairly well.  From the point of view of the Party, I say that we would not be one bit afraid to go before the people.  We have been challenged on the other side to go before the people.  We faced the situation as we found it.  When we came into office, we found it was unsatisfactory and we tried to clean up the mess.  We have done it before and anybody with any sense will realise that we are doing the same thing again, not for any political advantage, but for the good of the country.</P>

      <P>It is rather significant that a very vital decision will be taken this evening in this House, because to-day is the 1st of May and the toiling masses of workers of the world over are celebrating in the large cities and towns of their respective countries their liberation from serfdom, their freedom of speech, and certain liberties which they secured down the years. Here in Ireland, if this Budget is passed, the workers will have very little to celebrate.  Instead of marching forward, they will be going backwards as a result of this Budget.  A lot has been said by various speakers on both sides of the House during the last nine or ten days and very little is left to be said by those who have to speak towards the close of this debate.  I do not intend to go over the ground already covered by previous speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My purpose in rising is merely to protest against this financial statement of the Minister and the Government and to try to convey to them, even at this late hour, that they should not impose the taxes which they propose to impose and should not remove the <Col N="863" /> subsidies which they intend to remove in a few months.  I come, not from an industrial area, but from a rural constituency of small, hard-working farmers.  It has been said outside and inside this House that if the price of butter is increased, it does not affect the small farmer, and, that if he buys butter, it is due to laziness or to the mismanagement of his business.  That is untrue.  The small farmer with a wife and children who has six, seven or eight acres of land cannot maintain the necessary number of cows to provide him with an essential quantity of butter.  In nine out of ten cases, he has got to depend on a supply of butter from the creameries or go into the shop and buy butter.  In County Mayo, which is the third largest county in Ireland, there is not one creamery.  It is very easy to count the number of churnings made at the present time in the villages of the constituency I represent. The reason for this is that, due to the uneconomic size of their holdings, the people cannot afford to feed milch cows so that they will produce sufficient milk to make butter. The result is that the people are forced into the shops to purchase butter.</P>
    <P>We all know the racket that was kicked up by the present Government, when in opposition, because the inter-Party Government increased the price of butter by 1d. per 1b.  However, the Government have now increased the price of butter by 10d. per 1b. with one stroke of the pen.  I ask rural Deputies and my colleagues on the Government Benches&mdash;Deputies Moran and S. Flanagan&mdash;can they justify that action before the people in their constituencies?  I cannot see how they can face the people and justify that increase.  I cannot see how the explanation given by the Tánaiste, when he indicated to this House that, if butter was being increased by 10d. per 1b., the price of jam would be decreased, can be accepted.  Jam is a very poor substitute for butter.  We are all aware that when a family is being reared, an effort is being made to make sweet commodities such as jam and confectionery inaccessible.  We all realise that butter is one of the main items <Col N="864" /> on the table of most homes.  In my constituency, at the present time, the seeds are being sown.  There are no potatoes available just now because the small farmers have put their last few hundredweight into the ground as seed.  Therefore, their families will have to exist on bread, butter and tea for the next two or three months.  The housewife who has to budget for a family of from six to ten children will find, when she goes to the shop, that she will have to pay almost 18/- extra for a ten-stone bag of flour.  I was a member of a very large family, and I well remember that a ten-stone bag of flour lasted only eight days.  Remember, our valuation was less than £3 10s. per annum.  In those days flour was cheap in comparison with the present time.  When I endeavour to compare the prices now and the prices then and the mode of life now with that when I was being reared, I pity the mother or the housewife who will be responsible for budgeting for a household when the new prices come into being in a short time.  I would ask Deputies Moran and S. Flanagan and several other rural Deputies if they can honestly justify, with one stroke of the pen, an increase of 18/-in a ten-stone bag of flour, and the increase of 10d. in the 1 1b. of butter? Let us forget about the beer, the cigarettes.  These are articles which can, perhaps, be described as luxuries. Let us face the situation as it is going to affect the housewife or the person responsible for making ends meet at the present time.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the change of Government has brought about more unemployment and more poverty than existed in this State for a considerable time.  When one considers that there are more attending the dole offices to-day than was the case at any time for the past four or five years, surely we are entitled to ask the Government have they considered, in its fullest sense, what the impact of this Budget is going to be on the poorer sections of the people?  Are the Government determined in removing from rural Ireland the last remnants of the people?  Are they determined to close every home in the rural areas and force the people to emigrate in order to get <Col N="865" /> sustenance?  I have been sent up here from all classes of people, but, in particular, from the poor.  I have been sent up by the staunchest Fianna Fáil supporters &mdash; those who would vote for Fianna Fáil to-morrow &mdash; and I have been asked to protest against this Budget and to try to bring home to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues the seriousness of the situation and their inability to make ends meet if this Budget is carried through.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister for Finance, even at the eleventh hour, not to withdraw the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>We have to take into account that the present Government, during the years of the inter-Party Government's régime and, in particular, during the election campaign last year, on every platform and through the medium of the Press made solemn pledges and promises that they would not impose taxation on any of these commodities on which we find taxation imposed to-day, and that they would not withdraw the food subsidies.  These promises were made not by irresponsible candidates but by Ministers who have held office for 16 or 17 years.  Yet, within less than 11 months, we find that these people have gone back on their pledges and have reimposed taxation far in excess of what any Deputy or any candidate, by any stretch of the imagination, this time last year, would have thought possible.</P>
    <P>I would ask responsible Ministers and Deputies are they not ashamed to have associated themselves with and connived in the drafting of a Budget statement of this kind which imposes such drastic taxation.  Surely they know what the verdict of the people is going to be, if they are prepared to face them.  It has been obvious that every speech made from the Government Benches has been more apologetic than anything else.  In fact, one would almost feel sympathetic towards them, because they felt humiliated.  Of course, a few impertinent members of the Party sniggered and smiled, trying to cover up their guilt.  It reminds one of a criminal in the dock who, when sentence of death has been passed upon him, smiles a cynical smile in order to show how <Col N="866" /> brave and courageous he is.  How can the Government have the courage to face the country within the next month or two, or even within the next 24 hours?  We heard a lot from Government speakers about what is being given to replace or to offset the increased taxation and the removal of subsidies.  The amount provided in the Budget is something around £3,000,000 in the form of social services.  Not counting the imposition of taxation, almost double £3,000,000 is being taken back from the people by the removal of the food subsidies.  It means that something over £7,000,000 will be saved in the form of food subsidies.  For every £ you are giving to the poor man you are taking two from him with the other hand.  What form of compensation or relief is that?  You are doing the same thing, but to a much greater degree, as the British Government and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer did in introducing his Budget some few months ago.  You are robbing Peter to pay Paul.  You are giving a £ with one hand and with the other you are taking £2 away, and leaving people much worse off than they were.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said in regard to this miserable 1/6 to the old age pensioners. Ministers have gone back a number of years trying to justify their policy and trying to justify the introduction of this Budget.  They have gone back as far as 1922 and 1923 and talked about the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government and what they did towards the ordinary working man and the old age pensioners.  No matter what they did, it could not be any worse, and it is not worse, than what is being done in this Budget.  When you consider the circumstances under which they did some of those things and the circumstances under which they are being done to-day, you will find that they are totally different. There can be no comparison whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers entertained us for two or three hours on Thursday and on Tuesday.  He travelled all over Europe, from Sweden to Switzerland, France, Belgium; in fact, he brought us all over the world, comparing prices, etc.  He went on to tell us <Col N="867" /> that anything that has been done in the field of social development or industrial development has been done by Fianna Fáil.  That is an untruth.  If we want to be fair in our criticism, we must admit that the beginning of industrial development took place when the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office, whether we like it or not, when they constructed the Shannon scheme which was opposed by the then Opposition, Fianna Fáil, and when they built the first beet factory.  From the Shannon scheme we got the power that has enabled many of our industries to function and to produce the goods which we are producing at the present moment.  That scheme has provided the necessary power, and no matter what Government came into office from 1932 onwards the result would have been industrial development.  We were very backward in that direction, and industrial development was essential in order to balance the economy. Whether it was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, the Fine Gael Government or a Labour Government that introduced that scheme, you would have had the same outcome, industrial development.  But to suggest that Fianna Fáil alone are responsible and that they alone can claim to themselves the achievement of any of the things that have been done in this country since the establishment of the State is a falsehood, and the members of the Government are fully aware of that.</P>
    <P>If you look back to the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and take into consideration the difficulties under which they laboured and carried out administration you will find that the circumstances were absolutely abnormal.  If the help and assistance of the then Opposition was forthcoming instead of what was forthcoming, things might be much better and greater advances and greater strides might have been made.  All the criticism of Deputy Childers and his efforts to take all the laurels and claim all the glory for everything done over the last 20 or 30 years are absolutely absurd.</P>
    <P>He has tried to draw a comparison <Col N="868" /> with countries in Europe and with Great Britain in relation to prices, in relation to the consumption of goods, production, etc.  There can be no comparison. As Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and other Deputies have said time and time again, these countries have passed through two wars in the last 30 years. We have been saved at least one of these wars&mdash;that is, the last war, and we were in a position to make plans and preparations for development. Our central and local authorities were disorganised but we were in a position to make plans and make preparations for the time when things became normal.</P>
    <P>We were led to believe that these post-war plans were formulated from the outbreak of war up to the end of the war but there was very little done until the inter-Party Government came into power.  No matter what may be said of the inter-Party administration it cannot be denied that there is no Government since the establishment of the State which did so much in so short a time.  It is quite common to hear Deputies down the country and spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party saying to ordinary people outside the church gate or in the fair green: &ldquo;Which do you want?  Do you want us to become subservient to some foreign power &mdash; Russia, America, France or Italy?  Do you want us to become subservient by accepting loans or by borrowing money, or do you want us to maintain our freedom and our liberty?&rdquo;  They know full well that the Irish people still have a sound national outlook and they are trying to play on that sound national outlook. They know full well that the Irish people have not yet forgotten the serfdom under which they lived when a foreign power controlled this country.</P>
    <P>They know that no matter what hardships were imposed, if they were in the national interest the people would be prepared to sustain and endure those hardships in order to maintain their freedom.  But it is cruel and despicable that Deputies should take an unfair advantage of the people at church gates and in the fair green and try to convey to them that because America lends us a few million dollars <Col N="869" /> we are now subservient to them and that the real motive of the American Government in lending us this money is to utilise us in some way or other to her advantage.  To say that of a friendly Power and of a friendly Government is most unfair and definitely should not be said by any Deputy or by any responsible Minister inside this House.</P>

      <P>Every Government Deputy who contributed to this Budget has postulated in one form or another that there exists two alternatives. One is to stand on our own feet and the other is to become subservient to a foreign Power by borrowing or getting some financial assistance.  It has not been said, perhaps, in the simple language in which I have stated it but it has been said with one objective in mind, to misrepresent the inter-Party Government and to convey to the simple-minded folk that that was the intention of the inter-Party Government if they remained in office or if they got back into office after a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to think that after only 30 years of freedom, there should have sprung up citizens of such a low and renegade type who, on being elected by the people to Parliament, would descend to such a level as to betray this country and the freedom which has been secured for this part of the 32 Counties.  If the Government feel that what they have done is justifiable then they should not be afraid to seek the verdict of the people. If the Government feel that the people are quite prepared to accept this extra taxation then they should have no hesitation in facing the people for a verdict.  We are of the opinion (1) that the imposition of this taxation is not essential; (2) that the people were not told by the Fianna Fáil Party during the general election campaign that <Col N="870" /> if they were returned to office this taxation would be imposed and (3) that a guarantee was given that the food subsidies would be left as they were.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Budget was introduced in 1947 we asked the then Minister for Finance why he required the extra money for which he imposed extra taxation on certain commodities.  If my memory serves me well, we were told that he needed that extra money to subsidise food.  We were told that it was for the purpose of making cheaper bread and cheaper butter available to the working people. Shortly after the introduction of that Supplementary Budget there was a general election and the Fianna Fáil Government were put out of office. Now, under this Budget, the same duties are being reintroduced but the blow is heavier and the revenue which will come in from this extra taxation will not be devoted to the subsidisation of food.  In point of fact, the subsidisation of food is to be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>We were told by the present Minister that proper allowance for certain matters was not made by Deputy McGilligan in his Budget last year.  I have listened to the speeches made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, and I am prepared to take their word as against that of the present Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance has at his disposal all the information which he requires, and he has the help of civil servants and financial experts.  Despite all that assistance, there have been many blunders in the drafting of this Budget&mdash;blunders which the Minister has admitted.  It is possible that there are many more blunders in this Budget statement which have not been discovered by the former Ministers or Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Costello pointed out that this Government are budgeting for a sum in the neighbourhood of from £9,000,000 to £11,000,000 in excess of what is, in fact, required.  That has not been contradicted by any Government spokesman during the course of this debate. I hope that when the Minister for Finance is concluding he will reply to <Col N="871" /> the points made by Deputy Costello. The Tánaiste made an effort to do so, but he went round in circles and did not give any reply.  Deputy McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, spoke on the afternoon that this Budget was presented, and he spoke again this week.  He did not receive any reply either.  I am prepared to accept the word of Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan as against the word of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputies have described this Budget as drastic, cruel and unreal.  I describe it as a political trick.  I believe every word that Deputy Costello uttered about budgeting for a surplus. I maintain that it is the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to remain in office, if at all possible, for another 12 months.  I believe that, with the surplus moneys which they will have at their disposal by reason of this Budget, they will introduce a much more lenient Budget this time next year, and then face the people with the threat that if they dare change the Government they will have the same mess as they are alleged to have had after the inter-Party Government, and that they will have to pay the same penalty again in the form of excess taxation in order to clear up the mess which will result.  I maintain that 12 months after the presentation of this Budget &mdash; if they can hold on to office for another year &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party will go to the country and seek re-election.  We are aware &mdash; and most Fianna Fáil Deputies have admitted it &mdash; that the Government are not anxious to go to the country.  We can well appreciate their reasons for being loath to do so.</P>
    <P>I daresay that Deputy Moran will follow me in this debate.  We are good friends in our discussions, apart from politics.  I listened to Deputy Moran when he was speaking to his constituents during the last general election.  He was very convincing.  He spoke to large audiences in many large towns in County Mayo.  They were innocent audiences.  He spoke of the dual purchase prices system and, according to him, such a system was not to be discovered in any country <Col N="872" /> outside the Iron Curtain except this country.  He said that the inter-Party Government and the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics had something in common &mdash; that they were running a black market in so far as the essential foodstuffs of the people were concerned.  He pointed out that there was bad flour for the poor but that there was good, white, healthy flour for the rich &mdash; and, of course, he pointed out that there were two prices. He said that the poor man was rationed to a certain allowance and that if he could not do with that allowance he could go hungry, but that the rich man could obtain either the cheap flour or the dear flour.  He said that, naturally, the rich man purchased the good, white flour which was the dear flour.</P>
    <P>During his general election speeches Deputy Moran indicated that if the Fianna Fáil Party were returned to office the dual price system would be altered.  A period of 12 months passed before the system was altered.  We know what the new position will be. Deputy Moran will find great difficulty in explaining to those same audiences in County Mayo how the housewives are going to pay an extra 18/- for the 10-stone bag of flour.  Which system does Deputy Moran honestly consider the more reasonable, Christian and humane &mdash; the dual-price system or the one-price system?  If he is honest he will admit that, under the one-price system, many things will be outside the reach of the poor man's purse.  I do not believe that Deputy Moran can, in truth, say that the one-price system is fairer to the ordinary people of this country than the dual-price system.</P>
    <P>I am told that the back benchers and, in particular, those Deputies representing rural areas were the strongest influence on the Government in relation to the imposition of this extra taxation and to the withdrawal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>I could scarcely believe that, but the general rumour is that the Government would not have agreed to the withdrawal of the subsidies if it were not for the pressure brought to bear on them by Fianna Fáil Deputies from the rural areas.  If that is correct, and if Deputy Moran or any other Deputy had anything to do with the moulding <Col N="873" /> of Government policy in relation to the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the imposition of these taxes, they have a lot to account for, and I do not know how they will account for it when they face their constituents.</P>
    <P>I take a bottle of stout.  Deputies on all sides take a bottle of stout.  The average working man takes a bottle or a pint of stout, and he has now to pay an extra 3d. for his pint.  A packet of cigarettes and a box of matches now costs 2/6, minus a halfpenny.  I shall leave whiskey out of it.  I do not care if whiskey was 6/- a glass.  It does not make any difference so far as the working man is concerned, but I do say that the blow struck in regard to cigarettes and beer is altogether unconscionable. If a penny or twopence were put on the packet of cigarettes, one would not mind it too much, but to increase the price of the packet from 1/9 to 2/4 is altogether unreasonable and unfair to the average working man whose income is from £4 to £5 a week.</P>
    <P>This extra taxation is bad enough, but, side by side with it, we find that almost every Estimate has been slashed with the result that thousands of workers will be put on the dole. Already we have an increase of 15,000 on the number unemployed last year, not counting the 4,000 able-bodied men who have joined the Army and the 1,000 who have emigrated.</P>
    <P>We have record only of those who have signed on at the unemployment exchange and the figures show an increase of, roughly, about 15,000.  When I cast my mind back to what was said by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were over here about unemployment, I wonder what explanation they have to offer for the increased figures now. What explanation have they to offer to the hundreds of men who are lining up to sign at the labour exchanges in towns like Westport, Ballinrobe, Castlebar, Belmullet and Swinford, to get the few shillings which they are allowed?  How are they now to purchase the commodities which will have to bear these increased taxes?  We must not forget that, apart from increased taxation, the cost of many essentials of life has increased doubly or trebly in the last 12 months.  I believe that every Deputy has a conscience <Col N="874" /> and a certain amount of responsibility but I wonder what laxity affects the conscience of Deputies on the Government Benches or do they give any serious consideration to the fact that within the past 12 months the value of the £ has fallen very considerably, judged by the present cost of living?  It is bad enough that the Government should have failed to exercise any reasonable control over the cost of living but, in addition, they now come along to impose this new list of duties.  I ask responsible Deputies to ponder over the dilemma in which they are going to put the housewife with eight or nine &ldquo;kiddies&rdquo; who is faced with the problem of finding food and clothing for them.  What laxity attaches to the consciences of Deputies who are prepared to walk into the Division Lobby behind the Minister, who shows such callous disregard of the necessities of the people in this Budget?</P>
    <P>I think the greatest insult contained in the Budget is the offer of an increase of 1/6 to the old age pensioners. I came into this House in 1944 and I can recall that many motions were tabled by different Parties when Fianna Fáil were in power seeking increase for old age pensioners and for widows and orphans. The one thing that Fianna Fáil seems to forget is that whatever strides were made in the provision of social services during the 16 years they were in office came as a result of the pressure brought to bear upon them by the Opposition Parties.  We know that on one occasion the Minister for Social Welfare, as he now is &mdash; he was then known as the Minister for Local Government &mdash; when a motion was tabled requesting an increase of 2/6 in the old age pension and a small modification of the means test, which it was said would cost £500,000, opposed that motion and so did his Party because, as he said, the Exchequer could not afford it.  They now boast a lot of what they did in that direction but the credit is really due to the Opposition Parties who brought pressure to bear on them.  During the war years, when the old age pensioners were faced with a very high cost of living, <Col N="875" /> what did the Government do for them?  They were offered 2/6 a week and before they could qualify for that 2/6 they had to go before the relieving officer.  Deputies, including Deputy Moran and Deputy Flanagan, know that they would get that 2/6 only on set days once a month.  If the relieving officer was not in good form, if he was after a night on the beer or was on a &ldquo;spree&rdquo;&mdash; that word has become popular now&mdash;he did not turn up at all that day and they had to come back a second day.  They were humiliated and degraded.  They had to admit that they were on the verge of destitution and starvation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am discussing the increase of 1/6 allowed under this Budget to old age pensioners to offset the increase in the cost of living as a result of the new taxes and I am dealing with the provision for social services under this Budget.  I am pointing out that the social services provided by the present Government when they were previously in office were due to the pressure brought to bear on them from this side of the House.  I am pointing out the lack of consideration which the Government had for the old age pensioner when they held full sway and were not depending on the very delicate silk thread of support on which they are dependent at present.  When the inter-Party Government got into power what happened?  They abolished the existing system with one stroke of the pen and gave 17/6 a week to the old age pensioners.  Legislation was passed through this House bringing the pension up to the full £1 per week when the dissolution came.  That legislation had to be upheld by the successors of the inter-Party Government, with the result that the old age <Col N="876" /> pensioners are now receiving £1 a week.  Within a few years the pension was increased from 10/- to £1, an increase of 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>What do we find now?  A miserable 1/6 to offset the increase in the cost of living.  If Deputies have any heart, if they have any shame, or if they have any consideration for the old age pensioners, irrespective of whether they live in the urban or rural areas, they cannot honestly believe that 1/6 will be sufficient to offset the increase in the cost of living.  No greater insult could be offered to the old age pensioners, and if I were a back-bencher in a Government which would make that offer to the old age pensioners in such circumstances as those in which we find ourselves to-day, I would entirely disassociate myself from that Government, and I would do everything in my power to prevent any such proposal being implemented.</P>
      <P>We will have widespread unemployment in every industry and in every trade.  We will have widespread unemployment in every walk of life.  There are considerable reductions in all the Estimates.  One of the most important from the point of view of the small farmer was the money provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. That has been reduced by £500,000. Afforestation has been reduced. Present indications are that there will be a further increase in the number of unemployed, and the unemployed will have to bear an excessive burden and one that they cannot possibly carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a very serious situation calling for very serious consideration. Between now and 10.30 to-night it would be well if those Deputies who are free and who are capable of making up their minds would ask themselves what exactly the consequences will be?  To-night they will be free men walking into the Lobby.  They can undo these burdens.  Will they say to themselves: &ldquo;I am prepared to shoulder my responsibility.  I can prevent the Minister for Finance levying this extra taxation and withdrawing these subsidies.  I believe that the people who will be affected by the withdrawal of the subsidies and the imposition of these taxes will not be <Col N="877" /> able to bear the burden&rdquo;?  Any Fianna Fáil Deputy or any Independent Deputy who acts according to his conscience will have no need to fear facing the electorate and rendering an account of his stewardship.  He must recognise that the situation demands that he should use his vote intelligently. The situation demands that he cast his vote without any consideration except consideration of the effect his vote will have on the community in general and the poorer sections of it in particular.  I appeal to such Deputies at this late hour not to be whipped into the Lobby and into doing something which they know is against their own conscience.  If they vote for the imposition of these new taxes and the removal of the subsidies then they will do something for which they will have to answer.  How they will answer for it I do not know.</P>
    <P>I have made my protest.  I have made the few points I wished to make in relation to flour, butter, tea, sugar, beer, whiskey, cigarettes and tobacco. I am prepared to vote against these impositions and I have no doubt that if in the future the inter-Party Government is returned to power some, or perhaps all, of the burdens that have been so unnecessarily imposed will be removed.</P>

      <P>Since June, 1951, up to the 31st March, 1952, we lived in an air of expectation of what would happen in relation to the budgetary problems with which the present Government was faced.  From 1st April, 1952, to 2nd April, 1952, we were anticipating what the increases would be.  There was no possibility of any decrease and some of us anticipated that limited increases would be made in the case of certain commodities. On April 2nd, the Minister for Finance gave us the details of the taxation that he intended to impose.  It took from the 3rd April to the present day to realise the ramifications of those impositions.  I have put the matter under four sub-heads: expectation, anticipation, taxation and realisation. From to-day onwards until some time in the unforeseeable future there will be nothing but desperation.  Remembering the statements made by the <Col N="878" /> present Government before the last election and their actions now, it seems to me they will take a long time to expiate their sins for the impositions they have placed on the Irish people under this Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Budget has been carried on for a considerable length of time.  Indeed, as somebody said, it has been worn threadbare.  In reply to Deputy Cafferky, may I say that I, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, have nothing to apologise for and I shall have nothing on my conscience in voting for this Budget?  Fianna Fáil introduced their first Budget 20 years ago.  It met with the same criticism and the same sort of tactics as those which are being adopted now.  Fine Gael, at that time, put every boulder they could on the road to progress.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance presented his Budget with the same courage and foresight as he displays to-day and it was carried.  We have travelled a long way on the road since those days.</P>
      <P>We all know that there are a number of things which a Government must do, just as a businessman must do, in order to balance the Budget so as to ensure that the business of the State will be carried on as it ought to be. The most essential thing which he has to do is to submit a reasonably balanced Budget.  How is he to achieve that end?  We are all agreed that there are a few methods which would help him to achieve it.  One is a reduction of imports.  Another, which may be termed an aid, would be an increase in agricultural and industrial production.  He has another aid.  It may be drastic, but, for the good of the community, as a whole, he must have recourse to measures which will ensure that each one in the community will receive a fair slice of the national cake, and that is a reduction in amenities and services so as to make capital available for production. Another aid would be an increase in exports and savings, the savings to be produced by thrift on the part of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Minister has to consider how he will raise taxation without causing greater depression. <Col N="879" /> Some Opposition speakers do not seem to realise how he is to put more money into circulation without causing a greater trade on balance, or how to increase taxation on the higher income groups without reducing the savings for investment which those groups should normally provide for capital purposes, and, lastly, how to get our people, in a democracy such as ours, to provide more savings for capital purposes and to get them to submit to the taxation necessary towards that end.  These are the difficulties which faced the Minister for Finance in presenting his Budget for 1952.  I think that, in these circumstances, no Fianna Fáil Deputy need apologise for walking into the Division Lobby to-night to support this Budget.  The Minister has tried, as far as lay in his power, to reduce the burdens on the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It was easy for the Opposition, when they took over in 1948, to remit the taxes that we had imposed on beer, spirits and cigarettes in the previous year.  It was a popular thing to do, seeing that, at that time, they were about to receive all this money through Marshall Aid.  It was calculated that, under the Supplementary Budget introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1947, 3d. on the pint would bring in £830,000 to the Exchequer, that 4d. on the packet of 20 cigarettes and 4½d. and 5d. on hard and soft tobacco would bring in £1,960,000.  These amounts would have yielded, in the years that have since elapsed, a big sum to the Exchequer, and would, I submit, have left us in the position of being able to use the Marshall Aid moneys for capital purposes instead of putting them into the Exchequer to meet current expenditure. The Opposition state that they would borrow, at least that is their alternative.  I have not heard very many alternatives from them.  I may say, in fairness, that, except from the trade union journal, I have not heard many solutions offered either by Labour in this House or by any other member of the Opposition.</P>

Apparently, Deputy Costello offers borrowing as an alternative to taxation.  I am not so sure that he means that.  It may be perhaps that the Opposition are beginning to see the futility of that course of action.  Having borrowed to the degree necessary to cover expenditure, they conveniently forgot to make provision in their Budget of 1951 to cover a number of items of capital expenditure.  They conveniently forgot the sum of £11,070,000 that Fianna Fáil found in the debris when they came to power.  Experience teaches that borrowing is the most cowardly form of taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No Government, which will put popularity with the electorate before duty to its country, deserves to hold office.  The Minister for Finance, I submit, Sir, made every endeavour to protect to the greatest extent possible the poor and lower salaried groups in the community.  This fact has been completely ignored by speakers in this House in criticism of the Budget.  They pointed out all its disadvantages to the House but they did not point to any of its advantages.</P>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that in the last Budget the inter-Party Government put every item of expenditure on the long finger. They feared to ask the people to pay their way out of current expenditure. In doing this, of course, they were paying for popularity.  Thus, they point to increases in foodstuffs and to the withdrawal of the subsidies.  They conveniently forgot the roaring trade that was done in the black market and in off the ration foodstuffs as they were pleased to call them.  We were told at the time that we could have plenty of tea at 6/6 a lb., as against our future price&mdash;and I have no apology to make for this&mdash;of roughly 3/6 per lb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a weakness on the part of the people and it was not the fault of the Government.  The Government protected every individual by rationing and you cannot deny that. There was black market sugar at 9d. per lb. as against the future price of 6½d. per lb.  In passing, how long, for instance, would two ounces of tea do a worker in Bord na Móna who has to have tea four times a day and how long would ¾ lb. of sugar do him?  The people are not blinded by the wild talk about this Budget down the country. If you go to any businessman or if you ask any worker in Bord na Móna how much of the off the ration tea and sugar they bought they will tell you that the derationing of these commodities is a blessing actually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Then again, you had ½ lb. of butter at 4/- per lb.  How long would that do a bog worker in Bord na Móna or a man doing heavy manual labour for the county council?  As against that, the future price will be 3/10.  Six shillings per stone was the unofficial price for flour as against the future price of 4/9½; 1/2 was the unofficial price for the white loaf as against the future price of 9d.  You can couple with this a net saving of £3,900,000 on subsidies, that is allowing for the relief lifted off the taxpayer's back by the abolition of this form of hidden taxation.  That is what it amounted to &mdash; hidden taxation. You make for better business and better living.</P>
      <P>Every man knows what he is paying into the Exchequer and you are not taking taxes from him by reneging as at a game of cards.  You are asking him outright for it.  The direct approach, I submit, is the best and shortest every time.  I presume that it was no pleasure for the Minister for Finance to levy taxes on our people. Rather would the pleasure be to remove them.  The people opposite know that our dollar debt has got to be honoured and I presume that Deputy Costello would not have it otherwise since it is on record that he insisted it should be paid back in dollars.  Are they going to stand in our way then by this sort of tactics, wild criticism and protest meetings and stop us from honouring that debt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Budget has been discussed from many angles, but I notice in financial reviews and reports from the chairmen of various companies and industrial bodies in this country and from businessmen that they have their money invested in this State and were not afraid to invest it when this was a very young country.  Is there anyone of the Opposition who would presume to say that they were out to profit at the expense of labour in those days? Is there anybody on the Opposition Benches who would presume to say that they should not get a fair return for investing this capital in their own <Col N="883" /> country?  I have read a good many of these reports and I have not seen from any of them that they would be likely to condemn the policy of the Minister for Finance in trying to give back stability to our £, as it were, and put purchasing power into it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky unwittingly made the case against his own side of the House when he spoke of the housewife going into a shop and the trouble she had in stretching her £, as it were.  That is what the Minister is trying to do.  He is trying to put back purchasing power into the £.  Goods were so inflated and ballooned in price in this country that the housewife was in a dilemma. No matter how many pounds she had to purchase the goods, they did not seem to go any way towards the cost of the goods.</P>
    <P>There are a number of contributing factors to our present difficulties.  The Minister for Finance pointed out in his Budget statement that one of the largest causes contributing towards our present circumstances was the failure of our agricultural production to regain its 1938-39 level, while in other countries, not so favourably situated as we are, it is now 10 per cent. greater than before the war.  One of the chief causes contributing towards our difficulties is that, notwithstanding all that can be done to increase output in this direction, and even with the help of the increase in the output of industrial goods, whether for export or to replace imports of commodities in this category, it is to the main industry of the country, namely, agriculture, that we must look for expansion, and for an improvement in the present position. Here again an improvement in the over-all position may be effected either by increasing exports or replacing by home production some of the agricultural commodities we now import in large quantities.  It should be the function of the people engaged in industry to do everything in their power to help towards this end, so that the yeast in the national cake, as it were, will do its work properly in order that the cake will be sufficient to give everybody a slice.</P>
    <P>We must realise that farming is a business entailing, for the most part, <Col N="884" /> a good deal of hard work, which is not always adequately paid for.  On the other hand, a large section of the community who are not farmers must look to our landowners to produce at least a considerable proportion of our daily food and, in return for this, certain fundamentals must be assured to the farmer.  Some of these fundamentals might be described as follows: He must have a ready market, home or export, particularly for produce surplus to his ordinary output.  He must receive a price sufficient to enable him to maintain the fertility of his land, to purchase his necessary raw materials, to maintain himself and his family in comfort, and to have an over-all margin of profit in proportion to the capital invested in his farm and its contents.  He must be in a position to incur the expenditure necessary in connection with the increased production demanded from him, and he is therefore entitled to adequate facilities. While the farmer may demand all these things, the community at large is equally entitled to demand that the farmer's income is not increased merely by higher prices for his produce, but by higher yields per unit per area.</P>
    <P>The same applies to industry.  The trade statistics in any journal one takes up show the place that agriculture holds in the economy of this country. In the full year, 1950, agricultural produce of one kind or another accounted for over £50,000,000 of our total exports.  The exports of certain industrial products, including beer, which depends on agriculture for its raw materials, accounted for £5,000,000 extra, or a total of £55,000,000.  The same trend is shown in the figures for 1951.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the picture &mdash; the import side.  The figures show a huge volume of certain products of which a greater proportion of substitutes could be produced at home.  This trend seemed to have continued up to at least the date Deputy MacEntee assumed power as Minister for Finance in this country and put a check on it. Figures for January-November, 1951, show that animal feeding stuffs&mdash;coarse grains and other foodstuffs &mdash; together with fruit and dried vegetables accounted for the sum of in or near <Col N="885" /> £23,000,000, compared with about £30,000,000 previously.  Nobody will maintain that we could or should produce at home the whole of our imports under these heads or provide subsidies for them, but certain items representing huge sums strike the eye and I will read you the following figures.  For the year 1950 we imported £4.6 million worth of wheat; maize £7.8 million; oats £.17 million.  In 1951 we imported £7.5 million worth of wheat; maize £5.1 million; oats £.45 million; and butter £1.68 million.  Added to our difficulty is the fact that the area under wheat in this country has fallen from approximately 660,000 acres in 1945 to 281,000 acres in 1951.  It is quite possible that under normal conditions it might not be an economic proposition to insist on a large area under wheat but we are not dealing with normal conditions at the present time.  World supplies of wheat are in doubt and precarious.  Australia cannot fulfil her quota under the wheat agreement. Canada has had a bad harvest.  The Argentine is said to be importing rather than exporting wheat.  France is in the same position.  Only in America has wheat production in 1951 remained at the standard it had reached in 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, Sir.  It is relevant because increased production seems to be the only way out of our difficulties and that is the subject on which I am speaking.  Wheat is one of the things we have to pay for very heavily and which causes an adverse balance on our trade; more especially is it important because it is one of the commodities which comes from the hard currency or dollar areas and because dollars are hard to come by. However, side by side with that, world wheat consumption is increasing and year by year, production is failing to keep pace with the demand.  Therefore, it is up to us as a country of workers at least to make provision for ourselves and I think that no one on the Opposition Benches will disagree with that.</P>

      <Col N="886" /> In conclusion I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Seán MacEntee, who as I said at the outset, introduced our first Budget, 20 years ago.  He had to blaze a trail through the same opposition as we meet with to-day.  He laid the plans for the foundation of the State.  We are not long in existence as a free country &mdash; only 31 years.  The country is now able to float under its own sail without any help from any outside power.  Therefore, we on this side of the House, members of the Fianna Fáil Party, have nothing to apologise for to-night when walking behind our Minister for Finance and voting for this Budget which he introduced on 2nd April, 1952.</P>

It is hard to believe that there are men with common sense and intelligence, elected representatives to this House, who can stand up here and congratulate the Minister for Finance on this disaster, this hunger and thirst Budget.  Could any Minister for Finance bring any more disgrace on himself or upon the country than this Budget?  God has strange ways of punishing people.  The peoples of almost every country in the world have suffered in our own memory.  The Spaniards have suffered a civil war; Japan has had its difficulties; the Abyssinians also have had difficulties. In France difficulties are arising every day of the week; England has gone through two great wars in our own memory.  Germany built itself up and was blown to pieces, and the German people and the German nation was destroyed. The Italians only last year suffered severe losses through flood havoc.  Mussolini assisted in the building up of the country and was responsible for the destruction of Italy and its people.  In addition to that we have often read of how the Lord saw fit to punish the citizens of Sodom and Gomorrah when he let down fire and brimstone upon them.  He has different ways of punishing people, and the way He has decided to punish the Irish people is to leave us Eamon de Valera.</P>

    <P>We have read of black '47 and that the people starved in that year because of the failure of the crops. This year can be called black '52 because where is the difference in having no food and in depriving the people of the right to purchase food by imposing an exorbitant price on essential commodities?  There will be hunger for this nation because people will not be able to purchase the food they need.  This is a hungry Budget and, in addition, it is a thirsty Budget. Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party, together with those four or five Independent Deputies, can be held responsible for this Budget.  Deputy Dunne did not call the four or five Independent gentlemen who support Fianna Fáil &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; but &ldquo;Dependents.&rdquo;  They are dependents because, as far as their political life in this country is concerned, they depend on the Taoiseach.  They decided to support this Budget.  On every platform of the country where a Fianna Fáil spokesman stands he says: &ldquo;The reason why we had to present the country with this Budget is because the inter-Party Government left us in debt.&rdquo;  No Fianna Fáil Deputy has risen to speak on this Budget without saying the country was in debt and every one of them said that the increased taxation was due to the actions of the inter-Party Government. When the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office in this country taxation was £25,000,000. When the Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1932 their first Budget was for £28,000,000; in 1934 it was £28,000,000; in 1935 it was £29,000,000; in 1936 it was £30,000,000; in 1937 it <Col N="888" /> was £31,000,000; in 1938 it was £31,000,000; in 1939 it was £32,000,000; in 1940 it was £33,000,000; in 1941 it was £40,000,000; in 1942 it was £42,000,000; in 1943 it was £45,000,000; in 1944 it was £49,000,000; in 1945 it was £51,000,000; in 1946 it was £53,000,000; in 1947 it was £60,000,000.  Was the inter-Party Government responsible for that?</P>

      <P>Those are Fianna Fáil's housekeeping figures; they have dug their hands deeper into the taxpayer's pocket every year since they took office and they have studied nothing else.  Now they tell us that the reason they have to impose additional taxes on the people is because of the housekeeping of the inter-Party Government.  Was there not bad housekeeping between 1932 and 1947 when they put up the taxes from £28,000,000 to £60,000,000?  They cannot say that the inter-Party Government did that.  That is their work. That is the work for which Deputy Cogan condemned them in this House year after year.  There was no inter-Party Government while the people were being fleeced.  The inter-Party Government did not rule from 1932 to 1947, when millions of pounds were taken out of the taxpayers' pockets in this country.  They did not study anything else.  Since Fianna Fáil took office in 1932, and during their present term of office, there has never been any iota of relief for the taxpayer of this country.  The only relief given was during the three years of the inter-Party Government.  I challenge any Fianna Fáil Deputy to tell us what taxes they reduced from 1932 to the present day.</P>

      <P>We took off the penal taxes you imposed in 1948 and which you are trying to reimpose in 1952.  We reduced the tax on the pint and on the cigarette and, in addition to that, we reduced unemployment. Everybody was working during our term of office.  In fact, it was difficult <Col N="889" /> to secure the services of a worker throughout the whole country.  At the present time there are over 70,000 registered unemployed, and I suppose there are another 20,000 unemployed unregistered, which gives us almost 100,000 unemployed, as a result of the codology and the bull of the opposite Party.  Emigration has increased to such an extent that we do not know how many have left the country.</P>

      <P>I fail completely to understand the mentality of the Deputies who have supported this Budget.  Of course, we all know Fianna Fáil and its leader so well that we are not surprised.  On the 13th of June last they took office. People thronged outside the gates of this House, into the hallway and into the lobbies, and the hand of every Fianna Fáil Deputy was warmly shaken by their supporters.  The Fianna Fáil supporters said: &ldquo;Thank God, we have got the inter-Party out. Let us keep them out.&rdquo;  The people were stretching their hands outside the door and outside the gate trying to touch the long black coat of the Taoiseach as he left to go to the President.</P>

      <P>The crowd that applauded the present Government when they took office are not here to applaud them to-night.  The crowds that shouted: &ldquo;Up Fianna Fáil&rdquo; did not know that they were shouting: &ldquo;Up 10d. per lb.  on the butter.&rdquo;  It is only now they realise that they did not know they were then shouting: &ldquo;Up 3d. on the pint; up 7d. on the cigarettes&rdquo;.  When people were being canvassed for the set-up which is responsible for this calamity, the canvassers did not say: &ldquo;Vote for us, <Col N="890" /> because when we get in we are going to put 10d. per lb. on the butter.&rdquo; They made sure not to say things like that to the electorate.  They did not say: &ldquo;Vote for us.  When we get in there are going to be 90,000 people unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There would be no one idle.  In the good old days it was the Fianna Fáil policy to have work for everyone.  I should like to recall to the minds of Fianna Fáil Deputies the good times when their policy was one man one job, and that no man was worth more than £1,000 a year.  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies remember the time when they said that President Cosgrave, who was running this country on £25,000,000 a year, was being wildly extravagant?  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies remember the time when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were condemned for wearing dicky bows and tall hats?  Who are wearing the dicky bows and tall hats to-day?</P>

      <P>I respectfully say on this motion that the present Government have, as far as they possibly could, disregarded all human respect for the ordinary workers and labouringclass people of this country.  For the past nine months we have been treated to nothing but banshee wailings and sadness and gloom.  If the Fianna Fáil Party are not talking of war or destruction they are sounding some other sad note because that is what they like to do.  Every Fianna Fáil Deputy should be supplied with a bugle to sound the Last Post and to make things really sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government say that our people are not working hard enough, that they are spending too much, and that they are eating too much.  The people of this country had three and a half prosperous years under the inter-Party Government, during which time there was work for all and taxation was lowered.  That was the envy of Fianna Fáil.  The moment they got back into office, they said: &ldquo;The Irish people have had good times for the past three years. We shall put a stop to these good times <Col N="891" /> now.  We shall take the smile off the faces of those who have been smiling for the past three and a half years, and we shall make them cry instead.  We shall advise those who are wearing good clothes to take them off and don, instead, the rags which they were wearing from 1932 to 1948.  There are bad times and hard times coming.&rdquo; The Taoiseach again sounded a warning note when he said: &ldquo;We may soon have war.  Famine is coming.  The farmers are not working hard enough. There should be more tillage.&rdquo; Government Ministers visited every part of the country and made speeches in an effort to disturb the peace and contentment, and to upset the prosperity that prevailed under the Costello Administration.  The progress made in this country during the three and a half years of inter-Party Government was the envy, not alone of Fianna Fáil, but of the whole world.</P>
    <P>It was a sad and disastrous day for this country when Fianna Fáil were enabled to form a Government. Thanks be to God, the term of office of that Government is coming to an end. From last June till now they have succeeded pretty well in raising the cost of living.  I think all of us expected that the Budget would be severe, but in our wildest dreams we did not expect that it would be as crazy as it is.  Surely the Minister for Finance must be aware of the anger of the people of this country at the proposals to increase the price of flour, bread, tea, sugar, butter, tobacco and cigarettes, beer, stout, spirits, petrol, oil and income-tax?  Never before in the history of this country have the people been so enraged as they have been by the introduction of this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Dublin County Council passed a resolution asking the President of this country to convene a Council of State with the least possible delay to ask the Taoiseach, in the name of God and all decency, to pack up and get out so that the Irish people might get an opportunity of rejecting this cruel burden of taxation that is being imposed on them.  I do not know whether His Excellency has arranged <Col N="892" /> for the convening of the Council of State: I expect that the Dublin County Council will attend to that matter. The increase in the prices of bread, flour, tea, sugar and butter will affect the ordinary ratepayer for whom Deputy Cogan is always crying.  The unfortunate Wicklow farmer will pay higher rates in order to maintain the county home and the county hospital and the county institutions in Wicklow. The local authorities will be obliged to impose higher rates on the people as a result of this Budget.  The Government have no mandate from the people to impose this heavy taxation. Surely the Government and the Fianna Fáil Deputies must be aware how unfavourably the Budget was received by the people?  Surely they noted the manner in which it was described in the newspapers?  One citizen, when questioned about his opinion of the Budget, inquired: &ldquo;Is he mad?&rdquo;  The answer is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  No sane man would present the taxpayers of this country with this bill.  In a letter in the <i>Evening Herald</i>, one citizen writes: &ldquo;Bread and butter are our simple diet.  We shall starve now, thanks to Mr. MacEntee.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I can assure the House and the bandit Minister that this Budget is legalised robbery of the taxpayers of the country, something the taxpayers are condemning and will reject at the first available opportunity. Deputy McQuillan speaking yesterday said: &ldquo;I cannot see any difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael; one is Tweedledum and the other is Tweedledee.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan can call Fianna Fáil anything he likes, but what we want to see is Tweedledee putting out Tweedledum.  If Deputy McQuillan has the slightest doubt about it, I can assure him that at the first available opportunity the people will make that change and there will be no mistake about it.  Deputy McQuillan and, I think, Deputy Alfred Byrne this morning went a little further. They asked the Leader of the Opposition for a statement.  They said: &ldquo;Let us know what you are going to do about these taxes if you take office.&rdquo;  I cannot speak for the Leader of the Opposition but I can speak for myself, and if I were Leader of the Opposition, I would tell both of these Deputies to put up a running jump for themselves.  They can vote for it or against it but I would commit myself in no way.  Empty heads put this Government in and empty bellies will put them out.  If Deputy Byrne, Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Cogan or Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll want to know what the inter-Party group would do about this tax, their memories must <Col N="894" /> be very short.  They have only to reflect on what happened three or four years ago when we undid the damage that Fianna Fáil had done by removing the cruel and brutal taxes that were then imposed on this country.  I look upon it as a reflection on the work of the inter-Party Government that any Deputy should even ask them what they would do if they go back to office. We expect more confidence from these Deputies.  Does it not stand to reason that we would not be bellowing our protests against the Budget if we agreed to these taxes?</P>

      <P>I will not go to Strasbourg to make a disgrace of the country, anyway.  I believe that Deputy Byrne and Deputy McQuillan were not serious when they were making such queries because they have only to look at the record of the inter-Party Government and their proud achievements, the proud achievements which the people of this country approved at the last general election when they rejected the Taoiseach's call for an over-all majority and when inter-Party votes put in Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll.  These Deputies are in this House to-day as a result of the votes that were left over from Fine Gael and Labour.  The people who cast these votes for them cast them in favour of a continuance of the inter-Party Government. Remember there is an angry electorate waiting for Deputy Cogan.  If they do not get him this month, they are sure to get him in four years' time.  I am generally very busy in my own constituency at election times, but I am sure Deputy Everett and Deputy Brennan will not mind, if I intrude for one or two Sundays in their constituency at the next election.</P>

      <P>If I might be permitted to continue, the Opposition has proven to this House and to the country that the present Minister has overbudgeted by £9,000,000.  That is a fact that cannot be denied.  We are told by Fianna Fáil back benchers that Marshall Aid has to be repaid and that in order to pay back Marshall Aid this Budget is necessary.  When the inter-Party Government left office they left £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid money behind them.  If the present Government wish to pay back that money they could pay back £1,000,000 a year for 26 years without this Budget. What did they do with the £26,000,000?</P>
      <P>Then they tell us that we put them into debt?  What did the Government do with the £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid that the inter-Party Government left behind?  They are silent about that.  There is no reply to that.  The people down the country know quite well that they squandered the £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid that we left behind instead of holding it to pay back the instalments when the repayment period arrived.  If they had held that money, by the time the last instalment came to be paid there would have been a profit from the investments made with Marshall Aid money. The country would have had an overwhelming profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They tell us that the inter-Party Government put them into debt.  If anyone has plunged this country headlong <Col N="897" /> into debt it is the present Government set-up.  Not one of them has told us why this extra taxation is necessary.  They have told us that they have to pay back Marshall Aid.  We do not believe that because we know that it is not true.  The people know it is not true.  Both Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello had placed the facts before the House and before the country, and neither Deputy MacEntee (Minister for Finance or Deputy de Valera (the Taoiseach) has said that Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan were right. wrong.  We know they were right. £28,000,000 was left on the table of the Minister for Finance.</P>

Worse still, does he know why he must pay more for his bread and butter after 1st July&mdash;if this Government is still in office&mdash;and for his tea and his sugar?</P>
      <P>Estimates which benefited the country in providing work and employment at decent rates of wages in order to give our workers a decent standard of living have been cut down.  But the President's establishment has gone up this year.  Yet they tell us the Irish people are living beyond their means. The agricultural worker is living beyond his means; so is the widow and orphan, the old age pensioner, the blind pensioner, the unemployed and the small farmer, the coal miner and the bog worker.  They are all living beyond their means.  They must cut down. They must not eat so much.  They must not wear so much.  They must work harder.  They must save.  They must pay more in taxes.  They must make greater sacrifices to keep the flag flying and keep those chaps shouting: &ldquo;Up Dev.&rdquo;  They must starve themselves. They must cut down, and up goes the President's establishment.</P>

      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  Up goes the President's establishment, which is already costing us almost £52,000 a year.  There is an increase in the Vote for his establishment and the unfortunate road worker, the agricultural labourer and small farmer must pay more for his tea, his sugar, his bread and his butter. He must cut down his standard of living, but the President's establishment goes up.  There is tall hat policy for you.  There is the stuffed shirt and the bow tie policy.

      <P>Is it any wonder that a certain Department sent out a circular relating to the repair of all county homes? They will be badly wanted.  Do not forget that a large sum of money is being provided for mass radiography, so that people can go to the mass radiography centre and have a free chest X-ray.  Their health records will be kept.  There will be no need for the mass radiography personnel 12 months hence if Fianna Fáil is still in office, because people will have nothing to do except open their waistcoats and their friends will be able to see through them because of hunger. There will be no need for mass radiography. Fianna Fáil will X-ray the people free.  Their back bones will be visible through their chest bones.  They will have no trouble in seeing through each other 12 months hence if Fianna Fáil is still in office.  There will be no need for mass radiography, and Deputy Dr. Maguire need not worry about his patients and Deputy Dr. Browne need not worry about X-rays.</P>

      <P>What else has increased? The Estimates for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department of the Taoiseach have gone up.  That is <Col N="899" /> the man who is telling us we must not live beyond our means.  Yet, the Estimate for his own Department has gone up, and the people are to starve.  They must pay more for their bread, their tea, their sugar, their smokes and their pint.  They must work harder and longer so that the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department can go up. That is Fianna Fáil's standard.</P>
      <P>What else has gone up?  Science and Art.  Deputy Killilea will be interested in this.  Will Deputy Killilea, who is an expert in Science and Art, tell us the reason for that increase?  Perhaps Deputy Corry would make his eloquence felt on Science and Art. Perhaps Deputy Cogan would tell us the reason for the increase in Science and Art and the reason why my constituents have to pay more for a bottle of stout in order that Science and Art can be increased.  Deputy Byrne's constituents in the North Wall and in the dockyard will have to leave their work of discharging cargoes with the dust in their throats and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths because they must go home without a drink so that Science and Art can go up.</P>
      <P>What else has gone up?  The Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will know about this.  He should know about the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies.  Perhaps he will let us know something about that increase and the reason why my constituents and the ordinary taxpayer must pay more for the essentials of life so that the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies can go up.</P>
      <P>Universities and Colleges have gone up.  The children of the bog workers in my constituency will not be attending the University, so why should they have to pay for it?  Why should the small farmers have to pay so that the Universities and Colleges can go up?  Why should the coal workers in Rossmore and Wolfhill have to pay more for the essentials of life so that the Universities and Colleges can have more money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What else has gone up?  The Army. A leopard never changes his spots.  I <Col N="900" /> suppose war was in the Taoiseach's mind again and he said: &ldquo;Provide more for the Army.&rdquo;  The workers must sacrifice their bottle of stout. What is worse, they must eat a hard crust dry because they will not be able to pay the additional 10d. per lb. for butter.  The cost of the Army has gone up.  What are we going to fight?  Who are we going to fight?  Who is there to fight?  If there was war in the morning Fianna Fáil has pledged itself to neturality.  What do they want an Army for?  We on this side of the House have pledged ourselves to neutrality in the event of war.  Why should the taxpayers be bled to the last to keep up an Army if it is not wanted?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Estimate for Secret Service has also gone up, and that the people must sacrifice their loaf, their butter, the pint and the bottle of stout because this Estimate <Col N="901" /> is up.  You can picture a secret service in a peaceful country where the gaols were almost empty under the inter-Party Government.  There was not such a thing as crime under the inter-Party Government.  There was an atmosphere of goodwill, peace and brotherly love amongst all in this country. There was an atmosphere of peace and an air of freedom such as never prevailed before and such as has not prevailed since.  There was no such thing as an increased demand for the Secret Service.  But the moment Fianna Fáil got back they said: &ldquo;Let us now organise the spies again; let us pay one Irishman for spying on another&rdquo;, and here we see that all those men who sit behind the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are standing over the creation of spies and informers, for one to tell on another. Worse than that, this additional secret service money is to be provided this year for the purpose of strengthening the Fianna Fáil organisation because there is not a Fianna Fáil tout in the country but has his secret service.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputies to concentrate for a moment on the points which I have put before them &mdash;the unnecessary taxation and the unnecessary Estimates that we are being asked to pay for in this Budget. But there is something worse still. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when speaking on the Budget, said that the reason why they took the tax off dancing was because it was hard to collect.  When asked how much it was he said, with a wave of his hand, £145,000. That sum was not worth collecting and they would not think twice about it. What would not £145,000 do towards solving the unemployment problem in different areas?  If given to the Dublin Corporation it would go a long way towards providing work for the unemployed.  If Deputy McQuillan, <Col N="902" /> Deputy Finan and I had £145,000 to spend on the Shannon Valley what joy would it not bring to the flooded-out farmers in that area, which Deputy Davin has visited on many occasions. The Deputy knows that for nine out of the 12 months the farmers there cannot use their lands.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who was born and reared in the Shannon Valley, must know that if that sum of money were spent between Meelick and Athlone it would do a lot to improve the conditions of the unfortunate people in that area.  But the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tells us that it is not worth collecting.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies have seen, or whether I would be permitted to quote from, the <i>Times Pictorial</i> of June 23rd, 1951, which was about a fortnight after the change of Government. The following paragraph appeared in it from a correspondent:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am prepared to bet five pairs of expensive nylons against a row of safety pins that the present tax on dancing will be removed as soon as it is convenient for the Government to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fortnight after the present Government took office that article appeared in the <i>Times Pictorial.</i>  Dance halls and hops are available, and will be available to swell the Fianna Fáil election fighting fund.  People are wondering and are disturbed to know why the dance hall proprietors have been relieved from this taxation. This article, which appeared a fortnight after the last election, was written by a correspondent of the <i>Times Pictorial</i> who knew the inside story of a promise and an undertaking &mdash; a solemn undertaking, mind you&mdash; made by the Tánaiste to a Miss Morris of the Dance Hall Proprietors' Association and stating that, immediately the opportunity presented itself, the dance halls were to be free of taxes.  Because of that undertaking, practically every ballroom in Bray, Dublin and in the provincial towns was made available to the Fianna Fáil cumainn free of charge, and in cases in Dublin the dance hall owners provided the bands free for the Fianna Fáil organisation so that they might honour <Col N="903" /> and undertake to relieve them of this tax.</P>

      <P>The Deputy challenges the truth of that.  Deputy Cormac Breathnach says that this statement is entirely untrue.  I have here in my possession a copy of a letter dated the 10th May, 1951, written from this House &mdash; Dáil Éireann &mdash; by Deputy Lemass and signed &ldquo;Seán F. Lemass&rdquo;.  It is addressed to Miss Morris, the Olympic Ballroom, Pleasants Street, Dublin.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Party Committee has considered the entertainment duty on dances, and we have decided that, it is a most undesirable tax which we will remove.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does Deputy Cormac Breathnach deny that?  It is signed &ldquo;Séan F. Lemass&rdquo; and is addressed to Miss Morris, and is dated the 10th May, 1951.</P>

      <P>This, in my opinion, is in the nature of a bribe, and I am entitled to describe it as a corrupt practice in no uncertain manner.  And then people will say of the Tánaiste that he is a smart man, a brainy man and a straight man.  Here we see how they sneaked back into office.  Now we know how they got the funds to put up the big posters with the Taoiseach and underneath in black print: &ldquo;Vote for him.  You can trust Dev.&rdquo;  Now we know where the funds were got in relation to the poster of the unfortunate housewife about whom we heard so much during the last general election.  Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, went on to write:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to the abolition of entertainment duty for the present financial year, however, a decision must necessarily await the detailed examination of our next Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The detailed examination of our next Budget.&rdquo;  He kept his promise to Miss Morris.  Do not doubt it, Sir, but that Miss Morris will vote Fianna Fáil.  Why would she not?  Surely she would not <Col N="904" /> be so ungrateful as to bite the hand that fed her.  The dance hall owners of this country are the only one section of the community to whom Fianna Fáil have extended their sympathy. The reason was because those dance hall owners were requested to give generously to the election fund and other headquarter funds of Fianna Fáil, and they are doing so to this very day. Cheques have gone into Fianna Fáil headquarters from the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association within the past month in this connection, so that if a change of Government comes they will not find themselves in the position that those taxes will be reimposed again.  A number of dance hall owners in this country have subscribed as generously as to the sum of £250 and £300 each.  Now we know how the Government have agreed to bring about a relief in the entertainment duty.</P>
    <P>We are told here that they had nothing to tax.  They tell us in no uncertain way that they had to tax and that it was not a pleasant duty for them to tax immediately.  That is the line of action they have been following up since they first became a Government in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in the course of his speech last week, referred to luxury goods.  He did not seem to give very great consideration to the question of imposing additional taxes in order to get in some revenue from luxury goods.  I can say, Sir, that the Government would be better advised to tax imported luxury goods than to tax the essentials of life which the people need.</P>
    <P>Surtax was referred to.  The Minister for Finance stated that there were 200 people in this country whose incomes were over £10,000 a year and that there was a large section of our people with incomes of over £3,000 a year.  He also stated that in respect of those whose incomes were over £1,500 a year, 53 per cent. was taken by way of income-tax and surtax by the State.  We all remember very clearly when the present Taoiseach very loudly stated that there was no man worth more than £1,000 a year. How often did we hear him say that? <Col N="905" /> Were we not deafened hearing him say that no man was worth more than £1,000 a year?  The same man who said that no man was worth £1,000 a year, only three years ago said that 50/- a week was good enough for a labouring man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly advocate putting severe taxes on those whose incomes are over £10,000 a year.  I would tax them to the hilt. I would tax them to such an extent as to leave them what would give them a comfortable living and a comfortable existence.  Seventy thousand unemployed, agricultural workers, labourers and farmers with such a low standard of living are asked to work harder and pay more taxes while those with incomes of over £10,000 and £3,000 can get away with it.  I would also tax up to the hilt those with incomes of over £3,000 and offer no apology for doing it, but the poor man's Government will not tax those people.  Probably some of those who have £10,000 a year can sit down and write a cheque for £500 to Fianna Fáil headquarters as readily as they would sign a cheque for 6d.  Fianna Fáil are catering for those with the big salaries and they are completely crippling the ordinary worker and the ordinary wage earner of this country.</P>
      <P>Even since the Budget what have we seen?  Razor blades have gone up.  They are even depriving the ordinary citizen of a shave.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made an Order increasing the price of the ordinary razor blade within the last few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most extraordinary to hear the Government making an appeal for more production.  The Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, was addressing the Veterinary Council of Ireland in the Hibernian Hotel, Dublin, recently &mdash;<Col N="906" /> note where he was addressing them &mdash; and this is what he said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had heard recently that this country was living beyond its means. Everybody agreed with that at any rate and all agreed that we certainly were living beyond our means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When they read a speech of that kind being made in the Hibernian Hotel surely it must give the working classes something to think over seriously.</P>
    <P>If the Government were sincere or genuine in catering for the ordinary man in the street and anxious to help him &mdash; which they are not &mdash; several Deputies have suggested alternative means of raising taxes.  There are many ways of doing that.  I have dealt with the taxation of the wealthy elasses.  I offer no apology to anyone for advocating further taxation for them.  I would also tax Gaelic Athletic Association matches.  We read of 70,000 to 80,000 people sometimes being in Croke Park. When a man pays 2/6 or 3/- to get into a match, he is out for the day and he will pay 5/- or 7/6 just as readily. Would it not be better to pay 7/6, or even 10/-, if it went to that, to see a match in Croke Park than to have to pay 10d. extra for 1 lb. of butter and 3d. extra for a loaf?</P>
    <P>Rugby and soccer matches could also be taxed.  Greyhound racing could be taxed more.  Dog licences could be increased and special licences could be given to the owners of greyhounds at £5 a year.  Any labouring man with a prize greyhound at present may get rid of it, because he will have no bread for it; he will not have even a crust. Jewellery and cosmetics could be taxed more.  A driving licence at present costs 10/- a year.  No one would mind if it were increased to £1 so as to leave the bread and butter of the poor alone. Court fines could be increased.  Dances should be taxed more, as well as all kinds of amusements.</P>
    <P>Deputies must be disappointed &mdash; even Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;that during such an important debate as this the Minister for Finance has not made his appearance in the House during the whole day.  It speaks very badly for the Fianna Fáil Party, who say that <Col N="907" /> they are deeply interested in the welfare of the country, that their Minister does not think it worth his while to come into this House during this very important debate.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil told us that one of their chief aims was to reduce the cost of living.  I do not propose to go into that because Deputy Dr. O'Higgins dealt with that very ably.  He is to be congratulated on the very fine constructive speech he delivered, dealing with the cost of living and pointing out the deceit of Fianna Fáil as far as the cost of living is concerned.  It is very gloomy reading for Fianna Fáil supporters. When Fianna Fáil took office the people expected the cost of living to be reduced.  Then they saw in the papers that coal in Dublin had gone up by 10/-.  As reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1st November, 1951, the Tánaiste said: &ldquo;There is little hope of the cost of living coming down in the near future.&rdquo;  That was a great change from what he said in Cork before the election.</P>
    <P>Then we saw published in the papers increases in all sorts of goods, such as peas, cocoa, cheese and paraffin oil. There was to be stronger but dearer beer.  Cement prices went up.  We had such headings in the papers as: Big jump in cheese prices; further increase in coal.  On the 29th August, 1951, we had these: Dublin pays more for gas; higher prices for oatmeal; laundry up in Cork; bacon and pork to be decontrolled.  These things were done by people who slunk into office by giving their word of honour that they would control prices.  Eggs were 5d. and 6d. each in Dublin.  Deputy Dr. Browne gets up in this House and tells us that everybody, especially children, should drink plenty of milk.  The Fianna Fáil price for that is 11d. per quart.  He also said that all the members of a family should have an egg each day or sometimes twice a day.  How can the poorer classes purchase eggs at 6d. each?  Surely the father of eight or nine children could not purchase eight or nine eggs per day at 6d. each.  It is a consolation, however, to know that Deputy Dr. Browne will be sounding the Last Post <Col N="908" /> for these unfortunate people if he votes for a continuance of this.</P>
    <P>On the 7th July, 1951, the Government gave notice of increased charges for electricity.  Even the light is taxed.  They could not tax the air or the wind, but they taxed the light.  As a result of these additional Electricity Supply Board charges the ratepayer will have to pay more in rates.  The farmers of Carlow, West Cork, Roscommon, Kerry and Wicklow are now paying more in rates because of the increased charges for public lighting of the towns and villages.  On the 31st July, 1951, there was very gloomy reading in the <i>Irish Independent:</i> More price increases; milk up, gas up, coke up, oatmeal up.  Even the plate of porridge that Deputy Dr. Browne told us, when he was Minister for Health, was very wholesome and which he recommended should be taken every morning in order that we may be healthy and strong, went up in price.  The Government are now depriving the poor of the plate of porridge for which they were paying enough already.</P>
    <P>On 1st September, the <i>Irish Independent</i> had this in big block letters: &ldquo;Jump in Córas Iompair Éireann bus and train fares.&rdquo;  Up went the bus and train fares.  The worker from Crumlin who takes a bus to and from his work, the worker in Ballyfermot, the worker in Dún Laoghaire who is working in Dublin, the worker from Kilcormac and the worker from Clara working in Tullamore, the worker from Abbeyleix working in Portlaoise had their bus and train fares increased.  All that was done by the people who had given their word that the cost of living would come down.  The price of coffee also was almost doubled.  I was rather impressed when I took up the newspaper one morning and saw that 500 Offaly mill workers were to be put on short time as a result of the policy of Fianna Fáil.  I know that Deputy Cormac Breslin is bewildered listening to this. He is inclined to think that I am bringing before this House everything Fianna Fáil put up, and not saying anything about the things they brought down.  In fairness, we should mention the things they brought down.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 4th October, <Col N="909" /> 1951, had this heading: &ldquo;Prices fall in the Dublin market.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil brought down the price of live stock fairly successfully.  If there is anyone in the House from North Cork who has live stock for the Dublin market he should listen to this.  It is the constituency of the Minister for Education. On the 2nd August, 1951, there was another heading in the <i>Irish Independent:</i>&ldquo;Another slight fall in the Dublin market.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil brought down the price of live stock some more, to make sure there would be a good fall.  It may be asked did they bring down anything else?  They did.  On the 29th August, 1951, we saw in the newspapers that there would be cheaper air travel for the tourists.  The bus fares and the train fares went up &mdash; services that were being used by the ordinary citizen.  However, the aeroplanes to be used by the tourists, the swanks, the Tánaiste and the Minister for External Affairs reduced their fares.</P>
    <P>Down went the fares for the aeroplanes, and up went the fares for the buses and the trains.  We see, therefore, where the sympathies of this set-up lie&mdash;this unfortunate, disastrous combination called the Fianna Fáil Party, this set-up for the fatherless twins, this Cowan-Cogan, ffrench-O'Carroll set-up.  Shortly after the above announcement we saw another heading in the newspaper: &ldquo;Aer Lingus Cuts Excursion Fares.&rdquo;  The excursion fares were low enough as they were, but Aer Lingus cut them down at the request of the Tánaiste, as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Bus fares and train fares went up because they were being used by ordinary John Citizen, such as the labourer and the ordinary worker. Because these sections of the people travel by bus and train, the fares must go up, but Aer Lingus must cut their excursion fares.</P>
    <P>Next we saw that an attempt was made to put up motor car insurance. This increase had already been probed by the Prices Advisory Body, and I understand that a recommendation dealing with the question of motor car insurance is already before the Minister awaiting his signature, and that <Col N="910" /> this insurance will go up if he is long enough in office.</P>
    <P>A very interesting report appeared in the newspapers in which an appeal was made to the farmers to work harder and to produce more.  Yesterday the Minister for External Affairs appealed to the farmers of this country to produce more and to work harder.  However, he did not tell us that, when the inter-Party Government was in office, the cost of superphosphates ranged from £9 10s. to £9 15s. per ton and that the cost of superphosphates this year is £15 10s. per ton.  He did not tell us that, in order to produce more from the soil, manures and fertilisers are necessary, that these were available at cheap and reasonable rates when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and that they are gone up to £15 10s. per ton due to the incompetency of the present set-up.  We are told that the farmers of this country are the only people who can save us and that they must produce more.</P>
    <P>The farmer will produce more because he always did his part.  However, if he does work hard, he expects to be paid.  Surely, it is in order, when an appeal is made to the people to produce more, to recall the &ldquo;party&rdquo;&mdash; I think it can be aptly described as a &ldquo;party&rdquo;&mdash;which was held in the Gresham Hotel a few months ago, to which the chairmen of the county committees of agriculture were invited.  An appeal was made at that &ldquo;party&rdquo; to the farmers to produce more.  The next day the price of barley fell.  Any Deputy or any farmer who is a member of a county committee of agriculture knows the difficulties in producing more unless they get more assistance from the Government.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  While I am dealing with the farmers, I would like to take this opportunity of referring to the speech made by Deputy Dr. Browne on the 23rd April, 1952.  On Resolution No. 11, at present before the House, Deputy Dr. Browne said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Again, I wonder if there is any attempt on the part of the Government to try to find some way of getting more money out of the farmers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is Deputy Dr. Browne's statement; he wants to explore how the farmers can be got to pay more. Deputy Cogan is his colleague on that. He represents the farmers of County Wicklow, God bless the mark!</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne says: &ldquo;Surely there must be some way to get more money out of the farmers?&rdquo; I fail to understand how Deputy Dr. Browne can get away with a statement of that nature.  The very people who claimed they would bring down the cost of living are responsible for putting the country into the position in which it is to-day.  As I see it, every item has been increased in price except one, and that is, the ordinary Fianna Fáil membership card.  It was 1/- in 1932, and it is 1/-to-day. They can have a cheap sale any time they like and they can get rid of all these cards for 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate many Deputies made reference to the question of butter.  The inter-Party Government were very definitely criticised because of the Danish butter.  On every platform, during the last general election, Fianna Fáil spokesmen spoke loud and long about the Danish butter.  They said: &ldquo;You see the fruits of the inter-Party policy.  You have only got Danish <Col N="912" /> butter on the table.&rdquo;  They even painted pictures of the Danish butter keeping time, forming fours and sloping arms on the table and, in fact, even walking off the table.  Some people felt: &ldquo;We had better put this crowd out, because we will be able to get good creamery butter if Fianna Fáil comes back.&rdquo;  What happened? They were no length back when there was £2,000,000 worth of New Zealand butter imported by the very people who were condemning the Danish butter.</P>

      <P>Shortly after the general election the present Government decided to issue its policy to the people.  That may sound quite strange but it is true.  When the election was over the policy appeared, and as has already been stated by other Deputies the 17 points were placed before a number of Independent Deputies here and before the people.  Number 15 was to maintain subsidies.  In plain English that means to keep on existing subsidies.  Nine months afterwards what had happened?  It is hardly necessary for me to deal with the promises that were made and broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are other Deputies who are anxious to speak and I do not propose to detain the House to any great extent.  I want merely to protest <Col N="913" /> vigorously and determinedly against this Budget.  It has been very feebly defended by Fianna Fáil.  The worst speech that ever was delivered in this House was that of the Taoiseach. There has not been one speech made from that side of the House in defence of it.  What defence had Deputy Briscoe?  He said: &ldquo;They are going to have some consolation.  They are going to have several varieties of tea; they will have every variety of tea they like&rdquo;.  That is the only contribution Deputy Briscoe made.  Protests have come from all over the country against this disastrous Budget.  As has been pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition the present Government has no mandate from the people to impose this serious affliction on them.  I take this opportunity, as one Deputy who supports the inter-Party Government, who is proud of the fact and who will do so again, that if the Government have any decency left&mdash;there was seldom any decency attached to them&mdash;or if there is anything left in the name of decency in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will pack up and get out because they know quite well that the moment they do the people are waiting like hungry wolves for them.  They will never see office again.  They are hoping and trusting they may be able to carry on for another twelve months; if they do it will not be too bad because they will be able to take a penny off the pint, a halfpenny off the loaf, a penny off the cigarettes, and the back benchers will be able to come along and say: &ldquo;The old Chief steered the ship well.  We are coming back to the good old days. Things are looking well again.&rdquo;  I say, put them out, get them out, because they have brought disgrace on themselves and upon this country which is keeping them there.  The majority of those in the opposite benches have done well for themselves.  They are all right.  Some of the front benchers are well-to-do.  Some of the back benchers have their old I.R.A. pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that Deputies will come here to-night with a full sense of responsibility and with the intention of putting this Government out before they do any more harm.  I do not think there is very much more harm left for them to do.  They have done as much as they could, but I say this: It seems to me the more you kick an Irishman in the face the oftener he comes back for a further kick.  If the British Government imposed these taxes on us the whole country would be up in arms.  If the inter-Party Government imposed these taxes you would have crowds outside Leinster House pulling down the gates and you would have the ribs torn out of every Deputy that would stand up and defend them.  Because it is &ldquo;Dev's&rdquo; Budget it is all right.  It cannot be wrong.  You can trust &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; and Peadar Cowan, the political twins. You can trust Peadar to do the right thing.  During the elections while the National Anthem was being played at the Taoiseach's meeting in O'Connell Street &ldquo;Peadar on the Treetop&rdquo; was being played at Deputy Cowan's meeting in Fairview.  They are the political twins who are responsible for this unfortunate state of affairs.</P>
      <P>It is a sad state of affairs because every section of the community is disturbed and disgruntled.  You will have strikes and rightly so.  More power to the elbow of the leaders of the trade unions.  They will have my full support to see that the workers get what they are entitled to, and more power to the farmer in his demands for more for wheat, oats, beet and barley in order to meet the cost of living and pay labour.  It has to be done.  As I say, business men are going to have to close down their businesses because they will not be able to meet those demands.  The banks have restricted credit and are restricting it.  Credit cannot be given to the farmer because the interest has gone up to 6 per cent. If there is any hope for this country it lies in the removal from office with the least possible delay of Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach, with all their works and pomps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>At this late stage I shall endeavour not to delay the House very long in order to give other members an opportunity of saying something about this Budget.  It is very difficult to believe that when members on the Government side endeavour to justify this iniquitous Budget, they are sincere in what they say.  It is more difficult still when they congratulate the Minister for Finance for its introduction.  In fact, I think that they should be in a much happier position if instead of patting one another on the back they would give a kick in the pants to one another and two kicks in the pants to the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps that would save them to a certain extent from getting several kicks in the pants when they come before the electors to get their votes.</P>
      <P>If the Government opposite&mdash;which I may call, I suppose, the Coalition Government or a sort of caretaker Government if you like&mdash;when they took office eleven months ago, simply continued the work that the inter-Party Government had been doing, they would scarcely find themselves in the position they are in to-day.</P>
      <P>The inter-Party Government made agricultural and industrial agreements for the welfare of the agricultural industry and of those engaged in industry. They also improved the social services.  They increased the old age pensions, the blind pensions, the widows' and orphans' pensions and certain other allowances to the unemployed. By removing the penal taxes imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in their Supplementary Budget in 1947, they reduced taxation by £6,000,000. During the three and a half years of inter-Party Government not one halfpenny increased taxation was imposed on the Irish people.  Still, everything seemed to prosper.  The people were never more hopeful of good times to come.  Farmers, workers, professional men and women, and so on, were enjoying prosperity in all directions. In fact, there was an entirely new look about the people of the country.  I think these times can always be looked back upon as the three glorious years in the life of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> Instead of continuing the good work of the inter-Party Government, what exactly did the present Fianna Fáil Government do in the past ten or 11 months?  In order to keep afloat the sinking ship of Fianna Fáil, their leaders set out to make scare speeches. They set out to try to make the people believe that the country was financially unsound so that when the disasters which they predicted did not materialise, they could say piously that they had saved the country.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, ably supported by the Minister for Finance, made such gloomy and hysterical speeches that they rocked the nation.  The banks became alarmed.  Trade slumped and unemployment increased.  Even though the country was financially sound when Fianna Fáil took office, they asserted that it was almost on the brink of disaster.</P>
    <P>At the critical moment, and when the people of the country were really extremely worried, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, stretched across the path and stopped the stampede. By his speeches in Dublin, Cork and other places, and by the evidence he produced to support his statements that the country was financially sound. Deputy Costello made the actual position clear to the disheartened people, and they began to take courage.  They examined the position and eventually they were satisfied that things were not as bad as the Fianna Fáil Ministers said they were.  When the crisis had passed and when the Opposition in this House brought in a motion in connection with the Vote on Account, the Tánaiste not only swallowed all that he had said but he rejected the report of the Central Bank while his colleague, the Minister for Finance, maintained that the White Paper issued from his Department was correct. Though confidence was restored in the minds of the people of the country credit was restricted and the people were slow to spend.  While the shops were full of goods, nobody was buying and that situation was bound to create unemployment.</P>
    <P>When taxation is increased, purchasing power is reduced.  No matter what may be said to the contrary, unemployment <Col N="917" /> is bound to follow increased taxation and where there is unemployment there will be emigration.  When the inter-Party Government left office there was almost full employment in this country.  However, once the Fianna Fáil Ministers began to make their scare speeches and to try to stampede the people, there was unemployment and emigration.  I think that it was about that time that the Taoiseach went down to Galway and made a speech there about our exiles in England&mdash;a speech which should never have been made.  He criticised the manner in which our people were living in England.  Though there may be some black sheep among them, it is certain that the vast majority of our Irish exiles are a credit to their country and carry with them their grand Christian way of life.  Instead of causing a lowering of the morals of the country to which they emigrate, our Irish exiles set a good example in the Christian way of life.</P>
    <P>Emigration may not be due entirely to unemployment.  I read at one time that there are two tremendously powerful instincts within the human breast and that they work in opposite directions. One of these instincts is the desire of youth to unfold its wings and to fly away, to find adventure and perhaps to earn a livelihood in other lands.  The other instinct is the unquenchable desire of those same exiles to return again to their old homes, to caress parents, brothers and sisters and to shake again in friendship the hands of their friends of long ago.  I do not think that, at a time when speeches by Fianna Fáil Ministers were creating unemployment, it was right for the Taoiseach to make the type of speech which he made in Galway.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste admitted in this House that Deputy Costello, the former Taoiseach, was correct when he said in Cork that there was no crisis, but a problem.  I remember that the day after that admission by the Tánaiste the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> stated that the Tánaiste's speech in this House was a repetition of the speech which was made by Deputy Costello in Cork.</P>
    <P>Being foiled in their attempt to make <Col N="918" /> the people believe that there was a crisis, I take it that the object of this Budget was to make the Irish people believe that there is a crisis and that the inter-Party Government left the financial affairs of the country in a mess.  Of course, the inter-Party Government left the affairs of this country in a very sound condition but, in order to make the people believe otherwise, this Fianna Fáil Government have imposed extra, unjust and, as has been proved, unnecessary taxation. They will then be able to say, when they are leaving office, that though they found the country in an unsound financial state after the inter-Party Government, they put these affairs right.  People have been asking: &ldquo;What is the matter with the Taoiseach and with the Ministers?  Are they mentally unsound when they produce such a Budget and tax the people to such an extent?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has been proved by Deputy Costello, Deputy McGilligan and others that there is no need for this extra taxation.  Surely if the Government had any mercy at all on the ordinary people of the country they would not impose, or rather reimpose, the taxes on beer, tobacco, and even on petrol. Of course, the Taoiseach holds that he is infallible and that when he first imposed these taxes in 1947 there was a necessity for them and now that he has again assumed office they should again be reimposed.  The Taoiseach has some kind of idea akin to the old theory of the Divine Right of Kings and thinks that he himself can make no mistake.  He wants to prove now that the taxes imposed on stout and tobacco in 1947 were necessary then and are necessary now.  The tax on petrol is bound to increase the cost of transport, such as bus fares.  Even hackney car drivers are bound to increase their fares, and in that way the ordinary people of the country will be affected.  In spite of the fact that no one can understand why these taxes were imposed it was done very efficiently and very expertly by the Government.  They took good care that they did not impose all the taxes on 1st April.  They staggered them, as it were, so that when 1st July comes the people will have forgotten to a <Col N="919" /> certain extent the increased price of drink, tobacco and petrol.  Then, before the introduction of the next Budget, with the big surplus they are bound to have, the Government can, of course, give certain concessions, reduce taxation and go to the country. That must be the idea at the back of the minds of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture state yesterday evening that the Fianna Fáil Deputies for West Galway were sent up by their constituents to do away with the subsidies.  It is very hard to believe that.  Certainly I do not think they consulted their constituents in any way and, if they did, I believe they would not get that mandate. Deputy Killilea stated that the Opposition were trying to stampede the country.  It was his own side, the Government, that tried to stampede the country and that is the cause of all the trouble now.  Certainly, if I were a member of the Government Party at the present time&mdash;if by any kind of corruption I happened to become a member&mdash;and the Government introduced such a Budget, or even if the Party to which I belong were to introduce a Budget imposing such iniquitous taxes on my constituents, I would, no matter what my Party affiliation might be, vote against the imposition of such taxation.</P>

That air of unreality has been continued in the House up to this evening.  It was interesting to hear my colleague, Deputy Cafferky, asking the Government to go to the people on this Budget.

I want to reassure himself and his colleague, Deputy O'Hara, that the Budget will not be defeated, that there will be no election and that they are quite safe for another while at all events.</P>
      <P>This Budget is a realistic Budget in the situation in which we find ourselves. Various expressions have been used in various papers and by various Opposition speakers to describe the Budget.  We have heard the description &ldquo;butchery&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;butchery of the taxpayers&rdquo;.  We have heard of the &ldquo;black budget&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;harsh budget&rdquo;.  It is rather remarkable that none of the expressions used in the Opposition Press and by Opposition speakers in this House is new.  Away back in the early days of the Fianna Fáil Government, the very same expressions were used by Opposition speakers, and particularly by Front Bench speakers, to describe Budgets introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government. For instance, away back in 1933, Deputy O'Higgins used these words: &ldquo;In the face of this black Budget, in face of the Minister's dismal wail in introducing the Budget, is it not time for getting back and reviewing the position?&rdquo; We have had a rehash of these words in one way or another on every Budget introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance since.  Being used to these expressions in connection with Budgets introduced by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance each year, we are inclined to take much less notice of them than we otherwise would.  The same song has been sung, and the same tune has been played by the same people for so many years that we are now quite used to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now come to examine the reasons why a Budget in these terms is necessary in the interests of the nation.  I want to put this question to the House, and to the alleged economists of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  Do they agree with the proposition that if the adverse trade balance is greater than our export trade, and if that position continues, must the country not go burst? Not one speaker we have heard from the Opposition Benches has said anything <Col N="921" /> about that proposition, but it was a proposition put to this House a few years ago by one of the Deputies now sitting in the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  I suggest that never was the country in such a financial position as it is in to-day. Away back in 1935 Deputy Dillon is reported at column 1178 of Volume 56 of the Official Report as stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If this country continues to spend £36,000,000 yearly, while its adverse trade balance is substantially greater than its entire export trade, and while its foreign assets are dwindling, any same man must know that sooner or later we will burst the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that was a sound financial proposition in the year 1935 surely it is doubly sound to-day in view of the figures that we have before us because the deficit in visible trade last year, according to the Budget statement, amounted to £123.1 million with estimated invisible items of £62,000,000, making in all a total of £185.1 million. Does Deputy Dillon's dictum enunciated in May, 1935, still hold good?  Will it be suggested by his colleagues now that what he laid down then in relation to our national economy was so much eyewash?  If the proposition was sound then, surely it is doubly sound to-day.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt our foreign assets are dwindling.  The figures for last year would appear to show that they dwindled by approximately £30,000,000 between 1950 and 1951 mainly because of borrowing.  The result is that we have here an estimated expenditure of £101.7 million this year.  We have the position that our external assets are dwindling.  We have a huge gap in our balance of payments.  Deputy Dillon's dictum was unchallenged in 1935:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If this country continues to spend £36,000,000 yearly, while its adverse trade balance is substantially greater than its entire export trade, and while its foreign assets are dwindling, any same man must know that sooner or later we will burst the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we to allow ourselves to go burst to-day when we find ourselves facing the present situation?  Are we <Col N="922" /> not to take steps to deal with it?  Are such steps not necessary?</P>
    <P>I have not heard one speaker question the position in relation to the balance of payments.  Some of the Opposition speakers suggested that there was overestimation in this Budget to the extent of some millions. Every single argument advanced by all the Opposition speakers has starteo off on the basis that the Budget figures are wrong and that there is overestimation. Some said £10,000,000 overestimation; others gave different figures.  If one starts off on a false premise, it is quite easy to build up a case.  If one starts off on the premise that black is white one can prove anything. Every single argument advanced by the Front Bench Opposition started off on that false premise.  Nobody seems to have asked himself why the officials of the Department of Finance should have faked these figures?  Why should any Government or any Minister deliberately overestimate the requirements of the country?</P>
    <P>There might have been a very good reason if the argument was put the other way round and we accused the inter-Party Government of underestimating. There might have been a very good reason, for instance, for the Minister's predecessor to underestimate. There might have been a very good reason for faking figures in a Budget when the necessary provision was not being made for current expenses. There might have been very good reason, particularly when there was an election in the offing, for underestimating, because then the Government could go to the people and say: &ldquo;The Budget is not too bad, after all.  If we get back we can do what we like.  We can introduce a Supplementary Budget.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What licences have to do with the financial burden imposed under this Budget is beyond me.  It may be plain sailing to Deputy O'Leary. This sum of money is required and the question is: how will it be found? Not one responsible Deputy on the Opposition Benches has yet ventured <Col N="923" /> to show us where that money can be found if we remit the taxes it is intended to impose under this Budget. It is true that the position might not be so bad to-day had our predecessors faced up to their responsibilities.  In 1947 it became necessary, in the interest of the nation, to impose extra taxation on beer and tobacco.  We knew then that that was necessary. Had we continued in office it is quite possible we would not to-day find ourselves in the financial mess in which we are.</P>
      <P>There were people who preached in those days that the pint was sacrosanct and that it should not be touched.  They declared then an extra 1d. or 2d. on the pint was a shocking imposition on the people irrespective of the state of our national economy. They took that view then, and when the inter-Party Government came into office the first thing they did was to remove the essential taxation we had imposed in the interests of the community. If that taxation had continued and if our appeal had been listened to during those years we would not now be in the position of having to face this ghastly conglomeration of debt and taxation.</P>
      <P>Now we must take the country in the position in which we find it.  We must pay our way.  Otherwise we will go burst.  This Government has no intention of shirking its responsibilities. This Government has no intention of borrowing the country into perdition. This Government is prepared to face the situation, bad as the situation is. In facing that situation it is compelled to impose extra taxation in order to lift the country out of the financial morass in which we found it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have been made by Deputies on the Opposition side of the House in relation to attacks by us on the policy of the United States of America.  I did not hear anybody on these benches make any attack.  All I did hear was some Deputies on this side pointing out the dangerous position in which the nation will find itself if it continues borrowing.  It will find itself in the position in which any borrower finds himself when he continues <Col N="924" /> that policy.  We all know that the position may be all right so long as the lender does not get into difficulties. We all know what happens to a borrower when he is not able to pay what he has borrowed but his situation becomes intolerable when the lender finds himself pressed and is compelled, whether he likes it or not, to bring pressure to bear on the borrower.  We all know the position of the poor man in the country who finds himself up to his neck in debt in the books of the local shopkeeper.  We have had examples of that for a very long time here.  Every rural Deputy knows what happens.  It happened to a large extent in the bad old days.  Rural merchants, particularly the gombeen type, had people up to their necks in debt in their books and at election times they dictated to the people as to how they should vote and the people were told that if they did not vote in a certain way dire results would follow.  We know those people were not free agents.</P>
    <P>All that has been said on this side of the House in that connection is that we do not want to find ourselves in the position of the mortgagor.  We do not want to find ourselves in the position of the borrower.</P>
    <P>We do not want anybody, no matter who he may be, to tell us how to vote in a certain situation or what to do in a certain situation.  We all realise that we have been told here time after time, what the effect is on an individual of finding himself in the hands of moneylenders.  We all know that it has often been said in this House that, unless we had economic freedom in this country, our other freedom would to a large extent be negatived.  If that is true, should we not, as a nation, think twice before getting into a morass of debt, as has been suggested on some sides of this House?  If it is true that a nation, in order to be independent, must be economically free, then the first thing any nation should do is to be very careful before committing itself in the toils of borrowing.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested as a long-term policy or otherwise that it is sound economically for this or any other nation to keep borrowing year after year, and not to face up to having a balanced Budget annually, or not to face up to <Col N="925" /> the economic position in which we now find ourselves?  I cannot visualise any sane man suggesting that that would be a good policy in present circumstances. We know that sufficient borrowing has been done.  We know, contrary to what the nation was told by the then Government, the disastrous effects which some of that borrowing will have.  We know the amount of money that we will now have to raise in order to repay that borrowing.</P>

      <P>That may not be very palatable information for Deputy Rooney.  He and his pals, when they were members of the Government, raised that money.</P>
      <P>When the £ was devalued, they told the people that devaluation would make no difference.  We had Deputy Dillon, when he was Minister for Agriculture, proclaiming that it would not affect the price of foodstuffs and that the price of maize would not go beyond £1 per cwt.  We had Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance, assuring the people in a broadcast over Radio Éireann that the devaluation of sterling meant nothing, and would have no effect on this nation.  But we now find, particularly when we read the lines of the agreement which the boys signed with the American Government, that the Marshall Aid borrowing will have to be repaid in the lawful coin of the United States, in dollars, and that we will have to buy these dollars with sterling to pay back the money borrowed by the gentlemen over there.</P>

      <P>I suggest that is not a point of order.  Deputy Mulcahy comes in belatedly at this hour of the night, having been missing when Deputy Oliver Flanagan and other speakers were wasting time during the last three or four hours.  If Deputy Mulcahy was not prepared to come in and listen to Deputy Oliver Flanagan, I am not going to blame him for that, but at least he should have got someone to tell him what was happening in the House.  I was saying when interrupted &mdash;evidently Deputy Mulcahy did not like to hear it&mdash;that the gentlemen opposite had assured the people of this nation that the devaluation of the £ would not have any effect on sterling. We now find that we will require £45,000,000 to buy dollars to enable us to pay back the debts which those people incurred.  We have got to pay those debts because the money was borrowed in the name of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the invitations which have been addressed to some of the responsible Deputies in the Fine Gael Party to say where they would find the money to meet this bill which the Government and the taxpayers have got to meet, there has not been one word or suggestion from Deputy Costello, Deputy Mulcahy or any of the leaders of the Opposition as to what they would do if they were faced with this position or as to how this money can be found.  There has been a very strange quietness on the part of the Opposition to give a statement on this matter in answer to the questions which have been addressed to them by some of the Independent Deputies.  Why are Deputy Costello and Deputy Mulcahy so backward in coming forward on this issue?  Why have they kept so silent on whether they would, or would not, abolish the food subsidies if this House were dissolved to-night and they came back as the Government?  Why have they been so slow to give a lead to Deputy McQuillan and other Deputies, and to answer these six-mark questions?  Is it because they know quite well that <Col N="927" /> this position has to be faced, that it is of their creation and that somebody must now pay the piper for the debts created by the Coalition Government? Is it not because they cannot make up their minds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall address myself to the motion so long as I am allowed to do so.  There seems to be a deliberate attempt being made in this House to stop me speaking, and I have no intention of succumbing to these tactics.  I suggest, Sir, that if the Fine Gael Minister in the inter-Party Government had a free hand, if he were allowed to do what he thought fit the possibility is that we would not have to face this particular bill here and now.  But he found&mdash;as all the Fine Gael Party found after the last election&mdash;that he was not a free agent. They found they were in the hands of vested interests and dare not go ahead with the taxation they knew to be necessary.  They found they were tied &mdash;as that Party has been over a great number of years&mdash;to the strings of the licensed trade.  They found that they dare not, irrespective of whether they thought it was necessary in the interests of the nation or of good finance, tax, beer and tobacco.  They found that they would not be allowed to do it, even if they thought it was necessary. Being in that situation, they had to try to tide themselves over the period they were in office and they had to try to do that through the types of Budget they introduced.  They tried to avail of all the borrowing they could avail of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bill has been left to us and the Government has got to face up to it. It is difficult for us to have to impose this taxation.  We do not like doing it but we know that the only right policy is to take the people into our confidence and to point out to them that this bill is there.  We must meet it and the only honest way to do that is to face up to our responsibilities. As the people have found us to be honest with them in our dealings with them before, I have no doubt the public will realise the situation that has been left to us by our predecessors.  I have no doubt that nationalist Ireland will <Col N="930" /> stand behind us in connection with these matters.  The people know that we have to clear up these legacies left to us by the Opposition.  We propose to clean them up so that we will get the country back on that solid keel it was on before the gentlemen of the Opposition got into power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise how difficult it will be for some of us to speak in the time allotted.  The Minister for Finance is supposed to come in at 8 o'clock.  I say that the Leaders of the Opposition Parties should not have given the Minister that concession as he did not deserve it.  We are handicapped now.  There are many items of interest upon which we would like to speak, but since I want to give every man a chance.  I will be as brief as possible on the subject of this very important Budget.  There was much discussion about this Budget and we got many lectures from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Briscoe and others.  They have condemned the inter-Party Government for the policy they operated for three and a half years and have pointed out the terrible fallacy of their policy. They tell us that there is danger of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder did the Chancellor of the British Exchequer tell our Minister for Finance, when they had their little secret pow-wow, that in the financial year 1938-39, before the disaster of the Second World War came upon us, the national debt in Great Britain was £8,136,000,000?  Did he tell our own dearly beloved little Minister for Finance that the increase in the British national debt in that year alone amounted to £137,000,000 and that a Bill was brought before the House of Commons asking that, under the Defence Loans Act, the amount for borrowing purposes be increased from £400,000,000 to £800,000,000?  Did he tell him that in 1939 £250,000 per day was spent on the provision of aircraft? If he did, did he tell Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, that almost all that was got through borrowing?  We are condemned for borrowing.  Great Britain borrowed to win a war.  She found it in her own interests and in the interests of the people of Great Britain to borrow huge <Col N="931" /> amounts during that period for defence purposes and otherwise.  Yet we are condemned by a Fianna Fáil Administration who tell us they are ultra-republican in outlook.  We are condemned when we say we are willing to borrow for the purpose of building houses for our people.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Finance stated that unless he could borrow upwards of £28,000,000 from our people housing was going to be retarded and that hospitalization was going to be retarded.  No member of Fianna Fáil can contradict that.  Speakers in the Opposition have said&mdash;I believe they were justified in saying it&mdash;that the policy of the Government is one of full agreement with the British policy of finance as against a policy of financial friendship with the United States of America.  It is no use for them to deny it.  Some of their back-benchers admitted during the course of this debate that there may be a danger in getting money from America; we may be sold out economically.  If any man in this country is selling our full indepdence from an economic and financial point of view, it is the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>If they object to borrowing, if they object to a system of capital budgeting, it means, as we have proof already, an increase in unemployment. This time last year, the number on the unemployed list went down.  This year, unfortunately, each week the number has increased.  That is not a matter that I want to gloat over.  It is something that I am sincerely sorry about. What will we do to remedy that position? Do we believe in capital investment or are we satisfied to continue a policy which will allow the financiers to gloat over the quotations of stock market prices in London and New York in the morning papers?  Are we satisfied that Irish money is to be invested in foreign places?  Are we satisfied to allow the financial system which has dominated our economic life for years to operate?  Are we satisfied with a system whereby local authorities will have to pay more in bank interest?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> I have mentioned but a few points. I will curtail my speech to allow other Deputies to speak.  There is an extraordinary degree of similarity between the policy as advocated by the Minister and the Government and the words of a famous statesman.  I leave the House to judge.  At a period when the British Government were talking about raising huge loans for defence, a famous person said, on 21st February, 1939:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is no time for financial pedantry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went further and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This massive loan bill had added to confidence at home and was a factor on the side of stability abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying that the Prime Minister had only to ask for whatever was necessary.  That famous individual&mdash;famous, at least, from the viewpoint of the British people&mdash;Churchill &mdash;said that the Prime Minister had only to ask for whatever was necessary.</P>
    <P>At that stage the British financial policy was based on borrowing, to finance a war.  Now, because the Chancellor of the British Exchequer has told our Minister for Finance that we should not borrow, that we should adopt a policy which will bring us into a period of deflation, our Minister and our Government have accepted that policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned one particular matter.  He was entitled to do so.  He was sitting beside the Minister for Finance and the Minister gloated over the words of Deputy Corry. Deputy Corry drew attention to the letters which were sent to local authorities dealing with increases for staffs.  Deputy Corry said that that meant robbing this country, as it were, by giving increased allowances.  I would like to have it recorded in this House now that neither Deputy Corry nor any member of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Cork County Council objected to the request for increases in salaries at that time.  I give them credit for supporting the increases. We believed that these staffs were entitled to an increase.  But, considerual&mdash;famous <Col N="933" /> ing that neither Deputy Corry nor any of his Party opposed those increases, is it not right to draw attention to the hypocrisy of condemning something now with which, 12 months ago, Deputy Corry agreed completely?</P>
    <P>It is said that we are living beyond our means.  It is said that the removal of the subsidies means an increase of only 1/6 in the cost of living.  I wonder does the Minister for Finance still maintain that it means an increase of only 1/6.  I am sorry that he is not here.  If he does so maintain, then another prominent member of the present Government must be wrong, because the Minister for Agriculture has admitted that, on a request from the Agricultural Wages Board, he is giving the farmer an allowance of 4d. a day, which means 2/4 a week in the case of an indoor man, out of the recent increase for farm workers.  If the cost of living has increased by 2/4 a week to the farmer, the producer, then the Minister for Finance knows that his 1/6 is not correct, or, if he believes it is correct, he had better consult the Minister for Agriculture and find out which of them is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I could expect nothing better from the Minister for Finance.  There are decent men in his Party but, when a Party is controlled by a junta and when you have a Minister for Finance who had the audacity to offer 2d. a day to the honest road workers of County Cork, it is only natural to believe that he has no respect or regard for the workers.  Perhaps he is more in line with the gentry, with the people who may be living beyond their means and who found pleasure in being at Punchestown for the last couple of days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget on which the debate is now concluding has been criticised mainly on two grounds.  The first is that it is unduly severe, and the second, that it is lacking in imagination. Let me deal with the second of these first.  In an attempt to distinguish between the real and the imaginative, a philosopher has said: &ldquo;Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense; if absent, is imagination.&rdquo;  Am I, in framing the Budget for the nation, to exercise my imagination and to deceive myself and the country with the idle fancy that our liquidated assets, the assets which the Coalition squandered, are still in our possession? That is an exercise to which the imaginative ex-Minister for Agriculture has devoted himself in recent days.  Am I to visualise as real things the plant and capital equipment upon <Col N="935" /> which the Coalition pretend they spent the £46,000,000 of Marshall Aid?</P>
      <P>A poem or a play requires imagination in an exceptional degree, but a Budget, let me remind the gentlemen opposite, is neither of these.  It is a business document which embodies proposals relating solely to an important business, the business of calculating what the State is likely to have to spend and of devising ways and means for meeting that expenditure.  That is a job not for the over-imaginative person, because, as we have been told by the poet:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The lunatic, the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we think of the three years of Coalition Government, we may well suppose that a triumvirate of that kind had the destinies of this country in its hands over that period.</P>
      <P>The framing of a Budget is a job which requires, in the first place, that whoever should attempt it will have a firm grip on essentials, will have a realistic appreciation of what his proposals involve, what their effects are likely to be on trade and employment and last, but naturally with politicians by no means least, the reaction of the ordinary man in the street to them. The framing of a Budget therefore, is not a job for a visionary, nor for a man supercharged with imagination, nor for one who thinks that he can, by some monetary miracle, transform this harsh old world into an earthly paradise. It is a job primarily for a competent man of business, endowed by Providence with some commonsense and fortfited by comprehensive experience and close study of public affairs. I do not claim to meet my own specifications fully under any one of these heads.  All I can claim is that I approach the difficult task which I have inherited with a full appreciation of its difficulties and its dangers, but with a determination, shared fully by my colleagues, to discharge it honestly. As a Government, we shall fulfil the duty which rests on men and Governments alike to meet all our obligations and to pay our way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Now, as to the alleged harshness of the Budget, we in this Government and those who support us on these benches are no mere neophytes in politics.  We know how unpopular the measures which we propose may be; but we also know how essential they are, if the independence, the political and economical independence of this State and the peace and wellbeing of its people, are to be assured.  When we talk of people, we mean the decent, hard-working, selfrespecting men and women of Ireland, the people whose devoted loyalty and support, in good days and in bad, made this part of Ireland free.  They won that freedom; it is necessary for us to take the unpalatable but the wholly necessary steps which will enable them, under Heaven, to keep it.</P>
    <P>This Budget, we are told, is unduly burdensome.  Will those who say that answer me one question?  Will they tell me why I, who depend and always have depended for my seat in this Dáil mainly on the wage earners and white collars of my constituency, on the people with the smaller incomes in it, should impose unnecessary burdens upon them?  They have been my friends, my supporters, for almost 30 years?  Why should I be so foolish, so wrongheaded, as to tax them more heavily than the dire need of the time requires?  Sooner or later, within four short years or so at the most, I shall have to go before them again and ask them to re-elect me, to judge me on what I have done.  I know the Budget is not popular&mdash;no taxation ever is.  I know that my intimate association with it will constitute a very heavy handicap for me personally.  I accept that handicap because my duty to the people and the nation requires it but why should I increase it, why should I commit political suicide by taxing the people unnecessarily?  Not even the imaginative Deputies opposite can think of an answer to that question; not even they, with all their powers of invention, can fabricate a plausible one.  They know well, as every man and woman in the country knows, that it would be absurd for me to do as they are alleging, that it would be the peak and zenith of political folly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Their allegation, therefore, that we are taxing the people unduly sounds so hollow even in their own ears that they set themselves to concoct a series of faked figures to support it.  I use the word &ldquo;faked&rdquo; advisedly, because Deputy McGilligan himself told us why the figures were faked and how the whole plan of the Fine Gael attack upon this Budget was concocted. Speaking on Tuesday evening in this debate, my immediate predecessor as Minister for Finance gave the game away on his own Leader and his own Party, when he disclosed that Deputy J.A. Costello's figures were worked out&mdash;and these are his own words&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;not by people who thought they had discovered an overestimate here and there, but by people who considered the reasoning that was in the back of the Budget, that the scheme was to balance for a surplus and then this surplus had to be hidden and shown as a deficit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interrupted Deputy McGilligan at this point to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is not very fair to Deputy Costello.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then came back the surprising rejoinder from Deputy McGilligan:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It explains how he arrived at those figures, and it is an explanation that he will accept from me, because I know it to be the correct explanation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy McGilligan should have spilled out the whole bag of beans on his colleague in this way&mdash; and in any event, the Deputy's motive is not of much importance.  What is important, however, is Deputy McGilligan's disclosure that the figures, which Deputy Costello, with such an air of authority, has put before the Dáil and the people, were deliberately faked in order to support a thesis, the thesis that we are budgeting for a surplus.  There is no truth in that suggestion. We are not budgeting for a surplus.  Neither, however, are we budgeting for a deficit.  We are budgeting for a balance.</P>

      <P>I was saying, Sir, that we have been condemned, that there would seem to be something wrong about this idea of a surplus. But the Fine Gael Opposition, in the course of this debate have been loud in their praise of a Chancellor who is budgeting for a surplus and of his predecessors who budgeted for surpluses. They have been loud in laudations of Mr. Butler, because Mr. Butler did certain things.  Why was he able to do them?  Because Mr. Butler's predecessor in the Socialist Government had budgeted for a surplus and had left him a surplus of no less than £500,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in that position.  I am not following in the footsteps of Mr. Gaitskell.  I have told the Dáil that I am aiming at the lowest possible target, the target <Col N="939" /> which will just enable us to make ends meet.  The Fine Gael Opposition, while they have praised British Chancellors, present and past, for budgeting for a surplus on current revenue, think that our people would regard a surplus as in some way reprehensible and so they have been making the allegation that we are budgeting for a surplus and then set themselves to concoct the evidence to support it.</P>
      <P>That is the first thing that Deputy McGilligan wishes us to understand; that is the first disclosure that Deputy McGilligan has made in the course of his speech on this Budget.  The next thing is&mdash;and it is perhaps no less important than the first&mdash;is the fact that he disclaims any responsibility, this ex-Minister for Finance disclaims any responsibility, for the figures which Deputy J.A. Costello has produced.</P>
      <P>Now, with this knowledge at our disposal, let us consider the case made by the Leader of the Opposition. Never was an elementary knowledge of simple arithmetic put to such poor use as it has been put by the Leader of the Opposition and those like him who have been fumbling with figures and stumbling over statistics in the course of this debate.  The performance of the Fine Gael Deputies in this discussion has been so absurd that it has provoked even some of their usual allies and normal supporters to confute them.  The Leader of the Opposition made the case that the Estimates on which the Budget is framed are gravely in error.  He spent hours of parliamentary time in a fantastic endeavour to prove that.  He has been followed on the same lines by all the Fine Gael speakers, except the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan.  Even that eminent backwoodsman of the Party, Deputy McMenamin, has been moved to break his long years of silence and to write a letter to the papers repeating what his Leader has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, was not the line taken by Deputy Larkin.  He did not challenge the Estimates, though he is much more competent, as most people <Col N="940" /> will admit, to deal with these matters than Deputy Costello has shown himself to be.  Implicit throughout, Deputy Larkin's speech was the acceptance of the cold fact that additional taxation and heavy additional taxation is necessary if the Budget is to be balanced.  He admitted frankly and unreservedly that &ldquo;quite clearly, if we are going to have certain standards of social services, the money must be found to pay for them.&rdquo;  That is precisely the principle on which this Budget is based.  It is not because of the fact that the Budget involves increased taxation that Deputy Larkin criticises it but only that it does not provide for the sort of taxation that appeals to him.  But then Deputy Larkin's concept of taxation is very much like expropriation.  He thinks that the primary use of the taxing power should be to penalise the better-off, to punish people for earning too much; and the alternative forms of taxation which he suggested in his speech are all designed to that end. However, whatever be the kind of taxes Deputy Larkin would impose, he did not follow Deputy Costello in the line which the latter took, for he recognised that it is necessary to raise a great deal of additional revenue. The acceptance of this fact is implicit also in the document which was issued by the Irish Trade Union Congress last week.</P>
    <P>When the Leader of the Opposition opened his attack on the Budget proposals he alleged that they were based on misleading estimates of expenditure and of revenue.  He made specific charges in this regard and purported to substantiate each and every one of them by open calculations.  Deputy McGilligan has told us how these calculations were made and what reliance is to be placed on them.</P>
    <P>They have been shown to have been specious and misleading but it has remained for the Irish Trade Union Congress to pass final and crushing judgment upon them.  In the document to which I have referred and, beyond any doubt with the allegations of Deputy Costello in mind, the Irish Trade Union Congress says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" />&ldquo;Firstly, it is necessary to discover whether or not the figure of £15,000,000 constitutes the gap in the current Budget.  We do not doubt for a moment, despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various Estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not doubt&rdquo; retorts the Irish Trades Union Congress to Deputy Costello, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Mulcahy and the lesser fry in Fine Gael.  &ldquo;We do not doubt for a moment... that the various Estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is, in itself, a sufficient and convincing rebuttal of Deputy Costello's charges and I should leave the matter at that but for the fact that I think the public interest will be served if some further consideration be given to such of the Deputy's assertions as have not yet been fully exposed to the House.  I do not propose to go over in great detail the ground which has already been covered.  I do not intend to embarrass the Leader of the Opposition by demonstrating again how wrong was the method of calculation by which he endeavoured to support his charge that the savings on food subsidies had been underestimated.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health have refuted that allegation.</P>

      <P>I must, however, refer to Deputy Costello's endeavours to mislead the public in regard to the provision which is made in the Budget to cover the estimated cost in this year of the Social Welfare Bill.  In that connection it is relevant to recall that it was just about this time last year that, according to column 748, Volume 125 of the Official Report, Deputy J. A. Costello, then Taoiseach, confessed to Dáil Éireann that he had informed representatives of the medical profession <Col N="942" /> that &ldquo;it was obligatory as a matter of law... to have a free service for mothers and children under Part III of the Health Act&rdquo;, while he himself, after a study of the Act, had come-and here I quote again the Deputy's own words&mdash;&ldquo;to the conclusion that there was no binding obligation on this Government or any other Government to have a free scheme or this free for all and no means test&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With that fact&mdash;I do not want to reopen the controversy&mdash;with that admission from Deputy Costello firmly fixed in our minds, let us consider his performance in this debate.  If we turn to columns 1273 and 1274, Volume 130 of the current Official Debates, we shall see for ourselves how clearly the Deputy's speech paralleled his disingenuous statements to the doctors. In column 1273 the Leader of the Opposition is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I pass to the third item, which amounts to a sum of £1,000,000. Again I point out that in the &lsquo;Table Explanatory of the Budget, 1952&rsquo;, item 4, the provision for proposals in the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, is stated to be a sum of £3,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement in itself is a falsification of the actual printed text of the Table Explanatory of the Budget which the Leader of the Opposition had before him when he was making his speech.  In relation to item 4 of that Table the actual text reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Add:</P>
      <P>Provision for proposals in Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, and for other current services... £3,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And for other current services.&rdquo; These are the significant words which, as the Taoiseach pointed out in his masterly speech last week, Deputy J.A. Costello carefully omitted to utter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;though they were before him plain for his eyes to see and for his tongue to speak if he <Col N="943" /> wished to be honest and truthful with the House and with the country.  These are the words which he dropped from their context in order to bolster up his allegation that I have overstated by £1,000,000 the amount actually required for social services.</P>
      <P>Yet Deputy J.A. Costello has the hardihood to suggest that the figures in the Budget have been falsified.</P>
      <P>Let me consider this item 4 further and explain the basis of it to the Dáil. It is intended, as I have said, to provide for the cost in this year of the new social welfare benefits when they become effective and for other contingencies on current services which will undoubtedly arise.  With regard to the new social welfare benefits, these, as the Minister for Health has stated, will cost something under £2,000,000.  Let us take the cost at about £1,900,000. That will leave £1,100,000 or perhaps something more to cover other expenditure.</P>

The Deputy's £1,500,000 proved to be much too little, however, for the actual current expenditure unprovided for in the Budget came to over four times that figure at £6.8 million which is more than six times what I have allowed for in this year's Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what was provided for.  In the previous year the provision which my predecessor made under the heading &ldquo;Increases in Supply Services&rdquo; was only £600,000 but the actual excess of expenditure over the original Estimate was £1.44 million which is again more than I have allowed for this year.</P>
      <P>In his Budget for 1949-50, Deputy McGilligan, with a pretence at nice and precise calculation, allowed £676,000&mdash;it was not £675,000 nor £677,000&mdash;to cover unforeseen increases in Supply expenditure; but the total amount required to meet these increases was, in fact, almost six times as much at £3.8 million.  Now the Deputy will see where the six came in instead of the four.</P>
      <P>If we take the last three Budgets of our predecessors on the average, the amount overspent annually on current services was £4,000,000.  Thus if past experience is to be a ground for criticism of the provision made for supply service contingencies and unforeseen, unavoidable expenditure, the criticism should be, not that I have budgeted for £1,000,000 too much but that I have budgeted for £3,000,000 too little.  If the Leader of the Opposition has considered the matter at all, he must know that it is there the danger lies and not where he suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criticism made by the Deputy is that I have failed to take any account of what he describes as &ldquo;the traditional item known as overestimation. In column 1275 of Volume 130 of the Official Report, we may read his statement, that this item &ldquo;has been taken into account by every Minister for Finance in connection with his Budget proposals.  Experience has demonstrated over the years that there has never been less <Col N="945" /> than a saving of £2,000,000 each year on departmental expenditure.&rdquo;  Both these statements are demonstrably untrue, and I propose to show that. Let us take the first&mdash;the Deputy's statement that every year since the establishment of the State provision has been made for overestimation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;provision has been made&rdquo;.  You are misquoting me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Has been taken into account by every Minister for Finance in connection with his Budget proposals. I have here the Tables issued with the last three Coalition Budgets, those for 1949-50, for 1950-51 and for 1951-52.  In not one of them&mdash;and surely Deputy Costello must have been familiar with them&mdash;must have refreshed his memory by studying them before he made his speech&mdash;is there any reference made to possible overestimation or any allowance made for it.  On the contrary, so far from allowances being made for overestimation, in all these Coalition Budgets allowances were made for underestimation. Not only that, but even the allowances made for this contingency in them from year to year was much too small for that purpose.  In the three Budgets to which I have referred, the allowance to cover underestimation&mdash;not overestimation as Deputy Costello has stated&mdash;averaged £925,000 per year, whereas the overspending on the Supply Services over the same period averaged £4,000,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition when he was making this speech was very emphatic in the manner in which he levelled these accusations at me.  He thumped his desk.  He may thump his desk again in his mock forensic fury and may declare &ldquo;that there has never been less than a saving of £2,000,000 each year on departmental expenditure,&rdquo; but the truth, and that is what we are out to get in this discussion, is, in fact, the other way round.  The Leader of the Opposition in that one statement has been guilty of a statistical inexactitude to the extent of £6,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>The next charge made by Deputy J.A. Costello is that the probable charge for the service of the Public Debt has been overestimated by £500,000.  It is typical of the woolly outlook of the Opposition on these matters that its Leader makes no attempt whatever to back up his allegations with the relevant figures. He makes a reference in col. 1276 to the first interest payment due on the Marshall Aid loan but he slurs over the fact that in my Budget statement on the day before he spoke I had stated that, even after making provision for the ordinary public services I had still to find a further £35,000,000 to finance prospective capital expenditure. Details of the purposes for which this sum is required were given fully by me and may be found in cols. 1150 and 1151 of the current Parliamentary Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They were also set out in full in the typescript copy of the Budget speech which Deputy Costello had in his possession.  One might think that the Deputy did not grasp the significance of the figures, but that might be a charitable view. On the other hand, I think we all agree that it would be to rate the intelligence of the Leader of the Opposition much too low.  He understood and appreciated their significance fully; but he wanted to mislead the public on this matter and so we find him, according to col. 1276, telling the people:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No explanation has been given of that increased figure for interest on the public debt.  We have had no loan.  There is only hope of a loan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But there is going to be a loan, if the Opposition will permit it.  I pass over the importance which a psycho-analyst might attach to Deputy Costello's use of the word &ldquo;hope,&rdquo; in this context. The word &ldquo;hope,&rdquo; as he uses it, suggests the over-optimistic and always importunate borrower, and the basis of Deputy Costello's Coalition was improvident and lavish borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> That is not how I approach the question.  For Deputy Costello's word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; I substitute the word &ldquo;need&rdquo;. I say we need this loan in order to ensure that the programme of electrical development will not be interrupted, that the credit of the country will not be damaged by the Electricity Supply Board having to seek relief from its commitments to its suppliers. I say that we need it in order to ensure Bord na Móna against the same contingency and to enable that organisation to go ahead with its programme of turf development.  I say that we need this loan in order to ensure that our housing activities will not be impeded.</P>
    <P>I would rather that our need for it was not so great, that we were in a position to provide to a larger extent out of current revenue for the more speculative and less reproductive and remunerative, in a financial sense, elements in all these projects.  That was our policy when we were previously in office.  It was a policy which enabled us to leave behind to our successors a fair inheritance in a State free from external debt, in pawn to no man, and with its public credit standing the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>We should build the future of this country on a much solider and surer basis if it were possible to revert to that policy now.  But in present circumstances it is not possible to do so. The public finances have been reduced to such a state of confusion by the maladministration of our predecessors that the utmost we can do now is to make the barest provision possible to meet current and recurring expenditure out of revenue and to borrow for the rest, to borrow for the rest to the full extent of the public's capacity to lend.</P>
    <P>The need for a new loan, therefore, is not, as Deputy Costello thinks of it, &ldquo;only a hope&rdquo;; it is a certainty, an inevitable, unavoidable, undesirable certainty.  And because we know it is a certainty, we have made provision to meet our obligations in regard to it.  That, of course, is the honest and prudent thing to do, but apparently <Col N="948" /> the Leader of the Opposition takes the view that we should not have done it.</P>

      <P>But the new loan is not the only item in respect of which we shall have obligations.  Last year, as I pointed out in the Budget statement&mdash;the reference will be found in column 1131&mdash;the State had to borrow over £35,000,000&mdash;exclusive of the Budget deficit of £6.8 million.  Of this sum, £9.7 million was for what Deputy Costello and his Coalition colleagues described as voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo;&mdash;including Deputy Dillon's day-old chicks&mdash;those extraordinary birds for which the country will be paying on an annuity basis for the next 30 years. Let me say a word about these chicks because it throws a search-light upon the loose idea that pervaded the position in regard to what was capital expenditure.  These day-old chicks cost, I am told, about 30/- per dozen, yet the finances of the Coalition had become so over-strained that Deputy McGilligan could not pay that for them on the nail but had to borrow the cash and repay his borrowing, by an annuity spread over 30 years, and the country will continue to repay his borrowing for those day-old chicks for that period.</P>

Now this £41,000,000 odd was not, of course, all borrowed at once.  It was raised in instalments from time to time as payments fell due and had to be met.  By the end of June, that is, after the Coalition were elected, we had to borrow £6,000,000; at the end of July a further £5.56 million, and so on each month until the end of the financial year when, as I have said, the total net borrowings exceeded £41,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And every penny was raised to meet commitments which had been entered into before we took office.  But, of course, in no case did interest on these separate borrowings run for a full year.  The amount of interest chargeable last year in respect of Ways and Means advances depended not only on the amount of each advance but on the date upon which the money was obtained.  In the case of the Ways and Means advances, taken in at the end of June, 1951, interest for six months was chargeable in the financial year 1951-52; in the case of money borrowed in the last quarter of the financial year nothing fell to be paid in that year.  But in the year which is now running £30.1 million of that £41,000,000 will carry a full year's interest and the balance from nine to 11 months' interest.  Are we to believe that the Leader of the Opposition, when planning his attack on the Budget, never thought of that? It is scarcely credible that he did not; but if he did not, what status has he as a critic at all?</P>
      <P>It would take much too long to enumerate and deal with all the other factors which Deputy Costello ignored when he made the allegation that we have overestimated the amount required for the service of the Public Debt.  Before I pass on, however, I will just mention one of them.  Our predecessors, in 1950, initiated the procedure under which the expenditure on that part of the supply services which they classified as capital should be spread over 30 years on an annuity basis.  I do not wish to deliver a long disquisition on the merits or demerits of that procedure; but I should point out that under it, where there was, say, an original expenditure of £20,000,000, the people will by taxation have to provide a total of £32,000,000 in respect of it.  That is, at present interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, since the difficulty of making full provision for those services which must be met out of current revenue is so great, and since the Government is anxious furthermore <Col N="951" /> that the facts of the position should not be obscured by avoidable controversy as to the wisdom or propriety of the procedure initiated by our predecessors, we have decided this year to borrow for the same items in the supply services as they did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary, accordingly, to set up a corresponding annuity of £501,922, and this amount is, of course, included in the increased provision which we have to make in the current Budget for the service of public debt.  I come now to the last ground on which the Leader of the Opposition attacks the Budget.  His criticism is reported in column 1276, again of the current volume, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has made no provision&mdash;or if he has made any he has made inadequate provision for the buoyancy of the revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I pass over the absurd conception, inherent in Deputy Costello's statement, of the revenue as something which with every year becomes more buoyant than in the year preceding, in order to deal factually with this manifest misstatement.  The actual revenue collected in the financial year which closed last month was £83.9 million, which was £2,335,000 more than my predecessor had budgeted for.  The taxes actually collected, however, included the accumulated arrears of taxes which ought to have been collected before the 31st March, 1951, but which due to the bank strike were not collected and paid into the Exchequer until after that date.</P>
      <P>That is a non-recurring source of revenue.  We cannot budget for another windfall like that this year, but nevertheless we are budgeting for a substantial increase and are taking the probable revenue for this year as £86.6 million.  A simple subtraction, therefore, will show that in framing the Budget we have assumed that we will secure £2,700,000 more revenue than last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we were anxious to take the best view we honestly could take of the position. Perhaps the ebullient Deputy would allow me to proceed?</P>
      <P>Yet the Leader of the Opposition complains that I have made no provision for the buoyancy of the revenue, when the truth is that I have been optimistic enough to write-up the yield by £2.7 millions.  They query which might indeed be raised is whether, taking world conditions as they are, such optimism is justified.  It is the question which I have put to myself, the question which I am in duty bound to put to myself having regard to the sources from which our tax-revenue is obtained.</P>
      <P>In this matter the Leader of the Opposition and his followers are in truth trying to have it every way.  He and his Party tell us that a deflationary condition has set in, while at the same time they go out and tell the people we are underestimating revenue and they criticise us for not taking that highly optimistic view of the customs yield which only the admitted existence conditions would justify.  Of course, in matters of this sort, we are not inspired prophets and we do not pretend&mdash;as apparently the Opposition do&mdash;that absolute accuracy in these matters is attainable by ordinary men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition may be in a position to foresee every event at home and abroad throughout the year which will react on the finances of the State, and may be able to assess those reactions in terms of pounds, shillings and pence.  I make no such pretension.  Instead, I state the simple truth that the estimate of revenue has been based on the best advice available to me, that it is the highest that on any rational grounds we should be justified in making, and that the danger is that in our anxiety to avoid imposing unnecessary taxation we have overestimated the yield.  However, the Leader of the Opposition, without adducing a single authoritative calculation to prove his point, <Col N="953" /> makes the assertion that we underestimated revenue and savings.  And all up and down the country the Fine Gael chorus is quacking on the same note, like so many geese following a gander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But on the other hand we have the emphatic statement of the Irish Trade Union Congress that they &ldquo;do not doubt for a moment, despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various estimates, both of revenue and expenditure, were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow&rdquo;.  In so far as there can be any controversy as to the size of the gap between current revenue and expenditure which had to be bridged, I think that the view taken by the Trade Union Congress is the view that will be taken by all sensible men and women.</P>
      <P>It being admitted, then, that the gap to be closed is of the order of £15.1 million, the duty of the Government and the responsibility of the Government is to close it.  The question we put to ourselves and the question we had to solve was how was this to be done?  Not even the Opposition, with all its predilection for borrowing, has suggested that we should borrow for it. On the contrary, the Leader of the Opposition, when referring to my assumption that it was common ground that the current Budget must be balanced, solemnly declared with his hand on his heart and his eyes turned to heaven:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To that principle we on this side of the House, in or out of government, have always subscribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So at least the Fine Gael Party and the Government are at one in their determination to balance the current Budget without recourse to borrowing. Borrowing being, therefore, by common agreement ruled out, what remains? What other course is there except to balance the Budget either by reducing expenditure or increasing taxation, or by an equitable combination of both courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Fake the estimates is what you did.</P>
      <P>Naturally, before accepting the inevitability of increasing taxation the Government scrutinised all forms of expenditure which were chargeable against revenue.  The one service which appeared by its very nature to call for examination and in which any appreciable saving might justifiably be secured was the provision for food subsidies.  The attitude of the Government in regard to these subsidies has been a matter for some discussion in this debate.  Perhaps I might add to what I have already said about them in my Budget statement. In that statement I examined in some detail the history and development of this service since it was first introduced during the Emergency period, when a Wages Stabilisation Order was in force.  Just as the Wages Stabilisation Order was intended to be only a temporary expedient, so also was the system of food subsidies.  The one was originally interlinked with the other; and both were, in the view of the Government, highly undesirable even while in the conditions then prevailing they were unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Subsidies were introduced as a short-term expedient to deal with what was hoped would be a short-term problem.  They were introduced with great hesitation as an experimental measure and with great doubt as to their over-all advantage.  In the circumstances of the time the experiment had to be tried; it was worth while trying it, but it must nevertheless be conceded that it failed to achieve its original purpose.  Experience of the subsidies in operation has shown up their many disadvantages.  They are, as I have said, cumbersome, wasteful and expensive to administer and, so far as the majority of the taxpayers are concerned, they yield no over-all advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They make rationing unavoidable and thereby tend to tie up consumers to their individual suppliers and because of the difficulty and inconvenience of retrieving ration books to leave them subject to their goodwill. They stifle competition and deprive <Col N="955" /> consumers of the benefits of it; since there is no incentive to reduce costs, every increase, whether avoidable or not, can be passed on to the taxpayer. They facilitate the formation of trade rings and the development of restrictive trade practices.  They foster the illusion that food is cheaper to the consumer than it really is, since the subsidy which now pays a great part of the food's true cost is provided by the consumer himself as a taxpayer. Thus, in order to continue to sell bread, tea and butter at their present prices over the whole year, to pretend&mdash;for that is what it comes to&mdash;that these things cost the consumer very much less than, in fact, they do, we should require to raise in taxation from the general body of consumers no less than £15,240,000 nett.  And then, while raising it we are busily engaged in giving most of it back again.</P>
    <P>On a rough computation, which I have made merely for the purpose of illustrating the argument, that £15,240,000 represents a combination of taxes somewhat like this:&mdash;1/- in the £ income-tax; 8d. per packet of 20 cigarettes; 4d. per pint on beer; 6d. per glass on whiskey; 4d. per gallon petrol.</P>
    <P>By a tax scheme of this kind the £15,240,000 is collected without any highly elaborate machinery.  But to give it back again to the million or so persons from whom it was originally collected requires a most elaborate organisation, heavily staffed with civil servants, millions of ration books and millions upon millions of coupons, each of which, in theory at least, must be carefully kept, then surrendered and checked, and finally given up to those who first issued it.</P>
    <P>It costs quite an amount to collect the £15,240,000 from the taxpayer but it costs a very great deal more to give it back again in the subsidised tea, bread and butter.  The consumer, as taxpayer, pays the cost in both cases.</P>
    <P>On top of all this, there is the worry and trouble which the whole system imposes on those who are in the grocery trade.  It slows up the whole <Col N="956" /> business of buying and selling, records have to be kept, returns have to be made, forms have to be filled and a large part of the shopkeeper's time is spent trying to satisfy some civil servant instead of trying to satisfy his customers.  All this means additional costs to the shopkeeper, and these costs, naturally, with a percentage added, are passed on to his customers.</P>
    <P>The whole of this elaborate machinery has been devised, as I have said, in order to delude the consumer with the belief that his food is costing him less than it really does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And this applies to all the consumers, to the old age pensioner as well as to the surtax payer. Everyone who smokes, takes a drink, rides in a bus, goes to the cinema pays his share of the subsidy for everyone else&mdash;for all draw it, rich and poor alike.</P>
      <P>Not only do the food subsidies mask the real cost of living but they distort the cost-of-living index as well.  The taxation which enables the goods to be sold over the counter at less than their real cost is not taken into account when computing the cost-of-living index, but the artificially low price of the goods over the counter is used as the basis for the calculation. In a system where wages tend to be related to the cost-of-living index this is hardly to the wage-earner's advantage.</P>

I believe it would be better for the workers, in particular, that they should know what their real wages are in terms of the true cost of commodities rather than continue the present wasteful and cumbersome and expensive system which has so developed that it now exists to conceal from them that fundamental fact.  In altering the food subsidies we have acted on that principle.  At the same time we have recognised in our proposals that the change should be accompanied by an extension and improvement of existing social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly we propose to increase existing children's allowances and to extend the scheme to the second child; we propose also to increase the old age pensions and to improve unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Now, these are&mdash;unlike the subsidies which will inevitably go whether this Government remains in office or not&mdash; to be permanent benefits.  Any person who listened to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins's speech to-day, or who read it, noticed how evasive he was in dealing with the plain questions put to him by two Deputies.  Is it not far better that we should have these permanent increased social service benefits than have these temporary subsidies?  They are, as I have said, to be permanent benefits.  They will be embodied in legislation and will continue thereafter to be paid as a statutory right.  They will cost in a full year no less than £3,750,000.  Thus, apart altogether from the additional benefits to be provided under the Social Welfare Bill, we are making this further supplementary provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we might have done more for certain sections. We should have liked to do so.  It has been the aim of this Party since it was established to ask the people, through the State, to do the utmost they can to relieve those who may be in necessity, <Col N="958" /> penury or want.  We should have liked, therefore, to do better than we have done but the hard fact is that we could not do anything more that would be worth while with the resources at our disposal than give compensation at the average rate which the changes in the subsidies represent.</P>
    <P>We have been asked, in particular, why we do not propose to do more than this for the old age pensioner.  In considering that question, we cannot disregard the fact that there is a wide diversity of circumstances among old age pensioners.  Many, undoubtedly, particularly in the cities, are in necessitous circumstances.  On the other hand, many, particularly in rural areas, cannot, in honesty, be said to be in that condition.</P>
    <P>To give compensation to all pensioners at a greater rate than the average increase in charge which the changes in the subsidies represent would over-compensate very many whose living conditions would not justify it having regard to the rights of the other members of the community.</P>
    <P>The Government, I may say, gave long and serious consideration to the problem in an endeavour to find a solution for it which would be administratively practicable.</P>
    <P>At the end, we had to admit defeat and to rely on the important fact that if, in a particular instance, the cash compensation of 1/6 per week fails to obviate real hardship, the obligation still rests on the local assistance authority to deal with the case.</P>

      <P>In that connection I am giving the place of honour to my predecessor in office, the former Minister <Col N="959" /> for Finance, who did recognise that there was a Budget problem.  He recognised that a critical position was facing this country and made a most remarkable suggestion to meet it.  He started by declaring that: &ldquo;It is well known that there is a vast amount of money in this country illegally acquired during the war.  It has never been subject to income-tax.&rdquo;  Note Deputy McGilligan's general statement that there is &ldquo;a vast amount of money&rdquo;&mdash;not a figure, &ldquo;a vast amount of money,&rdquo; a real atomic bomb of money so far as purchasing power is concerned.  Well known to whom? Deputy McGilligan did not even seem to suggest that he had any particular knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that it was illegally acquired.  We had there three assertions by the Deputy: that there was this vast amount of money, that it was well known, and that this vast amount of money had been illegally acquired.  Like Deputy Costello, when Deputy Costello was dealing with the charge that we had falsified the Estimates of revenue and expenditure, Deputy McGilligan had not even a tittle of evidence to support any one of them.  On the basis, however, of these unsubstantiated hearsay statements, statements I think of his own fabrication, Deputy McGilligan advocated that the banks should be compelled to give information as to deposit receipts and money on deposit on which tax had not been paid.</P>
      <P>Let us hear, before the Finance Bill is concluded, if that is the official policy of Fine Gael.  If it is, the public ought to be told.  Deputy McGilligan, moreover, does not intend to confine his inquisition to the banks and bank accounts alone.  He is prepared to go further and institute household searches.  &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he declared in justification of his proposal, &ldquo;that little device applied here, it would drive out quite an amount of money that is in deposit or kept around the house&rdquo;.</P>

Deputy McGilligan wants the tax collectors to go snooping around and searching out the cash which is &ldquo;kept around the house&rdquo;.  Once more I want to know, because this is important, if that is the official policy of Fine Gael.  Do they wish the officers of the revenue to be given power to take steps that would bring out amounts of money that are kept around the house?

      <P>That was one suggestion which Deputy McGilligan put forward, as an aid to the State in the exceedingly difficult position in which it finds itself.  He made one other suggestion which, likewise, was intended not to help but to confuse. Deputy McGilligan, as everybody knows, is a prolific fabricator of false charges from which, when one pins him down to proofs, he scurries away.  He has explored more bolt holes than any rabbit in this country.  In his speech on Tuesday he suggested that the Government was in some way making a gift to tobacco manufacturers.  The manner in which that suggestion was made clearly implied that in Deputy McGilligan's view there was some impropriety involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what are the facts.  The Dáil will remember how, with a flourish and loud music from the Labour Party, Deputy Norton, <Col N="963" /> when Tánaiste, announced the establishment of a Prices Advisory Body. This was a body which, according to Deputy Norton, was specially chosen by the then Government to put manufacturers and others who sought increases in prices through all the processes of the Inquisition in order to discover the truth about their costs and profits.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, played a very large part in the selection of the personnel of that body.  The Prices Advisory Body has been kept in being by the present Government and functions as effectively under us as it ever did under our predecessors.  Last year, the Prices Advisory Body, having duly considered an application from the tobacco manufacturers, recommended that they should be permitted to increase the price of the standard cigarette by 2d. per packet of 20.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not immediately give full effect to that recommendation. Instead he went at first only half of the way and granted permission for an increase of 1d. last October.  That, however, could only be regarded in all fairness and in all justice as an instalment since it did not meet by any means the increase in the cost of the tobacco leaf and other charges which have occurred since the former standard price was fixed.  It is necessary because of the continued rise in these costs to concede now the full increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body.  These are the circumstances under which Deputy McGilligan alleges we are making a gift of 1d. per packet of 20 cigarettes to the tobacco manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How much would the tobacco leaf in a cigarette cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>His suggestion that something improper is being done in giving effect to the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body is, as we all know, a typical example of Deputy McGilligan's political technique.  Perhaps, however, the Leader of the Opposition might address himself to this question: If it is improper for the Government to act on the recommendation of the Prices Advisory <Col N="964" /> Body, is there not something improper in the recommendation itself, in the proceedings of the body which made it and in the conduct of its chairman? That, in fact, is the real charge which Deputy McGilligan, by innuendo, has made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish, I think to the surprise of most people, has associated himself with this charge against the Prices Advisory Body.  Deputy Corish is a follower of Deputy Norton.  It occurs to me that that, perhaps, may not be the real position as recent events suggest that Deputy Corish is one of those members who, like Deputy Larkin, are dissatisfied with the role which Deputy Norton played as cloak and dagger man for Fine Gael in the late Coalition, when Fine Gael was using every opportunity to strengthen its electoral position&mdash;&ldquo;Not only in the open light of day&rdquo;, but, as Deputy Larkin discloses, &ldquo;in the dark of night.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever be the attitude of Deputy Corish, whether it be that of a loyal follower of Deputy Norton or that of a rival on the steps of the throne, the fact is that Deputy Corish was one of those who was instrumental in setting up the Prices Advisory Body.  The Prices Advisory Body, according to Deputy Norton, on 6th December, 1950, speaking at column 1818 of Volume 123 and subsequent columns, was not to be:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;an inconsequential advisory committee ... but a price tribunal, a virile, vibrant representative body of three or five citizens, selected on the basis of their competence and on the basis that they are citizens of standing....  That tribunal will be expected to undertake the most critical and the most microscopic examination of every claim for an increase made to it and there must be no increase given by that tribunal unless the case for such an increase is proved beyond all possibility of doubt.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government will assist that tribunal by making available to <Col N="965" /> it ... the group of profits of the manufacturers, or the individual manufacturer, who go before the tribunal looking for an increase in price: in other words, the tribunal will not deal with these matters in vacuum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus spoke Zarathrusta in the person of Deputy Norton.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body which our predecessors established is the &ldquo;price tribunal&rdquo;, as Deputy Norton decribed it, which heard the application of the Irish tobacco manufacturers for permission to increase their prices.  It is the tribunal which, having made in Deputy Norton's phrase, &ldquo;the most critical and the most microscopic examination of every claim for an increase made to it,&rdquo; has advised that this increase must be given if the manufacturers are to continue in business.</P>
    <P>I do not know what evidence the Prices Advisory Body had before it in arriving at their decision but I do know that Deputy Norton told us at column 1819 of Volume 123 of the Official Report again on 6th December, 1950, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There must be no increase given by that tribunal unless the case for such an increase is proved beyond all possibility of doubt.  If there is to be a doubt, it is the public and not the applicant who will get the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even Deputy Corish will scarcely have the nerve to suggest that the tribunal composed of his own nominees departed from that principle when considering the application of the Irish tobacco manufacturers.  He will scarcely charge them, even in this place of privilege where he can speak with immunity, with being biassed in favour of the manufacturers and against the consumers. He must accept the inevitable conclusion, therefore, that there was absolutely no doubt in the minds of the members of the Prices Advisory Body that, by the most rigorous standards of justice, the application of the tobacco manufacturers must be conceded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> Deputy Corish objects to this decision.  He objects to justice being done by the tribunal in this case.  Now, will the Deputy tell us why?  Is it because the applicants are tobacco manufacturers?  Is it because they happen to be Irish tobacco manufacturers? Or is it merely because they happen to be manufacturers and employers that Deputy Corish objects to them getting justice?  Even the Deputy's biassed class-hatred cannot carry him so far that, rather than see justice done, he will put the manufacturers out of business and put, in particular, the Irish-owned concerns out of business.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, by some method of calculation, has arrived at the conclusion that this additional 1d. per packet on the price of cigarettes means £900,000 per annum to the tobacco manufacturers. I do not know how the Deputy has arrived at that figure.  It is, in any event, too fantastic to be correct.  The increase recommended by the Prices Advisory Body is given merely to cover increases in the cost of the tobacco leaf and other charges.</P>

      <P>Yet, the Deputy's speech was designed to lead the public to believe that the Prices Advisory Body had given this huge sum as an extra profit to the manufacturers.  Is there any justice in that suggestion? Is there any social justice in the suggestion? The fact is that the increase in price has been granted in order to enable the manufacturers to remain in business and this Deputy Corish well knows.</P>

      <P>Now, let the Deputy take his medicine.  Suggestions have been made that the additional revenue required could have been secured more easily by taxes other than we have proposed.  I cannot deal exhaustively with all these suggestions.  That would require several volumes, but I can assure the Deputies who have put these suggestions forward that they were considered&mdash;every one of them&mdash; very carefully before they were rejected for the taxes upon which we are relying.</P>
      <P>There are certain conditions which, in my view, it is desirable any particular form of tax should fulfil.  In broad general terms the tax should be equitable, effective, economic and convenient. No tax that man can devise will fulfil any or all of these conditions except in a loose and approximate way; but some taxes more nearly fulfil them than others, and it is on that basis that we must proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> If time permitted I would show how those taxes which I have rejected fall much further short of fulfilling the conditions than those which I have adopted.  So perhaps I might deal very briefly with one example.  It is the one which is most commonly offered as an alternative to other taxes.  It has been suggested that profits should be taxed more heavily, preferably by the introduction of an excess profits tax.  Now, experience has shown that an excess profits tax is a bad tax.  It is arbitrary; it is inequitable as between one taxpayer and another; it does not differentiate between profits which might correctly be described as excessive and profits which have increased because of greater enterprise, more efficient management or other desirable cause, and it lends itself easily and readily to fraud and evasion.  Finally, it is a tax on marginal earnings, and marginal earnings are just the type of earnings which must be encouraged if we desire to have an efficient, expanding economy.</P>
    <P>It was on these grounds that the Labour Government in Great Britain decided first to reduce the tax in October, 1945, and, finally in April, 1946, to abolish it altogether.  In doing so, Dr. Dalton who was at that time Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Socialist Government passed this judgment on it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Moreover, once the standard profit has been earned, this tax encourages extravagant and wasteful outlay, and even downright dishonesty, since if this expenditure were not incurred it would be the Treasury and not the owners of the business who would take the money. Under those conditions this tax works against incentive and against efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, whatever groundless allegations may be made that this Government is biassed in favour of or against any particular section, no one will suggest that Dr. Dalton, once Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, is biassed in favour of capitalists, industrialists or profit-makers.  Yet he condemns the excess profits tax unreservedly.  As <Col N="969" /> against this tax, so strongly condemned by a socialist chancellor, we find that the most effective tax on profits is the income-tax.  There is not the fine propagandist ring about its name that there is about the excess profits tax, but it is a fairer, more effective way of collecting revenue, particularly when it is associated, as it is now, with an equitable system of earned income and reduced rate reliefs.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with other suggestions which have been made, but it is necessary to get on to a more general aspect of the problem.  I have referred already to certain statements made by Deputy McGilligan in the course of his speech on Tuesday evening. The more closely I study that speech the more doubtful I become as to what the Deputy's real purpose in making it was.  At first reading, it might appear to be the sort of slick parliamentary performance we are accustomed to from the Deputy.  But there are passages in it that appear to be of deeper significance.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;give-away&rdquo;, for instance, of the manner in which Deputy Costello's figures were prepared does not suggest that Deputy McGilligan is prepared to continue to serve the Party with a complete disregard of the public interest. More suggestive still were the Deputy's references to the advice which he received from his advisers when preparing his Budget for 1951-52, the Budget, that is, for the last financial year.  No Deputy, no Minister or ex-Minister could speak in higher terms of the advice which he received or of the competency of his advisers than did Deputy McGilligan on Tuesday night.  But how did he treat them? He told us that they had warned him of the rapidly aggravating balance of payments problem.  He told us that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because the country is not supplying all the goods it requires we have a vast import of goods... there is this terrifying gap in the balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was told last year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the public and the Government between them are spending more than the nation can afford.&rdquo;  He told us, <Col N="970" />&ldquo;that advice came to me from people who have very good standards to give advice.&rdquo;  He told us again on Tuesday night, &ldquo;that was very good advice; taken by certain standards it was impeccable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us see how did Deputy McGilligan act on that advice. Seven million pounds were the additional amount that his advisers told Deputy McGilligan he would require if the Budget of last year was to be balanced.  It is an indication, a significant indication, of the soundness of the judgment and of the advice which Deputy McGilligan's advisers gave to him, but which he rejected, that, in fact, the deficit on last year's Budget, on the Coalition Budget submitted to the Dáil just 12 months ago by Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, was £6.86 million.  His advisers, whom Deputy McGilligan admits gave him &ldquo;impeccable advice&rdquo;, put last year's probable deficit at £7,000,000.  It turns out now to be £6.68 million.  A more accurate forecast than that of the out-turn of events 12 months ahead could scarcely be expected, even from a prophet.</P>
    <P>Let me ask again, how did Deputy McGilligan react to this figure of £7,000,000.  He himself has disclosed that he did not turn down the advice out of hand.  &ldquo;When I began to consider&rdquo;, he confessed on Tuesday, &ldquo;the sources from which that might be derived&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that&rdquo; being the £7,000,000 &mdash;his advisers &ldquo;fell back on what is now before the Dáil&rdquo;&mdash;increased taxes on &ldquo;beer, tobacco, whiskey and petrol. These were certainly suggested to me.&rdquo; Beer, tobacco, whiskey and petrol: more ominous words than the first three could not be uttered in Deputy McGilligan's hearing.</P>
    <P>As soon as he heard them last year, the blood in his veins turned to water and his previous resolution to do his duty by the people and bring in at least one honest Budget vanished like snow.  He knew what the Fine Gael Party in Dublin owed to the five publicans who had raised a considerable sum for the 1948 election&mdash; £30,000 it has been suggested.  He knew that he owed his own seat to the support of that particular vested <Col N="971" /> interest in his constituency and so he turned down the advice which he himself has admitted&mdash;and I am quoting his own words&mdash;&ldquo;was very good advice and which taken by a certain standard was impeccable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the &ldquo;certain standard&rdquo; to which Deputy McGilligan referred when he declared that that was &ldquo;impeccable advice&rdquo;?  It is the standard of objectivity set by distinguished public servants, chosen for their knowledge and experience of public finance, who are bound to advise their Minister to the best of their ability and in a purely objective way as to what financial or economic policy will best serve the interests of the people and the State.  That is the standard to which the advice of Deputy McGilligan's principal advisers must be related.  That is the sort of advice which they must give.  They must tell their Minister, without fear or favour, what course, in their opinion, will best advance the interests of the people.  Their Minister need not take it.  He need not take it even though he recognises that it is &ldquo;impeccable advice,&rdquo; as Deputy McGilligan himself has admitted it to be.</P>
    <P>He may be afraid to take it.  He may shirk his duty, as Deputy McGilligan now discloses he did last year, but that is not their responsibility. Their Minister carries full responsibility under the Constitution and that responsibility is accompanied by freedom to reject good advice&mdash;even &ldquo;impeccable advice&rdquo; if the political difficulties of the Minister require it. It was according to that canon of public conduct that Deputy McGilligan acted last year.  He could not do otherwise, indeed, unless he wanted to weaken the Coalition still further by himself being driven from the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>He knew that the then Minister for External Affairs dominated the then Taoiseach and that he would get no support from that quarter.  He knew that Deputy Dillon treated him and his Department with almost naked contempt. And so, instead of facing up to the situation, he allowed a Cabinet <Col N="972" /> Committee to cook the Estimates for the Supply Services, and to write them down arbitrarily by £4,000,000, and he himself failed, deliberately failed, in his Budget to make provision for charges which he knew would inevitably arise.  That is how the £7,000,000 deficit, which Deputy McGilligan's advisers feared, was, in fact, realised.  In order to salve his conscience&mdash;and he betrayed his public trust in this&mdash;he came to the Dáil, faint and bleating, uttering plaintive warnings in regard to the growing and alarming deficit in our balance of payments account, such as these:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position is, however, far from satisfactory&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from Deputy McGilligan's Budget speech of 12 months ago&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;inasmuch as the basic £10,000,000 deficit of 1949 was repeated in 1950....  The outlook for 1951 is, I fear, that the deficit may be even greater than in 1950....  The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably, the application of corrective measures will be called for.  At the moment these might be premature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Might I interrupt the quotations to emphasise the importance of that last statement which was made 12 months ago, not by me, but by my predecessor? &ldquo;If it&rdquo;&mdash;and by &ldquo;it&rdquo; Deputy McGilligan meant the balance of payments deficit&mdash;&ldquo;continues to develop unfavourably, the application of corrective measures will be called for. At the moment these might be premature.&rdquo;  Quite clearly, than warning presages the grave and serious situation which has since developed.</P>
    <P>We are now in the position in which &ldquo;the application of corrective measures&rdquo;, which Deputy McGilligan foresaw 12 months ago, can no longer be evaded.  The need for these measures was, indeed, manifest 12 months ago.  Even though the duty falls on us to deal with the position, it falls on us only because he and his colleagues shirked it.  They shirked it even though they knew the full consequences of doing so, even though as their Minister for Finance warned us <Col N="973" /> one year ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment&mdash;rather than by excessive consumption&mdash;can we be satisfied that as a nation we are making ends meet and not wasting our past accumulations.  One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manoeuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;which we are rapidly frittering away. It is the mainstay, I would say, not only of our economic independence but of our political independence also. Later in the same speech, in that tentative way in which he always spoke on these matters, as though he feared an attack from Deputy MacBride or Deputy Norton, he ventured to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the position with which we have to deal to-day.  Deputy McGilligan knew it existed last year. He knew it existed not only then but in the year before and in the year before that again.  So did Deputy Costello.  In fact, as the Minister for External Affairs reminded the House yesterday, Deputy Costello, then Taoiseach, uttered this warning in regard to it in August, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The adverse trade balance has grown to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment, or looks at the figures, the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;  It is to preserve that economic and financial stability that we have brought in this Budget.  We are acting on the warning <Col N="974" /> which ought to have been acted upon years ago&mdash;the warning which Deputy Costello uttered almost four years ago.  If it was not necessary, if he did not believe it, why did he utter it?  And since he did utter it, since it was necessary, why did he not act on it?  The reason, of course, is simple. The wild men in his Cabinet, the Dillons and the MacBrides, would not let him.</P>
    <P>Throughout those fearful years when Deputy Dillon was spending millions in an afternoon and Marshall Aid dollars were being thrown away like farthings, Deputy Costello, the ex-Taoiseach, and Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, resembled nothing so much as a demented captain and demented mate on a ship whose crew had gone out of control.  The only thing they did in that situation was to career up and down the deck shouting: &ldquo;We'll be on the rocks! we'll be on the rocks!&rdquo;  Now that situation has developed and we must ask ourselves how did it develop?</P>
    <P>In October, 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government decided, in an effort to deal with the price situation, to increase the then existing subsidies to rates which would require the Minister for Finance to find an additional £5,765,000 for the balance of that year. In order to obtain that sum, it was necessary for them to increase existing rates of tax to bring in £4,770,000 at the same time.  They allowed for a prospective surplus of £1,000,000 in the Budget.  The principal increases were made on income-tax, spirits, beer, tobacco, wines, entertainments and stamp duty.</P>
    <P>Following the General Election of 1948 and the formation of the Coalition Government, the increases in the taxes on beer, tobacco and entertainments were rescinded; but the increased rates of food subsidy were retained. The taxes were taken away but the expenditure was kept on.  Thus, the total cost of the subsidies was increased from £4,436,000, at which it was estimated in May, 1947, to £14,680,000 for 1948-49; to £12,580,000 for 1949-50; to £13,070,000 for 1950-51. But there was not any additional <Col N="975" /> revenue provided to cover these increases in expenditure.  The reductions in the tax-rates, to which I have referred, resulted in a loss of revenue of at least £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 a year to the Exchequer.  This £8,000,000 or £9,000,000, if it had been collected, would have gone a long way to help the State to balance accounts and would have prevented the present critical situation from developing.</P>
    <P>As our experience since has shown, the remission of these taxes was quite unjustified.  Our predecessors, however&mdash;everybody knows it&mdash;were coerced into making the remission. They had made themselves subservient to a certain interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They had made themselves subservient to a certain interest and they were not free to serve whole-heartedly the interests of the nation.  No matter how essential it might be to the well-being of the people and to secure the independence of the State, they dare not do an unpopular thing and so, instead of facing up to the responsibilities when they were confronted with them, when there was no longer any escape from them, last May, they dissolved the Dáil, went to the people, then, having been thrown out, they have left behind them a state of utter confusion in the public finances.  It is our tough and unpleasant task to straighten things out and, if the people support us, we shall do that.</P>
      <P>I have been accused here of making certain promises during the election. I made no promise and gave no undertaking that would be inconsistent with my public duty or that would fetter me in the discharge of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" />&ldquo;It is on this basis that we offer ourselves to you in this election.  In doing so, however, we wish to make it clear that Fianna Fáil makes no rash promises.  We do not know the extent to which the credit and solvency of the State has been undermined by the Coalition; we suspect, however, that, bad though the position in this regard appears to be, the worst has been concealed.  Therefore, if Fianna Fáil should receive a mandate to form a Government, its first task must be to reorganise the public finances and to set them in order. When this has been accomplished, Fianna Fáil pledges itself to pursue a progressive, social and economic policy, always, however, with due regard to the resources of the State and the individual rights of its citizens.  It will look, too, to the nation's defences, which the Coalition has so foolishly neglected.  Thus Ireland will cease to be both in grave peril herself and a source of weakness and danger to others.  On this programme we submit ourselves to you, and ask for your vote and general support, so that a disastrous phase in our public life may be ended.&rdquo;</P>
