    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We feel we are entitled to direct the Government's attention to the fact, that here again, in the main, they are asking the section of the community least fitted to bear the burden to carry it.  Some people will, in a glib way, refer to cigarettes and tobacco as luxuries.  I wonder if they are realists at all because, with the growth, not only here in Ireland but all over the world, in the consumption of tobacco, we can hardly put it in a purely luxury class.  I feel it may best be described within the category of goods referred to by Deputy McGilligan last night.  The Government are exploiting something which the people will buy.  The Minister is perfectly aware that it is the cigarette smoker and the tobacco smoker in the lower income group who will, in the main, have to bear the impact of this tax. The incidence of this taxation does not hit the person in the higher income group to the same extent.  We must refer back to the simple equation set forth last night by Deputy McGilligan, which shows the complete lack of balance in this situation.  We have heard talk in this House about the disequilibrium in the balance of payments <Col N="766" /> and about the disequilibrium in this, that and the other.  However, there is one startling realism about this situation; here again we have set forth Fianna Fáil's anti-wage policy; here again we have the people with the small pay packet being asked to carry an extra burden by way of an increase in the price of essential commodities. Last night they were asked to bear an increase in the price of beer, and now we have come to deal with the question of the increase in the price of cigarettes and tobacco&mdash;the semi-essentials of both the husband and the wife in most households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to ask the Minister what is his estimate of the real potential of this tax?  Is £5,500,000 the maximum yield?  On what basis, and on what information, does he calculate that figure?  Is this, as was patently demonstrated last night by Deputy McGilligan, an underestimation of what this savage increase in the price of tobacco should yield?  Figures were given last night, which were not controverted by the Minister for Finance, to show that the normal revenue from 1d. tax on a pint of beer would be £1,500,000 and that the revenue from a tax of 3d. on the pint of beer would be £4.5 million.  However, the tax is calculated by the Minister to yield only £2.4 million.  I want to know on what basic figure the Minister calculates the revenue he will get from cigarettes and tobacco?  Does this again go to show the sinister purpose of the Budget which, undoubtedly, is budgeting for a tremendous surplus? Would the Minister tell us what has been his previous experience of the yield from 1d. tax?  I gather that the 1d. granted to the manufacturers to meet increases in trading costs amounts to something over £1,000,000. On that basis alone, there seems to be a patent underestimation as to what the amount of revenue from this tax is likely to be.  He should tell us, now that he is seeking to put this tax into law, what the real yield from it will be.  Has the Minister calculated to his own satisfaction what the falling off in consumption may be?  If so, will he indicate to us on what estimated fall in consumption he calculates his new net yield from tax? <Col N="767" /> We feel we should protest most vehemently against this incidence of the Budget's severity, which delivers its most crushing blow to people least qualified to bear it.  As I said to the Minister last night, what incentive will this type of penal taxation be to the workers on the land and to the workers in industry?  Where are the Irish people going to find the 10 per cent. which he seeks by way of savings? Is not this Budget framed on the basis of repression?  Is it not a completely retrograde Budget which sets out deliberately to subtract from our present standard of life by decreasing and diminishing buying capacity? This particular tax, which will yield something in excess of £5,000,000, is the most savage tax of the Budget, excluding the raid on the family larder &mdash; the shameful despicable raid on the larders which were already incomplete enough.</P>
    <P>Now there is to be a further bit of piracy; we have the Minister, with savage glee, placing an extra tax on tobacco, bearing in mind the salutary answer he received from the Irish people when the 1947 Supplementary Budget was introduced, which imposed a less tax on tobacco than does this Budget.  With the vicious twist of a <Col N="768" /> specialised mind, he is lashing out, ruthlessly, in his own little tyrannical fashion, on the section of the community least able to carry the burden.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to clear the House's and the country's mind as to whether in fact this is not another patent bit of underestimation.  Would he disclose to us what the real yield of this tax would be? Would he also disclose to us why, in his long and wide range of taxes, he had to put the severest tax on this particular type of habit?  It may well be that the Minister will glibly say: &ldquo;You can give up smoking your cigarette or your pipe.&rdquo; That will defeat the Minister's own purpose.  The Minister's policy is not designed to ask the people to do that. It is designed to extract the maximum possible he can from those goods that people are most likely to buy.  It is a cheap trick &mdash; I designedly say cheap &mdash;to show his deep-seated attachment to a Tory Chancellor in the design of his Budget.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. The Deputy has stated that the tobacco manufacturers are to secure a certain sum on being permitted to increase the price of cigarettes by 1d.  There is nothing in this Bill affecting that. This increase has been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the advice of the Prices Advisory Committee, and there is nothing in this Bill dealing with that particular aspect of the matter.  I am putting it to you, therefore, that the Deputy is not in order in discussing it on this section.</P>

      <P>The man is rambling. This is a proposal in this amendment to extend to the tobacco manufacturers six months' grace for the payment of duty on stocks of tobacco.  Now Deputy Rooney makes the point, and rightly makes the point, that under collateral proposals made by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce the tobacco manufacturers are going to collect £1,000,000 over this very period. Deputy Rooney makes the very forcible point that if the tulips are going to collect £1,000,000 sterling as a result of the grace and bounty of the Minister they can well afford to pay within the term specified in the Bill, as submitted, the moneys that will come in course of payment for duty on stocks of tobacco. If the tobacco companies were in a state of bankruptcy or poverty it would be a reasonable proposal to do that.</P>

      <P>I am making a statement against the Minister's point of order. The Minister says there is nothing in this Bill affecting the 1d. to which Deputy Rooney has referred.  I am pointing out that the impact of the 1d. is that there is a flood of money pouring into the tobacco factories of £20,000 per week as a result of the penny he is giving them.  Surely they could use that to meet the payment of <Col N="772" /> duty on stock, and it is perfectly relevant, with that flood of money pouring into them, as an argument against giving them six months' grace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that this 1d. will bring into the manufacturers a figure in the region of £1? million.  If that 1d. on the packet of cigarettes is going to bring in £1? million to the manufacturers, surely each of the other six pennies imposed in the packet of cigarettes is going to bring in £1? million.  In that case instead of an estimate of £5,500,000 we should assume that the tax would bring in £7.8 million.  If 1d. brings in £1? million to the manufacturers it should bring in £1? million to the Exchequer.  It is just another proof of the underestimation of the revenue from this tax.  Deputy Corry last night let the cat out of the bag when he admitted that there was underestimation and said that he felt that it was justified.  I am taking the opportunity at this stage of pointing out that this figure of £5,500,000 appears to be a very low estimate of the revenue if we take it that 1d. will bring the manufacturers £1? million.</P>

      <P>Every time the 1d. for the tobacco manufacturers has been raised, every time it has even been suggested as an aside in the debate, the Minister for Finance is up protesting that it has nothing to do with the Finance Bill, and in this instance protesting that it has nothing to do with the amendment.  Are the Government and he now ashamed of the fact that they are making a present of £1,000,000 to the tobacco manufacturers of the country?  Is it out of order to argue that while the Minister for Finance wants the tobacco consumers of the country to pay an extra £5,500,000 to meet an economic situation, a picture of which he has painted for us, on the other hand he gives to a thriving industry a present of £1,000,000?</P>
      <P>When I talk about a thriving industry the Minister need not take me to task and say that there is unemployment in some of the Irish factories. Let me ask some of the same questions again.  Is it necessary to make a present of a substantial portion of £1,000,000 to firms like Wills and to Players?  If the Minister could submit any evidence whatsoever that the finances of these companies were in such a state that they were nearing bankruptcy then there might be some excuse for coming to the rescue in the manner he proposes, but under the circumstances which we see, all of us realising that the two big distributors of cigarettes in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In his financial statement on the 2nd April, as reported in the Dáil Debates of that date, column 1140, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proposed to increase the customs duty on leaf tobacco by the equivalent of 6d. on the packet of 20 cigarettes at present selling at 1/9. The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="775" /> has been satisfied by the manufacturers that it is necessary to allow an increase in price of 1d. a packet to cover increased cost of manufacture. These two factors&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>they are taken together in the financial statement,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;will raise the price of the popular packet from 1/9 to 2/4.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the other relevant comments are made regarding pipe tobacco and hard-pressed tobacco which was to be relieved to some extent.  First of all about the amounts.  Sixpence is what is going on as far as the yield to the Exchequer is concerned.  Again, this matter is very fresh in my mind because I have had frequent discussions about the yield of taxes on many things.  One was the yield of 1d. on a packet of cigarettes.  That was taking cigarettes comprehensively with the equivalent on tobacco.  The calculation for me was £1,300,000 and £1,400,000 in the full year.  The Minister was budgeting this year as from the 2nd April and that meant that he was getting a full year's yield this year.  Therefore 6d. should bring in £8.4 million.  He says that he will get £5.5 million.  Again we are faced with this confusion which the Minister could clear up, of course, and will not do.  Is he allowing for such a decrease in consumption as is represented by the fall in the revenue derived from the tax from £8.4 million to £5.5 million or is it partly that and partly underestimation; in other words, that it will yield booty, something more in order to give surplus? What is allowed to the manufacturers is very relevant.  I do not suppose that I ever saw so easy a gift so simply disclosed to us as this one.  In one single sentence he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been satisfied by the manufacturers that it is necessary to allow an increase in price of 1d. a packet to cover increased cost to the manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the Minister, what is the Minister's colleague, allowing to the manufacturers?  Is it £1,400,000, the fruits of 1d., or is it something else? <Col N="776" /> Or is it just whatever 1d. brings?  Are they gambling?  Were the manufacturers told: &ldquo;Take 1d., and if consumption keeps at the old rate you will get £1.4 million, but if it goes down to the point reflected by the difference between £8.4 million and £5.5 million you will get only £900,000&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It is to be noticed that the Minister there says: &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been satisfied.&rdquo; There is no question, so far as the financial statement is concerned, of the Prices Advisory Tribunal.  That came out later, when we were told that the Advisory Body had received representations from the tobacco manufacturers and had advised an increase of 2d. and that the Minister had granted an increase of 1d. before this 1d. increase. What was the first 1d. supposed to bring in &mdash; £1.4 million?  I suppose it would have, because there would not have been any great fall in consumption when that 1d. went on. What are the manufacturers getting? The Minister says the Prices Advisory Body recommended this.  I never heard of it.  He says that this body was set up by the previous Government. So it was, but the theme of the agreement and all the remarks made about that body were that the representations were to be made in public. I do not know what facts were brought before the tribunal.  We have not got them, but we are asked to vote 6d. to the revenue and 1d. to the manufacturers, on top of another 1d. granted earlier.  We do not know to what extent their representations carried weight with the tribunal &mdash; in other words, how much they were to be allowed.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned twice already that one of the groups of tobacco manufacturers who are going to benefit by the 2d. on the packet are a branch of the Imperial Tobacco Company.  The Imperial Tobacco Company, at their recent general meeting, told their shareholders that they were quite sorry &mdash; it was a matter of surprise as well as sorrow &mdash; that their dividend could not be put at the 35 per cent. level of two or three years ago and that they could only get a 32 per cent. <Col N="777" /> dividend.  To a branch of a company paying a 32 per cent. dividend, we propose to allow this 1d. increase, in addition to the 1d. granted apparently some time earlier.  That surely requires some better explanation from the Minister than we have had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>His explanation is that it is not in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is surely relevant to the Finance Bill.  The people are being asked to pay 6d. extra towards the Exchequer, and, taking, in the context of that levy, the 1d. already granted and the 1d. proposed to be granted, the price will be raised from 1/8 to 2/4, so the increase in the course of the year amounts to 8d. on the packet. That is the purely tobacco side.</P>
      <P>The other side is that this is a still further step in the policy of taking away from the value of the wages that people are getting, founded upon the main principle in the Budget, that the Government are satisfied that incomes have already advanced more than the cost of living.  Therefore, it is proper to cut incomes and one of the ways in which incomes are to be cut, or intended to be cut, is this, which is to yield £5,500,000, according to the Minister, but which I suggest will yield much more.  Taking it at £5,500,000, however, with the beer and spirits levies, it comes to £8.8 million and with the increase in the cost of foodstuffs, to something short of £13,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer in relation to all these matters is to take each separate tax and divide it over the community and say that it means only 1/6 a week.  Each one by itself is something small but the tot is nearly £13,000,000, and, on the Minister's line, that amount of £13,000,000 is to be provided out of present wages.  He has certainly no idea of a wages policy allowing for increases.  The principle is that this is necessary to reduce purchasing power because the country was living beyond its means so far as external purchases were concerned. &ldquo;We are spending abroad in excess of current savings&rdquo;, and that had to be reduced.  One of the ways by which <Col N="778" /> the people can be prevented from buying things coming across the Border is to tax the things they must buy, the things they are likely to buy and so we get that £13,000,000 piled up and, as I say, that is to be taken from present wages.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest slice of the exaction.  All the food items come to £4,000,000 and the tobacco to £5,500,000 even on the reduced consumption.  If it is going to bring in only £5,500,000, it means that at least £5,500,000 is going to be extracted from the housewife's share of the man's wages for the purchase of other things, but it is also going to mean a certain amount of mortification on the part of people who smoke who must remit some part of the pleasure they get from smoking in order to help the Minister to please the bankers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to praise the docility of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I think the picture of the Fianna Fáil Party being flogged into the Division Lobby for the purpose of securing that the tobacco companies which are to receive from the public a gift of £2,800,000 are to be given six months' grace wherein to pay the duty which becomes due on the stocks they at present hold, lest they be incommoded by having to pay on the nail, is something so grotesque as to deserve adequate description.  When you come to think of it, now that the bank rate is being raised, if an unfortunate shopkeeper down the country owes a bank £100 to-day, he will be asked to pay 6 per cent. on it and if he does not pay on the nail, the bank manager will want to know what he proposes to sell and when he is going to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present begging the Department of Fisheries to pay what they owe to a man because the bank manager is at his door every morning saying: &ldquo;Pay up or we are going to sell you out.&rdquo; But the tobacco manufacturers! Who would ask them to pay?  They are getting only £2,800,000.  The Minister has not even bothered to tell us what is the sum he expects will be due from the tobacco manufacturers on the stocks they hold.  Let us assume that it is half a million &mdash; and I do not think it is at all as great a sum.  They have <Col N="779" /> had £2,750,000 as a free gift, but so solicitous is the heart of Fianna Fáil, so restless has the sleep of Deputy Killilea become lest the Imperial Tobacco Company should be incommoded, that we have an amendment before us to assure them that, if it is not convenient for them to pay now, they can have six months' credit.</P>
    <P>Six months' credit is a useful concession.  It would yield no more than £3 to the fellow who owed the bank £100, but three months' interest on £500,000, if it were at 6 per cent., would be £15,000.  This amendment is just throwing a little sugar on the pill. We have given them £2,800,000, and now we are going to pay them £15,000 in order to take the present, lest it be too much trouble for them to come over and take the £2,800,000.  They must have £15,000 to pay for their bus fare, lest the remission in favour of the dance hall proprietors would rest too heavily upon them.  Is not that true? Is it not astonishing?  Deputy O'Reilly is an old campaigner with me; does he think we should pay the tobacco manufacturers £15,000 to come and collect £2,800,000 from the Exchequer? Does he not think that is acting too handsomely?  Does he not think they could come under their own steam to collect this money?  That is all they are being asked to do, to hire their own taxi or even come on the bus and collect £2,800,000, without being paid a further £15,000 to do it.  Is it not another subsidisation that this amendment amounts to, for which we are providing £15,000?  Has some illuminatus on the Fianna Fáil Benches discovered an explanation?</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Finance to tell us if it is true that the six months' grace which it is proposed in this amendment to give the tobacco manufacturers will be worth £15,000 to them, if their stock of tobacco calls for a duty payment of £500,000 and they have to borrow that money at 6 per cent.  as an ordinary shopkeeper in rural Ireland may have to do?  Is that the purpose of this amendment?  If the Minister does not care to make the calculation for us, I suggest to him <Col N="780" /> that he has an obligation to tell us, before he asks the House to pass the Finance Bill, what is the amount of duty he anticipates will be payable on the stocks of tobacco now in the hands of manufacturers and what will be the interest saving which will accrue to the manufacturers if they are, by this amendment, excused, by a period of six months' grace, from paying the duty which becomes due on their stocks under the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Prices Advisory Body is a body to which a judge of the Supreme Court was appointed as chairman by the late Coalition.  They recommended that the price of cigarettes should be increased by 2d.  One penny of that price increase was sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last October.  The other 1d. is being granted now and it is being granted on the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body.  If that recommendation is being challenged, then the people whose conduct is being impugned are, first, a judge of the Supreme Court who was chairman of that body; an officer of the Revenue Commissioners who was subsequently seconded, at the request of the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, to the Department of Agriculture and who has since been appointed a member of the Prices Advisory Body; a representative of the Trade Union Congress; a representative of the Congress of Irish Unions; and another member.  The personnel of the Prices Advisory Body which made that recommendation is precisely the same &mdash;there is one solitary exception &mdash; as it was when the Coalition Government left office.  It is the conduct of these gentlemen which is now being impugned &mdash; or does Deputy Corish suggest, or Deputy Dillon either, that from their knowledge of the people who constitute this body they are likely to make such a recommendation that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be justified in turning it down?</P>

      <P>If the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Prices Advisory Body, upon which Deputy Mac Fheórais and Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton were prepared to rely when they were in office, is the Deputy suggesting now that it should be insufficient to satisfy the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Is the Deputy suggesting now that this Prices Advisory Body were too easily satisfied, that they were not careful enough before they made this recommendation, which he has alleged is going to result in putting into the manufacturers' pockets, he said, £1,000,000 &mdash; or rather £900,000?  He <Col N="783" /> was more moderate than Deputy McGilligan; he was not such a fool; he knew what he was talking about, to some extent at least, or knew more closely than Deputy McGilligan.  Mind you, I say he knew it; I am not saying that that was the impression which he tried to convey in his presentation of the case.  That £900,000 is not going into the pockets of the tobacco manufacturers, in the sense in which Deputy Corish wished to convey it was, because the whole tenor of Deputy Corish's speech and suggestions has been that that is £900,000 additional profit.  The Deputy knows that is not so.  The Deputy knows that that additional increase of 1d. has been necessitated by the rise in the price of tobacco leaf, by the rise in wage rates, by the rise in the prices of packages, paper, and other materials which the tobacco manufacturers require, and that it is just sufficient to cover these increases in cost and to allow them their normal profit.</P>

Irish firms are the firms which would suffer most if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had done what Deputy Corish is suggesting he ought to have done &mdash; that is, to say to a Judge of the Supreme Court, to the civil servant who commanded the confidence of Deputy Dillon to such an extent that he had to take him out of the office of the Revenue Commissioners and appoint him to a post in his Department, to the representatives of the Congress of Irish Unions and the representatives of the Trade Union Congress, with which Deputy Corish is so closely allied, and to the other person whose name escapes me at the moment: &ldquo;We do not believe you arrived at this conclusion justly.  We have no confidence in you&rdquo;&mdash; for that is what it means&mdash;&ldquo;and, therefore, we are prepared to disregard and overthrow your recommendation altogether.&rdquo;  That is what <Col N="784" /> Deputy Corish wanted the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have heard something extraordinary.  Deputy Corish has made an extraordinary suggestion. Remember, it was the Coalition Government that appointed these persons.  When they were appointed we were told by the Coalition Government that they were independent of everybody.  We were taking a Judge of the Supreme Court, a high officer of the Revenue Commissioners, representatives from the two trade union bodies, and another gentleman whose name has eluded me since I started to make this speech.  They were going to be completely independent persons.  They would hear the evidence.  If there was any doubt whatsoever the balance would weigh in favour of the consumer.  I cannot quote the picturesque phrases of Deputy Norton but he gave one the impression that if a manufacturer went before that body and asked for an increase in prices he would be stripped to the skin and his pockets would be searched. In fact, he would go through the sort of procedure which, we are told, the Gestapo adopted in their treatment of their victims, before he would get a price increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does Deputy Corish say this morning?  This independent body was regarded, apparently, by him as a body of civil servants who were to do what their Minister told them to do. There is no longer any question of independence because civil servants are not independent.  They are the officers of their Minister.  They carry out their Minister's directions except in so far as they, being accounting officers. have a direct responsibility to this House.  However, in regard to general administration not touching the expenditure of public money, civil servants are the officers of their Ministers. That is what Deputy Corish now says &mdash; that this Prices Body was not an independent body, as Deputy Norton wanted the public to believe, <Col N="785" /> but was a mere rubber stamp to act as civil servants, on the instructions of their Minister, to sign on the dotted line when their Minister told them to do so.  Does Deputy Corish want the Irish people to believe that, in fact, that is how the independent Prices Body was regarded when he and his colleagues were in office?  I may say that that is not the position now.  We regard them as independent.  They are treated as independent.  We regard them also as responsible persons. When they have fully satisfied themselves in their investigations and make a recommendation we are prepared to accept it unless somebody can come along and satisfy us that that recommendation was unjustly or improperly made.  Then, if that should happen, we will do our duty in regard to the Prices Advisory Body just as in regard to any other organ of the State.  That is the position.  Again, I repeat that there is nothing in this Bill or in any section of this Bill which relates to the particular matter which was raised here in the first instance by Deputy Rooney, then by Deputy McGilligan and then by Deputy Corish &mdash; nothing whatever.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  The Minister for Finance raised this question and suggested that Deputy Rooney, Deputy McGilligan and myself were not in order in discussing the additional 1d. given to the cigarette manufacturers. On three distinct occasions, the Ceann Comhairle decided that it was in order to mention the 1d. increase.  Now the Minister says that we were grossly out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the sort.  I have accepted the Chair's ruling in regard to this matter.  I am merely emphasising the matter again, because I feel there is a certain deliberate obtuseness of view and apprehension on the part of Opposition <Col N="786" /> Deputies which prevents them from recognising that there is nothing in this Bill which deals with any recommendation made by the Prices Advisory Body.  How has this matter been brought in?  It has been brought in, if I might say so, on the back of one of Deputy McGilligan's March hares.  Deputy McGilligan read through my Budget speech in an attempt to find one or two things which were not sufficiently precise because they were not sufficiently detailed.  After all, the speech had to be kept within some bounds with regard to time.  I want to make it quite clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was acting on the advice of the Prices Advisory Body.  Deputy McGilligan had not time to read what was in the Bill or what I said in the financial statement in regard to the increase in the tobacco duties.  I said that we were increasing the rates of tobacco duty to such an extent that there would be an increase of 6d. in the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes, arising out of the duty, and that there would be only an increase of 2d. in the case of hard-pressed tobaccos.  When Deputy McGilligan was saying that the Revenue Commissioners, on certain occasions, had informed him &mdash; this is very interesting &mdash; that a duty which would be equivalent to an increase of 1d. in the price of the packet of cigarettes would bring in £1,300,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When we were discussing the sections relating to the <Col N="788" /> increase in duty on spirits, petrol, beer and, now, tobacco, Deputy McGilligan obviously came with a very freshly informed mind to this House. He had apparently been discussing with the Revenue Commissioners how much an increase in the rates of duty upon these commodities which I have mentioned would bring in.  Was Deputy McGilligan, when he was discussing the matter with the Revenue Commissioners, before he brought in the Budget of 1951, merely engaging in an academic exercise?  Was he just bringing over the Revenue Commissioners to waste their time, and saying: &ldquo;Look, boys, I just feel a little curious. How much would 1d. in the price of cigarettes yield if we increase the rates of duty to increase the price of a packet of cigarettes by 1d.?  How much would an increase of 1d. in the pint yield to the Exchequer if we were to increase the rates of beer duty by an amount which would necessitate an increase in the price of a pint by 1d.?  How much would be brought in if we increase the petrol duty by 4d. a gallon&rdquo;?  And, of course, the Revenue Commissioners were able, on the basis of increases of minimum amounts, to give him these figures&mdash; £1,300,000 per 1d. increase in the price of cigarettes and the corresponding increases in the price of the other tobaccos.</P>

The point I want to bring out is this, that when he was speaking on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, Deputy McGilligan admitted that he was advised, before he brought in his Budget of 1951, that he would require to find several million pounds and, as he said himself &mdash; I am paraphrasing his words &mdash;&ldquo;When I began to pursue this matter further I was told that I would get this from petrol, spirits, beer, tobacco,&rdquo; and then he said: &ldquo;I would have nothing to do with it.&rdquo; Instead of that, he brought in his Budget here on May 2nd.  He opened it in the usual formal way.  It received perfunctory discussion in this House.  The <Col N="789" /> general debate on the Budget was adjourned until May 8th, and the Dáil was dissolved on May 7th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was dwelling <Col N="792" /> on&mdash;and I think I am entitled to dwell on it&mdash;is that Deputy McGilligan has shown himself to be exceptionally well informed in regard to these matters, and I am asking the House to consider how he got that information.  He himself has admitted that he was advised that he would require several million pounds more revenue last year.  He has not only admitted this, but he did warn the House that if there was going to be any fresh expenditure there would have to be increased taxes.  He said that in 1951.  All I am now endeavouring to do is to point out the significance of the admissions in the statement which Deputy McGilligan has made in this House in the course of the debate, that these taxes, or at least part of these increased taxes, should have been imposed last year in order to enable Deputy Norton, if he had then been in office, to finance his Social Welfare Bill, to provide for the increase in the old age pensions, and in order to enable Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, the Minister responsible for the Civil Service, to meet the cost of the increased salaries of civil servants, which he knew were coming into operation last year, and for which we have to provide this year.</P>
      <P>That is the point I am making because, as a matter of fact, the discussion on this amendment is not confined to the narrow terms of the amendment.  Deputy Collins has been talking about rifling the larders and Deputy McGilligan has been talking about the pay packet.  These had nothing to do with the amendment. but they were regarded as relevant by the gentlemen on the opposite side. who are now becoming nervous of the turn which the discussion has taken, because they know it will become more evident that they should have imposed these taxes last year.  They know that they should have increased the tax on tobacco last year, but they were afraid of that, and they ran away from it. They had, however, perfectly prepared the ground so that when they had thrown over the Labour Party, sunk Clann na Poblachta and steamrolled Clann na Talmhan, they could come back with their over-all majority and bring in a Supplementary Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming very closely to the amendment.  The position is very simple.  Considerable stocks of tobacco had been cleared by the tobacco manufacturers from bond before the Budget.  They had been cleared in the ordinary course of business. On them, customs duty had been paid.  We had the option of allowing these manufacturers to dispose of that tobacco at an inflated price, including the amount of the customs duty, or of levying an excise duty on the stocks of tobacco which had been cleared from bond.  We anticipate that we shall get something less than £600,000 as a result of the excise duty.  The tobacco manufacturers could not have foreseen that these increased payments would be required of them.  They did not know that we <Col N="796" /> were going to increase the rates of tobacco duty.  They had cleared these stocks in the ordinary way of business in order to maintain production and to meet the continuous unbroken public demand.  Quite obviously even Deputy Dillon will realise that.  I do not know whether the lawyers on the other side of the House would, but a person who is supposed to be a businessman like Deputy Dillon will realise that it would be very difficult for many small tobacco manufacturers, particularly the Irish-owned concerns, to find that money overnight.  These were stocks that were manufactured but were still held by them for sale in their stock rooms. They were to be asked to pay on the nail.  That is what Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan wanted.  I am not surprised that Deputy McGilligan wanted it because he has had no touch with the practicalities of commercial life, but Deputy Dillon is supposed to have.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that these tobacco manufacturers carrying these stocks should pay on the nail something like £600,000. What undertaking in this country, big or small, could find that money overnight? Then, having paid if to us, they were to wait until the stocks were liquidated before they could recoup themselves.  Is not the position clearly one that would have to receive very careful and sympathetic consideration?</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputy Corish to talk about the subsidiary tobacco companies.  What about the Irish-owned concerns?  They have not the capital resources of their competitors. How can they find the money overnight to pay on the nail, as Deputy McGilligan said?  Quite obviously they had to be given time, the time which we had originally intended to give &mdash; the 1st July, 1952.  After careful consideration and study of the documents submitted to them, the Revenue Commissioners came to me and said &mdash; it is my responsibility and I am not putting any responsibility on them&mdash;&ldquo;It will be essential for you to allow the tobacco manufacturers further time unless you are going to close down certain Irish concerns.&rdquo; All they are being given is time to pay the money, time to enable them to clear their stocks to put themselves in funds to pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> It has been suggested that because that time is being given we are doing something unusual.  Has Deputy Dillon ever asked for time to meet his accounts?  Is there any Deputy who is engaged in business who at one time or another did not find it difficult to find money to pay on the nail?  That is what we are doing in regard to this excise duty which fell suddenly on these tobacco manufacturers who had cleared stocks in bond in order to maintain themselves in the ordinary course of production.  Some people, however, are trying on the basis of that to suggest that I am putting money into the tobacco manufacturers' pockets; that I am giving them some benefit, some concession which will represent a substantial profit to them. On the contrary, I am merely putting them in a position to carry on and meet their obligations in due course to the Exchequer when they have sold the stocks on which we are levying tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not come to a pretty pass when the Minister for Finance gets up and says that the oldest established businesses in Ireland could not get credit from their bankers for three months for a self-liquidating overdraft to meet the payment for excise duty on tobacco which was passing into consumption and which must be consumed within six weeks of the date of the payment being made?  Have we reached the stage when the Minister for Finance gets up and says that his advisers came to him and said: &ldquo;Minister, either these old established businesses must close down or you must give them the credit that their bankers have refused to give them?&rdquo; Small tobacco manufacturers, the old tobacco manufacturers, can come to the Minister and ask that they should be given that credit, but the shops which are closing in this city and in every provincial town in Ireland because there is no appeal from the bank manager's ultimatum: &ldquo;You pay on the nail or close your doors,&rdquo; cannot go to the Revenue Commissioners and say: &ldquo;Give us six months' credit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that, having examined everything, he was satisfied that some of the oldest industries in Ireland were warned by their bankers: <Col N="798" />&ldquo;Close down; dismiss your employees; get out; we will not give you six weeks' credit.  Even if that means sacking every man in the place and wiping out an industry, this is our decision; out you go.&rdquo; The Minister has volunteered the information that after an examination of the circumstances of the old-established Irish tobacco manufacturers, he was satisfied that the alternative was this amendment or see them go to the wall.  No banker in Ireland would give them six weeks' credit, and the only place they could go to was to Parliament to intervene and to amend the Finance Bill. That is the certificate the Minister is giving, I am not alleging it.  I am commenting on what the Minister has told us.  He says: &ldquo;I looked into the case, not of the Imperial Tobacco Company, but of the old-established Irish tobacco manufacturers, and I satisfied myself that it was this amendment or close their doors, dismiss their men, and wind up their business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise the position into which we have been manoeuvred by these lunatics?  Can they imagine that some of the oldest Irish businesses are now in a position that bankers dare to say to them: &ldquo;Not one farthing; it does not matter whether there are 500 or 600 men depending for a living on your business, we will not give you a week's credit although you are prepared to demonstrate to us that this is only to pay duty on tobacco which is passing into consumption every day, and which must be consumed within six weeks of the giving of the overdraft&rdquo;?  The Minister does not seem to realise that he is commending this amendment to the House on the grounds that he has manoeuvred Irish businesses into the position that they cannot get six weeks' credit for whatever sum is due to pay the duty on stocks which are actually in the process of manufacture.  If that is the case of some of the most substantial old businesses in this country, conceive what is the position of those who are not in a position to come to Parliament. If they get an ultimatum, they shut their doors, the men are dismissed, and the proprietors look for a job.  It is the Minister who has told us this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Although he has told us that that is the position in regard to Irish businesses, he is distributing, according to his own allocation, £2,800,000, of which the Imperial Tobacco Company will collect seven-eighths.  Then he says that Deputy McGilligan has misled the House because he has not adverted to the fact that if you reckon 1d. on cigarettes to produce £1,400,000, you imply that a corresponding tax applies to tobacco.  He says that at column 1141, Volume 130, of the Official Reports of his Budget statement he told the House that he was not going to extend this 1d. to ordinary tobaccos.  I said to him: &ldquo;What then do you lose from revenue?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Something about 20 per cent.&rdquo; Let us see where that leads us.  He admits that 1d. applied to cigarettes and tobacco yields £1,400,000 and that 6d. yields £8,400,000.  Take 20 per cent off that because he has not extended it to tobacco.  A fifth of £8,400,000 is approximately £1,700,000.  Take that from £8,400,000 and you get £6,700,000 as the yield of that tax.  What does the Minister for Finance tell us the tax will yield?  Look at column 1141.  He says there he hopes to get £5,500,000. Which calculation is right?  Is it to be £6.7 million or £5.5 million?  What is the House to believe?  All I know is that we are giving the tobacco companies, of whom the Imperial Tobacco Company represents seven-eighths, £2,800,000 for themselves &mdash; 2d. a packet on cigarettes.  We will now by this amendment extend the period wherein they can pay tax on stock for six months.  Assuming these stocks to be half a million that means that we are giving them a further present of £17,000 interest which would be payable on the half million for six months. We are asked to do that because the Minister says he has personally considered the circumstances, not of the Imperial Tobacco Company but of the old established Irish tobacco manufacturers and he has discovered that when they went to their bankers to get accommodation for approximately six weeks they were told: &ldquo;Close your doors; dismiss your men; wind up your business; we will not give you a farthing; we will not accommodate you <Col N="800" /> for a month, or a week, or a day.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil sits there and applauds that.  Fianna Fáil declares that that is right and that the appropriate way to remedy the situation is to come in here now and move an amendment to the Finance Bill to the effect that if the bankers have decided to close these old established firms up they will rescue them at the eleventh hour by amending the law and they will lay that soothing unction to our souls in the conviction that &ldquo;Where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be thousands of other small businessmen who are being told to put up their shutters, dismiss their men and look for a job but, thank God, we in Dáil Éireann do not know about them so there is no need to amend the Finance Bill to relieve them.  Was there ever such an example of unscrupulous, callous, shameless abdication of duty?  Every Deputy of Fianna Fáil is fixed with notice now on the authority of Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Finance, that he has himself examined the case of a group of the oldest business establishments here and he has himself established the fact that for the want of six weeks' credit they would have had to close their doors, dismiss their men and wind up their business.  That is why he is coming in here now to move this amendment and Fianna Fáil applaud that.</P>
    <P>That is what Fianna Fáil has done to our people in the last six months.  That is what they glory in having achieved in this country within the last six months.  They are the greatest curse that has ever come upon our people and, with God's help, we will clean them out of that place at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a very interesting statement from Deputy Dillon.  The first point I would like to make is that the basis of his calculation leaves out of consideration one factor which I have taken into consideration. Naturally, if we have to impose in this year, not merely taxation to cover the increase in the cost of public services which will arise directly immediately in this year but also those increases and costs which occurred last <Col N="801" /> year, but which were not provided for, then the increase in the rates of taxation will be above normal because we shall have to impose in this year those increases in tax rates which should have been imposed by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues last year.  Because of the fact that the rise in taxation is steeper than it would have been if they had done their duty, we have to allow in this year for the fact that there will be a reduction&mdash;perhaps a substantial reduction&mdash;in the amount of tobacco consumed.  Deputy McGilligan's rule of thumb which he applied so unintelligently and, in relation to which Deputy Dillon is now doing likewise, in taking the yield appropriate to the minimum increase in the duty and applying that on a much wider scale is patently absurd.  We have to allow for the fact that if we have in this year to increase the price of tobacco by 6d. instead of by a more moderate sum there will be a tendency for the consumption of tobacco to decrease. That explodes completely the suggestion that I am underestimating the yield from tobacco duty.  I am estimating it as closely as it is possible for any person to estimate it.  I have no desire to underestimate.  I have no desire to overestimate.  With regard to the closing down of these old manufacturing concerns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I said these concerns <Col N="802" /> would be in difficulty, that they could not raise £600,000 on the nail and that those which would be most immediately affected were the smaller Irish-owned concerns.  Therefore, since we were making this unexpected demand upon them, we were prepared to give consideration to their position.  There is nothing unusual in that.  It was done by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>It was done by Deputy McGilligan, perhaps not with the same justification, when Deputy McGilligan proposed to collect 13 months' beer duty inside 12 months. That means that one does not increase the rate of tax, but merely compels the people who are brewing beer to pay 13 months' duty within a 12-month period.  It comes out of their pockets and out of their resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Dillon's heart is now bleeding.  He is weeping crocodile tears for the brewers.  We all know that.  Would the Deputy consider the pangs that rent poor Deputy McGilligan's heart in 1948?  What did Deputy McGilligan say: &ldquo;Oh, you poor brewers, bankrupt and broken, I am screwing 13 months' tax out of you and making you pay that inside 12 months.  I realise that that is getting blood from a stone and that you will be stony broke when I finish and, therefore&rdquo;&mdash;said Deputy McGilligan to Deputy Dillon's friends &mdash;&ldquo;we will allow you to pay that additional month's beer duty in instalments spread over the rest of the year; one month's beer duty will be paid by you in ten instalments over the balance of the year.&rdquo;  That is the concession which Deputy McGilligan made with Deputy Dillon's full consent in the year 1948 to the brewers of Ireland.  When <Col N="803" /> it was permissible to do that in 1948, what objection can there be to a similar consideration to men who are caught in the position in which these tobacco manufacturers were caught, because remember there was this justification, that at least Deputy McGilligan might have argued that he was merely shortening the brewers' credit and still was entitled to collect his beer duty from them as the beer went out. The tobacco, however, on which the excise has been levied had been cleared from bond.  Customs duty had already been paid on it in its unmanufactured state.  If Deputy McGilligan thought fit to extend to the brewers the credit which I have mentioned, why should not we extend a corresponding consideration to the Irish tobacco manufacturers? That is the point at issue.</P>

Why could not the brewers have gone to the banks and got credit then?</P>
      <P>The point which the Deputy has raised is relevant to the discussion, because as I have pointed out&mdash;this brings it home, I hope, to the Deputy &mdash;the reason why the manufacturers were granted an increase in the price of cigarettes was due to the fact that they had increased costs to meet.  They had to finance not merely the excise duty on tobacco which we are imposing on them under Section 13, but also to finance the purchase of tobacco at rising prices.  They have had to replenish their stocks.  The tobacco has to be carried in stock for a considerable time before it becomes manufacturable. The Irish tobacco manufacturers are now in the position in which they have to buy stocks at an appreciating price.</P>

      <P>I was relating the difficulties of the Irish tobacco manufacturers and the consideration which this amendment proposes to extend to them to the question of the devaluation of the pound.  The fact of the matter is that they have been compelled to sell their commodities, and quite justly compelled, on the basis of the tobacco prices which were ruling when they bought their stocks and when the pound was standing at $4.  This is the problem, that the main body of their stocks was bought when the pound was standing at $4.  The stocks of tobacco which they then purchased are now being exhausted, and they have got to replenish them when the pound has depreciated.  That is one of the reasons why the Prices Advisory Body, having had full regard to that consideration, have advised that the tobacco manufacturers should be permitted to increase their ordinary retail prices to the public to the extent to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why this 1d., about which so much play has been made by Deputy Corish and Deputy Dillon, has been granted to them, because after all we did remain tied up with sterling and we were not able to maintain the Irish pound at $4. That is why we just had to follow suit with Great Britain because we were so tied up with the British market, with which Deputy Dillon has been so much concerned.  That is the fundamental factor.  That is one of the reasons why the Irish tobacco manufacturers now have to pay for their stocks in pounds worth only $2.80 each.  These pounds were worth $4 when they bought the great bulk of the stocks, which are now being exhausted.  That is one of the results which followed devaluation, and that is one of the reasons why they had to <Col N="806" /> be granted this increase in the ordinary price of their commodities; that is one of the reasons why they are in these great difficulties, and it is because they are in such great difficulties that we have had to extend this help to them.</P>

      <P>Whatever I agreed to, I am merely putting the responsibility upon the Government which took the decision to devalue the Irish £. Arising out of the unexpected imposition of excise and due to the necessity to replenish stocks using depreciated Irish pounds, it is necessary for this Government to extend to the Irish tobacco manufacturers the same sort of consideration, but not at all on the same wide basis, as our predecessor extended it to the Irish brewers.  There was nothing wrong, in my view, with the concession which was extended to the Irish brewers by Deputy McGilligan and the Coalition Government in 1948, and there is nothing more wrong with the consideration which we are extending to the tobacco manufacturers now.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Minister for Finance towards the wage earners of this country is typified in his approach to this particular amendment.  I distinctly remember listening to the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, speaking at Ferns in my constituency during the last election campaign.  Deputies should have heard his concern, or his alleged concern, then for the wage earners of this country.  It is all the more pathetic when we bear in mind the fact that he was addressing small farmers, road workers and agricultural labourers.  He described to them how the inter-Party Government had seriously depreciated the purchasing power of their wage packet from week to week.  What is his concern in this amendment, in this Budget and in this Finance Bill?  His concern is for the Imperial Tobacco Company.  Last night his concern was for the brewers.  He said last night to Deputy Cowan: &ldquo;If the publicans of Dublin are going to suffer in any way as regards their normal profits, I will be prepared to meet them, provided they are not a political gathering.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>His attitude, as far as surtax-payers were concerned, was that he would not increase surtax in case he would drive the people who ordinarily paid surtax out of the country.  He was not a bit worried that the effect of this Budget would be to drive the ordinary wage earners out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also proposes under this amendment to give a further concession of something between £15,000 and £17,000 to companies who, at the present time, are paying a dividend of 32 per cent., and he tries to justify that action.  How can he make concessions under this Finance Bill of something in the region of £1,000,000 to people like the Imperial Tobacco Company and, under this amendment, make a present of something between £15,000 to £17,000 to companies?  His attitude is: &ldquo;To hell with the fellow who will have to pay more for his cigarettes, and to hell with the people who will have to pay more for their food.&rdquo; The concern of the Minister for Finance and the concern of the <Col N="808" /> Fianna Fáil Party is for the protection of the Imperial Tobacco Company and for the protection of those who are in receipt of incomes ranging from £2,000 upwards.  The whole idea in this particular amendment, and incidentally in the section to which the amendment refers, is to depreciate as far as ever they can, and contrary to what Deputy Cowan thinks, the purchasing power of the wage packet of the workers of this country.  This amendment is designed to do that to an even greater degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In short, this amendment is one designed to extend a moratorium to the tobacco manufacturers of this country.  They appear to be picked out as a class specially deserving of this commiseration from the Legislature of this country.  We have before us the Finance Bill, which picks out another distressed class&mdash;the dance-hall proprietors &mdash; and makes them a gift of £140,000.  This is done in the same year as the State proposes to increase the price of tea, sugar, bread, butter, beer, spirits and tobacco for the unfortunate old-age pensioner. We find the Minister swinging from his generosity towards the dance-hall proprietor to an equal display of generosity towards the tobacco manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no ground upon which the Minister can justify the amendment which he has submitted.  Is it seriously suggested that a company, such as the Imperial Tobacco Company, which was able to pay a dividend recently of 32 per cent. on its capital, has any difficulty in meeting demands which fall on it under this Bill?  Of course they have no difficulty whatever.  To ask the Legislature to pass an amendment of this kind in order to give the Imperial Tobacco Company a measure of generosity of which it has no need whatever is, in my view, an abuse of the powers of the Legislature.  When the Minister pleads that it is necessary that this moratorium, because that is what it is, should be extended to the Irish manufacturers, we are entitled to say to him: &ldquo;If you have brought about this condition of affairs by your Budget, you ought to go to the Irish tobacco manufacturers and tell them to <Col N="809" /> get this money through their normal financiers&mdash;the Irish banks.&rdquo; I see no reason why the Irish banks, having been permitted recently to increase the discount rate by 1 per cent., should not be compelled, as a matter of State policy and in an issue of this kind where the liability is self-liquidating, to advance money in order to enable these otherwise solvent Irish tobacco companies to meet their obligations to the Legislature under the Finance Bill.</P>

Córas Iompair Éireann is not a public authority.  They have got a good scheme as far as their clerical grades are concerned for sickness benefit and, of course, they are safe against unemployment.  It is only necessary to apply the widows' and orphans' part of the insurance to them and this amendment is necessary in order to do that. As far as the other employees of Córas Iompair Éireann, outside the clerical grades, are concerned they will come in under the full scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did consider the matter but actually decided against it because it was either financially or administratively impossible.  What I had in mind was a suggestion by some Deputy that for the widow who is going out you might have a lower age limit than for the widow coming in for the first time. As Deputies are aware, the widow without children does not get a pension unless she is 48 and to reduce that to 45 would be very costly.</P>

The other thing that was suggested was to leave the widow coming in for the first time as she is but to make a concession in the case of a widow, who has been in, whose youngest child reaches 16 and who goes out again.  I believe that would be administratively very difficult unless it was done all round. Therefore, I had to drop the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>She does.  That is true. Of course, there is more than that in it.

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point to the Minister.  Would it not be possible to give the widow the option of continuing to receive her contributory pension when she reaches the age of 70 instead of disqualifying her just because she has reached that age? Obviously when she is 69 she has certain rights, and just because she has reached 70 she finds herself in a <Col N="815" /> different position and that her income is going to be abolished or reduced. Her means would probably be the same at 69 as they will prove to be at the age of 70, when the question of the old age pension arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.  There is no doubt her means would be the same but the point I was making was that it might conceivably happen that a widow was left a lot of money.  She would still draw her contributory pension until 70 but then, when she applied for the old age pension, her means would count.  What the Deputy wants, apparently, is that a woman should draw a contributory pension for life and not stop at 70.  We would have to recast the finances for that purpose because, being a contributory scheme, the contributions would have to be increased.  It is a matter that would require consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned we were dealing with the question of the F.C.A.  In short the approach to the F.C.A. should generally be taken, in my view, on the basis that, firstly, you have to provide the permanent element which is necessary for the efficient functioning of the F.C.A., the <Col N="817" /> Volunteer force, both in peacetime conditions and under emergency conditions. We have gone into some detail on that but that is the first necessity. Having provided that, in regard to the force itself, we must realise that this force is of very great importance and something more than a mere auxiliary to the other elements of the Defence Forces.  It is not to be regarded as a mere auxiliary.  It is to be regarded as an integral and indispensable element of the Defence Forces as a whole should they be called upon to discharge the role for which they are there.  That being so, the approach must be to give that force the facilities which are necessary for making it effective.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, that means a certain demand on the regular forces. The experience in other countries and the experience in this country in regard to the Volunteer force before the last emergency&mdash;and I should say it is the experience with the F.C.A. since the emergency&mdash;is that unless you provide an adequate number of regular officers, N.C.O.s and men for training purposes you will not be able to get the efficient force which is needed.  With the best will in the world and with all the enthusiasm you have got in the Volunteer force it will still be unable to run itself unless these administrative and training facilities are provided.  In fact, if these facilities are not provided, the impossibility for the part-time volunteers of catering for all the problems which arise both in administration and training, coupled with the feeling that they are neglected, is bound to have an adverse effect on morale; that in turn will have an adverse effect on numbers, and that will have an adverse effect on training and interest in the activities of the force.  For that reason, therefore, the Minister has to consider the problem on the basis that he will have to provide a certain number of officers, N.C.O.s and men for this task, and the requirements will be considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war certain provisions were made, but in the light of experience they were completely inadequate for running a Volunteer force.  Towards the end of 1948 in the Dublin units of the Volunteer force the conclusion was reached that to each <Col N="818" /> battalion of that Volunteer force you would not only have to allot, whole-time, a certain number of regular personnel, but that you would probably have to allot in addition a certain number of instructors whole-time to the companies of that battalion.  During the emergency, when calls on personnel were very great and personnel could hardly be afforded, we had the same experience: it was necessary to detach a number of whole-time personnel to organise and run the L.D.F., as it then was.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about our defence problem and about the F.C.A., particularly as the F.C.A. is now in the position of supplying a large part of our reserve, we cannot escape from the fact that it will mean a relatively large commitment of regular personnel. Care should be taken to have it appreciated that the mission which officers, N.C.O.s and men seconded to that force are discharging is one of great and primary importance.  An officer or N.C.O. employed on such duty should be made to feel that he is in every way following his profession and will have all the same advantages with regard to promotion and prospects in the Army as if he were serving on a regular staff in a regular unit.  It is probably desirable that there should be a periodic turnover so that all officers and N.C.O.s will have an appreciation of the problems of both the Volunteer force and the Regular Army.  On that basis we can hope to get a great distance with the training of the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which must be considered: How far will the F.C.A. be merely called upon to supply a local home guard and how far will it in effect be needed to discharge a first line job?  We have not thought out that problem and it should be thought out.  The conclusions arrived at in the consideration of that problem will have a large bearing on how the force will be organised and on how regular personnel is to be allotted to it.</P>
    <P>An adequate allocation of training equipment and equipment generally must be made to the F.C.A. within our resources.  If the role of the F.C.A. is to be merely that of a home guard it would probably be sufficient to train <Col N="819" /> them as the L.D.F. were trained during the emergency&mdash;that is, on the basis that they would have only light equipment with some general training so that they could handle any equipment, but under present circumstances in the present set-up it seems likely that this force, in one form or another, will be called upon largely to do a first line job.  In a certain contingency an emergency army might have to be recruited, the members of which would come from the existing F.C.A.  In that situation we would have to do something more in the training of the F.C.A.  The basis of their training must be that they are first line reserve soldiers supplying some first line reserve units; in other words, some of the ideas on which the old Volunteer force was run must be applied to the F.C.A.  Already, during the emergency, that was done with regard to certain city units.  Specialised units and battalions were developed as well as infantry battalions.  Having regard to the problem it is desirable that these men be trained as far as possible on a first line reserve basis rather than on a home guard basis.  That is necessary if we are to rely on the F.C.A. as our reserve.  It is desirable even if the F.C.A. is to be called upon to give whole-time soldiers, as happened during the emergency.  If we are raising an emergency army the more advanced the training provided for them the better, provided that it is done effectively.</P>
    <P>Another element is that one of the difficulties with the volunteer soldier is to avoid monotony.  He wants to know, to experience, to feel, that he is being introduced to as many items as possible in the military field.  One of the ways in which monotony in training can be avoided is to intersperse the routine, basic and essential training in small arms, minor tactics and such things, with a general introduction to more specialised matters and more specialised equipment.  Although from one aspect that training may be a bit vague and may not be sufficient to make the person concerned proficient in specialised matters, it is nevertheless a help.  It helps the <Col N="820" /> soldier to appreciate the problem of combat over a much wider field than his own individual training; it helps him to take an interest, it is a ready means of overcoming monotony and it is something to attract people to attend parades.  With that idea in mind, if the Minister provides training officers with sympathy and imagination to run the force and accommodation is available for them, then, even with the present lack of equipment, it should be possible to make enough equipment available, not only to train the force basically but also to give these interesting interludes sufficiently regularly to avoid monotony in training, to attract people to the force and to keep them interested, which is most important.  It is harder to keep a volunteer active and interested than it is to recruit him.  I believe that it is feasible and the Minister should consider the matter in that light.</P>
    <P>Above all, the volunteer soldier must feel that he is as much a soldier, as important a soldier and as competent a soldier as the man who is whole-time in the Forces and I think we can give him that feeling.  Even though he may never hope to get the mechanical proficiency which we hope from our permanent elements, nevertheless it is a good thing to give him that feeling and it is good for morale. The more we encourage him on that line the more proficient he will become, the more respect he will command from his regular colleagues and the further we will have gone in making the Defence Forces a whole homogeneous body.</P>
    <P>I will finish as I started by again reminding the House that, important as all the other things are, everything depends on a proficient regular force as the nucleus on which everything else must be built, and I do not think that I can stress that point too strongly. For that reason, I have repeated arguments which we have been advancing over a period of years.</P>
    <P>According to the ideas which have been expressed here about guerrilla warfare, we should be content merely with light equipment in the small arms category.  It has also been pointed out &mdash;and indeed with a great deal of <Col N="821" /> truth &mdash; that the securing of heavy equipment in sufficient quantity will be beyond us.  I feel that there is either a certain amount of oversimplification there, or that there is a failure to appreciate other factors in the situation. When dealing with the question of guerrilla warfare yesterday, I tried to make the point that, whereas our forces should be trained in that sense, nevertheless, for the initial stages of hostilities, it is essential to keep them in a position to put up a more conventional resistance than merely guerrilla tactics.</P>
    <P>In connection with this, a question arises with regard to equipment. Certain forms of light artillery, field artillery, armoured fighting vehicles of the type we have and equipment of that nature is essential and will not be completely useless if it comes to guerrilla warfare.  If we are to be in a position to put up an initial resistance to deter an aggressor and to impose on him a delay in time, as I tried to outline last night, such equipment will be needed.  Already we have a certain amount, and even though we might not be able to service that equipment indefinitely &mdash; and that was one of the arguments advanced against having that kind of equipment, that you would run out of ammunition quickly &mdash; I should like to make the counterpoint that, if you have that equipment and a certain amount of ammunition for it, it will make all the difference in that second phase, as I called it yesterday, the phase of organised resistance, in making that resistance reasonably effective for the limited time for which you will hope to put it up on your own. Therefore, it is important that, if we can get equipment in that intermediate class, such as field artillery, we should get it and our troops should be trained in the use of it.</P>
    <P>As regards the other type of equipment, I agree to this extent with the arguments advanced, subject to the remarks I have already made, that we should try to have an adequate quantity of small arms and particularly of mortars which can very frequently discharge the rôle of a field piece and which, in fact, are indispensable if it comes to guerrilla warfare.  Many who <Col N="822" /> took part in guerrilla activities in the days round about 1919 to 1921 will recall the difference it would have made if they had had a small proportion of, say, mortars&mdash;even the old Stokes mortars of that time.  It would have meant that they could have effectively attacked installations and barracks where they were debarred from any effective action for want of such weapons and we do know that at these times efforts were made to improvise such weapons.  I will deal in a moment with the question of improvisation, but we can never improvise an article of that sort in any way that will compare with the standard article.  Therefore, it should be a priority to get as many of that type of weapon as we can.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question of antiarmour. One of the big advantages which any force which would get in against you and one of the big obstacles to any success in guerrilla warfare is the armoured vehicle, and, where guerrilla warfare is concerned, the light armoured vehicle particularly would need something to deal with it.  Again, people who had experience in the days I mentioned will appreciate the weight of what I am saying.  For that reason, the provision of things like anti-tank grenades, anti-tank mines, portable and, if you like, hideable articles, should be a priority.  What is more, these articles are equally essential and important for infantry and other troops operating in the more conventional or regular manner, so that for any phase of our defence activities the provision of such material is essential.</P>
    <P>I would put the provision of such equipment as mortars, anti-tank weapons of a light type and similar articles as the first priority, always assuming that we have an adequate quantity of small arms.  Thereafter, you want a lighter form of equipment, which I think would have been termed heavy by some of the people who spoke, for your forces such as certain field artillery and so forth.  We will leave it to the staff to work out the priorities.</P>
    <P>The point is that if and in so far as we can get such equipment, it should be got and time should not be lost in getting it while it can be got, because, as I mentioned previously, the time <Col N="823" /> factor is uncertain.  Two and a half or three years ago, a number of nations were committing themselves to five-year plans and there were indications that, at the end of that five years' period, the situation might be critical. There is no very great reason for changing that estimate, but we are three years nearer the end of the five years, so that from now on and particularly any time after the next two years, unless there is a radical change in the situation, there is an indication of the need to be prudent.  If we can get in such equipment, we should get it now and carefully make out our priorities in getting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department have been correct in their approach to that, but, in getting that lighter form of equipment, we should not neglect the opportunity of getting such heavier forms as we can get.  They will be essential in one stage of the operations, anyway, and need not be a total loss in any sense.  The argument that suggests, that because you will run out of ammunition eventually, because we do not manufacture it here or even because it is not manufactured, is not as telling as it appears to be at first sight. Fortunately, ammunition of that nature lasts a considerable period of time, as we know.  You can still get ammunition of relatively great age and it is still serviceable.  The important thing is to try to get enough to carry you at least over what I described as &ldquo;the second phase&rdquo; yesterday.  There is another corollary in regard to equipment, the attention to spares.  It is important to get as many spares as you can.  Provided you can get some spares &mdash; I would not say even an adequate supply of spares &mdash; and sufficient ammunition to put up a resistance for a certain length of time anyway, you are justified in purchasing them, in present circumstances, for our defence insurance, notwithstanding the fact that the particular type made, either in the approximate future or even already, has gone out of production and even if you will be denied supplies at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I can take a case in point.  We have certain artillery at the moment from <Col N="824" /> before the war which I think is not being manufactured now and for which ammunition is not being manufactured. Nevertheless, we have in stock sufficient ammunition for that equipment to contribute to the second phase that I mentioned for a considerable period of time and that ammunition will remain serviceable, with care, for a considerable number of years longer. That is to be by no means despised.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is simple.  Let us get that equipment if we can get it.  Let us get it in the greatest quantities that we can get it in.  I think I am safe in saying that, because it is practically impossible to get our requirements.  We should attend to the matter of spares, but we should not be deterred by that argument I have referred to, because on analysis when you relate it to the defence end it is not as weighty as it appears at first to be.</P>
    <P>By the way, when I was talking about this yesterday, a remark was made subsequently, in defence of guerrilla warfare, that if you maintain an ordinary force in peace time they will be bombed out originally and never get deployed.  The answer is that there will be a lot in that argument if we were to contemplate that we were to be attacked for some reason by one other country, that it would be between that country and ourselves, that it would be an isolated war in which we would be on one side and the attacking country on the other.  That possibility is extremely unlikely.  The one we have to consider is the one I mentioned yesterday, where there is interference that is largely incidental to something on a much bigger scale.  In that case you can hope to get time to disperse your force.  When I talked about initial assistance and the Regular Army and what I might call the permanent mobile force, I was not suggesting that you keep them completely concentrated. That is a matter for the Staff, who know how to use them.  The point is to have them immediately available and to be able to put up an organised resistance, as against a guerrilla hit-and-run resistance, where they could be committed definitely and where it <Col N="825" /> will be possible to have them mobilised and dispersed with as much protection for them as for guerrilla elements in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>The question of equipment leads to the question of improvisation, with which I might deal very shortly.  I am all for it and I have advocated it here as far as possible; but let us not be blind to the limitations of the potentialities. Unfortunately, we have not got here the requisite basic industries necessary for improvisation of the type that has been advocated.  Some of us have pleaded for that for a number of years.  I myself have stressed the importance of a basic chemical industry here.  We are talking about defence in the narrow sense, but it must all be conditioned by the broader questions of providing food, organisation for the civil population, and those other big things.  As part of that bigger aspect of defence, I have been advocating here for a number of years the setting up of a basic chemical industry &mdash; related to our basic industry, agriculture.  I do not propose to delay on that now.  If we had got that we would be in a position to improvise in the matter of explosives and even propellants.  Unfortunately, we have not got it.  The amount of improvisation we can do will be very modest, according to our experience during the last war.  We succeeded in being able to produce a certain quantity of second-class demolition explosives.  To produce them took a number of years and it was only at the end of the war that we were in a position to produce that explosive.  In order to do it, it took all the activities of the Emergency Research Bureau, with certain elements in the Army collaborating.  We had to build a factory and make the raw materials and then make the explosives.  These are problems which cannot be solved overnight.  I agree that there is a good deal in the suggestion that we should improvise, but it is more important that if we are going to improvise we should be in a position to do so and it is too late when you want the improvision to have to start to improvise to produce the raw material.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of difficulty that has to be faced.  It goes into a much wider field than I can discuss here on this <Col N="826" /> Estimate, but I have raised it elsewhere. Before the war, we realised the need to have these industries.  In fact Government Departments had got to the stage where they were about to place a contract &mdash; if my memory serves me right &mdash; for a chemical nitration fixation plant.  The plant was to come from Czechoslovakia, but then the crisis in Europe came and it could not be obtained.  There were also proposals for an ammunition factory.  Both fell through when the war came, as it was not possible.  After the war, we might have been able to get some plant &mdash; I do not know &mdash; and some of us have tried to press that these matters be considered, but in fact over the last four or five years they have not been considered.  I am afraid the chances of getting equipment for the necessary factories now are relatively remote.  It would take time and the importation of the equipment necessary for these factories is a very questionable matter now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the small arms factory that has been mentioned, let us not forget there are such questions as that of the steel of a specialised kind, and of brass and chemicals and the handling of chemicals for it.  That cannot be done overnight.  I would like to see a factory set up, but the first requisite is in the industrial sphere, where you can provide the materials for that ammunition factory.  If it can be done, I am all for it, but I am afraid that at this moment the chances of being able to set up an ammunition factory here are not very rosy.</P>
    <P>Improvisation is a good thing where it is necessary, but I think it is a better thing if we can minimise the need for improvisation by preparation.  We can minimise that need in two ways. One is by getting all the standard equipment we can, getting all the right sort.  I think every Deputy in the House would want to do that, and I know the Minister is doing it. Secondly, let us think out now what we might be able to improvise and try to prepare for that improvisation.  I know that during the last war we did try to improvise, but we did relatively little.  It involved setting up a factory to make our own raw materials before we started making weapons at all. <Col N="827" /> Deputy Dillon mentioned the phosphorus incendiary grenade, the Molotov Cocktail.  The fact is that actually in 1941 we in this country knew how to do it.  Just about this time in 1941, as far as the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; is concerned, we were able to do it.  When we examined the problem we found that the real trouble was that we had not the materials.  Starting at that date, we had, first of all, to carry out the preliminary research not on the making of the weapon but on the making of the raw materials.  The Emergency Scientific Research Bureau directed and conducted that work with the help of Army personnel, who were working with them.  That preliminary research on how to make phosphorus and the other components of that incendiary was later followed by a preliminary research on how to make the chlorate for the explosive.  We had to go through the pilot plant stage, and then build a factory for full production.  We made the phosphorus and the other components for the grenades, but we were not in production for a matter of years.  If we were to do that again, the same thing would happen unless we had here an industry which would provide these materials.</P>
    <P>Incidentally it may be of interest to the House to know that that Army factory though, fortunately it was never required to produce material for use in warfare, was actually able to supply the match industry of this country with essential raw materials at a time when supplies of these materials were cut off.  I make that point in some detail for the reason that I think the Minister should consider the question of technical advice.  I think that even the Army itself has not been alive to the necessity for what I will call certain &ldquo;technical planning&rdquo; here.  I think it is time the Minister had somebody to advise him like the way in which he had the advice of the Emergency Scientific Research bureau, where representatives from the Army who had a certain technical training and ability to co-operate on the scientific side, were able to work with the best people in the country who could know these things &mdash; keeping abreast of developments as they then occurred and <Col N="828" /> trying to see how we could, from our own resources, meet the problems which might arise.  I think it would be a good thing for the Department of Defence to have some such advisory body, backed up by a small element in the Defence Force itself, for planning in that particular line.</P>
    <P>During that whole period to which I have referred we had the question, say, of making smoke grenades and where we should make them.  There was the question of making the body of the grenades and getting a firm here to do them.  The making of the grenades at the shops in Inchicore was also a question of time and planning.  If that planning had been done pre-war, production would have been much quicker. We are not asking a great deal when we ask that these problems be examined and a certain amount of blue print work done.  There is no use in saying that you are going to produce an anti-tank grenade comparable with the standard one.  There is the problem of the fuse, of which we are aware.  With our limited resources there are some things which we simply cannot meet but there are other things which we can.  I will content myself, without going into further detail now, by suggesting that the Minister should have that aspect of the matter examined and, in general, the whole question of the technical corps and technical departments in the Army.  I think that is a matter that should get more attention than it has got heretofore, particularly in the light of modern war.</P>
    <P>I have not touched on the broader aspects of defence &mdash; the tie-up with the regional organisation, local government, and so forth.  I dealt with it on previous occasions and our views are on record.  I commend them to the Minister.</P>
    <P>By way of shortening the debate, I should like to say that I was looking through the records of the House for some time past.  I find that, in Volume 110, on the 14th and 15th April, 1948, the Estimate of this Department was under discussion and that, between Ministers who had experience pre-war and during the war, and some of us who had some specialised experience, <Col N="829" /> we have pretty well put on record the history of our experiences in those days.  If any Deputy is interested in learning the facts he will find them there.  In all the controversies that arose in subsequent years on the discussion of this Estimate, these facts were never challenged and were repeated as a challenge.  In Volume 114 there is some interesting information also which arose on the discussion of the Defence Estimate in 1949 and, incidentally, a statement of some of the developments in the world at that time makes rather interesting reading.  In Volume 119 we see that the Defence Forces Bill came up for discussion, and on about the 18th or 19th April, 1950, in Volume 120, there was another comprehensive debate on this subject, during which all these matters were gone into.</P>
    <P>I mention these views now because I should like the Minister, if he can find the time &mdash; I think his staff should be able to find the time &mdash; to go into the points raised by Deputies on both sides of the House in these debates during these years &mdash; debates which were more general and detailed than were customary before the war.  A number of ideas were put forward in these debates &mdash; ideas which should be sifted and which would be important for the future.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence was dealt with in the debates which I have mentioned.  I shall content myself now by pointing out how important civil defence is and how utterly essential to any defence organisation it is to have an adequate civil defence organisation.  It is not atomic bombs that we have to fear in this city or in this country.  A conventional fire raid would be enough to cause as much devastation in this city as any atomic bomb, having regard to the organisation we would have if it came.  Much leeway has to be made up in that respect.  It is time we realised that the planning and organisation of civil defence, particularly in our cities, is a major problem.</P>
    <P>Evacuation, regional organisation, and so forth, have all been discussed in this House on previous occasions. I want to draw attention to the points that were made in other debates on the <Col N="830" /> Defence Estimate and to reiterate that these points are important and urgent &mdash;perhaps more so to-day than at the time they were made.  I will leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion in this House, and in Committee, I discussed and advocated certain views with regard to ex-officers in the service &mdash; taking them back, and so forth.  I want to avoid repetition and I know that the Minister is aware of the case which was put to him by a number of Deputies.  I urge him very strongly to consider what was said in the House, and in Committee, and to consider the representations which were made to him. The question of insurance and pensions in respect of personnel arises on the pensions Estimate.  I think it is best to leave that matter over to the next Estimate.</P>
    <P>With these general remarks I want to repeat, so to speak, all that I have urged on the Minister's predecessors. I want to urge on the present Minister for Defence everything that I urged on the previous Minister for Defence when I was speaking from the bench on which Deputy S. Collins is now sitting. I want to urge it on the present Minister with the same urgency as I urged it on his predecessor.  I do not want to create a scare and there are hopes that war may not come but nevertheless it may come and prudence demands that we should be ready.</P>

      <P>Section 14 enshrines what one may describe as the most obnoxious and disreputable part of this Finance Bill.  In view of the interjected assertions made yesterday by the Minister for Finance, it might be well to preface the discussion on this section by repeating verbatim to the House the letter which appears at column 1473 of the Official Debates of the 3rd April, 1952.  It will be recollected that the Minister yesterday attempted to disown any connection with the dance-hall proprietors.  The letter reads as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have received your letter of May 6th which has been considered by the Fianna Fáil Party Committee.  The committee's view is that the entertainments duty on dances is an undesirable tax.  As to its abolition in the present financial year, however, a decision must necessarily await the detailed examination of the Budget introduced in the Dáil immediately prior to its dissolution, but it would be the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to repeal it as soon as practicable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Lest we offend the ordered susceptibilities of the Minister for Finance, let us revert to the filthy bargain in regard to which the excited but satisfied Miss Morris writes to the ballroom proprietors indicating to them the good fellowship and paternal solicitude of the Fianna Fáil Party, indicating that she wants an immediate response, that the response must be in the shape of financial aid, generous financial aid, and that already one doughty warrior had headed the list with a subscription of £250.  Many more had promised equal and larger sums, and therefore she asks those whom she addresses to subscribe generously to this organisation.  In a Budget imposing a catastrophic burden on the poorer sections of the community she has this one glimmer of relief, this one touch of glory in the abolition of the dance tax.  For what purpose?  The purpose has already been clearly stated since the Minister made the announcement.  The poor dance-hall proprietors do not intend to pass on the relief to the dancing public.  &ldquo;Oh, no, munificent and paternal stepfather, the Fianna Fáil Party has given us an opportunity to reimburse ourselves for coming to their aid by way of a subscription to the Party funds, to reimburse us to the tune of £140,000 per annum, in case there may be any further tribulations before us.&rdquo; Not one halfpenny of the remission in this section goes to anybody but the proprietors of the dance halls, and they have already emphatically indicated that there will be no reduction, good, bad, or indifferent, to the dancing public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Let us go in for the Minister's charming doctrine of estimation; underestimation when it serves the purpose, overestimation when it serves the purpose. But let us take a reasonable mien of estimation, and take it that 140 big dance-hall proprietors are affected.  They get a remission of approximately £1,000 per head per year.  Take that on the basis of even a 5 per cent. contribution to their munificent new stepfather, and you get some idea of how the coffers of the last general election were filled, and how the coffers of the pending election are likely to be filled.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to put on view before the Irish public the completely shady and disreputable background to the removal of this tax. It is a sordid political bargain made at a stage when the Party making it could not conceive their return to office and fulfilled under circumstances that bring public life into a &ldquo;new low&rdquo; of degradation.  On the general Budget resolution, I deliberately quoted verbatim from date to signature all these letters.  In case anybody thought I was trying to twist, misquote or misuse extracts, I quoted them <i>in toto.</i> The Minister has been invited time after time to deny what is revealed in all its naked implications in these letters and he has not been able to do so. <Col N="837" /> But some of the hardy warriors behind him have made excuses and said that the tax was difficult to collect, that it was difficult to do this, that and the other.</P>
      <P>I have adverted before to the fact that in this section the Exchequer is gratuitously throwing away £140,000 which, limited amount as it is, could have gone a long way to satisfy some of the irritating demands that Deputy Breathnach knows about of the old pensioned teachers and that Deputy Colley knows about of the Old I.R.A. men and all the other little pin pricks which have been causing irritation here over the years.  Is there any justification other than a sordid political one, with dance crowds bigger than ever, with the earnings of dance halls bigger than ever, for the remission of this tax?</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour this.  It has already been held forth as one of the most disedifying episodes we have had over a long period.  It is shabby, but it is in harmony with those who conceived the idea of giving the concession. It is a miserable bargain, a sordid bargain.  It is something to which a salutary answer will be given in July, because no matter what difficulties we may have to face&mdash;and the Minister has painted a gloomy enough picture&mdash;there is nobody insane enough to think, in face of that published correspondence, in face of the evasion and the absence of denial, that there is not the smell of political intrigue and graft behind this Section 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will be seriously challenged even by members of the Fianna Fáil Party that this is the toughest Budget this House has seen for the past 30 years.  At one fell blow this Budget imposes new taxes on such staple articles of food as tea, sugar, bread, butter, flour and on such near necessaries as tobacco and beverages, having regard to the pattern of life of our people.  All these additional taxes are being imposed on the plea that it is imperative, that these taxes are indispensable, that they represent the grim economic and fiscal position which the nation has reached and that nothing else but these taxes will rescue the nation from the difficult <Col N="838" /> financial and economic position in which it is to-day.</P>
      <P>That is the plea made by the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the plea for making poor people living below the subsistence line, the under-privileged and the almost submerged classes endure a Budget of this kind.  They are asked to pay more out of their slender resources for tea, sugar, bread, butter and flour because they are told it is necessary that the nation must extract this tribute from their meagre resources in order that the nation may live and enjoy its independence of foreign Powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet in a Budget which demands these sacrifices we set out to give a donation of £1,000,000 to the tobacco manufacturers and we propose to give a gift of £140,000 to dance-hall proprietors.  Let us forget this smelly and indecent correspondence which took place between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Secretary of the Dance-hall Proprietors' Association.  Let us put that aside and not use it for the purpose of this discussion.  Let us judge the Budget on its merits, put on one side the sacrifices it imposes on the masses of the people, many of them living below the subsistence level, and at the same time put on the other side the gift of £140,000 to dance-hall Proprietors. Is there any justification, when we are imposing such heavy burdens on backs quite incapable of bearing them, that we should at the same time give such a substantial gift to a small section of the community who clearly have demonstrated by their assets that they are in no sense in a comparable position with the masses of the people who will be asked to bear heavy burdens under this Budget?  I saw a large dance-hall last week, outside which there was a mile and a half of motor cars, bumper to bumper.  I made inquiries apropos this tax.  I asked how many people patronised that dance-hall.  I was told by people who had an interest in the hall that in the winter season the crowd is not as great as it is in the summer season.  I was told that they take 2,000 people a night into this ballroom.  When one reckons that up &mdash; 5/-, 7/6 or 10/- a night &mdash; and the auxiliary business that <Col N="839" /> is done in association with a dance-hall &mdash; I think no fair-minded man can avoid coming to the conclusion that dance-hall proprietors are not a needy section of our people, and that in any case they are not first in the queue for economic or financial relief, having regard to what this Budget is doing in relation to large masses of our people.</P>
    <P>We are taxing the old-age pensioner under the Budget.  He has to live on tea, bread, butter and sugar.  Those commodities represent meat and fish for him as well as bread and tea and butter and sugar.  Tea, bread, butter and sugar are the commodities which he uses at all his meals because his meals in the main consist of these commodities. We will make him pay more and on to his miserable pittance of £1 per week we propose to add 1/6 to compensate him for the increased price of bread, butter, tea, sugar and flour and to compensate him also for the increased cost of tobacco and the increased cost of his bottle of beer or his half-glass of whiskey.  To offset all that he will get 1/6 compensation. Presumably the reason why he cannot get more than 1/6 is because the country cannot afford to give him more than 1/6.</P>
    <P>Does it not seem a vicious contradiction judged merely on the level of equity that we cannot give more than 18 pence per week compensation to an old-age pensioner while at the same time we can give a gift of £140,000 per year to the dance-hall proprietors?  Is there any equity in that?  Is there any element of fair play?  Is there any attempt to reconcile the ideologícal factors which operate throughout the Budget when we grind down the masses of the people by compelling them to pay higher prices for foodstuffs and at the same time pick out the tobacco manufacturer and the dance-hall proprietor for reliefs &mdash; reliefs which the dance-hall proprietor class never dreamt it would get under this legislation?</P>
    <P>I want to argue this on the basis of levels.  There is a smell about these levels that I do not like.  Probably there is an explanation for this provision exempting dance-hall proprietors from entertainment tax under this <Col N="840" /> Finance Bill and under the Budget. Will some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies tell the House and the country why in a Budget that makes the masses of the people pay more for their food we should give a gift of £140,000 to the dance-hall proprietors?  There is no sense of equity in a Budget which gives a gift of that dimension to dance halls while at the same time compelling unfortunate old age pensioners and other submerged, or partially submerged, classes to bear the burden of the impact which this Budget will have on their simple domestic lives.  Is it fair to expect the poor old age pensioner to be compensated by throwing him 18 pence for seven days, less than threepence a day?  Is it fair to say to him: &ldquo;There is your threepence; that is your compensation now for the fact that tea, bread, butter, sugar, tobacco and beer have gone up in price; there is your threepence; you cannot get any more than threepence under this legislation; you cannot get any more than threepence from this Government because this Government wants to give a gift to the tobacco manufacturers and the dance-hall proprietors?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is an outrageous concept of justice that in a Finance Bill which is imposing the toughest burden our people have had to bend their backs to bear for the past 30 years we should select the dance-hall proprietors as an object of compassion in a House which, apparently, if it passes this Bill, has nothing but a shocking disregard for the sufferings that many people will endure if this Bill is put through in its present form.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy Norton speaking and I think his language was worthy of a better subject.  We are discussing here the removal of the tax on dancing.  Considerable play has been made by Deputy S. Collins and others with a document which, apparently, was circulated by some secretary of an association of dance-hall proprietors.  One would think that at the last general election the question of the views of the majority of the members of this House was in some doubt.  This tax was reimposed in 1948 by Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>At that time there was considerable opposition to it. There was strong opposition from the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. There was strong opposition from the members of Clann na Poblachta.  In 1950 it again came before Dáil Éireann and it was debated at considerable length on two amendments, one tabled by Deputy Aiken and the other by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was a member of Clann na Poblachta.  Deputy Davin, a member of the Labour Party, expressed very specific views in relation to this tax. He referred to it as an unpopular and irritating type of tax.  At column 1691 of Volume 121 of the Official Report he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I opposed this unpopular and irritating type of tax when it was originally imposed by Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government. I argued in favour of its abolition last year because it was, like every new tax which was imposed, unpopular, and because I thought it was a very irritating type of tax in the way I know it to be administered in some parts of the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin proceeded to discuss the question at some length, but eventually he voted for the continuance of the tax.</P>

      <P>I put a completely different point of view.  In fact, I supported Deputy Fitzpatrick on an alternative form of tax which I suggested. In 1949 and 1950 the question of this tax was a live issue in this House.  It was debated at length in both these years.  Many Deputies here received deputations representing dance-hall proprietors, musicians, and representatives of workers engaged in the dance-halls.  It was brought home very clearly to us, and we so put it to the Minister, that the continuance of the tax meant less employment in the dance-halls because dancing is, to a <Col N="842" /> large extent in our cities and, anyway, in our big towns, an industry.  One cannot get away from that.  There are quite a number of people employed in and about dance-halls.  One may laugh at that.</P>

It has been removed, and we are now giving the legislative approval to that removal. In 1949 and in 1950 many Deputies in this House, for many reasons, opposed the tax.  The tax amounts to approximately £100,000.</P>

      <P>The tax amounts to £140,000.  I am perfectly certain that we would have heard the same criticisms of the Minister if he put on that tax as we are now hearing because he took it off.  The tax was originally imposed in 1939.  I did not bother to go back as far as that date, but I am perfectly certain it was violently opposed then by Deputies in this House.  It was removed, I think, in 1946, and there was a sigh of relief. Now, however, the case is being made that if that tax were retained old age pensioners could be paid an increase and that the Old I.R.A. could be paid an increase.  That is the point Deputy O'Higgins made, and there is no sense in it; that £100,000 could not increase old age pensions.</P>

      <P>As I said, this tax was imposed in parts of the country only and, in addition, it was evaded in many areas.  It was a tax which resulted in the loss of employment by musicians and by staff employed in dance halls.  As Deputy Davin said, it was an irritating tax, and that was also the view of everybody else.  There is something unfair about an irritating tax which only affects part of the country.  Would Deputy Dillon tell us where is the fairness or the equity in a tax applicable to a dance held in a place with a population of 501 persons, which does not apply to a place having a population of 499 persons.</P>

      <P>I would not like to prevent Deputy Dillon from repeating the speech which he made yesterday.  I know he is anxious to get going on it and to read again this letter which we have heard read so often in the course of this debate. However, I feel that if Deputies looked on this tax in the way it should be regarded&mdash;from the point of view of equity&mdash;they would be satisfied that it should be removed.  If they looked at it from the point of view that it caused unemployment, that it led to evasion and that it caused people to break the law in many parts of the country, they would agree with its removal.</P>
      <P>I know a number of clubs and organisations in Dublin that run dances once or twice a year, usually for two purposes, one as a social venture for their own members and the second as a means of raising funds for an athletic club, a football club or for some such purpose.</P>

      <P>As I said above, clubs here in Dublin run dances once or twice a year for two purposes; they run a dance as a social venture for their members.  They run another dance for the purpose of raising funds &mdash;in other words, a local dance open to anybody who wishes to pay.  This dance served two purposes.  However, it is found that when the cost of the dance hall, the band and the tax is paid, that there is nothing left for the funds of the club.  That is the experience of people endeavouring to run dances for the purpose of maintaining hurling, football and athletic clubs and even to help cut political organisations. Every Deputy in this House was aware that the person who is standing at the door of a dance hall with a bundle of tax tickets in his hand is very careful, where he is trying to make a few pounds, about the people to whom he gives tax tickets.  That is happening everywhere, and there is no use in one trying to conceal the fact.</P>

      <P>It is happening everywhere where the dance tax is in operation.  Those members of a club or an organisation who are running a dance are very careful with the tax tickets; they do not give them all out, but they retain some of them and have a particular excuse ready if some official from the Department of Finance or from the Revenue Department comes in to inspect the place.  Does anyone suggest that this is a desirable practice?  It is anything but desirable. Clubs have been put into that position so as to maintain their own little organisations.  This practice has been <Col N="848" /> adopted by political organisations, by athletic organisations, by football clubs and by hurling clubs and by all other kinds of organisations.  I maintain that a dance tax that has that result is a bad tax from the point of view of the country.  I maintain that, if it cannot be enforced 100 per cent., it should be removed altogether.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Parliament must take note of these things.  It takes over £100,000,000 to run the State, and the dance tax brings in about £100,000 or £140,000.  Are we to have that state of immorality brought about for the sake of £100,000 or £140,000?  I think it is time that we ought to look straight at these matters.  It is time that politicians should give up creating trouble because their opponents happened to get a subscription for election purposes. Any political Party that refuses a subscription certainly would be entitled to condemn the dance-hall proprietors or anybody else for contributing to a political Party, but it is only if they refuse to accept subscriptions to the political fund they can adopt that particular attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to quite a number of people in the city in regard to that. Very few people are being codded with all this nonsense and with all the fulminations that we have had from Deputy Collins, who was repeating, in a different key, the words of Deputy Dillon.  These fulminations had no effect on the people, and particularly on the thousands of people who are engaged night after night in endeavouring to run dances for the purposes I have mentioned.  The removal of the dance tax is generally welcome, as it would have been welcomed in 1949 and <Col N="849" /> 1950 had we been successful in inducing the Minister to remove it.  It was a bad tax.  It was, as Deputy Davin described it, an irritating tax, and it is a great job it is gone now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had extraordinary arguments in favour of the removal of this tax.  With some of the arguments which Deputy Cowan mentioned I think there would be universal agreement.  Any tax is unpopular and there are a number of taxes which are irritating but surely the question which concerns the Dáil and the country on this occasion is whether it is fair, just or reasonable to remove a tax on dance halls under a Budget which proposes substantial increases in the prices of essential foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Nobody for a moment suggests that essential services should not be carried on, that the money required to pay for these services should not be raised, that the money for the Army, Garda and Civil Service, and that whole variety of expenditure by the different Departments should not be met. Revenue must be raised to meet the commitments involved.  In this Budget of over £100,000,000 a sum of £140,000 is not a substantial tax.  A strong case can be made on the basis that it was difficult to collect, that there was to some extent an evasion, that it imposed trouble on those responsible for running dances, that it was irritating, and a variety of other arguments in favour of its abolition, but do not the same arguments apply to income-tax?  With few exceptions, such as in the case of road tax, and probably taxes in respect of spirit licences and taxes collected at source, there is evasion.  One of the responsibilities and functions of the officers of the Revenue Commissioners is to stop that evasion and to make tax collections as effective as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the returns show, the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners indicate that the revenue derived from the dance tax was on the increase. That shows it was possible to collect it to an increasing extent.  It shows equally that the alleged effect of that tax on the dance-hall industry was not jeopardising that industry and did not jeopardise the employment of those concerned in it.  If it did jeopardise it <Col N="850" /> I would like to inquire what effect the increase in the present Budget in the price of beer and tobacco would have. The Minister waxed eloquent on the effect on the tobacco companies of the suggestion that they should not be allowed to get every farthing of the increase that was recommended by the Prices Advisory Body and the effect it would have on employment.  In the case of the dance-hall proprietors this tax will not be remitted to the public. The public will not get the benefit of the remission of the £140,000.  That will be put in the hands of the dance-hall proprietors.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone seriously suggests that the amount of money involved in the remission of this dance-hall tax is large in comparison with the Budget as a whole.  We do not agree with the views that have been expressed here that people are not deceived.  People are bewildered by the fact that in this Budget the price of petrol, which is used by a variety of people, including traders, business men, commercial travellers and by transport users of all kinds for business and trading purposes, is going up by 4d. per gallon, the price of the print by 3d., the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 7d., the price of tea by more than 100 per cent., the price of sugar by 2½d. per lb., the price of butter by 10d., the price of flour by 2½d. per stone and the price of the 2 lb. loaf by 2½d.</P>
    <P>All these taxes affect, without exception, all citizens, most of them directly.  Those that do not affect every individual directly affect him indirectly.  Bread will be dearer.  The essentials of life will cost more and yet it is decided in the Budget to make one extraordinary remission in taxation of something like £140,000 to the dance-hall proprietors.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can seriously suggest that it is sound economy, or that it is good national economy or even sound public finance to increase the prices of a variety of essential foodstuffs, of a whole range of near essentials and increase the cost of transport, in a Budget, which this Finance Bill implements and which remits a tax on dancing of £140,000. When the Táiniste was speaking here <Col N="851" /> on the day after the Budget he said, at column 1301, Volume 130, No. 9 of the Official Debates of 3rd April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear, however, that the abolition of rationing means that subsidised flour&mdash;flour subsidised at the new rate&mdash;will be available for the producers of fancy bread and biscuits who are now paying an uneconomically high price for the 75 per cent. extraction flour; and therefore some reduction in the price of biscuits and other foodstuffs produced from the 75 per cent. extraction flour is to be anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in the same volume at column 1305, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, there will come into operation, almost simultaneously, a substantial reduction in the price of jam, marmalades and other manufactured foodstuffs in which sugar is an ingredient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is an astonishing fact that this Budget will have as a direct result the effect of increasing the price of bread to the consumer, the price of butter, the price of flour, the price of tea and the price of sugar; in other words, the essentials of life will increase substantially in price.  But under the same Budget jam, cakes, marmalades, biscuits and any commodities manufactured from sugar will be reduced in price; and under the same Budget it is proposed to remit the tax on dance halls.  I do not think anybody seriously suggests that this tax remission is justified.  It has been alleged that the Opposition has made a lot out of a small amount of money in relation to the whole Budget.  As far as that is concerned the amount of money involved is not the important aspect of this question.  Leaving aside entirely this letter about which there has been so much talk and to which reference has been made, I believe the important and serious aspect of this alteration in the tax rate is that it is made in a Budget which imposes substantial increases in the price of essential foodstuffs&mdash;substantial increases in the price of petrol, tobacco, in the price of a whole variety of commodities, but which also remits the tax on dance-halls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> It is easy to say that the tax is unpopular. It is easy to say that it is difficult to collect.  Reference has been made here to past debates on previous Budgets when appeals were made to have this tax remitted but those making these references have omitted to point out that in these Budgets there was no increase imposed on the price of bread; there was no increase in the price of butter; there was no increase in the price of sugar, of tea, or of flour. As a result of this Budget substantial increases in the price of these commodities will occur.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone for a moment believes the suggestion that this tax remission will mean a sudden revival in employment.  The effect of the impact of Fianna Fáil government in the last 12 months has been to drive up the number of unemployed to such an extent that there are now 13,000 persons more unemployed than there were this time last year.  Some Deputy, I think it was Deputy Captain Cowan, suggested that this is going to have an effect on employment.  I do not think even the most ardent advocate of the remission of this tax will make that case for it.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside altogether the question of the undertaking which was given prior to the election by the present Tánaiste on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I think that the fact that this tax is being remitted has bewildered, confused and angered people, particularly people who were obliged to pay and will be obliged to pay substantially increased prices for essential foodstuffs.  This tax, it retained, could increase by 25 per cent. the pensions of the Old I.R.A.  They are only one section of the community that will be hit by these increases in the price of essential foodstuffs, and remember, this is part of the confidence trick that was played on the electorate by Fianna Fáil.  In two speeches during the last election campaign two Ministers of the present Government said that there was no truth in the suggestion that the taxes relating to beer and tobacco would be reimposed, and at point 15 of the pamphlet containing the 17-point programme published in the <i>Press</i> on the 5th June after the result of the election, <Col N="853" /> it was stated that one of the points in the Fianna Fáil policy would be to maintain subsidies, to control the price of essential foodstuffs, and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.</P>
    <P>That was part of the Fianna Fáil programme which succeeded in deluding some of the electorate.  That was part of the programme that was designed to secure the reins of government on the basis of misleading either the electorate or some of the Deputies who subsequently supported it.  That is the programme which has resulted in substantial depression in trade, a Budget which imposes increased income-tax, increased prices by the withdrawal or the variation of subsidy, increased taxes on petrol, on tobacco, on beer and on spirits, but it remits the dance tax because there was an undertaking given during the election that it would be remitted if Fianna Fáil were returned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to ask people to pay more for bread, to pay more for flour, for butter, for tea and sugar, to expect them to pay more if they want to smoke the same number of cigarettes, to expect them to pay more for a pint of beer or stout, to expect petrol users to pay 4d. a gallon more for petrol, to ask income-tax payers to pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a shilling in the £ more.  The increased revenue which will be derived this year from the variation in the rate of income-tax amounts to £910,000 more than the figure which was secured last year.  If this is less money, then the Minister will have to explain it again.  I do not understand the effect of a tax which results in gathering in almost £1,000,000 to the Exchequer over that which was gathered in last year and which was put before the Dáil on the basis that less income-tax will be gathered this year than was gathered last year.  The fact is that the people of this country, old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind pensioners, Old I.R.A. pensioners, every citizen, <Col N="854" /> whether he works for the State, whether he has retired as a pensioner, whether he is at present endeavouring to secure a wage increase by application before the Labour Court, whether he is a member of a trade union, whether he is self-employed or employed in business, in trade or in commerce, whether he is a farmer or a farm worker, he is going to pay more for bread, for flour, for tea, sugar, butter, beer, cigarettes and petrol, and if he is an income-tax payer, more on income-tax.  But if he wants to dance at night he will not get the benefit of the dance tax remission..  Remember, nobody should be deluded into thinking that people are going to be allowed even to dance more cheaply, because they are not.  The fact is that the dance-hall proprietors, under some preelection arrangement which was not made public until after the election, will be allowed to put into their pockets a sum of £140,000.  It is a small sum; in relation to the size of this Budget it is a comparatively small figure.</P>
      <P>What the public do not understand, however, what those Old I.R.A. pensioners who are seeking an increase and what all sections of the community fail to appreciate, is why this remission amounting to £140,000 is being given to the dance-hall proprietors under a Budget which raises the prices of essential foodstuffs, which imposes increased burdens on all sections and which in no way seeks to alleviate these increased hardships.  I do not think that anybody can seriously suggest that the increase of 1/6 a week to the old age pensioners&mdash;and God knows they were entitled to it and needed it badly&mdash;will offset the rise in the price of bread, tea, sugar and flour and, if they they smoke, of tobacco and, if they drink, of beer and spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies often forget that there had already been a substantial rise in the cost of living since this time last year long before the present Budget was introduced.  There was an increase in the cost of essential foodstuffs&mdash;butter, bacon, meat and eggs.  In addition, there was an increase in transport charges for people travelling on buses and an increase in freight charges.  It <Col N="855" /> is in respect of these increases that negotiations and discussions are at present proceeding between the Trade Union Congresses and the representatives of employers regarding an increase in wages.  That increase is needed to meet the rise which has already occurred not to mention, not even to think of, the rapid increase which will take effect on the 4th July, when the full impact of this Budget is felt.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the slight increase in children's allowances and the old age pension will meet the rise in the cost of living.  All of these are welcome and all of them are necessary to offset the increases which had already occurred since this time last year.  Remember that this is the Government which was to maintain subsidies, control the price of essential foodstuffs and operate an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.  Deputies are familiar with the speech of the present Minister for Finance during the recent election in which he said that a number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading the rumour that Fianna Fáil if they were returned to power would reimpose the taxes on drink which had been imposed in the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  &ldquo;There is no truth in any such rumour,&rdquo; he added.  That speech was made at Rathmines and was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 5th May, 1951.  The present Tánaiste referred to a Coalition Minister who had made a speech saying that Fianna Fáil if returned would impose these taxes and asked why should these taxes be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>What confidence can the electorate have in the speeches of public men when they saw how during the election campaign they were misled and deluded by them in dishonest speeches when they were seeking the votes of the public?  &ldquo;There is no truth in any such rumour.&rdquo; How wise were the publicans, how right they <Col N="856" /> were, how accurate they were in their prognostications of what would happen on the return of Fianna Fáil.  During the election campaign Fianna Fáil did not publish the correspondence into which they had entered behind the backs of the electorate with the dance-hall proprietors.  They announced that they would maintain subsidies but the effect of the alterations proposed in the Budget will be to increase the price of bread, flour, butter, tea and sugar, although jams, cakes, biscuits, marmalade and any other commodity manufactured from sugar will be cheaper.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that this Budget and this tax remission in Section 14 of the Finance Bill should be passed by the House.  It is astonishing that the case should be made for that remission that the tax was unpopular and irritating.  Nobody on this side of the House questions that description of this tax or denies that in relation to the Budget as a whole it is a small sum, but it must be considered in the light of a Budget which increases the price of bread, tea, flour, sugar, and a whole range of essential foodstuffs for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and every section of the community, a Budget which increases income-tax by 1/- in the £ and petrol by 4d.  It must be considered in the light of a policy which has already succeeded in increasing the number of unemployed by over 13,000 persons since this time last year.  It must be considered in the light of a Government which has already witnessed an increase in the price of milk, bacon, eggs and beef, as well as the cost of transport, in the last 12 months to such an extent that trade union organisations are forced at present to seek an interim increase in wages in order to put into the pockets of workers, wage earners and those responsible for maintaining households some compensation for the depreciation in the value of money.  When considered in the light of these things the remission is suggestive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that in opposing this remission the Opposition are irresponsible, bluffing and doing something for political purposes which we would not do for economic purposes. No question of economy, justice or fair <Col N="857" /> play has so far been brought before the House or the country to justify an increase in the price of bread, sugar or flour, cigarettes, petrol or income-tax. Income-tax is, to some extent, a difficult tax to collect and the Revenue Commissioners from time to time find evasions of that tax.  Almost every tax, with few exceptions, presents difficulties of collection from time to time. The problem of these evasions and collecting the tax is a responsibility which the Revenue Commissioners discharge. The dance tax, however, has been represented as one which was evaded and was unpopular with dance-hall proprietors and those responsible for running dances.  Nobody should be under any delusion that this will mean cheaper dances because it will not mean a reduction in the charge of admission.  Even if it did, why should the House pass a Budget which remits the price of dancing when it increases the price of essential foodstuffs over and above the substantial increase in the cost of living which had already occurred during the past 12 months?</P>
    <P>I do not think that any real case has been made for the remission of this tax.  I do not think that there is any equity, any justice in a Budget which seeks to remit a tax on dances which in itself is not a very substantial amount of money in relation to the total sum covered by the Budget.  It cannot be justified on the grounds that the section of the community it might benefit are as badly off or as much in need of subsidy from the Exchequer as those sections of the community whose subsidies are varied and decreased in respect of bread and eliminated in respect of tea, butter and sugar.  Every wage earner, every individual in the community, will be obliged to pay more for all these essential commodities.  I have put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for answer next week to try to elicit what reduction will take place in the price of jams, chocolates and sweets.</P>

I do not think any real case has been made for the remission of this tax, and I do not think there is any justice in remitting it when the Budget inflicts hardship, misery, difficulties and increased burdens on every section of the community. There could have been a case, and probably was, for remitting this tax in previous years, when we were maintaining foodstuffs at the same price, when beer, tobacco and all these other commodities were being retained at the existing level.  There was some case to be made then for a remission of this dance tax, but there is no justification in a Budget which increases the burdens on each and every section and on every individual for remitting a tax in respect of dances which will not effect any reduction in the imposts being borne by all sections.</P>

If it had not been for the fact that Deputy McGilligan and the Coalition ran away from their Budget and fled to the country, we should have objected to it again in 1951.  Therefore, as I have said, when Deputy Lemass, as he then was, and Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, informed the secretary of the association representing the dance-hall proprietors who had approached him on the matter that we were consistent, the Deputy is not surely going to charge us with any impropriety, because we are consistent and always have been consistent in our attitude towards this tax.</P>

It is quite the ordinary <Col N="860" /> thing for organisations and individuals who feel that their interests can be improved to approach political parties and candidates and ask them to state their views and what they propose to do.

      <P>Fine Gael was not the only organisation which had disinterested support of that sort.  I happen to have in my possession a copy of a letter written by a certain gentleman enclosing a copy of another letter written by a former Minister of this State and a present Deputy.  In the course of that letter, the then candidate at the general election of 1948. and subsequently Minister for External Affairs and present Deputy, gave certain assurances in regard to the entertainments duty on dog racing and in regard to the establishment of totalisators on dog racing tracks.  As a consequence of that letter which he wrote to &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; and which he signed &ldquo;Sean MacBride&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; wrote a letter to his friend in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" />&ldquo;I am enclosing a statement of policy as affecting the greyhound industry which I have obtained from Mr. Seán MacBride, Clann na Poblachta leader, in reply to a questionnaire addressed to him.  It is a very logical exposition of the position as affecting the industry. In addition to obtaining funds, I consider it the duty of every greyhound owner, and a good investment, to support this man's policy by sending me a subscription which will be duly acknowledged by his headquarters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was there anything corrupt in this little transaction between Deputy Seán MacBride, ex-Minister for External Affairs and &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo;? Was there anything politically corrupt in it?  Was there anything politically corrupt, so corrupt that &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; regarded a subscription to Clann na Poblachta as a very good investment ?

Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, set up subsequently a committee to inquire into greyhound racing in this country and one of the matters which was to be investigated was the advisability of establishing totalisators on greyhound racing courses.

Who moved Deputy MacBride?  Was it &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; who moved him to induce his dear friend and colleague in the Coalition, the Minister for Agriculture, to set up this committee?  You see, Deputy MacBride as he then was&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr. Seán MacBride, as he was then only a candidate at the general election of 1948&mdash;had assured &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; that if he was returned to power and sufficiently influential, apparently licences to establish totalisators would be granted to the proprietors of the greyhound racing tracks and the entertainments tax upon dog racing would have gone into the pockets of the same individuals.</P>

At the time of an election, every Party receives all sorts of communications and requests asking their attitude towards this problem and the other problem and you get subscriptions from various sources.  Some people organise themselves into groups and go out to get subscriptions.  Nobody will tell me, for instance, that the Fine Gael Party and the Clann na Poblachta Party did not, in the General Election of 1948 secure very generous <Col N="867" /> subscriptions from the licensed trade in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cowan pointed out to this House this afternoon, Fianna Fáil have had a consistent policy in regard to the dance tax.  Secondly, there is nothing unusual in the fact that political Parties are asked to express their policy in regard to one or other public issues or even in regard to things which are not public issues in the wide general sense but which affect particular sections of the community.  Further, it is not unusual, if acceptable assurances are given, for the persons who feel that their interests will be promoted by a certain Party to come along and give it the material and public support which will be necessary in order to secure the election of that Party.  These are commonplaces of politics.  There is no use in Deputy Dillon's holding his nose as if there were something indecent, corrupt or wrong with it.  It just happens.  Everybody knows that it happens in that way.  However, they do not have a corrupt influence, at any rate, so far as the attitude of Governments in this country is concerned.  I assume that we try to administer the affairs of this country decently and honestly.  The one thing that does, perhaps, deter us&mdash;and we have had an example of that in the Budget of 1951 &mdash;is the fact that we hate to do an unpopular thing.  Therefore, even though our advisers give us impeccable advice &mdash;as Deputy McGilligan was given it <Col N="869" /> in 1951&mdash;that several millions more might be required and that the only way of getting it is to increase the taxes on beer, spirits, petrol and tobacco, these are things which we do not like to do.  Sometimes, again, as happened in May, 1951, we are not prepared to face up to our obligations and responsibilities in that regard. Otherwise, outside that, I do not think political Parties are influenced very much by subscriptions which they get. In the main, these subscriptions come from people who are sympathetic to the broad policies expressed by these Parties and who are anxious to see these policies made effective.  Therefore, without looking for any special return, they are prepared to support us.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the dance tax, on its merits, and having disposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Ah!  Deputy Dillon, I think on Section 6 of this Bill, opened the matter by referring to this letter. He was told by the Ceann Comhairle that he could more properly raise that issue on Section 14, and it was on Section 14 that the issue was raised by Deputy S. Collins, who opened the debate for the Opposition.  The debate was continued on the same lines by a very suggestive speech by Deputy Norton.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the letter was not an issue.&rdquo; He kept repeating it time and time again&mdash;and all the time he was making it an issue.  We had the same performance from Deputy Cosgrave.  I have no doubt that if I had not got up, and if Deputy Dillon had got up before me we should have had from Deputy Dillon for the third time to-day a speech referring to that letter.  Having, as I said, shown that there has been nothing unusual in regard to the letter, that the transaction was perfectly plain and open, I <Col N="870" /> have only to repeat what I said yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement to this effect&mdash;given in certain terms&mdash;that we were making no promise; we would consider the situation as we found it, but pointing out that we had in 1946 removed the tax and, in 1949, opposed the re-imposition of the tax, and again opposed the continuance of the tax in 1950.  That was the general terms of the letter.  I have not it in front of me.  Arising out of that letter, this lady, at the instance, I assume, of the former&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I know I have to ask for a certain amount of consideration.  This proposal is not being considered by the Opposition on its merits.  The suggestion has been that because somebody gave a subscription of £250, we were doing something improper in removing the entertainments tax on dancing.  I am asking is there anything more improper in tendering a subscription of that sort and taking it from the proprietor of a dance-hall than there is in taking a subscription from the proprietor of a greyhoundracing track, having given that proprietor an assurance that if you were returned to power, you would use your influence to secure that the entertainments tax would no longer apply to greyhound racing and that permission would be given for the establishment of the totalisator on greyhound tracks.</P>

      <P>We can now come to discuss the section on its merits.  As I pointed out when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, this dance tax is a complete anomaly.  It is the only form of entertainment the participants in which are taxed.  The people who engage in dancing as a social amusement and have to go to a public hall to do so are taxed for doing that.  If they happen to be professionals, however, and they are dancing on the stage you can go and see them dancing and they are not taxed and you are not taxed.  But if people go to a dance hall in Dublin and take their wives, fiancées or sweethearts, they are taxed even before going in.  If one happens to have a wooden leg and wants to go out in the evening with the rest of a party, wooden leg and all, he is taxed on going into the hall.  If you happen to be an amateur all-in wrestler and you go to Croke Park or anywhere else and throw your opponent about and subject yourself to torture, you will not be taxed.  Anyone who goes to look on will not be taxed either.  If you go to a racemeeting you will not be taxed for going.</P>

      <P>You can reduce any argument to an absurdity.  But surely the onus is on the man who wants things to be taxed to prove that they ought to be taxed.  Is not the onus on Deputy Corish to prove why dancing ought to be taxed, not to oppose the Government who are taking the tax off people?  Surely it is the man who is advocating taxation who must prove that things must be taxed, that you cannot avoid taxing them.  Does not the whole onus lie on those advocating the taxation of anything, whether it be entertainments, amusements, luxuries such as mink coats and Chrysler cars, or beer, spirits or tobacco?</P>

What is happening was referred to by Deputy Norton to-day.  He told us about a dance hall in the country where there were often 2,000 people trying to get in.  I have no objection to people going to dances at the seaside or in the country or anywhere else.  What I do think is undesirable is that they should be attracted a long way from their homes in order to go to these dances and that there should be exceptional cases of persons coming home under the influence of drink late at night who are a menace to themselves and other users of the roads.</P>

      <P>As everybody knows, if a dance is held in a village the population of which does not exceed 500, or is held outside a certain radius from a centre of population of more than 500, it is free of tax.  But the population of this country varies from year to year, and from census to census.  The population of these towns varies from census to census.  It could happen that on the day before a census was taken and enumerated admission to dance halls would be free of tax and on the following day be subject to tax.</P>

      <P>The situation has, in fact, developed that the patrons of a <Col N="883" /> dance hall may be subject to a dance tax one day and may be free from it the next.  The converse may occur; they may be free from it one day and subject to it the next.  Not only that, but one can&mdash;and I pointed this out in my speech on the Second Reading&mdash; hold a dance in a country mansion provided that mansion is three miles from anywhere in the sense that it is three miles from any village.  One can charge 16/- or £1 or 30/- and call it a hunt ball or anything else.  Patrons going there will not be subject to tax.  But if a dance is held in the village and if the village has more than 500 persons in it &mdash;if it has 501 persons in it&mdash;one is immediately subject to tax, irrespective of the admission fee charged.  If patrons are charged 5/- that 5/- is subject to tax.  Is not that a completely illogical situation?  Is it not illogical that a person can go into a country mansion and dance in the ballroom there free of tax provided that mansion is three miles from anywhere in the sense that it is three miles from any centre of population?  A patron may be compelled to pay 30/- or £2&mdash;whatever the proprietor likes to charge for admission to this dance&mdash;and he will not be subject to tax.</P>

What we are trying to do in this section is to prevent an abuse and remedy an anomaly. We realise&mdash;and Deputy McGilligan realised it in 1950&mdash;that there is an anomaly.  We are trying to remedy a completely anomalous and illogical situation, and the only way in which it can be remedied is by reverting to the position that existed after the 1946 Finance Act was passed.</P>

I could not help thinking of the statues of Grattan and Flood and of an Irish Parliament sitting here.

But that is not what happened.

But that is not what the dance-hall proprietors said.  They said that it would be appreciated that this association is entirely non-political.  It was not interested in policy.

      <P>The association has decided that the support of Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is what the Minister has described as a realistic approach in politics,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;should take the form of substantial financial help and also that all members both city and country should lend a hand in every possible direction to secure the return to power of the one Party who has given the association an indication that they as a Party are opposed to this undesirable entertainment tax on dances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That letter is dated the 15th May, 1951.  I ask the House to note the form of words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The association has now no alternative but to support the Party who <Col N="887" /> has indicated that they are prepared to repeal this tax as soon as it is practicable...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say that they are the one Party which has given the association an indication &ldquo;that they as a Party are opposed to this undesirable entertainment tax on dances.&rdquo;  I now ask the House to listen to the letter of Deputy Seán F. Lemass:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have received your letter of May 6th which has been considered by the Fianna Fáil Party Committee. The committee's view is that the entertainments duty on dances is an undesirable tax.  As to its abolition in the present financial year, however, a decision must necessarily await the detailed examination of the Budget introduced in the Dáil immediately prior to its dissolution, but it would be the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to repeal it as soon as necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Miss Morris is not moved by the general tenor of Fianna Fáil policy.  She is moved by the specific words implied by Deputy Seán F. Lemass in his letter, that the entertainments tax on dances is an undesirable tax.  But more is to come.  She says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be appreciated that in order to have the desired effect our financial aid must of necessity be generous.  I may mention that one leading commercial ballroom in Dublin has headed the list of subscribers to this fund with a generous sum of £250 and other members of the executive have also indicated their willingness to subscribe very generously.</P>
    <P>Whilst the association does not specify any particular amount to be subscribed, they request you, in your own interest, to give as much as possible. I shall deem it a great favour if you will reply promptly as time is getting short before the general election, and if we are to help it must be done immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I give this credit to Fianna Fáil that, faced with the duty of defending that transaction before the country, they summoned Deputy Cowan to their aid.  Behold the advocate!  The strain <Col N="888" /> and the pain in the countenances of the criminals in the dock as their resourceful advocate sought to put a gloss upon their conduct reflected some credit on their hardened consciences. They summoned Deputy Cowan to their aid and, to give the devil his due, he followed most dutifully every hare that he thought could be chased, and one hare proved more rheumatic than the other.  As they crept their way around the floor here they met with derisory laughter from all those who were listening, so that the tattered reputation of Fianna Fáil became not only tattered but aromatic.  We were finally forced to this stage: &ldquo;They are a poor lot, a mean lot, but, sure, what do you expect them to be?  After all, they are only T.D.s and you do not expect much of T.D.s in this country.&rdquo;  I say that is typical of the rotten, corrupting and blasting effect which Fianna Fáil have had on everything that they have touched in this country, that it is conceivable that men could get up in Dáil Éireann and say: &ldquo;After all, they are only T.D.s, and what more could you expect from them?&rdquo;  I think we are entitled to expect from members of this Parliament the highest standard of honour and integrity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a monstrous thing if the doctrine is to be enunciated here that there is an obligation on us to equate our standards of conduct with the lowest standard of conduct that Deputy Cowan can think up as practical for any legislator or public representative.

I think the Minister ought to be ashamed to come into this <Col N="889" /> House with the crawling, ghastly alibi: &ldquo;I did nothing worse than others did; somebody else did something queer; I have evidence he did, and so my act is no worse than his.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a contemptible defence.  I want to comment on it not only for the failure of the analogy between what the Minister referred to and his own conduct, but because it is base, humiliating and degrading that an Irish Minister should think it an adequate alibi to say: &ldquo;Why pick on me; they are all at it; if I got money by the way, why pick on me; we all do it?&rdquo;  We do not all do it, and it should not go out to the people in this country that Dáil Éireann accepts the proposition that every political Party goes before them seeking their suffrages and claiming the right to be ruled by a morality entirely distinct from that which should rule the lives of ordinary men and women, and no ordinary man wishes to boast of the fact that he undertook to do something in the course of duty because he received payment for it over and above what he was entitled to get.</P>

The fact is that the report of that inquiry is in the Minister's hands, but he will not publish it.  What the greyhound industry got was an inquiry to examine most exhaustively every turn and twist in the coursing business, the greyhound racing business, the breeding business, and the buying and selling of greyhounds.  Let that report be published, and let legislation coinciding with its recommendations be enacted, and let anyone in this House get up and say that those recommendations were bespoken by people connected with that industry who were in bad faith.  Now compare that with what happened.  They did not ask for an inquiry; they did not ask for any investigation; they asked for cash on the nail, and they said: &ldquo;If you give us so much cash, we will give you so much cash, and they gave the cash.&rdquo;</P>

Is it proper for a vested interest in this country to walk into the executive of a political Party from whose membership the Government is drawn and to strike a bargain and say: &ldquo;We will give you so much money.  How much money will you pass to us through the Finance Act&rdquo;?  I say that is corrupt.  Am I wrong in so saying?  I understand Deputy Cowan to say that that procedure <Col N="891" /> is right.  He is the advocate and the defender of the Fianna Fáil Party who say: &ldquo;If we can sell it to the country and get them to realise that it is the practical thing to do, we may get away with it.&rdquo;  I do not think that Fianna Fáil can hope to effect that degree of degradation.  Our people are no prudes; they are no fraudulent moralists; they know the difference between right and wrong, and they know the standard they expect of their public men; they do not expect them to be angels.  They sent people like Deputy McGrath in here. They expect that even for people like Deputy McGrath there will be certain Rubicons across which they will not venture to put their feet.  They expect that there will be certain standards of conduct from which our public men will not stray.  Our people are very good judges of what conduct should be.

Is that an unfair description of this transaction?  Is there any precedent in the 30 years of life of this Parliament for this Assembly being openly asked to enact legislation to fulfil a bargain sealed with a monetary payment by the vested interests of the political Party from which the present Government is drawn?  Are we to allow this practice to pass as the accepted procedure of Oireachtas Éireann?  There is no other Legislature in the world outside the banana Republics of South America where that could be done and got away with.  Could you imagine what your reactions would be if you read in the newspaper that a proposal was brought before the Congress of the United States of America advocating that money should be appropriated for a vested interest which had paid a substantial sum to the democratic Parties of the United States on condition that they would enact legislation appropriating them a substantial amount of money?</P>

How many speeches has he made about it?  I bet that Deputy Cowan has made the welkin ring at the awful spectacle of corruption that surrounds and permeates the public life of America.  Yet, he is the man who has come before us to-day advocating that we should take this policy to our bosom with both arms and adopt it as the practical standard and the realist's approach to politics in Ireland.  If he thinks there is disintegration in the public life of the United States of America, why does he want it here?  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th June, 1952.</P>
