      <P>I have had an examination made of the supply position of turf in the area referred to by the Deputy.  The result of my inquiries indicates that 85 per cent. of all turf produced for sale in the area had been disposed of at the end of last December. Producers are reluctant to undertake the work of rendering the balance fit for sale until drying conditions improve with the onset of better weather.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Scrap iron represents only a small fraction of the scrap metal used by Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, whilst it is the main raw material for foundries.  I consider that the existing arrangements for the distribution of the available supplies of scrap iron are the most satisfactory to meet the requirements of the different classes of users.  I do not propose, therefore, to adopt the suggestion made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that between 50 and 60 men were laid off recently by Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, and were taken on again after a short interval.  I understand that this interruption of employment was normal and arises from time to time when repairs are carried out on the furnace; on this occasion also the execution of repairs coincided with a temporary reduction in the available supply of raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible that those men were laid off as a result of the absence of scrap iron to carry on the work at Haulbowline?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been directed to a statement made at a recent meeting of the Cork Council of Irish Unions to the effect that a number of firms may have to close down owing to the scarcity of scrap metal, and that scrap metal was <Col N="176" /> being sold elsewhere at illegal prices; and, if so, what action he proposes to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the hardships borne by workers who break down in health through accidents, tuberculosis or other ailments by reason of the issue of medical certificates stating that they are fit for light work; further, if he is aware that such statement on certificates interferes with the payments of allowances under various schemes and also causes reduced payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, whilst at the same time the person concerned is not wanted by employers and cannot secure the light work recommended; and if, in the circumstances, he will introduce proposals for legislation to prevent the issue of such certificates in future and to provide that full payments be granted in every such case until such time as the person is fit for full employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical certificates issued by medical certifiers to persons claming benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts contain no reference to light work.  Occasionally a medical referee may advise that in his opinion a claimant is capable of light work but this does not result in immediate termination of benefit.  If and when national health benefit terminates and the claimant is still fit for light work only, it is usually open to him to apply for benefit or assistance under the Unemployment Insurance Acts or the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
      <P>In so far as workmen's compensation is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, which makes provision for payment of compensation at the full rate in the type of accident case which the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that quite recently in a public board a man broke down in health who had <Col N="180" /> been getting £7 a week and whose pension is now 34/- a week with a certificate of light work?  They could not provide light work and nobody else wants him.  Could the Minister take steps to see that people who are broken down in health will get the full rate of compensation until such time as they are ready to go back to the work they left and for which they have been specially trained?  I have not had any reply from the Minister, as I understand he has been quoting an Act.</P>

He and his wife have been left to continue as best they can on 34/- a week.  I am asking whether the Minister is aware that certificates like that do damage to the persons concerned.

I have therefore no information regarding either the home assistance position or the question of free milk in the case referred to.

      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of annuities collected annually in repayment of advances made by the Land Commission to tenant purchasers varies according as fresh advances are made and existing annuities amortised.  The annuities collectable as at the 2nd gale, 1951, under the Land Acts, 1881-1950, amount to £2,355,745 2s. 4d. per annum, to <Col N="182" /> which might be added a sum of £123,397 10s. 4d. in respect of advances under the Labourers Acts, 1906-1914, the Labourers Act, 1936, and contributions under the Land Reclamation Act, 1949, giving a total of £2,479,142 12s. 8d.</P>
    <P>The period of payment of annuities in respect of advances made by the Land Commission varies in accordance with the financial provisions of the particular Act under which the advances were made.  The periods are approximately as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The periods of payment are further varied in cases where arrears were funded under the Land Act, 1933, and where two or more holdings, in respect of which advances were made, stand consolidated.  Thus the period of payment of any annuity depends on the circumstances of the particular case.</P>
    <P>As advances are still being made it is impossible to estimate the total amount which will ultimately be collected by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The land purchase annuities are, of course, the repayment of advances made to tenants and allottees for the purchase of their holdings and allotments.</P>
    <P>I might add that the benefits conferred on the farming community by the revision provisions of the Land <Col N="183" /> Act, 1933, amount to more than £40,000,000 to date.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, in view of the call made by the Taoiseach and the Government recently for an increased tillage drive, a call with which I am in agreement, he considers that the Department of Lands is setting a good example by holding, as it does at the moment, hundreds of thousands of acres of lands in its possession that are not being used for the purpose of tillage from one year to another.  How does he or the Government hope to have any great success in this drive for which they are calling if land in the possession of the State is not being properly utilised?</P>

      <P>I do not know that it is my province to answer supplementary questions based on such an inaccurate hypothesis as the Deputy's.  Of course, the Land Commission has not hundreds of thousands of acres of land. The total amount of land in the machine at present is some 60,000 acres.</P>

      <P>That is the amount of land in their possession from the time the attention of the Land Commission is originally called to it until it is prepared for scheming and allotment. <Col N="185" /> There is a procedure to be followed as the Deputy knows.  In the case of lands on which it is proposed to place migrants it is often not possible in spite of the best efforts of the inspectors to arrange that the migrants will take up possession in a particular spring.  The question arises of the spring work on two holdings, the holding from which the migrant comes and the holding he is going into.  The general question of letting for grazing is being considered.  I have asked the secretary and inspectorate to take certain steps in the matter.</P>

The inspectors are mainly occupied at this time of the year on resale schemes in order to try to complete as many of these as are so far advanced before the spring period, I am hopeful that the work will be completed fairly early and as soon as the work which he has in hands is completed, the inspector intends to take up this estate.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Government to expedite the relief of congestion and the Land Commission are utilising all practical means at their disposal to secure land for that purpose.  The Land Commission have no power or intention to prevent private sales of land whether to nationals or non-nationals.  The sale of land to a new owner in no way impairs the Land Commission's power to acquire such land for the relief of congestion, should such course prove <Col N="191" /> necessary.  As I informed the House on 11th July last: &ldquo;There is a pretence the Land Commission has some special function in regard to that matter.  As far as the nationality of owners of land is concerned, or their citizenship, the Land Commission has precisely the same rights and can acquire their lands if they are necessary for the relief of congestion and provided the other conditions are fulfilled.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was not possible to make any progress last year with the preparation of a rearrangement scheme for this estate.

There are at least 24,000 holdings that have to be dealt with and possibly 15,000 of these will have to be rearranged.

      <P>No British military personnel have been or are engaged in surveying the coastal defences of this country.  A general topographical and photographic survey of coastal areas has been in progress since November, 1948.  At the request of the Army authorities, certain technical equipment and the services of some technical personnel were obtained from the British authorities to assist the members of the Defence Forces in carrying out this work.  Two British officers and about ten other ranks were made available but these have now been reduced to one officer and two other ranks.  It is anticipated that the field work of the survey will be completed by the summer, after which the remaining British personnel will leave.  The report will be completed by members of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;In addition to the grant allocations shown above a special allocation of £1,000 has been made available in each year to each county council for the execution of works ancillary to operations under the Land Rehabilitation Project.  The special allocation in the case of Cork County Council was £3,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has received requests from the (1) Laoighis, and (2) Offaly County Councils for further grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, to enable both bodies to carry out essential schemes already approved by his Department; further, whether he is aware that 300 men at present employed on such schemes in County Laoighis will be paid off this week unless further grants are made available; and, if so, if he will now state what action he has taken or proposes taking in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility of deciding on the timing of execution of approved works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act rests with each local authority, and the Department has recommended that in planning works sharp fluctuations in employment should be avoided. Laoighis County Council apparently decided, however, that the maximum employment should be afforded for a short period.  In this connection I note that the employment on works under the Act in the four months September to December, 1951, was appreciably higher than that afforded in the corresponding months in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the council's request for <Col N="208" /> further grants for these works I have indicated that the maximum amount which can be made available in the current year, having regard to the amount provided for this service in the Department's Vote, has already been allocated and cannot be increased.</P>
    <P>In the case of Offaly County Council, the grant so far made available for works under the Act is in general sufficient to meet the estimated cost of approved works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware&mdash; I believe he is aware&mdash;that the works that are waiting to be carried out have been approved by his own Department? Am I to understand that there is no more money available for the administration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949?  Is it proposed to suspend the operation of the Act which the Fianna Fáil Party voted against when it was brought into this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the cause of the failure of his Department to sanction the proposals and plans of the Dublin Corporation housing committee to erect a block of 36 flats on <Col N="209" /> the bombed site, North Strand Road, in view of the fact that the flats proposed are urgently needed to house workers engaged in industries in the district including the docks and railways and that the site is one of the few left on the north side of the city that has adequate church, school, shopping and bus facilities adjoining it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs, calculated to the nearest pound, of providing flats of the type proposed on this site would be £1,429 for a two-room flat, £1,972 for a three-room flat and £2,460 for a four-room flat.  Four-roomed houses are being erected a few miles away for about £1,200 a house.  I, therefore, decided, in view of the abnormally high expenditure which would be involved in erecting these flats, that the money would be better spent in building more houses of the ordinary type on other sites.  The corporation was informed to this effect on the 19th December last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the corporation resents very much the attitude of the Government in relation to this particular block of flats for which tenders had been invited and the plans revised on two occasions?  Is the Minister further aware that the site in question is the only available site in the centre of the city for dock workers?  Churches, schools, hospitals and shopping centres are all near at hand and yet the Minister would be willing to sent the prospective tenants&mdash;who are workers in the dock area&mdash;four miles out from their work, with the result that they would have to pay increased bus fares in addition to increased rent.  The corporation are a good and capable body.  They know what they want in Dublin City while, apparently, the Minister's Department do not.  I request the Minister to have the whole matter reconsidered and to permit the corporation to proceed with their splendid housing programme.  Only recently, because of the Department's delay in issuing a sanction, 12 bricklayers were dismissed and had to face emigration.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The discussion between members of the Cork Corporation and officers of my Department who attended a special meeting of the city council on the 11th October last was not in the nature of an inquiry.  It was arranged at the request of the corporation with a view to enabling the views of the members to be ascertained in detail.  There was also an investigation by an inspector of the Department into the labour and building industries potential available for house building in Cork and other related matters.  As a result of the investigation and the discussion with the city council, my Department is in correspondence with the city manager as regards possible improvements in the arrangements for co-ordinating and directing housing activities generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also expect to be soon in a position to issue recommendations to the corporation on various aspects of the planning of future schemes with a view to <Col N="214" /> assisting their efforts to expedite and increase the housing output.  As regards current schemes, I am glad to be able to state that the corporation's progress in house building has shown a considerable improvement on the position as reviewed by Deputies here last summer during the debate on the Estimates.  The number of houses completed in Cork City during the year 1950-51 was 113.  The output for the present financial year is expected to be between 250 and 300 houses.  At the 31st December, 1951, 481 houses were in course of construction and a tender for development of a site for 112 houses had been approved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that in districts along the east coast television broadcasts are being received from another country and whether, in view of the cumulative damaging effect which these broadcasts may have on our national culture, he will take the necessary steps to introduce television broadcasting in the Republic of Ireland with a minimum of delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has so far not given any formal consideration to the question of television, and I cannot say whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have any responsibility for television beyond the control of wave-lengths.  The views I express in the reply are, therefore, based only on general information and not on official study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that British television transmissions are being received in the east coast localities here.  While it would probably be going too far to say that the reception is of a freak nature, general information is that it is indifferent, and I have not heard or read of anybody who claimed to be getting consistent and reliable reception. <Col N="218" /> All parts of this country are certainly outside the normal service area of the nearest British television station.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear to the public that in my view the establishment of television in this country will not be practicable for a number of years.  The cost of providing and maintaining a service for even a relatively small part of the country would be heavy.  The erection of modern broadcasting studios is in any event receiving prior consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that there is a good reception not far away from my own residence and not a freak reception. There are six or seven sets there and they can get a very good reception.  In view of the large number of sets now being sold, will the Minister reconsider the matter?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the <Col N="230" /> price of feeding barley for 1951 may militate against the growing of wheat; and, if so, whether he will state what is or what will be his policy to ensure that this will not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable proportion of the barley of short strawed varieties marketed in 1951 was purchased for seed purposes and this, no doubt, tended to increase the price obtained by growers.  It is to be expected that feeders of live stock will, as far as possible, grow their own requirements of feeding barley in this and future years in replacement of maize.  If considerable quantities in excess of seed requirements are marketed in 1952 the price will necessarily be governed by the prices obtainable for their live stock and live-stock products by those feeders who cannot grow their own requirements of feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>There is an unlimited market for all millable wheat at a price which is higher than has ever been obtainable by farmers in this country and I do not think that the price obtained for feeding barley in 1951 will militate against the growing of wheat this year.</P>

      <P>The number of losses due to the storms and floods about the Christmas time were not large enough, I would say, to warrant such a recommendation.  If there were nationwide losses the possibilities are that the Government would have to come to the assistance of the people who had suffered losses.  In the cases that have been mentioned the losses have been comparatively small.  The live-stock losses in the Milltown area amounted to 26 cattle and two ponies, the property of 11 people.  In the Castlemaine area the losses were 52 cattle, four horses and 12 sheep.  It will be seen from that that the losses were not abnormal.

      <P>I take very great exception to the way in which the Government is treating the House. The Government assembled here this week and put practically no business before the House.  There are 19 motions tabled by private Deputies on the Order Paper, together with five other motions.  The House treated the Government very sympathetically and very leniently inasmuch as they gave the Government a recess of three and a half months in the summer in order to afford the Government an opportunity of preparing its business.  The work <Col N="240" /> done during the autumn put very little strain on the majority of the Ministers. Yet, despite that, we now find ourselves brought here with quite a number of important measures promised by the Government but not put before the House and with very, very little work to be done.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Government that Deputies have arranged their private business in order to attend Parliament this week and to continue their attendance in the future.  A number of very important private motions have been on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  They deal with very important and very urgent matters.  I submit the House should meet next week and, such business as the Government may have having been transacted, the remaining time available on Wednesday and Thursday should be put at the disposal of those Deputies who have private motions on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>On behalf of our Party I would like also to protest against the way in which the Opposition is being treated by the Government. I do not think the country will easily understand why, having been in recess for seven weeks, we should meet here for two days and then adjourn for practically a fortnight when there are so many important matters to be considered.  Apart from the fact there are many important motions tabled in the names of the members of the Opposition, my Party is under the impression that at this stage we ought to be discussing something like the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, that at this stage we might be discussing a mother-and-child scheme that was promised or that we could be considering the abnormal increase in unemployment over the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a particular motion down in the names of Deputies Norton and Larkin and if Dáil Éireann did nothing else next week but discuss unemployment, emigration and the cost of living and if we got a clear statement from the Government as to what their view is and what they propose to do, the country would be relieved or, at least, it would know what the Government's policy is in respect of these three particular <Col N="241" /> difficulties, emigration, unemployment and the cost of living.

A request was made yesterday to the Government for time to discuss a motion tabled by the Leader of the Labour Party dealing with unemployment.  I understood from the attitude of the Tánaiste yesterday that he was willing to give favourable consideration to the question of the discussion of that motion. Would the Government not at this stage decide to allow a day for the discussion of that motion?  I am sure that the Tánaiste and the Government generally appreciate that unemployment has now passed the danger line, with 70,000, which is recognised as a danger signal.  Surely it would be wise if discussion were allowed on these issues now.</P>

Also, some Private Members' business is being disposed of.  It is not unusual to take some time at the beginning of a session in getting business under way.

    <P>With regard to general remarks that Deputies have made about conditions in the country, may I ask them not to exaggerate the position?  They will only do harm.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not objecting on the grounds that certain things have to be discussed.  I could object on those grounds.  I am objecting to the way in which Parliament is being treated, the way in which the Dáil is being treated and particularly the way in which the Dáil is being treated at a time when there are some very, very important things that require an atmosphere of composure and an atmosphere of ordered discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again reiterate that the House gave the Government every possible sympathy and co-operation by allowing them during the summer to have a recess of three-and-a-half months to size up their situation and that in the autumn period the work that was being done by the Government did not throw any great strain on the Ministers or occupy their attention to any great extent.  So that from the time the Ministry took office they have had practically the whole time to deal with any proposals that they wanted to put before the House.  No doubt, when they decided that they would reassemble on the 30th January they had estimated their position with regard to the work of the House.  They meet us now with none of the work that was contemplated prepared but, on the other hand, private Deputies have put down a series of very important motions and they have arranged their domestic and private affairs in such a way that they can, as best they can, attend the sessions <Col N="244" /> of the Dáil from 30th January on.</P>
    <P>The Ministers can look through the various matters that are tabled for discussion. Surely, if the situation contains so many of the problems that Ministers emphasise now and then, it is most advisable that private Deputies would be given such opportunity as is afforded them by the time available to the House to present their outlook on some of these matters before the Government puts formally before the House either the legislation that they have promised or any proposals that may arise out of their present-day review of the position.</P>
    <P>Therefore, my protest in the matter is a protest on behalf of the House as a whole, its prestige and its dignity, against the manner in which the Government are treating it.  I oppose the motion that the Tánaiste suggests and I say that it is treating not only individual members but the House itself and, therefore, the country that it represents and whose business it has to do, with contempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Government is concerned, if they are not in a position to bring forward certain legislation, then nothing can be done about that.  There is, however, a number of motions on the Order Paper which are of vital interest to individual Deputies.  Whatever motive may be behind the tabling of some of these motions, there is a motion in the names of Deputies Norton and Larkin that merits serious consideration.  I say that completely independent of any views expressed in this House from either side.  I want to disagree with the Tánaiste in his remarks with regard to the question of unemployment in the country.  No matter who may be responsible for it, there is more unemployment to-day in the West of Ireland than there has been for a number of years.  Last week I took the opportunity of getting figures from the local labour exchanges and comparing them with the corresponding figures for the same week in 1951.  I found that in the town of Roscommon in January, 1951, 15 people were in receipt of unemployment benefit, while in January of <Col N="245" /> this year 54 people were in receipt of such benefit.  That is the position in a small industrial town which has no industrial employment whatever.  The importation of commodities from abroad has not been responsible for that reduction in employment.</P>
      <P>Whether or not this House sits next week, I would like some priority to be given to the discussion of the motion put down in the names of Deputies Norton and Larkin.  If the Government is not prepared to bring forward now other business which will be discussed later on, then I see no reason whatever why this House should sit next week just for the sake of satisfying some Opposition Deputies.</P>

      <P>It is true that the Government has the right to determine the order of business to come before this House but, if I may quote the present Taoiseach, I have heard him say from time to time that, in his opinion, the question of the consideration of the private motions, especially those put down by Opposition Deputies, constitutes one of the most important features in this House. I think his opinion and the opinion of the Government has changed in that respect.  I would like to refute the implication by the Tánaiste that there is no business to be done.  As long as we have 24 motions on the Order Paper in the names of private Deputies there is business to be done, because in these motions Dáil Éireann is being asked for certain information, to recommend certain actions, and to do certain things which members consider to be of vital importance at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures have been supplied to us from the Statistics Branch or the Department of Social Welfare, I forget which, indicating that at the present time, compared with the same time last year, there are 7,000 more unemployed persons in this country, not counting those people who are working on short time and on half time.  The members of this House want to know and the country wants to know what the Government proposes to do in respect of those 7,000 extra unemployed people.  We would <Col N="246" /> also like to be informed what the Government proposes to do to try to induce some of those unemployed people to stay here to take up whatever employment may be available to them.  The Government has failed to take care of this very important matter.</P>
    <P>It is generally thought by us that the seven weeks of the recess were considered as a recess by the Cabinet Ministers of the Government.  It is a scandalous state of affairs that after seven weeks they have no business to put before the elected representatives of the country.  The Defence Bill was prepared a long time ago.  The Garda Pensions Order is something that has been negotiated over the months and I am sure was drafted before the Dáil went into recess on 13th December. For seven weeks the &ldquo;Coalition&rdquo; Government preferred to be away from Dáil Éireann rather than risk defeat. They just sat tight and did not prepare any business.  I suggest they do not want the Dáil to meet because they do not want to risk defeat from four Independent Deputies.  I here challenge the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has often happened that Deputies who put down such motions found that they were not reached for over two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody questions the right of a Government to settle the Order of Business, but just before the Dáil adjourned a number of Bills were introduced in this House on the assumption that they would be ready for circulation before the Dáil resumed after the Christmas recess.  I will take the Bills as they appear.  First of all we have the Social Welfare Bill. Deputies will remember that before the change of Government the Deputies <Col N="247" /> opposite announced that if there had not been a change of Government in 1948 they had a scheme ready and were prepared to introduce it.  Now they are on the Government Benches and they have not even introduced a scheme.  They went through the form of introducing the title of a Bill here but it has not yet been circulated.</P>
      <P>We had been told of the serious situation due to the adverse balance of payments.  One of the remedies that could quickly be applied to that situation is an expansion of the tourist trade.  A lengthy inquiry was conducted here by a team of American experts, who submitted a report.  Acting on that report, legislation was prepared which was ready for introduction before the change of Government came about.  That legislation has not yet been introduced although we have heard speeches from Ministers all emphasising the seriousness of the situation. Most of them are ready to lay the blame on the previous Government for the state of affairs that exists, but, although the Bill was introduced before Christmas, we have not yet had the text of the Bill.  The only attempt that the Government have made so far to bring forward a tourist policy has been the establishing of a third authority for the tourist industry.  At this stage, I need not elaborate on the reasons for the decision taken to establish that authority.  However, anyone who is familiar with the position of tourism in this country and familiar with the circumstances surrounding it will readily recognise that it was not for the purpose of developing tourism, but for entirely different reasons&mdash; political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned certain matters which were also referred to by Deputy McQuillan.  Whoever is responsible for the present situation, it is one which demands immediate attention of Parliament.  The fact that one Party blames the other Party for what has come about will not solve the problem of the large numbers who are now unemployed and the problem of the numbers on part-time work.  They are not all affected by whatever imports occurred over the past 18 months.  Most <Col N="248" /> Ministers have alleged that there were no imports worth while and no stockpiling. Now, they cannot have it both ways.  There was no stockpiling except what was necessary to meet a situation which might arise&mdash;a situation which, according to the Taoiseach, looks dangerous every day&mdash;a situation that required stockpiling of essential supplies to meet whatever eventualities might occur.  If, on the other hand, there was no stockpiling, the present unemployment has not been caused by any action of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the silence of some Deputies who in the past were extremely eloquent when circumstances were not nearly as bad as they are at the moment.  When conditions were comparatively prosperous, when there was a steady level of employment in agriculture and industry, these Deputies brought forward a number of motions and criticised the inter-Party Government.  In addition, there were numerous debates here and a number of motions on the rising cost of living up to the change of Government last June.  Serious as was the situation up to June, catastrophic are the changes that have occurred and the rises that are affecting all sections of the community in the last six months and particularly since the Dáil adjourned before Christmas.</P>

After all, assuming that we are doing this for a political purpose&mdash;no doubt a lot of people judge everybody else by their own mentality&mdash;we would be doing a very good day's work for the people of the country.  We would be <Col N="249" /> clearing the air of an atmosphere that has developed and that is getting foggier and foggier every week since Fianna Fáil took office.  At the moment in rural Ireland we do not know from one day to another what way prices will go.</P>
      <P>I have a motion with regard to putting back controls again on the price of milk.  I am sure that the price of milk will soar higher than anybody in the Minister's Department visualised. He is getting a free hand and I think that my resolution in itself would be of benefit to a lot of the Fianna Fáil back-benchers&mdash;many of whom are conspicuous by their absence to-day&mdash;and who with their silence are giving consent.  However, they will try to explain the situation as they explained it before the last election.</P>
      <P>I say that every member who put down a motion on the Order Paper was actuated by the very best intentions and I take exception to any Deputy who tries to diagnose my mind and probably give a misinterpretation of what was in my mind.

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the protests that have been made in regard to the suggestion <Col N="250" /> that the Dáil adjourn now for a period of a fortnight.  I think it is notable, Sir, that in the period that has elapsed since this Government was elected, the 13th June to date, out of a possible period of some 28 weeks this Government has had this House sitting for less than five weeks.  That means to me anyway that the Government is behaving like a set of scalded cats as far as this Parliament is concerned.  I think it is monstrous that the people of the country have been told in the last three weeks by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the rest of them that we are facing a serious situation and yet the representatives of the people are denied the opportunity of discussing the situation which exists.  It is perfectly apparent that that is a dodge of the Tánaiste's.  It is apparent that they are trying to keep this Dáil out of session because they know the longer this Dáil meets the more untenable becomes their own political position.  I think in this country to-day when there are acute problems facing the people and ones that each day become more acute, it is monstrous to have any Government in a democratic country trying to prevent the people's representatives from ventilating their grievances.  This suggested adjournment is, under present circumstances, monstrous and undemocratic.</P>

We were going to vote for whatever measures the Fianna Fáil-Cowan Government <Col N="251" /> brought before this Government, or against them on their merits.  That is still our attitude and policy.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has come in here on behalf of the Government, without any previous consultation through the ordinary channels, that is, by way of the Whips, and announced, in an off-hand way, that there was no business worthy of consideration to be done and, therefore, the House was to adjourn until Wednesday week.  If I had the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I was going to move&mdash;but whether I am permitted or not I think it is desirable to say&mdash;that the House would be well engaged next week in the consideration of all the issues arising out of Private Members' Motion No. 24.</P>

Whatever may be said in regard to the importation of clothing&mdash;and that is what he has in mind and he has nothing else in mind&mdash;he is surely not going to suggest that the 6,000 men and women workers engaged in the boot and shoe industry are idle or working short time to-day as a result of any action taken by his predecessor or by the previous Government. Out of the 6,000 boot and shoe operatives that were working full time and overtime when the inter-Party was in office and power 1,000 have lost their employment&mdash;and the Minister knows it well because he met a deputation from the union last week&mdash;and everyone of the remaining 5,000 with the exception of 300, are either working half time or three-quarter time but none are working full time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's own returns furnished to Deputies every two weeks&mdash;he cannot deny this&mdash;by the Department of Social Welfare, the number of registered unemployed is 7,000 more than what it was for the corresponding period of last year.  If <Col N="252" /> the Fianna Fáil Deputies from my constituency would come in and sit behind the Minister they would have to admit that a couple of thousand persons in my constituency have been unemployed in recent times.  The callous refusal of the Minister for Local Government, or the person acting for him, to-day, to provide any further moneys under the Works Act means that a special meeting of the Laois County Council has been specially summoned for to-morrow because 300 of our workers, who had plenty of work to go on with, are going to be thrown on the scrap heap because no further moneys will be provided under the Works Act, 1949.  Is it or is it not a fact that money can be provided under that Act?  There is still more money available to be provided without any fear of increased taxation.</P>

If the Government have no public business to bring before the House themselves, I assert that the seriousness of the position, as indicated in motion No. 24, is, in itself, a grave and urgent reason why the House should meet next week for the purpose of discussing all the implications contained in that motion.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice in the strongest possible protest against the Taoiseach and the Government depriving this House of an opportunity of discussing the very serious problems that are facing the people to-day.  All Deputies on this side of the House may not know the background of the intention of the Government to ask for an adjournment of the House for a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell you, Sir, that the main reason behind the Tánaiste's desire that the House should not sit next week is that he knows that two of the Independent Deputies supporting the Government cannot be present.  He knows that Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll cannot be in Dublin next <Col N="253" /> week.  He knows that Deputy Cowan has got cases in the country and that the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis is being held. He knows there will be a full attendance of Fine Gael Deputies.  I know that Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has business outside Dublin next week. That is the real reason behind the Government's desire to adjourn, and then the Taoiseach is an honest man! He is running Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll says: &ldquo;The House must not sit next week.&rdquo;  That is what is behind all this.  I here and now challenge the Taoiseach to deny that he has been told that within the past 24 hours.</P>

He knows these things would bring about the downfall of the Government and he wants to hold on to his shell of office.  That is the reason for the Government's wishing to adjourn for a fortnight.  He is a coward and he is afraid to face up to this House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Next week on Private Deputies' Business the motion to be taken is one in my name and in that of Deputy Finan. It concerns the plight of the farmers in the districts of Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Tipperary and parts of Limerick.  The farmers in these districts have suffered severely as a result of floods in the Shannon.  That is the next motion to be taken in Private Deputies' Business.  Surely the Government must view with very grave concern the fact that those people have been in such a serious plight during the past few months?  Deputy McQuillan has told of their plight during the past week.  We know it is of the utmost importance that this House should be given an opportunity of discussing this matter and the Opposition are entitled to know what plans the Government have for alleviating the distress, the discontent and the appalling and desperate conditions that obtain in the Shannon valley district from Athlone down to Shannon Harbour, Banagher, and North Tipperary.  That is the next motion to be discussed.  The people in these districts are suffering severely and I am going to assert my rights as Deputy and I shall demand that the Government permit this House to be given an opportunity of discussing the grave issues involved in this connection.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the Tánaiste when he says that there are no other Bills of very great importance.  What greater importance could there be than to see hundreds of people in the Shannon valley district homeless, to see their live stock dying and to see them left in a position which words cannot possibly describe?  Deputy McQuillan knows that.  He sees those conditions. Deputy Finan is aware of them.  My constituency is gravely concerned with this and with the issue raised by Deputy Davin, that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds are becoming unemployed in the County Laois as a result of the present set-up policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Keane has wisely indicated his intention of insisting on this House giving special attention to his motion dealing with the increase in the price of milk.  In the towns of Birr, Tullamore, and Portlaoighise <Col N="255" /> there are people unable to purchase milk at 5d a pint.  Neither are they able to purchase fresh meat.  These are matters which should be discussed. They are matters which must be discussed. It is our duty as an Opposition to bring the Government to their senses and to see that the elected representatives of the people are going to be given an opportunity of having those grievances thrashed out in the Parliament of the country.</P>
    <P>In view of the grave importance which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture attached to it at a meeting recently&mdash;or should I describe it as a party?&mdash;in the Gresham Hotel, Dublin, where the chairmen of the various committees of agriculture were going to have a stock-taking on the question of production, it is only right that if the Government have no Bills of importance for this House, we should at least be given an opportunity of spending a day on discussing the ways and means of increasing production, especially agricultural production. Surely the Taoiseach must and does know that instructions have gone from the Department of Finance to the banks to restrict credit to the farmers.</P>

      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's opinion that Deputies should have an opportunity of raising matters which are of great importance to the community?  We are also anxious to discuss in this House the reasons for a recruiting drive in the midst of peace.  We know quite well the reasons why the Government has started recruiting: so that the unemployment figures will look decent.  Those who cannot get work are to be drummed into the Army and will have no alternative but to join the Army.  The reason the Government are asking men <Col N="257" /> to join the Army is to keep down the unemployment figures.</P>

Those instructions have gone out regarding the machinery which is engaged at the present time on the land project.  The officers are being asked to wind up the present scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I protest vigorously, strongly and determinedly against another thing?  The Taoiseach is supposed to be the champion of free speech.  We are told that he has been anxious to give Deputies an opportunity of discussing everything.  He has told the House time and time again that he welcomes discussion and criticism, but I now accuse him of shirking his responsibility, of trying to muzzle Deputies in this House and of deliberately denying the elected representatives of the people an opportunity of bringing before the House and the country the failure of his policy to keep the people on the land, to end emigration and to reduce the cost of living as he promised.  He knows that he has failed utterly on those issues; he knows that his Government have failed; he knows also that he fears and dreads criticism and above all he knows that Deputy Captain Cowan and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll cannot be here next week.  He knows that if Dáil Éireann meets with a big muster of Fine Gael Deputies here for the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis it will be the last straw and the end of the Fianna Fáil-Cowan-Cogan set up.  He is a cute old hen who never lays out, but he laid out once and if the House meets next week he will lay out again.  I challenge the House to meet next week. He knows that Deputies Cowan and ffrench-O'Carroll are two Deputies who cannot be here and in order to please these two Dublin Deputies who are responsible for placing him where he is in order to bring about the destruction of the country, as he is doing very successfully day after day while he is in office, he will not allow the Dáil to meet.  He knows that if the Dáil meets without this pair&mdash;my vocabulary has failed me; it is very difficult to find words to describe those two Deputies, Deputy Cowan and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll.  The Taoiseach knows that that is the real background. He has denied it in this House.  Can he deny that his office was 'phoned last night?  I call upon Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll to prove that he did not communicate with the Taoiseach's <Col N="259" /> office to say that he could not possibly be in the Dáil next week. This is bluff on the part of the Taoiseach. He is an old hand at bluffing. He bluffs fairly successfully.  He was bluffing his way through this to-day until the Opposition became anxious to know the reasons why he was trying to pull the wool over the people's eyes. I look upon it with disgust; it is viewed with disgust by every decent Deputy in this House and it is viewed with disgust by every decent citizen outside this House.  Everyone knows that in the nostrils of every decent man and woman to-day Fianna Fáil stinks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I protest on behalf of my constituents, to whom Deputy Davin referred, in the shoe trade in Edenderry who have lost their livelihood since the Tánaiste took charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce? Edenderry was a boom town; Edenderry was an industrial town during the inter-Party term of office and Edenderry to-day has been reduced to a wayside village because of Fianna Fáil policy.  It is only right that an opportunity should be given to deal with the points raised by Deputy Davin in that connection.  When I say that the shoe industry is being brought to ruin and destruction in Edenderry, it is likewise in Birr where, I understand, a number of workers in the shoe industry are to be thrown on the unemployment list at a very early date. Again, the shoe factory in Carlow has practically been closed down.  Those issues of factories being closed down are not of such importance to Fianna Fáil that they can spend a day discussing the provision of employment for those workers.  Does the Taoiseach not know from the statistics available in his Department that, in the past <Col N="260" /> three months, there have been more calls at Guards' barracks and labour exchanges for passports than in the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government?  Go to the North Wall or Dun Laoghaire and see there the boats taking workers in thousands out of the country every day, simply because of the action of the Chief, as he is popularly described by the dummies sitting behind him, in bringing the country into the deplorable mess it is in to-day.</P>

      <P>On a matter of personal explanation, references have been made to me in the speech just made by Deputy Flanagan, and I simply want to say that I had no knowledge whatever of this proposal to adjourn until I entered the House and heard this discussion on it.  The suggestion has been made that I would permit my private business to interfere with my public responsibilities.  I have never permitted that and I hope I never shall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably less well-informed than Deputy Flanagan and I have no idea why the Government are seeking this adjournment, but I should like to put this consideration very seriously to the Taoiseach, that, where all Parties in the Opposition are of the view that the House should meet to discuss a particular topic and where that discussion does not cut across the parliamentary programme of the Government, it seems to me that it would be good parliamentary practice to yield to the views of the Opposition.  Where a substantial number of Deputies feel that a certain question should be discussed, it would never do any harm to discuss that question.  It would probably do much less harm than a refusal to allow discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case, there is a very important motion which has been tabled by the Leader of the Labour Party on the paper.  Members of different Parties in the House have indicated that they wish to have that motion discussed.  The Government has indicated that it has no business <Col N="261" /> for the House to discuss, and, when the question was raised yesterday by Deputy Corish of making time available for the discussion of that motion, we were informed by the Government that the matter would be considered. I understood from the attitude on the Government Benches that time was, in fact, going to be made available.  I think it would be unfortunate if the Dáil adjourned now and if no time is made available for that discussion.  As I have already indicated, unemployment has passed the 70,000 mark, which is the danger line.  It would be very wise if the Government now took note of the views expressed in the House and permitted the Dáil to meet next week&mdash;for even one day&mdash;to discuss that motion.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said that references to unemployment and the economic position in the country were harmful. I wonder does he really mean that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I did not say that.  The Deputy is a master of the art of misrepresentation.  I realise that and I realise also that it is useless trying to stop him, but I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it down here &mdash;we were doing harm by exaggerating the position.  If we are doing harm by exaggerating the position, would it not be better to have the position discussed fully, so that whatever harm we may be doing may be counteracted? Who, might I ask, in this House has been exaggerating the position as to the economic condition of the country for the past three months if not the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance? It seems to me that in these circumstances it would be much better to clear the air by a public discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the most extraordinary feature of the proposal which the Tánaiste has placed before the House to-day, without notice to anybody, and probably the feature which has given cause to Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies to put forward possible <Col N="262" /> reasons for the course adopted, is that we were not given a single reason why this adjournment should take place.  If the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach came to the House and said: &ldquo;We are very sorry.  We have no Government business, no legislation ready.  We have had too much to do,&rdquo; I am sure we would all understand.  We can appreciate the amount of work that has to be done by a Government and we can appreciate the difficulties the Government may have in framing its policies, but we have not been told even that. We have been told that there was no legislation and that the Dáil could not meet next week.  The fact there is no legislation ready would not prevent the Dáil meeting to discuss the motion tabled by Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin.  The mere fact that this adjournment is sought in these circumstances is bound to give rise to a great many rumours and it would be very wise of the Government to agree that the Dáil should meet for one day next week&mdash;next Wednesday&mdash;in order to discuss that motion.  I appeal to the Taoiseach now to reconsider the matter, and, unless he can adduce some very cogent reasons to the House, I suggest that he should yield to the view of what is, in effect, half this House.</P>

      <P>I want to put just a few quiet facts on the record.  Since the Government came in on 13th June last, it has, unfortunately, been part of my duty to be in contact with the Chief Whip on the Government side, and during the whole course of the discussions that have inevitably taken place from 13th June up to the present, I want to put it on record that I have received complete courtesy.  On this occasion, however, until the Tánaiste got up and said that the House would not sit next week, no statement, good, bad or indifferent, was given by the Government to the Opposition as to what their plans were.  As late as 10.20 p.m. last night I had to get on the Government Whips' office to try to find out what the business to-day was to be, and even at 10.20 p.m. last night I could get no indication from the Government that they did not propose to sit next week. <Col N="263" /> I was told then for the first time that the only Government business that was to be brought before the House to-day was the Old Age Pensions Estimate which was to be put forward by the Minister for Social Welfare, and then after that we would deal with Private Members' business.  If the Government knew where they were travelling, surely they knew last night that the House was not going to sit next week and surely they had the responsibility of communicating that fact to the remaining members of the House&mdash;unless, of course, the Tánaiste wanted to try and bluff it through quietly and silently and then let it slide away, hoping that it would not be noticed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been given, in the ordering of their business, every possible facility since they took office last June.  I do not think that can be denied or will be denied, and for the Government to come along in this manner and attempt to put a quick one across without notice is beneath contempt.  When we met on the last occasion before Christmas, we were told most specifically by the Tánaiste that he would have his Electricity Bill circulated before the middle of January.  We were given to understand by the Minister for Social Welfare that he would have his Social Welfare Bill circulated before the House met again.  We came and met yesterday and we found that the only business that this Government of flounderers was able to put before the House was the Defence Bill, the Bill that was there from their predecessors. We have no Government business to be brought forward but we will have, in the course of the next few weeks, the financial business commencing, and everybody knows that once that financial business commences there is an established precedent here that Private Members' time is not allowed and that all the official time of the House is set aside for Government business.  That is going to happen in a couple of weeks.  We have an opportunity next week, because of the inactivity and inability of the Government to do their job, to take the Private Members' business which is on the Order Paper <Col N="264" /> and which otherwise would not be taken this side of the Long Recess, because of the habit and practice of the House in dealing with financial business.</P>
    <P>The Government, for some reason best known to themselves&mdash;I do not profess to know why&mdash;are deliberately trying to avoid that position and if so, particularly in the circumstances in which they tried to hide it from the Opposition through the usual channels last night, then we cannot be blamed if we are inclined to see something sinister in it and if Deputies are inclined to see in it some reason, that there is some particular motion they do not wish to face.  The individual Ministers of the Government, as Ministers in charge of administrative Departments, obviously have work that requires to be done and if the Government had come to us and said there was such pressure of administrative work that they were unable to deal next week with the Private Members' business before the Dáil, one could understand it.</P>
    <P>One might disagree with it, inasmuch as one would like to disagree with the administrative mind of the Minister for Agriculture, who told us that it was no concern of his what price the farmers would receive for barley.  One could understand a Government giving pressure of administration as an excuse, but the Tánaiste just threw it out that the House was not going to sit next week, in a casual fashion without any explanation, without any attempt to try to inform the others members of the House who were entitled to be informed.  One can only assume from that that it is further evidence of the old Fianna Fáil trick of regarding this House merely as somewhere to register decisions that they have come to behind closed doors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the pretended indignation of the Deputies who have spoken, one would think that it was something absolutely new to ask the Dáil not to meet in the coming week and to meet the week after.  It is a thing that every Deputy knows has happened time after time.  One cannot always judge the length of time that <Col N="265" /> would be taken by discussion of some particular subject.  I certainly did not expect that so much time would be spent on discussing the question whether the Dáil would meet on Wednesday next or the Wednesday after that.  The fact is that we met a fortnight earlier than when the previous Government were in office last year. When these matters are discussed in private, I have often suggested that it would be wiser to wait until you were sure that you had the full current of legislation ready, so that there would be a continuous flow. There is a different point of view that can be taken and held fairly successfully, that is, that by starting you first get a number of Bills introduced and work put into train, and even if, after the first week spent in dealing with the business you have ready, you do have to wait for a week, it is better to do that than to wait as was done last year for a fortnight.  If we had proposed to meet on the 15th February as was proposed last year, instead of on the 30th January, there would have been nothing said about it.  The fact was that we met a fortnight earlier than we met last year.</P>
      <P>The calculation, when the date was fixed, was that certain Bills would be ready.  That calculation did not prove correct, and we find ourselves in this position.  For instance, my own view was&mdash;I did not know that there was going to be a special committee arranged to deal with it&mdash;that the discussion on the Defence Bill might take a considerable time and might have widened out into all sorts of discussions on the present defence situation.  It apparently did not take that particular trend.</P>
      <P>What is proposed to-day is simply what has been proposed very many times and agreed to on many occasions, that is, after the Dáil having met earlier than is usual, there is a postponement for a week.  All these suggestions of tricks and all that sort of thing are, every one of them, devoid of foundation.  This was done when it was found that the business of the Dáil would be better managed by waiting for a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene only for a very short time in this debate.  I want to intervene principally for the purpose of repudiating the suggestion which has just been made by the Taoiseach that the opposition to this proposal is mere pretence and that the speeches that have been made are made in pretended indignation.  I left the House last night having no idea as to what the Order of Business was to be to-day.  I had certainly no information that the House was going to adjourn this evening for a fortnight.</P>
      <P>I also want to make this point very definitely and very emphatically&mdash;that it has appeared to me, and to a number of my colleagues, that business affecting the country in the financial, economic and social sphere is tending to be done outside this House and not inside this House.  During the Recess we have had ministerial speeches, speeches from Government spokesmen and others, dealing with the so-called or alleged serious financial and economic situation in the country, making the flesh of the people creep, and even making people, who had no other reason to feel uneasiness, wonder whether, by reason of the continued reiteration of suggestions of financial instability and economic uncertainly, there might not be something in them, they were made so frequently and so authoritatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have given proof since we became the Opposition in this House that we are prepared to do the business of the House in a businesslike way, not in the way we were met by the present Government when they were in opposition.  As Deputy Sweetman has just said, we have co-operated <Col N="270" /> in every way with the present Government in that respect.  If a situation arose unexpectedly, as the Taoiseach suggests now that it has arisen, that situation could have been discussed with the Whips and matters could be arranged between the various Parties that comprise the Opposition.</P>
    <P>We got no intimation whatever about it.  Let me add, while I hope to be reasonable, that I wish emphatically to express the view that matters that should be dealt with in this House have been dealt with outside it.  A singular example of that arose yesterday when we heard that the Minister for Finance was going to England.  I think that it was something in the nature of a public scandal that we should have heard that our Minister for Finance was going to discuss matters of vital concern to this country with his opposite number in England, over the British radio for the first time.</P>

      <P>In accordance with ordinary diplomatic practice between countries, there should have been an arrangement that there would be a joint announcement in both Houses.  I do say that that is another indication of the manner in which matters are being done outside this House that should be done inside it. If there were reasons why this adjournment should take place they could have been discussed.  There is no doubt, taking the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his own estimate throughout the country, of the serious financial condition affecting the country, and how the lack of production by farmers is affecting economic stability in the country, that there would be an opportunity in this House next week to discuss all these matters&mdash;the affairs of the country and the ills of the country.  There would be still a further opportunity of allowing <Col N="271" /> us to make it perfectly clear that we are not suffering from the ills that the Tánaiste and his Ministers would have us believe we are suffering from. Let us clear up in public where the evil lies, if there be an evil, and what the remedy for it is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton asked yesterday for time for his motion.  I did not quite gather whether the Taoiseach suggested that the situation which confronted the Government was unexpected by reason of the failure of Government business, by reason of the fact that Deputies were not sufficiently talkative on the Defence Bill or whether he suggested that the unexpected situation in which they find themselves had reference to the proposal that time should be given for this debate on unemployment.  It was announced in the newspapers weeks ago that this motion was being put down by the Labour Party but to suggest, as the Taoiseach has suggested, that the last Government had no collective responsibility and that he and the Tánaiste could not make up their mind in five minutes if they wished to do so, to give time to-day for this debate, is ridiculous.  If they wished to go through the forms of collective responsibility had they not telephones at their disposal?  All the Taoiseach had got to do was to ring up his ministerial colleagues and say to them: &ldquo;As we have no business to occupy the Dáil, can we not give Deputy Norton the time for his motion this week that we shall have to give him later anyway?&rdquo;  In conclusion, I wish to protest again against the statement of the Taoiseach that the indignation expressed on this proposal is a pretence and merely a put-up job. We have very many arguments to put forward and there is much work to be done.  We wish to make our case publicly that this country is not in the parlous condition in which the Government want to make out for their own political purposes.  We want the earliest opportunity to do that.  It is the principal reason, as far as I am concerned and I think as far as my colleagues are concerned, why we oppose this matter.</P>

      <P>There is not a Deputy in this House who does not deprecate the very high unemployment figures to which we must own at present.  During the term of office of the inter-Party Government when the unemployment figures stood at 50,000 and 60,000, and it was the responsibility of the inter-Party Government to try to lessen these unemployment figures and in addition to reduce the emigration of the 20,000 unemployed whom we saw leave the country, I do not believe that our actions to curb either unemployment or emigration were as expeditious or effective as they should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An air of panic and an impression for the urgency and necessity of speed has been created in this House tonight. The hurricane speed, with which these people on the Opposition Benches suggest that they are now obsessed and possessed, is blown rather sky-high by one argument used by Deputy Cosgrave.  He drew the attention of the House to to-day's Order Paper and pointed out a number of Bills mentioned on it.  One of them is the Tourist Traffic Bill&mdash;a Bill which seeks to do something for the sadly neglected tourist trade.  The tourist trade, if properly developed, is of fabulous value from the point of view of sterling for what it is worth and for dollar earnings.  It should be recalled that Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Cosgrave's colleague, was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the inter-Party Government for three years.  I must admit to my share of responsibility for the fact that during these three years no progressive or energetic policy in regard to tourist earnings for this country was developed. Hence, that Bill has been there for three years and no motion of censure was brought before the House and no attempt was made to put the <Col N="273" /> then Government out of office.  This is merely a transparent and specious attempt to restore and put the inter-Party Humpty-Dumpty Government together again.</P>

However, all these facts fade into insignificance when one considers the arrant impertinence of the leader of the Labour Party in this House.  Deputy Norton and his deputy, Deputy Larkin, put down this motion on present hardship from rising unemployment figures.  For three long years that man, Deputy Norton, was in absolute control of the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;the Department which has supreme authority over the welfare of the people mentioned in this motion&mdash;the widows and orphans, the unemployed, those seeking sickness benefits, and so forth. That man, Deputy Norton, though he was Minister for Social Welfare for three years, made no honest or real attempt to expedite or hurricane through the social legislation which would have mitigated and ameliorated, to some extent at any rate, the hardship which is being caused by the rising unemployment, which everybody knows is there but which cannot be overcome in one night.  That is the typical game of humbug and hypocrisy which has dominated the actions and <Col N="274" /> the principles of those people throughout their political life.  They now attempt to play a silly, cheap, political schoolboy trick on a motion here.</P>

I remember that when the Social Welfare Bill was going through this House the Minister was asked the cause of the delay in producing the larger Bill. The Minister replied that he would have the Social Welfare Bill for circulation before we resumed on the 30th of January.  Where is that Bill now? We have no indication to-day that that promise will be implemented.  I can quote the Minister for Industry and Commerce as saying that he could produce the Social Welfare Bill in one month.</P>

      <P>The people who are responsible for the government of this country must display a sense of responsibility.  I detest matters as important as this matter being discussed in this House from a prejudiced and a political point of view, no matter from what side of the House such prejudice and politics may come.  This country is facing a very difficult situation.  I consider that the Government are trifling with the feelings of the people when they make statements such as the statements which have been made by various Government speakers throughout the country during the past six or seven weeks.  I have said in this House on more than one occasion and I have stated it at our meetings and in the <Col N="276" /> Press that the Labour Party stand four-square behind the Government in any endeavour to improve the lot of our people.  That is our attitude to-day as it has been our attitude in the past.</P>
      <P>The position now is that our Minister for Finance has been invited to London for discussions with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and that he has accepted that invitation.  If there is anything wrong then the proper thing to do would be for this House to discuss the matter for a few hours next week so that the different Parties could give their points of view and help to strengthen the hand of the Minister for Finance irrespective of whether he is bound for discussions with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer or anybody else.  These are matters of vital importance and nobody can afford to make a stunt of them.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this unemployment problem when the number unemployed was 52,000.  These unemployed people were treated by the Governments of this country as a class apart from the community. If a man is earning £6 a week and is put off employment, he has to try to pay rent and keep a family when that £6 is reduced to 22/6 with 7/6 for his wife.  Then we are told that it is all humbug and that it is dishonest to put down a motion now when we have over 71,000 unemployed registered at the labour exchanges. These are matters which the people outside are demanding that we should discuss in a calm and cool atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is to go to England to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I think we should be able to indicate to this House what stand he should take and what attitude he should adopt in discussing Irish affairs with that important gentleman. Why have we not something like that before us for next week?  I say, without animosity or prejudice, that whatever discussion is taking place this evening the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for it.  We are not moving fast enough in dealing with the problems facing us in this country.  I take an interest in the speeches made by a responsible man like the Minister for Industry and <Col N="277" /> Commerce, and I have even noted some of the speeches of other Ministers.  I have them all carefully earmarked.</P>
    <P>It is not treating decent elements in this country properly to be creating scares that this country is down and out or facing a fearful position because we are tied to the £ that England is in command of at present.  It is very wrong that we should not be allowed to discuss this important matter next week.  The Minister for Finance who is going across to England often tells me I am talking nonsense when I am speaking about financial matters.  I say to him that he will have no stronger backers in doing right by the Government and the people than he has in myself and the members of the Labour Party.  We should end this heated discussion and agree to discuss these important matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest against the proposal that the House should not meet next week.  For four or five weeks last year this House was engaged in trying to decide whether a crisis or a problem existed in this country.  If one or the other exists, surely the House should meet to discuss the means by which it can be overcome.  There are other matters which may appear small in relation to the whole community, but which affect some of our people.  I wished to put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce next week with regard to a quandary in which farmers in my constituency find themselves. These farmers in the Lee valley had to give up land to make way for a hydro-electric scheme.  They asked the officials who are over that scheme whether they could till their land this year and get crops off it before the land is inundated, but these officials could not inform them; they said that the farmers would have to seek that information at higher level. I thought that by way of a parliamentary question next week I would be able to get that information for these people.</P>

      <P>You should see that they do the job and supply the farmers whose land has been taken with information as to whether or not they can till the land.  There have been scares about the necessity for increased tillage.  It would seem that the Government are treating this House contemptuously by shunting off motions which appear on the Order Paper into the dim and distant future because the matters which would be raised would be inimical to the position in which the Government find themselves.  One of the pillars of this Government described the man who is now in charge of the nation's finances and who is being sent to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer as a senile delinquent.  If that is the type of man we have in charge of the nation's purse, then it is necessary that this House should meet and advise that &ldquo;senile delinquent&rdquo; as to the manner in which he should conduct our business over there.</P>
      <P>It has come as an absolute surprise to the House to find that the crisis which was supposed to have existed some short time ago has completely disappeared.  This Government went off on a lengthy honeymoon after its formation.  Then the House met for a brief period, after which we were told to go home for six weeks.  Now we have come here for one or two days to be told that we are to take another rest.  The country will regard that as an absolute insult and a negation of the conditions which Ministers are trying to put over as being in existence. The people are asked to produce more and work harder.  They must do all these things so that the nation may survive.  But the members of this House are only brought here periodically for a few hours and are then told to go back home again for another two or three weeks.</P>

I hope that some day you will examine your conscience and say to yourselves: &ldquo;We destroyed this country; we destroyed the economic trends which Fianna Fáil built up over the years in trying to make the country self-supporting; we have left thousands of people unemployed, and we have forced them to the emigrant ship.&rdquo; That is what you are guilty of, and now stand up to it and do not try to hide behind any stunt resolution.</P>

I think it is time that something was done about this effort at dictatorship which is being made in the House to-day. Sometimes I am convinced that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and particularly some of its leaders, have no conception whatever of the needs of the people of this country.  I am convinced that to-day, when they suggest that this House can afford to rise for a fortnight, with a serious economic situation in existence, they <Col N="281" /> are displaying no responsibility whatsoever in the task&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we compare the figures for unemployment we find that we have now 7,000 more people signing at the labour exchanges than we had in January 12 months ago.  That may be of little consequence to some of the Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party and <Col N="282" /> to some of their leaders, but it is going to be of very great importance when they go to the people again, and let it be soon, gentlemen, we implore you. Let it be soon, because it will be of very great importance.</P>
      <P>Unemployment and the rising cost of living are not deemed to be important enough to call this Dáil together next week.  In common with everybody else, I feel it is my duty to protest against this particular effort at stifling discussion. Several times during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government when times were not as critical, economically, as they are now, when we had a condition of relative prosperity in the country, when people were in almost full employment and when conditions were fairly good, we remember that when there was a suggestion of an adjournment which might have appeared unduly long, we had Deputy Lemass and members of the Fianna Fáil Party jumping up and protesting that it was unjust, that something was being hidden and that the people were being fooled.  Of course, at that time the people knew very well that there was no urgency in the situation, but there is urgency in it now.  There is urgency in it for anybody who believes that the people of this country are entitled to a fair life.</P>
      <P>I know very well that there are people who think that it does not matter how many unemployed there are.  I know there are people who believe that, to have an ordered economy, you must have unemployment, but some of us believe that the Christian law lays it down that a man is entitled to a living.  Those who are signing at the labour exchanges throughout the country to-day will have only further proof given to them by this discussion of the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;that it has not changed&mdash;and that the days before the war, when unemployment was rife, are back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke in his usual futile rambling made reference to foreign importations and tried to cast responsibility for the present economic situation on the previous Administration. What did the Fianna Fáil Party accept office for if it was not to accept <Col N="283" /> responsibility for the state of the country?  Why should they try to evade that responsibility now?  If they think that the people can be fooled now as they have been fooled for many years they are making a sad mistake.  Go out into any part of the city or country, go to places where people gather in bus queues or in trains or wherever men come together to discuss their daily lives, and they will tell you that times were never as hard as they are now, that there was never in the lifetime of many people as much unemployment as there is now.  Only last week I was told that since Christmas more building trade workers had left this city to work in Britain than had left since the years of the war.  Yet that situation is not supposed to be sufficiently critical to convene the Dáil next week.</P>
    <P>What do the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government think they are playing with?  They are playing with the liberties of the people of this country and with the rights of the people.  Every member of this House is entitled to come here and say what he thinks is good for the people whom he represents and for the whole nation.  The Government is trying to deprive Deputies of that right.  It is not even fair to some of its own members.  We had Deputy John Flynn yesterday expressing dissatisfaction.  He, too, could hear the distant drums of the election that is coming and is making his plans.  He is taking steps to see that, whatever happens to Fianna Fáil, he, at least, will try to survive no matter who else may go down.</P>
    <P>Whatever the decision may be here to-day on this issue, the people will not be misled.  They will not be fooled by the hysterical screamings of Deputy Dr. Browne or by the foolish vapourings and outpourings of my colleague from County Dublin.  The people know full well where the blame lies for the present situation.  They know very well that this Administration is at present in office as a minority Administration and against the people's will. They are seeking anxiously for an opportunity to put this Administration where it belongs, namely, as a very <Col N="284" /> small group on this side of the House. Make no mistake about it: Whether or not we come back as individuals, as sure as we are here to-night, the next election that takes place the people will speak, and speak loudly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I, as one Deputy representing the people in County Dublin, and having a wide knowledge of the rural workers in the constituencies of many rural.  Deputies here, challenge the Government to go to the country, not next month and not next week, but now, and let us see who will win.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Loyalty is a very noble virtue, and I feel the House owes a very special debt to Deputy Dr. Browne for his graceful display of that noble quality to-day.  It is something that might well be noted by some of the younger arrivals in the public life of this country, for it is an example which I would not wish my worst enemy to take.  The temptation to join Deputy Dr. Browne in his spiritual home, the gutter, is recurrent and strong; but we must resist it.</P>
      <P>The reason that I feel it is wrong to suspend the activities of the Oireachtas unduly at the present time is because I am convinced that at this moment Ireland is economically the strongest nation in Europe.  What exasperates me is that, with abundant resources at our disposal to meet whatever problems may confront us, instead of constructive and courageous action we have nothing but middle-headed panic on the part of men who have clearly demonstrated their reckless ignorance of the fundamentals of the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party wants to discuss unemployment.  Some Deputies appear to believe that the unemployment of industrial workers is just an act of God, and that nothing can be done about it.  The Tánaiste and the less scrupulous members of his Party, for he now controls the Fianna Fáil Party, seek to make the case that there is nothing they can do to protect men from unemployment because the unemployment has been caused by steps taken by their predecessors in the inter-Party Government.  Perhaps they believe that.  If they do, this is the <Col N="285" /> place to clear their minds of that mistake.</P>
    <P>Let me give one specific concrete case.  There is a leather factory in Gorey, County Wexford.  That factory, in common with hundreds of other businesses here, went into the market at our behest and stockpiled 12 months ago.  We asked them to do that just as we asked every local authority to buy two years of road-making materials and put them in stock; just as we instructed Deputy Dr. Browne to equip himself to finish the hospitals that were in process of construction; just as we instructed Deputy Dr. Browne to charge the local authorities to furnish public health institutions with two years' supply of appliances and drugs; just as we told builders' providers to go out and buy scarce materials for the completion of housing, discreetly but as rapidly as they could; just as we asked every other prospective purchaser here who dealt in necessary goods to lay in stocks against any possible contingency that might lie ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not change my story.  I told the story in this House. Any Government in a democratic country has to determine two things: one is the probable course of events but, in relation to that, another consideration must affect the judgment; that is, the capacity of an irresponsible Opposition to undermine morale. Eighteen months ago Fianna Fáil declared from these seats that war was about to break out any day, any week, and that the Government of Ireland at the time was making no provision to meet it.  I told my colleagues that was &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  So far as my voice carried in the Government of the day I said: &ldquo;These fellows are at their lousy codology again; nobody but a gom would believe them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that wiser heads than mine said: &ldquo;That may be true, but we as a Government have not only got to provide against a probable contingency, but we have got to take steps that will maintain the people's morale, and if <Col N="286" /> the Opposition can carry conviction to the people that the danger is there, the normal course of approaching events will spread panic through the community; therefore, whether it is necessary or whether it is not, a situation has now been created which makes it necessary to stockpile.&rdquo;  I think my colleagues were right in that decision, and we acted on it.</P>
    <P>Amongst those who helped us, and I have no reason to believe they had any political sympathy with us at all, was this leather factory in Gorey.  That factory to-day finds itself in this position: it is carrying more stock than its capital will finance.  I say here and now, as a responsible member of the inter-Party Government at the time, by implication in any case we gave such people to understand that if that situation should supervene we, as a Government, would help them through their period of financial stringency.  It is one of the most disgusting acts of treachery to public-spirited citizens here, who took the Government at that time at their word, that such people as the Gorey leather company are now required to put half their men out of employment because our successors in office will not redeem our pledge.</P>

I have no other source of information except the exchanges that took place in this House on that particular subject.

But what he quite overlooks is this, that 12 months ago it looked highly likely that every readymade clothing manufacturer in this country was going to close down for want of cloth.  Who bought the cloth?  Was not it the clothing factories who wanted the assurance of being able to maintain employment?  Is not it true that nine months ago, when the price of wool hit the roof, many woollen mills manufacturing woollen cloth notified their customers that they could make no delivery of cloth for six months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment in the building industry: I know of two specific cases.  I know an hotel proprietor in a popular seaside resort who sought accommodation to build an annexe to that hotel of bedrooms, having adequate dining-rooms and refreshment accommodation in the hotel building, and who was told that she would not get a penny, that there was no money now, by direction of the Government, for capital expenditure of that kind.  I know of a garage proprietor in one of the most populous centres of this city who asked for money to extend his garage premises on very valuable land which is now vacant, on the undertaking that the extension would enable him to employ 14 additional men and he was told he would not get a penny for a capital investment at the present time.</P>
      <P>Is there a Deputy in this House who does not know of individual small builders who were proceeding on the basis of buying a piece of land, getting three or four customers for two pairs of houses, getting credit from the bank while the houses were a-building on the understanding that as soon as they were built the overdrafts would be paid back and the man would start another two pairs of houses?  How many men who were engaged in that activity have quit in the last 12 months and gone to England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it propaganda to direct the attention of this Oireachtas to the fact that restraint of credit with these results is a shortsighted folly and that there is nothing in our circumstances as a nation which could conceivably justify it?  Is not it reasonable to ask for an opportunity to make the case that our economic circumstances are such and our economic prospects such that we may with every confidence <Col N="290" /> continue to invest in our own country and that this is the time above all times when the safest bank into which our people's earnings can be put is the land of Ireland and the people of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Listen to me.  There is something people in this House are entitled to forget.  Ireland has two economic peculiarities.  Inflation can show itself in this country by excessive imports of consumer goods.  I have asked the Tánaiste and all the members of the Government to analyse the list of our imports and show us where this excess of imports of consumer goods may be. In other countries monetary inflation will show itself as a rapidly rising price level for the supply of goods available.  That might not happen here.  But Ireland has another economic peculiarity.  Unemployment will never show itself in Ireland with the dramatic obviousness that it shows itself in Great Britain or the United States because unemployment in this country has a natural tendency to transmute itself to emigration.  And remember, if this country throws into periodic unemployment craftsmen, skilled workmen, they will not accept periodic employment.  Why should they when, by travelling for three hours across the English Channel, they can get long-term permanent contractual employment at rates of wages fully equal to the rates payable here and with a prospect of higher overtime opportunity if they choose to take it.</P>
    <P>It is just madness for us at this time to be stampeded by anybody inside or outside this country into driving people whose labour we urgently need into an emigration from which we struggled hard to drag them back during the last three years.  I remember when the housing drive began it was a headache of the country that we could not get plasterers, we could not get carpenters, and we could not get joiners.  We looked for them in England and got them in England.  But we got them only on the understanding that they were coming home to permanent employment.  If those men had not come home in anticipation that they would have to go back to Great Britain, all the King's horses and all <Col N="291" /> the King's men would never bring them back again.</P>
    <P>I understand that an order has gone out that no further machinery is to be purchased for the land project.  I ask Deputies of this House to go and ask the men who are driving machines for the land project whence they came to that work.  The last two men I spoke to before I ceased to be Minister for Agriculture I asked them where they learned to drive the bulldozer.  One, a Mayo man, told me that he learned it on the groundnut scheme in North Africa and came back to Ireland when he got the chance of employment here at skilled rates of wages: and the man who was driving another machine told me that he answered the advertisement from the Suez Canal and was glad to come home to Ireland when he could get skilled employment.</P>
    <P>Let this Government at their peril drive the likes of these men out to employment to the Colonies again and all the King's horses and all the King's men will never bring them back.  I am talking of this not from the point of view of the men.  I think the men are able to earn their living as can any man in a skilled trade.  I am talking from the purely economic point of view of Ireland.  Ask the Board of Works what was their principal problem on the Brosna Drainage Scheme and on the Clyde and Dee.  It was not money and it was not material. It was to get men competent to work the drainage machinery and they got them from abroad, Irishmen who learned this work either in Great Britain or on works in Africa or the Near East.  In addition to training the other chaps they told the chaps they were training what they were able to earn abroad.</P>
    <P>If there is a cowardly interruption of the housing programme or the land rehabilitation programme an injury will be done to this country that no succeeding Government can repair, for we will lose the men who are fit to do the job.  There is no use in sending out the Cabinet, whatever Party constitutes it, to drive bulldozers.  They are not fit and the skill and capacity of those who are capable of doing it is <Col N="292" /> one of the most readily saleable exports this country has, and it is one of the exports this country should be most reluctant to cash in upon.</P>
    <P>I want, if all the hullabaloo is genuine, to discuss a question in this House and bring the Government to answer it, taking it as beyond question that increased agricultural production is fundamentally necessary to everybody in Ireland.  If it is true that the first item in the hierarchy of agricultural production should be wheat, as Fianna Fáil says it should be, the Irish Land Commission have in their hand to-day thousands of acres of the best land in Ireland.  In the course of the next three months they are going to set 100 per cent, of that land for grazing. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is setting up a State company to make grass meal on a virgin bog in Ennis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Deputy might discuss this when the legislation is before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>More fantastic than a proposal to grow pineapples in O'Connell Street.  Surely if it is desirable to set up a special State body to grow grass on a virgin bog in Ennis the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture could set up an interdepartmental committee to grow wheat on the 50,000 acres of prime land at present untenanted in the hands of the Land Commission and which is at present in the process of being set on an eleven-month letting for grazing.</P>

I have mentioned matters of manifest and urgent importance. Do not forget that many disillusioned members of this House may take the cynical view, I know the Tánaiste does, that discussion in Dáil Éireann is unavailing and a waste of time.  I know he would like to close &ldquo;the talking shop&rdquo; and get on with the job.  There are still a good many people in this country who do not share that view.  Mind you, it does something to lighten the burden of adversity.  If these people have visible evidence that Oireachtas Éireann is conscious of their problem and honestly doing its best to resolve it, it is a good thing.  Maybe we will not succeed in so doing.  It is very galling for a man who is willing to work and proud of his capacity to work to keep his family unbeholden to anybody, if he gets a chance, to find himself without a job, or the means of getting a job, and to find the legislators whom he trusted to help him towards that admirable end going home for a fortnight's holiday on the grounds that they have nothing to do.</P>

      <P>The facts I want to put before the Dáil are these: The Dáil met this year on the 30th January which was a fortnight earlier than Dáil Éireann met after the Christmas recess for many years past.  If this motion to adjourn the Dáil to the 13th February is passed, it will reassemble on an earlier date than that on which the Dáil met after Christmas for many years.  The summoning of the Dáil for a date earlier than might otherwise have been chosen was decided upon by the Government, first of all, to give an opportunity of introducing various Supplementary Estimates which were thought might be ready, to dispose of any business that might be in line for debate, to give Deputies <Col N="294" /> an opportunity of asking the 200 questions which they did, in fact, ask and with some expectation that the Bills which were introduced before Christmas might have been circulated in time to permit of the Dáil being asked to discuss them now.  This procedure of summoning the Dáil for one week for the ordering of business for the session and then adjourning for a week has happened on many occasions. It happened frequently while the Coalition was in office and nobody ever suggested that it was not an inevitable consequence of the difficulty of arranging a full programme of Government business at the beginning of the session.</P>

      <P>There is no desire whatever to prevent a discussion of motions by private Deputies.

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, towards the end of last session there was agreement that Private Deputies' motions would give way to Government business.  I admit that I am responsible, to some extent, for the delay of two of the Bills which were introduced before Christmas &mdash; the Electricity Supply Bill and the Tourist Bill.  The delay was partially due to some difficulties that emerged in <Col N="295" /> drafting but it is mainly due to my personal preoccupation with administrative matters during the past month. One of the Bills is being printed at the moment and the other is going for printing very soon.  It was a very slight error of calculation which prevented them being available.  If we had foreseen that these Bills would not have been circulated in time for discussion here, we would, perhaps, have reassembled the Dáil a week later and nobody would have suggested that we were depriving Deputies of the right to discuss private business or that we were establishing a dictatorship, as Deputy Dunne has suggested.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the seriousness of the economic problems of this country.  It has been devoting a very large part of its efforts since it came into office to convincing Deputies opposite and people outside of the seriousness of such problems.  On remembering the debates which we had here before Christmas, I regard it as our greatest achievement to date that Deputy Costello, Deputy Dunne and others regard these problems as so vital that it is taking an undue risk to adjourn the Dáil for a week, and so urgent that they desire to express their views on them at once.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Norton asked me was I prepared to allocate Government time for the discussion of that motion, I could have said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but I thought it more polite to say that I would consider it.  I certainly did not give any indication that I thought it desirable to make Government time available for its discussion.</P>

      <P>I said yesterday that we did not know whether the business ordered would be concluded yesterday or whether there would be business available for to-day.  In any case there has been some misunderstanding as to the expectation of the time which the Second Reading of the Defence Bill would take.  There has been a change in the arrangement for the Dáil programme arising out of the decision which the House is about to make to refer that Bill to a Select Committee rather than take it in Committee of the whole Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point about Deputy Norton's motion is this.  I do not want the House to think that I have given any undertaking of any kind whatever to afford Government time for this discussion <Col N="297" /> or to consider favourably giving Government time for discussion. The suggestion will be considered.  On looking through the motion, it seems to me that it would be foolish to set aside time for the discussion of a motion which relates mainly to a matter which will be, if my expectations are realised, the main matter in debate by the Dáil during the present session&mdash;the improvement of our welfare services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if a substantial portion of the House wish to discuss a matter it should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all. In that connection, may I say that Deputy Costello was talking a lot of nonsense about his desire and the desire of his Party to discuss certain matters when there is no motion put down about the matters he wants to discuss?  There was no intimation given, until Deputy Costello spoke, that there was any desire on the part of the chief Opposition Party to have time to discuss these matters.  There must be some consideration given to members of the Government and intimation must be given in advance that there is a desire to have matters of that kind, matters of that importance, brought here for debate.  It should be a question for the Government to consider whether, having regard to the business which it contemplates will come before the session, it is desirable to set aside time for a rushed debate upon an issue of that kind.</P>
      <P>There were many suggestions that the Government, in proposing the postponement of the Dáil was engaged in some political manoeuvre.  Yesterday, I did not think that this proposition would be made.  When we considered the matter this morning, having regard to the state of business, I felt that the wiser course was to adjourn until Wednesday week and have a full amount of Government business for the House to deal with at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that that decision was not conveyed to the Opposition Whips. That was in part due to the fact that when the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="298" /> conveyed to me that the only business ordered for next week and available were the Supplementary Estimates introduced yesterday, I asked him, before taking that decision on myself, to check up with each individual Minister whether there was any question of policy which made it necessary that these Estimates should be passed by the Dáil next week.  It was only late in the day that the Parliamentary Secretary told me that he had confirmed with each individual Minister concerned that the Estimates could be held over to the following week.  I mention that to dispose of the ridiculous idea in regard to political manoeuvring.  If anybody thinks we are afraid to give time to discuss the motion put down by the Labour Party, afraid of being defeated on that motion, may I point out that we can, at least, postpone that event by refusing to give time for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £337,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons (Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1951); for Supplements (No. 22 of 1946); and for certain Grants.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is rendered necessary by the Social Welfare Act, 1951, which effected certain changes in the means test for old age and blind pensions and also increased the rates of those pensions.</P>
      <P>The means test, as Deputies will no doubt remember, has been relaxed in three ways:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1.)  A farmer occupying a holding with a valuation up to £30 can, on reaching pensionable age, assign his farm to one or more of his children and thus qualify for an old age pension if not disqualified by reason of other means.</P>
      <P>(2.)  Sums up to a limit of £80 a year received by a person by way of disability or wound pension or other allowance under the Army Pensions Acts are disregarded for the purpose of the means test for old age or blind pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> (3.)  Assistance received by a person from one or more charitable organisations up to a limit of £52 5s. 0d. a year is disregarded for the purpose of the means test.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these three relaxations of the means test will enable 7,000 persons who were not previously entitled to them to receive old age pensions.</P>
    <P>The 1951 Act raised the maximum old age or blind pension to 20/- a week and enabled this pension to be awarded to a person whose means did not exceed £22 2s. 6d. a year.  Formerly the maximum pension was payable only if the means of the person did not exceed £15 12s. 6d. a year.  Persons whose means exceed £52 5s. 0d. a year but do not exceed £65 5s. 0d. receive a pension of 5/- per week under the 1951 Act where formerly they received nothing.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that as a result of the provisions I have mentioned an additional sum of £337,000 will be required in the current financial year to meet the expenditure out of the Old Age Pensions Vote, and this is the sum I am now asking the Dáil to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be any opposition to this Vote, but I should like the Dáil and the people to appreciate that this Vote is moved by the Minister to-night because the people of this country were lucky in that in recent years there was in power an inter-Party Government.  The Social Welfare Act of 1951, the passing of which without opposition by this House necessitates this Vote, was merely the enactment by the present Dáil of certain sections of the Social Welfare Bill which was discussed here in the early part of the year.  It represented a new deal for old age pensioners, or for those people who now qualify as old age pensioners, given and guaranteed to them by the inter-Party Government. That guarantee was so definite that, although the former Government and former Dáil were dissolved before the Social Welfare Bill became law, the undertaking had, of necessity, to be honoured by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that while the Social Welfare Bill was being discussed, there was very determined, very violent and <Col N="303" /> organised opposition by the Fianna Fáil Party to its enactment into law.  I recall also that it was only during the stress of the last general election, when the Fianna Fáil Party were seeking any measure of political support they could get, irrespective of the manner in which they obtained it, that they gave a solemn undertaking to the people that if they were elected as a Government they would introduce the measure incorporated in the Social Welfare Act of 1951.  Accordingly, the old age pension was raised to £1 per week, the means test modified and certain other provisions enacted into law entitling people to a pension which they otherwise would not have obtained.</P>
    <P>Naturally, this vote will not be opposed from the Opposition side, but we hope and trust that the people of the country will realise that this measure of social service is one that was shaped and formed by the Minister's predecessor, and we hope and trust that the people, while recognising that, will still demand from the present Minister the implementation of the rest of the scheme.  He has been in office now doodling for the past six and a half months, and the social welfare scheme which could have been introduced in a matter of weeks has still not seen the light of day.  In this Parliament to-day we have had the disgraceful performance of 66 Deputies deciding that they do not want to work, and adjourning the Parliament for a fortnight when urgent work needs to be done, such as the introduction of the social welfare scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pertinent for us at this stage to inquire when the Minister, armed as he is with a secretary and adviser, proposes to implement the rest of the inter-Party programme in relation to social services.  What we have got in this Bill, and what we are voting to-night, is merely the minimum promised by the inter-Party programme and policy, and it is only being introduced by the Minister <Col N="304" /> because he could not get out of doing it.  The rest of the scheme must be implemented or some alternative proposed by the Minister.  It is not wrong for us to point to the fact that over six months is sufficiently long for the Minister to shape the rest of the programme.  I know that he has had to bed it down with Deputy Cogan, Deputy Browne, Deputy Cowan and the rest of them, but surely by now they should have smoothed out their difficulties, and should be in a position to tell the House what their plan and policy are.</P>

      <P>Anybody who was in the House at the end of 1948 when Deputy Norton was amending the Workmen's Compensation Act, will remember that he said he was introducing a comprehensive insurance scheme and Deputy Larkin, as he said here, only accepted the amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act in the light of a promise that there was to be a comprehensive insurance Bill and that workmen's compensation was going to be dealt with in it.  Having kept that dangling before the inter-Party Government for three and a half years, he waited until they were going before the people to introduce the Bill and absolutely refused to consider passing these items on their own, although it could have been done in the space of a couple of hours or minutes, if necessary.  They did not form part of the original Bill but were incorporated because of questions put down by members of Fianna Fáil, <Col N="305" /> including myself, asking what was going to be done for these people. Now Deputy O'Higgins has the impudence to tell us that we had to do what they kept promising for years.</P>

May I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to explain this, if he would be good enough to do so, in connection with this Estimate?  On the evening of the day that he voted against the Social Security Bill, on the 3rd March last, he marched over with his colleagues to the Fianna Fáil headquarters <Col N="307" /> in Upper Mount Street and there and then produced an alternative scheme which was printed in the Irish papers the following day.  In view of what happened on the evening of the 3rd March&mdash;after they had examined their conscience, I presume&mdash;I want to know the cause of the delay in printing the Social Security Bill which he promised to produce to Deputies two weeks before we met yesterday.</P>

      <P>Old age pensions will be provided for under this.  It is my hope &mdash;and if the Minister does what I ask I will give him the credit that he has been good enough to do it&mdash;that the Minister may be able still further to increase the old age pension maximum allowance, in view of the tremendous increase in the cost of living.  He made a promise to the people on the evening of the 3rd March last year.  What is the cause of the delay now, when he has all these experts and in view of what he said, that he had a plan for the provision of a social security scheme, before he was voted out of office in February, 1948?  The Minister should take action in his own interests and particularly in the interests of the Party, which appears to be floundering in this matter on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but let me emphasise that it is only a step and that there are many more steps to be taken before we reach the payments to old age pensioners in the Six Counties.  If we are to hold out an inducement and encouragement to our fellow-countrymen across the Border, one of the matters which must be attended to is to bring up the social services, especially the old age pensions, to the level that is being paid there.  Our people are entitled to that consideration from the Minister.  When this half-crown was first mentioned, we were told it was only a step and that it could be accepted as <Col N="308" /> part payment of something better that was to come along.  In view of the purchasing power of money having been reduced so much that even with the extra half-crown the value of the pension is back to what it was before the half-crown was given, the Minister should now give another 2/6, 5/- or 10/-so that the old age pensioners might be able to purchase the foodstuffs they could purchase a year or two ago.  It will take another 10/- to do that.  No one is boasting about this extra half-crown to our own people who served the country so well in days gone by. I earnestly hope the Minister will find it possible to give a further increase, even if he does not touch the maximum that is paid across the Border.  If we increase it to the Northern level, it would be just a little encouragement to the older people in the Six Counties to consider sympathetically voting for the abolition of the Border.</P>
      <P>In this cold, wet weather the voucher that is given for turf&mdash;and they are getting wet turf&mdash;is of very little value.  I was wondering if it would not be possible for the Minister or the Government to give the old age pensioners a bag of coal instead of the wet turf taken from the dumps, for which they pay 9d. or 1/- per half-cwt.  They complain that that turf is of no value at all.  Perhaps it could be arranged through some organisation&mdash;his own, if possible&mdash;that the people would get a bag of coal a fortnight or even per month instead of the turf.  We have nothing to boast about and we are not going to complain, but I ask the Minister to consider a further increase in the pension, to enable those people to purchase the food they could purchase a year or two ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to ask the Minister two questions on which, if possible at this stage, he might give some information. I am informed that there is a residence qualification for the old age pension.  The particular example I have in mind is that of a person who has been out of this country for over 12 years.  This is a person who was born in this country and who, through force of circumstances had to seek employment in Great Britain.  That <Col N="309" /> person has now reached the age of 70 and in the normal course of events would qualify for an old age pension. I think it is rather harsh that the resident qualification of 12 years should be applied in her case because the last 10 or 12 years have not been what one might term normal times and unfortunately many people had to go across to Britain.  Now in their declining years they come back here and they are debarred from receiving the old age pension by reason of the fact that they have been 12 years away.  On the other hand they are citizens of this country, since they were born in this country.</P>
      <P>The other question which I wish to raise is in connection with fuel vouchers for old age pensioners.  I am informed&mdash;and I should like the Minister to enlighten me further for the benefit of some of my constituents &mdash;that since the extra half-crown was given, where a married couple are both receiving the old age pension, they receive between them only one fuel voucher as against two which they received heretofore.  I do not know whether that is the responsibility of the local authority which issues the voucher or whether it has come as a direction from the Minister.  I should like also to add my voice to that of Deputy Byrne&mdash;I refrain from any comment at all on the few remarks made by Deputy McGrath&mdash;in urging that the Minister, in view of the increased cost of living, should announce to old age pensioners that he is at least considering giving them an increase.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody in this House would expect the Minister to say straight off: &ldquo;Yes, I am going to give them another 2/6 or 5/-,&rdquo; but I think there should be some sort of indication that if the cost of living continues to increase at the same rate as it is increasing at present, strong consideration will be given to the claims of old age pensioners for an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy will agree that the £1 which the old age pensioner receives at present is altogether inadequate to meet ordinary needs.  When one considers the increase in the price of coal, milk and the various other commodities that are absolutely essential to <Col N="310" /> these old people, one must agree that these old age pensioners are entitled to better treatment from whatever Government is in power.  I think that in common with the increases given to other people in the country&mdash;wage-earners and people in receipt of superannuation from various sources&mdash;the old age pension should also be increased. We hear a lot of lip service paid to their claims and a lot of talk about the sacrifices they made and the respect which we owe to our elders, but the best way to show recognition of these facts is to give them some little financial assistance.  It is fortunate that there was so much discussion about the last Social Security Bill inasmuch as the old age pensioners were singled out for special treatment under that measure.  It is sometimes said that they are pawns in the political game, but I do not think anybody would object to that if it ultimately means that they gain something.  I do not at all object to the idea of political Parties bidding for their support, and of boasting of what they are doing for the old age pensioners because that means that anything that can be granted to them ultimately will be welcomed by all Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, members of all Parties will support this Estimate.  I have no intention of delaying the House on it except to say, in view of some of the remarks made by Deputy McGrath, that, if, we are to be sincere, it must be admitted by the present Minister, as it is admitted by people in the country, that since 1948, no matter how the Minister may seek to check the figures given by Deputy Davin, pensions have been increased from 10/- to 17/6.  It is true that some pensioners were getting 2/6 as a result of having to go to the dispensaries to the Home Assistance Officers but the plain fact is that the pension was increased in that period to 17/6.  We are glad to know that it has been since increased to £1 but it will not be denied that it was not just at election time that Deputy Norton said that the increase of 2/6 would be given.  The Second Stage of the important measure under which the increase was <Col N="311" /> to be given was being discussed at the time and there was no talk of a general election then.  I do not intend to go into the general question of social security but I should like the Minister to remember that he stated during the election campaign that neither he nor his Party was in favour of giving the old age pension at 65. Under the Bill introduced, and brought to its Second Stage by Deputy Norton, the inter-Party Government were committed to giving those sections who would automatically be covered by the Bill old age pensions at 65.  If Deputy Norton's Bill had gone through, and if there was not an election at that period, it would mean that not alone would the pensioners be getting £1 a week much earlier but that a large percentage of them would be enjoying the pension at 65 in the case of men and at 60 in the case of women.  It is well known, and it can be proved by checking the records of this House, that that Bill was introduced before there was any talk of an election.  Furthermore, it was made quite evident by many speakers that the increase of 2/6 to be granted under that Bill, bringing the pension up to £1, was not to be regarded as the maximum.  This is not the time to refer in detail to what the present Minister said in 1947, but he made it quite clear that neither he nor his Government was committed to giving a pension at the age at which the inter-Party Government were willing to give it.</P>

The Minister has our support in giving this 2/6.  I sincerely hope that in the future any opportunity that presents itself to improve the lot of the old age pensioner will find this House in full agreement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I spoke for two hours and I explained my attitude at the time. I do not think it is necessary to go into all that again now.  It is true that we voted against the Bill.  Deputy Davin, in his speech, said that I was one of the best men on the Government Benches: I do not know whether he meant that to be a compliment.  Deputy O'Higgins remarked that I have been in office now for six months and that I have not produced very much in that time.  I thought I could have brought in this complete Social Welfare Bill within six months.  I think Deputy Davin should not stress that, however, because Deputy Norton was three years in office before he did it.  I suppose, naturally, that Deputy Davin thinks Deputy Norton is a better man than I am.  He should, anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Deputy Norton said there was no scrap of paper, but when I went back to the Department and asked for my scheme they handed it to me.  They were able to hand it to me, and yet Deputy Norton could not see it.  In 1948, the Labour Party published their scheme.  I was Minister for Social Welfare at the time.  I was able to get the figures and I found that it would cost £44,000,000.  That did not deter Deputy Davin and his colleagues.  It was nothing to them. They were ready to put it into operation.</P>

He cannot help it.  But it is different when Deputy O'Higgins says it, because he belongs to the Fine Gael Party, who took 1/- off the old age <Col N="314" /> pensions.  For the member of the Party which was so mean as to deduct 1/- from the old age pension to say to me: &ldquo;You brought this Bill in because you had to,&rdquo; is just turning the House into ridicule.</P>

But (c) was that the earnings of a <Col N="315" /> man over 70 would not be taken into account.  Did Deputy Norton attempt to embody that principle in legislation in the course of his three years in office?  Of course he did not.  It was all right for Deputy Davin to walk into the Division Lobby in 1947 and ask: &ldquo;Which way am I to vote?&rdquo; He voted with Fine Gael as he usually did, but he did not know what the motion was about.  I think Deputy Davin is an honest man and that he would not have voted for it if he knew what it was about.  But Deputy Norton never attempted to bring that into operation. A motion was brought up by Fine Gael, in their usual irresponsible way when there is another Government in office, saying that the earnings of a man over 70 should not be taken into account.  Of course, it was the most ridiculous motion ever brought in, and I naturally voted against it.</P>

Every time that the subject of social welfare comes up here either Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin tells the House about my voting against a motion in 1947 for improving the means test for old age pensioners.  Of course I did, and I would vote against it any time you bring it in.  Deputy Norton voted for it, but he was Minister for Social Welfare for three and a half years and he did nothing about it.  I am sure that if he were Minister for another ten years he would do nothing about it.  Yet the Labour Party quoted as an injustice against the old age pensioners that I voted against it.

I do not say the scheme will be the same as Deputy Norton's, but I say that it will be quite evident when I bring the scheme before the Dáil that Deputy Norton was making a very wild guess when he said it would cost £10,000,000.  It will be nothing like that.  We could not afford that amount of money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne said that he hoped this was only a step.  I suppose that is true &mdash;probably it is.  Deputy Byrne also said that there was an increase of 10/- a week in the cost of food.

      <P>&ldquo;He or she must have resided in the State for an aggregate period of 30 years.  In the case of an Irish citizen not less than six years or in the case of any other person not less than 16 years of that period must be after 50 years of age.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As far as the person mentioned by Deputy Corish is concerned, if the person has lived for 30 years in the aggregate in this country and has been here for six years between 50 and 70 years of age he should be eligible for a pension on the residence test at any rate.</P>

      <P>Of the 30 years, six must be between 50 and 70 years of age. However, if the Deputy thinks it should be amended we can consider that when we come to the Social Welfare Bill.  As to the fuel vouchers, it is not true that any change has been made since the 2/6 extra was given. The same conditions apply and these conditions have been circulated to the local authorities concerned year after <Col N="318" /> year.  It is a matter for the local authority to make its own conditions. Some local authorities make different conditions from others.  I could not say, unless Deputy Corish were to ask a question about it, whether there is a change in any particular town or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Deputy Corish also made the point that £1 is not sufficient for a man or woman to keep himself or herself.  The way I look at these social welfare schemes is that I think it could be argued that an old person could not keep himself on £1 a week.  I am afraid we have to admit that it is not sufficient, but the hope always is that with £1 per week some relative will give him a little assistance to help him over his difficulties, or, if the person is absolutely destitute, the local authority must come in with some contribution from home assistance.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We must be clear with regard to another matter because Deputy Desmond has not stated the position correctly.  The old age pension was 10/- up to 1947.  In 1947, when I was Minister for Social Welfare, we gave an increase in all the ranges of the social services.  As far as the old age pensioner is concerned, the increase was 2/6 in the rural areas and 5/- in the urban areas.  In addition to that, in the rural areas it was arranged, if you like, that where the local authority thought that a recipient of an old age pension was not getting sufficient they could give an extra 2/6 and the central authority would recoup the local authority in that case to the extent of 80 per cent., I think it was. I know that the local authority was recouped a large percentage.</P>

      <P>Well, that is the position anyway, and I suppose there is not much use in arguing about it.  The last thing I want to refer to is this. Deputy O'Higgins said that the Bill was brought in and the people of the country could thank the Coalition Government for it.  Well, now he is absolutely right.  It was the Coalition Government, and not the Department of Social Welfare, because it was the only Bill that I have known in the last 30 years of Government in this country which did not originate in the Department.  I asked for the file of this Old Age Pensions Bill to see what were the views expressed by the various Departments on it, and to my amazement, and for the first time, I read that a direction came from the Government to the Department to say: &ldquo;You are to bring in a Bill on the following lines.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is all right, but it was the only occasion during 30 years where that was done, where the Government said: &ldquo;We will give 2/6 a week increase to the old age pensioners and tell the Social Welfare Department to get it done.&rdquo;  It was the only occasion on which that was done in the last 30 years.  It was the only occasion on which it was done by the Coalition Government and, of <Col N="321" /> course, we know why.  It was done just before the Bill was brought into the Dáil, when there was a break in the Coalition Party.  The Government considered the matter, and found that the only thing they could do was to increase the old age pensions and say, as Deputy Davin said to me tonight&mdash;it is the old argument used against recalcitrant Deputies: &ldquo;Are you going to vote against the increase for the old age pensioners?&rdquo;  That is what kept them together up to a certain stage, but they broke eventually.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Underdevelopment of National Resources&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Debate resumed on the following motion in the names of Deputy MacBride and Deputy Tully:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Realising that our national resources are underdeveloped because of chronic underinvestment in our own country, and further realising that emigration and unemployment, which are destructive of family life and of the family unit, upon which Christian society is founded, flow from this underdevelopment of our resources, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the financial policy hitherto pursued, whereby the major portion of the savings of the nation is invested in Britain, should be discontinued in order that credits adequate for the development of our resources and for the provision of housing and other necessary services for our people should be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out last night, when this motion was under discussion, that I could understand the point of view of those who, until the different devaluations took place, considered that the wise policy was to export the savings of the nation and invest them in England.  I could understand that viewpoint, though I do not agree with it, for a number of considerations to which I referred; but I do submit that the time has not merely arrived, but has passed, when that policy should be considered in the light of existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties which I have found in considering this question, or in preparing material for this discussion, is the lack of information which is available concerning sterling assets.  I do not know why there should be a reluctance on the part of the Department of Finance to make the information available in the normal way, but it seems to me there is some shyness or reluctance in regard to it.  The figures which are usually given concerning this country's holding of sterling assets are usually incomplete, or are what are termed by <Col N="323" /> the Department of Finance the &ldquo;net&rdquo; sterling assets.  I do not know exactly how the figure is arrived at, but I understand that, in computing the figures, the total gross assets are arrived at and that therefrom are deducted the holdings and the value of any property held by a firm not registered in the country.  I understand that many large firms, which are certainly regarded as Irish firms and which carry on the bulk of their business here, are nevertheless registered in England and their assets are deducted from the holdings of sterling assets which this country has.</P>
    <P>We have certain quite definite figures in this respect.  We know that on 31st March last the Central Bank held £80.6 million.  We know that the Government itself, in addition to the moneys held by the Central Bank, held £56.7 million.  We know also that the eight associated banks held £252.1 million. We know that very considerable sums were held by other firms by persons and by insurance companies in sterling assets.  Though I have put down repeated questions to the Government on that issue I have failed to elicit any information.  I believe that that information must be available in some form in the Department of Finance. Possibly it may not be available in a very accurate form, but it must certainly be available in sufficient form to enable an estimate to be made.</P>
    <P>From estimates that were made some three or four years ago by reputable economists here I think it would probably be an underestimate to say that &ldquo;other firms and persons&rdquo; hold at the present time something in the neighbourhood of another £160,000,000 in sterling assets, making a total, if that figure be correct, of £549.4 million.  It is quite true that there are some British firms which have assets here. It is quite true there are certain calls that can be made.  But, from the point of view of an examination of investment policy, I think that what really matters is the amount of money which we as a nation have actually invested in Britain.</P>
    <P>What I say now is not by way of criticism of this Government in particular. <Col N="324" /> It is a criticism of all the Governments that have operated since this State was established.  By investing every penny of its money in England the Central Bank has, in my view, set a headline which will naturally be followed by the ordinary commercial banks.  The Government, by investing £56,000,000 in British securities, has also set a headline which will inevitably be followed by the banks and other investors here.</P>
    <P>I should point out that an interesting change has taken place in the holdings of sterling assets over a number of years.  The percentage of sterling assets held by the Government and by the Central Bank has increased.  I do not mean now an increase in terms of money; such an increase would take place because of the depreciation in the value of money and the increase in assets.  But there has been a percentage increase in relation to the total holdings.  For instance, the total holdings of the Government and the Central Bank in 1939 constituted 11 per cent. of the total sterling assets.  By 1949 that had risen to 25 per cent. of the total.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of that policy by our Department of Finance and by the Central Bank sets, in my opinion, a very bad headline and is responsible in no small measure for the fact that the country now suffers from underinvestment. I want to make it quite clear&mdash;and I trust the Minister will not try to misrepresent what I say, as has been done on several occasions&mdash;that the view I have expressed can be translated conveniently into the slogan: Break the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;link with sterling&rdquo; is not the one particular economic connection we have with Britain.  We are a member of the sterling area.  I do not think we can change that.  I think that is something partly geographical and partly due to the economic and trade relations we have with Great Britain.  I do not think we can alter that position at the present time.  I regard as much more important than that particular connection the fact that we utilise our savings by investing them outside the country instead of at home.  That is the more harmful part of what constitutes the &ldquo;link with sterling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> I said yesterday that it is difficult to have an objective discussion on these issues.  I do not think a democratic form of government lends itself to economic planning of a long-term nature.  I do not say that by way of criticism of democratic government. It stands to reason, however, that governments are not always composed of people who know and understand economics or who have made a study of the economic problems of the country.  As is inevitable in politics, persons are very often elected for reasons far removed from economic issues.  Possibly they may be elected because they are able to make a good speech or because they Lave influence in some particular quarters of certain political Parties, or very often through historical accidents that place them in a position where they capture public imagination.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that in derogation or by way of criticism of democratic government or of those who elect them, but I think we can accept it as a reasonable proposition that a democratically elected Government will not necessarily produce a set of economists or even one good economist among the lot.</P>
    <P>As well as that, democratic Governments are not everlasting.  They change from time to time, sometimes frequently; sometimes they can remain in office for a long period.  Therefore, it is very hard to evolve a carefully planned economic policy unless it is agreed to by all sides, and unless some system of ensuring continuous development of that policy is established.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me that we should aim at reaching agreement upon certain fundamentals of our economy, and that we should entrust a national economic council with the task of implementing that policy in conjunction with the Government of the day. The economic council would be a continuous link, if you like, in the development of our economic policy.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that a proposal of that kind has difficulties, but I think that the difficulties could be overcome if we could reach agreement on the absolute necessity of pursuing a vigorous policy of investment in the country, and if we could rid ourselves <Col N="326" /> of this chronic desire, I may call it, that there has been to send all the savings of this country for investment in England.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in the course of a speech recently, referred to the inadvisability of allowing this country to be the pet of any other country, or to place itself under the economic domination of any other country.  I am sure we can all readily agree with those sentiments, but I could not help wishing at the time I read that particular speech that it was not aimed at the fact that our economy had been kept subservient to the British economy.  I feel that it is very hard to consider that we have economic independence so long as we are in effect a pawn in the British financial machine, so long as all our assets are tied up and we are so dependent on the British economic machine.  My only regret was that that particular statement was not an indication that the present Government intended to alter their course in that respect.</P>
    <P>Whether we want to increase agricultural production or whether we want to increase industrial production, the first essential is to be in a position to invest the amount of capital necessary in order to increase production. In the case of land it is a question of enabling the farmers to acquire the necessary machinery, fertilisers, grain, seed and so on that they need for their farms.  In the case of industries it is a question of providing the capital necessary in order to create new industries or to expand existing industries.</P>
    <P>There is not very much to be gained by talking about the need for greater production output unless we are prepared to have sufficient self-confidence to invest our own resources in the country and invest them fully in the country.  Undoubtedly, it would have been much simpler if this process had been carried on more vigorously and with more determination in the course of the last 30 years, but it would be better to start putting such a policy into effect now than to wait until we have no capital left.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, in dealing with these matters, will approach the <Col N="327" /> whole problem objectively.  I know that a great many arguments can be put in favour of maintaining large sterling balance in England.  I think that most of these arguments have practically disappeared in the course of the last few years.</P>
    <P>I may avail of this opportunity to say that we all hope that the Minister for Finance will be successful in the course of his visit to London.  It occurred to me that he has a number of cards in his hand which are of value. One of the very real factors contributing to the present unbalance in our trade is the fact that Britain failed in her deliveries of coal to this country, failed to carry out the letter and the spirit of the trade treaty into which she entered.  As a result of that failure, this country was forced to expend vast sums of hard currency, principally dollars, in order to purchase coal elsewhere.  There would be some justification if Britain's failure to deliver coal was due simply to the fall in her coal output, but on examination one finds that while Britain failed to deliver coal to this country she was exporting vast quantities of coal, far in excess of her treaty obligations to us, to other countries with whom she had no comparable treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>She exported that coal to the Argentine, to Brazil, and to a number of other countries throughout the world in return for hard currency, and in some cases for commercial advantages.  In other words, she supplied the coal which she had undertaken to supply to this country to other countries in return for hard currency, and forced us into outside markets, as a result of which we have had, over the last 12 months, to haul across the Atlantic coal at very high prices.  It occurs to me that that is one of the matters to which the Minister for Finance in his forthcoming discussions with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, might refer on the question of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Another cause for the present unbalance of payments arises from the practice of dual pricing pursued by Britain for a number of years, as a <Col N="328" /> result of which we have had to pay a higher price for coal than is charged on her home markets, while we get a lower price for our agricultural exports than the price she pays to her own farmers.  I think I might also draw attention here to the vast sums of money which we accumulated in Britain during the war&mdash;accumulated by reason of our supplying goods to Britain.  Now we have little or no prospect of ever securing the full value of those goods by reason of the depreciation in the value of money since.  I feel it is no exaggeration to say that the money accumulated during that period has since depreciated by at least 50 per cent. in purchasing power. Therefore, in effect, we shall receive only half payment for the goods which we supplied to Britain during the war, when she needed them badly.  I merely mention these matters as I am sure that every Party in the House would like to feel that the Minister for Finance will receive the backing of the country in any steps he takes to ensure that we secure complete freedom of action in regard to our sterling balances.  There is not very much more which I could add to what I have already said.  I hope it will be possible to continue this debate in an objective atmosphere.</P>

      <P>When one considers the difficulty of getting money to finance the building of houses in this country and when one is made aware of the millions invested abroad I think the matter is beyond explanation.  I am not blaming any one Government for this situation.  I am blaming all the Governments who have had the responsibility of the administration of this country from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read recently that the United Nations had published a statistical study made by the World Health <Col N="329" /> Organisation of World population.  Of the 52 countries surveyed, we are the only one whose population has been reduced since 1900 and is still reducing.  Although the population of the world is increasing by 60,000 per day since 1945 we are the only country the population of which has reduced and is still on the downward trend. One would ask a very pertinent question: what is the cause of that, seeing that we have only a miserable population of not even 3,000,000 people in the country?  The Taoiseach made a statement in this House 17 years ago that our country could support a population of 17,000,000 and give them a standard of living higher than our people ever enjoyed.  The Taoiseach went on to say: &ldquo;I stand by that statement because I believe that the resources of this country could maintain a population of 17,000,000.&rdquo; Is it not time we asked ourselves why is it we cannot give a higher standard of living to the 3,000,000 people we have in the country at the moment having regard to the resources at our disposal?</P>
    <P>I asked a question here yesterday with a view to finding out the amount of money paid as interest on the overdraft of one organisation of this country, namely, Fuel Importers, Ltd. It is an appalling state of affairs that 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. interest is being paid on this money while we have £116,000,000 invested in England at less than 1 per cent. interest.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister for Finance in his reply what is the justification for that.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I was listening to the Minister for Education speaking in Cork.  I heard him say he was appalled at the conditions of our national schools.  I do not wonder he was appalled, or anybody else who knows anything about them.  The Minister said that the main difficulty with regard to the schools was finance.  Am I to be told that while we have £56,000,000 invested in England by Departments of State and £80,000,000 invested there by the Central Bank that finance should be an obstacle to building decent schools for our children?</P>
    <P>When we in the Cork Corporation <Col N="330" /> made an appeal for funds in April of last year&mdash;the amount we asked for was £500,000&mdash;all we got from the investing public and from the banks was £120,000 and the State had to make up the balance.  We are paying 4 per cent. interest on that money.</P>
    <P>What is the position as regards housing in Cork?  We received a statement from the City Manager the week before last telling us that the rent on new houses there is going to be 40/-per week.  We are also informed that the loan charge on a four-roomed house will be £65 per annum and on a five-roomed house £73 per annum. Therefore, the loan charges on these houses range from 25/- to 30/- per week. Then we have all the money I am referring to invested in England at 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is wrong is that we have not yet studied this question or got a real opportunity of discussing it without political prejudice.  I would suggest that the time has arrived when the best minds of the country should be brought together to discuss this all-important question.  I want to say this, that if the British Empire went into dust to-morrow morning the resources of this country and the capacity of our people to supply goods and services would have to be maintained by the people of this country.  Some people think this crisis in England was a very recent affair.  Anybody who studied the matter knows that the financial system broke down as a result of the 1914-18 war and it was then built up on the old model.  It has now been shattered beyond repair.  Why should we be tied to a country and invest money there when it is tottering and tumbling and when the only guarantee we have is bombs, guns and every other weapon of destruction?</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that instead of farmers being helped to get cheap money their interest is being increased by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I think we have talked about this matter long enough and the only thing to be done is that the best minds of the country, understanding the problem properly, should be brought together with a view to making the necessary changes to build up this <Col N="331" /> country on the credit of the country, and that is, the land, our harbours, man-power, ships and everything else, including the capacity of our people to produce goods.  That is the wealth that should be looked after and not the fiction of money.  We are living under a money economy which has us where we are to-day.</P>
    <P>I hope that the best brains in the country will be called together to solve these problems.  I do not mean that there should be a large number of men, but there are men who understand what needs to be done.  I believe that representatives of all Parties in this House could contribute a certain amount of knowledge to the problem and I hope political prejudice will not stand in the way of putting this country where it deserves to be at the moment in the eyes of the world.</P>

      <P>With the conversations that are pending between the Minister for Finance and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, I think it is fortunate that an opportunity arises to discuss certain economic issues in regard to which it is eminently desirable that the Minister for Finance, representing our people, should feel his hand strengthened by a considerable measure of support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable to recapitulate certain events that have transpired in the recent past.  Deputy Hickey and Deputy MacBride often speak with great doubt of the desirability of the sterling link.  I have no doubt about the desirability of the maintenance of a link in parity with sterling, because I believe a primary necessity it serves in this country is that of those of our people who live and get their living on the land.  Any fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the currency which is legal tender in this country and the currency of the country to which 85 per cent. of our exports go would inevitably react unfavourably on our farmers, who in that exchange are invariably sellers.  It is common knowledge that in a situation of fluctuating exchanges it is always the seller who suffers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am merely dissociating myself from what I think Deputy Hickey hankers after, and that is, severance of the sterling link. I agree with the Minister for Finance and those in this House, including our own colleague, the ex-Minister for Finance, that there are considerations which make maintenance of the sterling link a matter of great importance to our people and, I think, in fact a matter of complete indifference to the British people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to recall certain facts in regard to the monetary relations between Ireland and Great Britain which may be called in question in the immediate future and might be gravely detrimental to our economic interests, if these facts were not recorded as being matters of substantial agreement by Deputies on all sides of the House.  My understanding of the matter is that when in 1939 Great Britain suspended the convertibility of sterling there was an approach by the British Treasury to the Irish Government asking the Irish Government to forbear from any attempt to convert on a large scale British securities and currency under its control into dollars and that if they would consent to forbear from that procedure the British Treasury would hold itself liable to provide from their resources the normal requirements of the Irish Government for dollars in exchange for sterling in the years that lay ahead.  From 1939 to 1948 90 per cent. of the purchases which we made in the dollar area were financed by dollars provided by the British Treasury in exchange for sterling. In 1948, after we had been sometime in office, the House will remember there was an acute crisis and on that occasion representations were made by the then Chancellor of the British Exchequer that their sterling pool's dollar difficulties were then so great that he requested the Irish Government, in view of the fact that Marshall Aid was forthcoming, to restrict their dollar requirements to the dollars made available under the Marshall Plan and our own earning.  But my recollection is that while expressing ready willingness to help in the <Col N="333" /> general scheme of the Marshall Plan, the ultimate aim of which is to restore convertibility to all currencies, we specifically reserved the right to the drawings on the sterling pool for dollars to which we were entitled under the 1939 understanding and in consideration of which our predecessors had exercised a prudent restraint in the use of dollars.</P>
    <P>If my recollection be correct the British Chancellor of the Exchequer's reply was: &ldquo;You cannot take blood from a turnip or water from a stone.&rdquo; But should the need for dollars over and above our Marshall Aid availabilities become pressing he did not doubt that dollars could be found if the Irish Government took the view as a matter of grave consequence that supplementary dollars should be made available. I think I am right in saying that since that discussion in 1948 the Irish Government never effectively drew dollars from the sterling pool.  In the ordinary operations of Marshall Aid, I believe it is quite a common thing for dollars to be advanced for a fortnight until dollars came through the pipeline of Marshall Aid to replace them. I do not think there was any effective reduction of dollars in the sterling pool by any demands made by the Irish Government up to the time we left office.  I do not doubt that it will be the aim of every sane Government in the world which values liberty to help in any way it can to restore convertibility of sterling with the other currencies of the world and economic equilibrium in international trade.  But while feeling ourselves associated in sympathy with all other countries who share that objective, it is right&mdash;I have no doubt the Minister for Finance will feel this too&mdash;to bear in mind that our duty is to our own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And while eager and willing to collaborate with all other countries of a common mind, it would be wrong for us to take up the position that there is any equitable claim in Great Britain or the United States of America, or any of the Common wealth countries, to call upon us to make extreme sacrifices because we must not <Col N="334" /> lose sight of the fact that in this matter we are the creditors.</P>
      <P>I profoundly regret that we should have had in this country a six months' campaign by the Government to create the impression that this country is bankrupt and a beggar at every man's door.  We are not the debtors in this situation.  Our position is that we are very large creditors of the sterling pool.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure we are in a helpless condition because, owing to the prescience of the Government that has just left office, we have accumulated pretty valuable stocks of raw materials and a great deal of machinery which, were you to buy it now, would cost us 50 per cent. more than we paid for it and which will help in some way to insulate our people against any extreme shock that might be waiting.  But what is most important, it is machinery, equipment and fertilisers that at this moment are enabling our people to produce more of the commodities which are saleable, if needs be on barter, in any country in the world.</P>
      <P>I look back with rejoicing to the fact that last October 12 months we sent for the newspaper editors of this country and told them that we were about to throw the trade balance of this country into dramatic disequilibrium in order to procure for our people, while they were still procurable, essential raw materials, essential amenities such as drugs and bandages, and especially hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of heavy machinery, with which to expedite the rehabilitation of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we have 200,000 acres of land rehabilitated or in the process of rehabilitation, every one of which is going to be fit this year to make its contribution to the earning of foreign exchange, if needs be, in a currency other than sterling, provided equitable arrangements are proposed in London in a fortnight.  These goods will be available for sale for sterling, provided it is quite clear that any restrictions on the use of those sterling balances will be for us to determine and not <Col N="335" /> for the people to whom our goods are consigned.</P>
    <P>Let us face this fact, Sir&mdash;and there are a good many of my colleagues in the House who will think it rude to say so&mdash;in the last analysis, the existence of this free Parliament and the liberty of every individual citizen of this State depends on the survival of the Anglo-American axis in the world. Individual liberty and free democracy are to-day an arch, one pillar of which rests on the United States of America and the other on the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Should either of those foundations crumble, free democracy and individual liberty will perish not only in the United States of America and Great Britain, but in Ireland and in every free country in the world as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would involve the sterling link and the liability of sterling.  It would obviously be madness to invest further in a currency which we contemplate collapsing.</P>
      <P>I am making the case that subject to certain reservations we should accept sterling and continue to accept and maintain the sterling link because the collapse of the viability of sterling would involve so much more that I feel that the cause of freedom itself would be involved and that, I do not believe, is going to founder, but unlike Deputy Hickey I am glad that the struggle to maintain it has so far been kept far away from our shores.  I would view the prospect of having to endure Cominform aggression with consternation and dismay.  I think that Deputy Hickey is falling into a complete mistake in maintaining that cheap money is an unqualified blessing.</P>

      <P>Cheap money for general use can be like a boomerang and can very often ultimately operate to injure most those whom it was intended most to serve.  I think that there is an alternative which is very commonly overlooked.  While the rates of interest which should appropriately be associated with ordinary commercial transactions may be arguable, I am blowed if I can understand why the State or a municipality must be compelled to deal with the source of money on the same basis as an entrepreneur whose contact with the money market has no other purpose than the perfectly legitimate aim of earning profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be a desirable thing in certain circumstances that interest rates on commercial borrowing should rise and at other times fall, but how can anyone <Col N="337" /> argue that if the Government, acting in the name of the community, purchases £1,000,000 worth of coal as a national reserve for bank directors, bank managers, bank clerks, charwomen, farmers, trade unionists, railway workers, rentiers and every other section of the community, then on that £1,000,000 there should be paid annually in interest to a joint stock bank £350,000 or £250,000?  If a municipality or the Government determined that for the preservation of the social order and decent conditions of society it is necessary to build houses for the accommodation of the people who must otherwise continue to dwell in condemned buildings, why, in the time between the cost being paid to the contractor to build the houses and the time the redemption fund derived from the rent has accumulated to obliterate the loan, should the people of Ireland pay to any individual 3½ per cent. on the capital involved?</P>

      <P>After the close of <Col N="338" /> the debate which took place this afternoon to adjourn this House until this day fortnight, Deputy O. Flanagan was in the restaurant talking to another Deputy, Deputy Dillon, when a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Flynn, came behind him, caught hold of him, turned him round, used a very offensive and obnoxious expression and struck him violently in the mouth, alleging that he had during the debate spoken about him, Deputy Flynn.  He also assaulted an usher, one of the servants of the House, and was guilty of extremly offensive conduct.  He also made offensive references to another Deputy, Deputy Collins.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity for me, a Chinn Chomhairle&mdash;and I am sure you will agree&mdash;to underline the importance of dealing with a matter of that kind. I would make no comment on it at the moment.  I have tried to give you and the House a bare outline in as objective a fashion as I can of the complaint that was made to me.  As leader of the Opposition it then became my duty to inform you, so that you, a Chinn Chomhairle, would take the necessary action and direct the proper steps to be taken.  It is a matter entirely for you, as custodian of the privileges of this House, its dignity, its decorum and its order.  It is not for me to suggest the course to be taken.  If I were to suggest any course I would say that it is a matter entirely for you, a matter so serious that it can only be dealt with by the Ceann Comhairle in person, a matter of such great consequence that action must be taken, and in view of the long adjournment of the Dáil I think it is my duty to inform you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey referred to the charge imposed on the weekly rent of a municipal house by the interest rate payable by a local authority for the money it cost to build it.  I should like to hear anybody argue the justice or equity of the people, through their public representatives, being required to pay for the use of <Col N="342" /> their own money.  Eighty per cent of the money in circulation in this country and in every modern society is bank money.  I should be grateful to somebody in this House who would expound for me the ethical or economic justification for asking the people to pay a limited group of persons, to wit, shareholders in joint stock banks, £35 a year for the right to use £1,000 of their own money.</P>
      <P>A municipal house to-day may cost up to £1,500.  Leave out altogether the annual allocation for the redemption of capital.  If the municipality has to borrow that money at 4 per cent., the interest on the money required to build that house amounts to £60 per year which the tenant must pay, except in so far as the taxpayer pays it.  If it is the tenant, a weekly rent of approximately 22/- is payable by the tenant for no other reason than that the normal banking system of the country is used to discharge the debt due to the contractor on completion of the house and his delivery of it to the municipal authority.  There is no question of security and no question of any danger of the capital not being repaid.</P>
      <P>It is merely the period of time over which the Legislature determines in its own wisdom that it is expedient to repay the capital.  This strange fact is true that while it is regarded as axiomatic that money borrowed by a Government on which a municipality builds houses should be liable to this charge, from the moment that the three great societies of the world became involved in war and similar accommodation had to be procured in order to pay the armament manufacturer for the tanks and guns, no one contended that for an outlay of that kind the Government should be asked to pay&mdash;and none is paid.  A management charge of something between I and 1? per cent is payable because there is no cheaper way of getting the accounts checked and that percentage meets the legitimate cost of the banking system in administering these loan accounts on Government account.  The rate payable on such borrowing is ruled by the ascertained cost, as near as they can go, to the banking system for keeping the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Now, famous bankers of the 19th century have said that it was a dispensation of Providence that the average man could be depended upon never to unravel the mystery of money and credit and that, therefore, those who control it were in a position of absolute safety.  They were mistaken in that belief.  The average man does understand in very large degree the workings of money and credit.  But here is our danger: the average man understands it in large degree but there is no subject on which the aphorism is more true, that &ldquo;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&rdquo;. The moment the problem of money and credit begins to appear simple and obvious to an average man, you may assume that he is either daft or stupid. The more this problem is studied and understood the more its infinite complexities confront the inquirer.  I do not purport to follow the theory of money to its source.  An attempt of that kind could not be encompassed in a book of less than 400 pages.  For Deputy Hickey's information, I may mention that Geoffrey Crowther wrote a very good one, which the Deputy might with profit peruse.</P>
    <P>I am simply applying my mind, and I am inviting the House to turn its mind, to one simple facet of the larger problem to-night.  I urge the Minister for External Affairs to make the case, if it can be made, for requiring the community to pay 3½ or 4 per cent on its own money to provide essentials without which the community cannot properly function.  When he has done that I ask him to enlighten my darkness on the issue of how it can be right, proper and orthodox to furnish the Government with money at 1? per cent to defend the public and the community from external aggression, but to forbid the community to avail of a similar amenity when the war is against disease and destitution.  Let us make a note of this, for it goes to the heart of the matter that we are talking about, the borrowing of capital sums is an operation which predicates a redemption sinking fund to be raised annually from the revenue of the community.  You cannot substitute credit for revenue, but if your revenue <Col N="344" /> is sufficient to provide a redemption annuity for a capital borrowing there is no reason to make that annual charge more than that by adding to it an interest charge for the benefit of a few at the expense of the community to which that few owe their very existence and their opportunity of carrying on with the banking operation, the services of which the community proposes to avail of.</P>
    <P>There is a last matter to which, I think, the Government might properly turn its mind.  When the Central Bank Act was enacted I think a section was inserted therein providing that, in respect of the currency reserve, 100 per cent. cover in the form of British securities or British legal tender was to be maintained, subject to the proviso that if the board of the bank took the initiative in proposing to the Government that a proportion of that currency reserve should be invested in Irish securities, and if the Minister for Finance gave his approval, the board would be entitled so to invest.  The very insertion of that section in the Central Bank Act demonstrates clearly that those who were responsible for it envisaged conditions in which such a departure might with propriety be made.  In one long answer which the Minister for Finance gave to a question relating to that matter, he spoke of the Central Bank as the bank of the last resort.  How you can have a bank of last resort without a money market such as functions in the City of London, in the sense of that term, is something that baffles me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the term &ldquo;lender of last resort,&rdquo; it means that <Col N="345" /> where the money market, the bill market, fails to get money from any of its usual sources&mdash;its own capital, its own deposits, the joint stock banks&mdash;it may discount its Treasury bills with the Bank of England; but the restriction on that is that, if they go to the bank of England for that accommodation, they are charged not the market rate but the bank rate, which is usually 1 to 1¼ per cent. above the accommodation rate from the joint stock bank or the discount houses.  Now, a lender of last resort, in the position of the Bank of England, must be ready on demand effectively to encash for the bill market of the city where it functions, all the Treasury bills outstanding in the hands of the bill market, if for some reason the ordinary bank houses, such as the joint stock banks or the other financial institutions of the city, are temporarily unwilling or unable to provide the bill market with the liquid resources which are required.  There is no money market in Dublin, and there is not any machinery analogous to a money market in Dublin.  How then is the person for whom the Central Bank is the lender of last resort, in the sense I have outlined, which is the sense that imposes on the Central Bank the duty of high liquidity, to obtain these facilities?  The only duty I know of devolving on our Central Bank which envisages the possibility of a rapid production of legal tender, is carrying out of its undertaking when there is a run on the bank to convert Irish currency into sterling. The method by which we maintain sterling is the undertaking on the face of our note that if any one brings that note to our agent in London, our agent will give him a Bank of England note.  So far as I know the essential liquidity can only arise in that context, but if Deputies will only stop to think for a moment, our currency at present is to the order of £58,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose every single note of our currency were transported by boat or aeroplane&mdash;and, mind you, they would have to be transported to England because the obligation to pay English notes only arises at our agent's office&mdash; and people drove to our agent's office in London with pantechnicons full of currency notes.  The office does not <Col N="346" /> open until 10 o'clock.  They would then have to carry in the currency, mountains of it, and the cashier would have to start thumb-counting it, note by note, working to the best of his ability to count 58,000,000 notes.  I reckon that, counting as fast as he could, and even taking his dinner at the desk, he could not hope to count the amount in less than six weeks, working a full day, and, remember, he would then have to count the other stuff out.  The stock exchange accounting period is three weeks.  Even if a run began on the first day of the account, the British Government being a rational sensible institution, does not want £50,000,000 of its war loan sold on the British stock exchange on a Monday morning. As the British Government disposes of funds in its own various Government accounts of several thousand millions, does anybody seriously suggest that if a queue formed outside the office of our agent in London and claimed conversion of these notes, the agent would say: &ldquo;There is £50,000,000 of war loan here; we shall have to go to the Government stockbroker in Lombard Street and say to him: &lsquo;Dispose of that and issue £50,000,000 in English notes, because there are so many lunatics who want to change our notes into your notes?&rsquo;&rdquo; You can then imagine a line of steel vans drawing up at the agent's office, packed to the roof with Bank of England notes, the poor citizen sitting inside the office of our agent counting the Irish notes in and counting the British notes out, and a notice hanging outside the door saying: &ldquo;Let nobody in the queue fear; there is £50,000,000 in notes packed in under the desk here and as fast as we can go to it we shall pay you.  Meanwhile, if anyone wants an umbrella or a rug to keep himself warm, we shall be glad to supply it, and we shall give you camp stools if you require them.&rdquo;  That is a literal description, as I understand it, of the sterling link as at present operated.</P>
    <P>The way the sterling link is maintained by our Government is that if anyone offers a pound note to the Central Bank of Ireland and asks a British pound note for it he will get it, and we maintain our agent in London to do that.  If you want to <Col N="347" /> hold the Irish Government to that undertaking the way you do it is to bring your note to the agent's office in London, where you are entitled to get British currency for it.  Thus, for every pound note a cattle dealer pays out or that a shopkeeper receives, if he wants to purchase something in England with it, he can go and get a Bank of England note and pay for whatever he wants in England with the proceeds.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that the Central Bank of Ireland required to maintain a high degree of liquidity because it was a lender of last resort. So far as I know, its functions as a lender of last resort can only come into operation under the circumstances I have described&mdash;far different from the position of the Bank of England which, as I have tried to explain, is a lender of last resort to the money market in the City of London, while it is true that, even as a last resort, in the limited sense that that term applies to the Central Bank of Ireland, it must maintain a genuine and real readiness to redeem the promise printed on the front of our note&mdash;and there must be no hugger-mugger about it.  The question is whether it is necessary to maintain the whole of the currency reserve in British Government securities because that operates to leave us with a very modest return on a large capital sum at a time when we ourselves find it necessary to borrow.  But if wise heads remain convinced that the preservation of certainty in regard to the convertibility of our currency with British currency depends on 100 per cent. currency reserve, surely the same wise heads will concede the desirability of accepting the principle that different interest rates should obtain for Government borrowing from the banking system from those rates which obtain for individual <i>entrepreneurs</i> seeking accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think that if the differential interest system were instituted, much of the objection that Deputy Hickey feels to the existing system of maintaining the currency reserve would disappear. My worry about all this business is <Col N="348" /> that the present system of monetary management here and in Great Britain and in other free countries, like every other human institution, is far from perfect, but it works and can be made to work much better without any radical or revolutionary upheaval in it. It has been made to work much better in Great Britain&mdash;and quietly and silently the character of the whole banking system in Great Britain has been revolutionised in the past ten years.</P>

The trouble is that all of us know that fundamentally Deputy Hickey is substantially right and if he goes lepping and nobody has a real heart to spancel him and hold him back because you have the feeling that, well, he has done everything he could do to achieve these reforms by argument and reason and that nobody would listen to him.  But when he goes lepping mad something begins to happen.  The danger is that, in the process of lepping mad around the country, people whose heads may be as soft as their hearts may tear down a very complex and delicately-balanced piece of social machinery, confident in their capacity to substitute something much more efficient, equitable and just, only to discover that when they have torn down a very complex thing which it has taken generations to build up, it is quite beyond their capacity or that of anybody else to put something in its place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy's Government did was to avoid taxing in order to avoid political unpopularity. They inflated, and the result of the inflation in this country was that the people were consuming more wealth than they were creating and drawing upon past savings, namely, the sterling assets.  That practice is as old as the hills.  Governments from the beginning, when they did not want to face the political unpopularity of collecting money or cutting down Government expenditure, either pulled in the coins and put out lighter coins, or pushed out some seashells, or created Government debt of some kind or another.  It was not a new idea that the former Minister for Finance hit upon, when he could not get his Party to stand for collecting money they should have collected, to borrow and to spend funds like the Post Office Savings Bank's funds and the Marshall Aid funds which were under his control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people will recognise what went on.  They have seen people having a good time in a pub, some fellow rapping and calling and then telling the bar-tender to &ldquo;put it on the slate&rdquo;.  That lasted for the three years of the Coalition Government. The Minister for Finance rapped and called and he &ldquo;put it on the slate&rdquo;. We have to pay for it, and future generations will have to pay for it. <Col N="351" /> We have to pay extra £4.3 millions a year in interest and sinking fund because of the debt created by the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon comes along to-night and asks why we did not get money from the banks at 1? per cent. for State purposes.  The only money that was ever got from the banks here at 1? per cent. was got by myself.  I created the system whereby the Government could get money by means of Exchequer bills for three months at 1? per cent.  One of the first things that Deputy McGilligan did when he became Minister for Finance was to allow the banks to give State loans at 3¼ per cent. and then repay the Exchequer bills that were drawn at 1? per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride wants to know what moneys we have in sterling assets.  He gave a lot of figures which I do not propose to contest.  It is true that the Central Bank has £80,000,000 or £90,000,000 of sterling assets; that Government funds have £50,000,000 or £60,000,000; that the commercial banks have a couple of hundred millions; and I suppose other institutions and persons have probably another £100,000,000 or £200,000,000.  We have gross sterling assets of probably £ 400,000,000 £500,000,000 or £600,000,000.  Against that, however, we have various claims on us.  The best estimates I have seen &mdash;it was made unofficially because it cannot be done officially&mdash;was made by one of the officials of the Department of Finance.  That estimate was that, about 1949, we had net sterling assets of about £222,000,000.  We have spent a good deal since.  Therefore, our net must be very much less at the moment, nearly down to half.  If we continue for the next couple of years as we have been going it will be down to nil.</P>
    <P>I do not speak as a defender of last resort of sterling assets.  Deputy Dillon was talking about the lender of last resort.  We as a Government, from 1932 to 1948, often had to take decisions which might mean that our community would draw upon their savings outside the country.  We got a lot of abuse from Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and others during the 30's <Col N="352" /> for adopting that policy.  We were told that we would be ruined because we were spending a few millions per year more than we were producing.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride last night said that we should agree upon a common national economic policy; that we should have a review of the situation and see where we were going because we had not changed since 1921.  That is not true.  Deputy MacBride has been acting like Rip van Winkle.  There was a revolutionary change in 1932 in the economic and financial outlook of the country.  Before that time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were in office.  They were supported by a number of people whose attitude was that this country could only prosper if it produced goods for a single market and the type of goods wanted by that market.  Any idea of substituting imports by native production was the subject of great examination.  I remember that there was a proposition in the Cumann na nGaedheal time that we could at least produce our own prayer books.  The then Tariff Commission sat for two years considering that and they visited half a dozen countries to see whether or not we could print our own prayer books here.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy when speaking and I have not got a very long time to speak.  Whenever the local communities pushed Cumann na nGaedheal when there was a local factory closed&mdash;there were several closed down in my constituency during the Cumann na nGaedheal regime up to 1932&mdash;they took very diffident steps into the cold water of protection.  They were like a two year old child at the seaside with the found father, mother, aunts and others trying to get him to take a duck in the sea and only succeeding in getting him <Col N="353" /> to put in his toe.  The Government at that time put their toe into the water on a few occasions but they had not the slightest idea of having a swim. They were careful about protection. The result was that nearly 1,000 factories were closed down during their regime.</P>
      <P>Their whole attitude to economics was displayed by Deputy Mulcahy when Minister for Local Government in 1931.  When he was asked to go out for a housing drive he said: &ldquo;We cannot go on with any great housing development until the cost of labour and the price of materials fall to a point when we can build houses and let them at an economic rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we came in we changed that whole attitude.  We started off on a housing campaign and got 146,000 houses built or reconstructed during our time.  We gave protection all round.  We created industry as a result of which at the present time, even though we are not producing as much as we should for export in order to pay our way in the outside world, we are producing a vast amount of industrial products which are enabling our people to have as high a standard of living as practically any country on this side of the Atlantic Ocean.  If we could for a number of years get our people to restrain their present consumption and put their energies into building up more capital equipment, the time might come when we would have a higher standard of living than people in other parts.  It is very difficult, however, to get people to save in order to build up capital wealth.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride, I am glad to say, has dropped a few of the old cliches and slogans which he used to use in connection with problems of this kind.</P>
      <P>He did not put forward to-night or last night as the cure for all our ills that we should break the link with sterling.  He did not talk too much about the fact that we were giving £150,000,000, or whatever the amount was, at ¼ per cent. to the British, but that we could not get money here under 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy may have been educated a little bit to realise that the fact that we have external assets, instead of detracting from our ability to build up our country, in fact encourages us and strengthens us in the attempt to build it up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon alluded to an understanding away back in 1939.  Supposing it had been possible for the Government here in 1939, 1929 or 1949 to translate all our sterling assets and foreign assets of any kind into gold and take them back here and put them into the vaults of the Central Bank, is there anybody who would say that, because we had gold in the vaults, it detracted from our ability to produce wealth here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take one Deputy at a time.  I cannot talk if everybody else is talking.  I said it is the only alternative to gold that is open to us in the modern world.  Deputy Dillon spent about half an hour before Christmas telling us how hard sterling was, and Deputy MacBride spent most of the time telling us how soft it was.  All that I want to say is that, whether it is hard or soft, it is the only external asset that we have to enable us to buy equipment and to buy the things which we do not produce here at home and which we want to consume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not so in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not so in 1939. The point that I was making, in reply to Deputy MacBride, was this, that if in 1939 or 1949, 1929 or 1919 we had <Col N="355" /> translated all our external assets into gold and dumped them here, there is no one who would say that that was detracting from our ability to create credit or to promote capital development here, or that that development was stopped in any way by the fact that we had gold.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, we spent £90,000,000 of the external assets that we had in 1939 in buying dollars to enable us to buy the things that we imported during the war.  Now, you can buy dollars or buy francs with an acceptable currency or with an acceptable commodity like gold.  Even at the present time, you can buy gold for sterling if you give enough of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Deputy to remember that I have only ten minutes to reply to all the things said here.  The Central Bank has the power <Col N="356" /> to control bank credit in this country if it wants to exercise it, and the Government of this country has the power to select and appoint the directors of the Central Bank.  The last Government had the power to do it, and, in fact, six of the present directors are people who were appointed or reappointed by the previous Govern-ment&mdash;six out of nine.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as much about that as he seems to know about a lot of other things.  Section 50 of the Central Bank Act gives the Central Bank the power to control credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is this, that if the Deputy wants to impose his will upon me&mdash;let me put it that way&mdash;and he has a gun at my back&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he can tell me either to go forward or to go back.  He has the force to compel me to go forward or to go back because he has the power to impose the penalty of shooting me if I do not.  The Central Bank has not the power to shoot bankers, but it has the power, if they are lending too little or lending too much, to make them cover a percentage of their deposits in the Central Bank, interest free.  It has the power to compel the commercial banks to do that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, unfortunately, knows very little, although he talks a lot about this subject.  As a matter of fact, he talked here for about an hour as to his inability to get a certain bit of information from the Department of Finance when he was in office.  I had to point out that an official in the Department of Finance had actually written a book about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>My only point is that Deputy Dillon spent a lot of time proclaiming and complaining that he could not, during the three years he was in office, get information from the Department of Finance which was already in published form, issued and written by an official in the Department of Finance years before he became Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon talked about certain powers of the lender of last resort.  He said that there was no use and no necessity for a lender of last resort in this country.  It is foolish for Deputy Dillon to think that the lender of last resort can only act through the intricate series of operations which come into play on the London Money Market through its bill brokers and the rest.  The general function of the lender of last resort, applicable in any country in the world, is to see that if there is a run on the banks and the people want cash or legal tender they will get it.  That is why that clause, to which the Deputy has alluded, is in the Central Bank Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new definition for a lender of last resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite an accurate one, as the Deputy will see if he looks it up.  I had come as far as 1932 in dealing with Deputy MacBride's points.  It was the belief of the Fianna Fáil Party right from its foundation that if we only put our backs into the work as a nation, we could utilise the resources in both brains and material which God had given us here in order to build up an ever-increasing standard <Col N="358" /> of life for an increasing population.  I think it is true to say that the population is to-day about the same as it was in 1932.  A number have gone.  That is another line of argument.  About the same number of people are in the Twenty-Six Countries to-day as there were in 1932.</P>
      <P>When we first came into office and brought in an Agricultural Wages Act there were certain districts in which farm labourers earned only 14/- a week, without keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you really believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it to be a fact. In certain districts that is all they got. The first increase we gave, and it was thought to be quite a big advance, throughout a large part of the country was 24/- a week.  The minimum now is £ 10s. od.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The average would be £3 10s. od.  In some parts the wage is £4.  It compares very favourably at any rate and clearly demonstrates that some advance has been made because everybody must admit that the poorest section of our workers have gone from 14/- to 70/- or 80/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacBride made a certain allegation.  I would not take much notice of it were it not for the fact that he will probably deceive a number of people.  He said that the banking system here was largely controlled by the British Government. That is not true.  Our commercial banks are subject to the control of the Central Bank.  If my memory serves me aright, I think it is Section 50 that gives the Central Bank the power to make the commercial banks put in an interest-free deposit if, in its opinion, they are not operating in the right direction.  On the point raised by Deputy Dillon as to what it is right for the Government to pay the commercial banks, may I say that the commercial banks have to live.  Deputy Dillon seems to think that if they are allowed to participate in Government loans, they should participate at the lowest possible rate.  But they have a function in the community just as well as other privately-run businesses have. A lot can be said for leaving a private business that is doing a reasonably good job of work alone rather than nationalise it.  We could, of course, if we thought fit, nationalise the banks here.  If we nationalise them, the working <Col N="360" /> of them may become a much more expensive job for the State.  In terms of cost to the community, the work might be much more expensive than it is at present.  Irrespective of what the cost might be as between running the banks by civil servants or by banking officials, there would be a very big public outery every time a loan was refused or every time a loan was granted.  It would be said that loans were granted or refused purely for political reasons rather than for business reasons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we went to Belgium and examined the position there we might easily find that it is not so very much different from our own.  Side by side with commercial banks there are institutions there for the purpose of making loans.  Side by side with our commercial banks we have the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We have institutions like the Sugar Board, indirectly a Government organisation, giving credit to the farmers for the purchase of manures, seeds and so on. If we examine the Belgian system, therefore, we may find it is not so very much different from our own.  But there is a very big difference in the Belgian economy because during the last few years the Belgians have really got down to living within their means and creating a little more wealth than they actually consumed.  The result is they are to-day on top of the world.</P>
