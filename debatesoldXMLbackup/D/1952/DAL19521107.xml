    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In promoting this Bill, I am bearing in mind that the Oireachtas, by the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1951, has already approved, in principle, of the granting of a weekly half-holiday to agricultural workers.  But, as I have previously stated in this House, the 1951 Act, while it requires agricultural employers to give a half-holiday each week to agricultural workers, was not framed in a sufficiently clear and workable manner. For example, while one provision of the Act gave the Agricultural Wages Board power to prescribe rates of pay <Col N="1200" /> for the half-holiday, another section actually laid down how rates of pay for the half-holiday are to be computed. Moreover, the Act conferred no power on the Agricultural Wages Board in regard to its enforcement.</P>
      <P>When I decided some time ago that the Wages Board ought to be made responsible for the administration of the half-holiday legislation for agricultural workers, I examined whether it would be possible to amend the 1951 Act, but I came to the conclusion that to put it on a proper footing would require so many amendments that it would be far more convenient for everybody to repeal it entirely and replace it by a new Act.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the most important new provision is the provision similar to those already contained in the Agricultural Wages Acts and the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, whereby officers of the Wages Board may take proceedings on behalf of a worker who has been underpaid, or not paid at all, in respect of work done on the half-day.  I have also provided that in fixing rates of minimum wages the board shall act with due regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another provision in the Bill which I would like to mention specifically, and that is the requirement that, before a worker is entitled to the half-holiday, he shall have completed 45 hours' work in the previous five week-days.  I think it is only fair that, before asking a farmer to give a worker a half-day, that worker should normally have completed his full quota of work on the previous five days.</P>
      <P>I am retaining in the new Bill the principle that the worker may, if he wishes and with his employer's consent, remain at work on the half-day, provided the employer pays him for it at a rate not less than a rate to be prescribed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also included in the Bill a provision that, where the day on which the worker is to be allowed a half-holiday falls on a day on which he takes a day's annual holidays under the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, or on a Church holiday or <Col N="1201" /> public holiday allowed to him by arrangement with his employer, or on a day on which he is otherwise absent from work, he will not be entitled to a half-day in that week.</P>
    <P>I have also included in the Bill a provision which will be for the benefit of workers, such as dairy workers who normally would have completed more than half their day's work before 1 p.m.  Under this provision a worker who has completed five hours' work on the morning of the day on which he is to get his half-holiday will then be entitled to the half-holiday without waiting until 1 p.m.</P>
    <P>I have also provided that this Bill when enacted will not be brought into operation until a day which I shall appoint by Order.  It is necessary to do this, because the Agricultural Wages Board will require a certain amount of time before they can prescribe minimum rates of payment for work done on the half-day, and make any other necessary arrangements in connection with the operation of this Act.  From the day when I bring this Act into operation, the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holidays) Act, 1951, will stand repealed.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret, first of all, that the Minister did not give an indication of how many people this Bill will affect.  We should like to have got an authoritative estimation of the number of agricultural workers who will be affected by this Bill.  The Second Reading of this Bill this morning affords a very good example of the changes which time brings.  Those of us who were in the House at the time have a very clear recollection of what happened when the Bill which is now being repealed, that is the Act of 1951, was before it.  We have a very good recollection of what occurred on the occasion of the passage of that Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Bill sought to establish, for the first time in this country, the right for agricultural workers to be treated in the same manner as all other workers in the Republic, and to be allowed the very simple amenity of a half-holiday <Col N="1202" /> in the week.  The working week stood at 54 hours: nine hours per day and six days per week.  Reasonable people and reasonable employers of agricultural workers in Dublin, Meath and other counties had long agreed that just as industrial workers had already got entitlements inclusive of a half-day the lowly agricultural worker was also so entitled.  But we could not get that accepted here in Dáil Éireann nor could we get it accepted by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>We passed it for you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be remembered that when the Act of 1951 went to a vote following the Second Reading the Fianna Fáil Party abstained from voting in the belief that the free vote of the House which was permitted on the Government side would defeat the Bill. In fact the reverse happened.  Those of us who were associated with the promotion of that measure and who had been associated over a considerable number of years with the struggle to establish for farm workers a weekly half-holiday had the satisfaction of seeing written into the Statute Book their right to this very simple amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may seem to some Deputies, it may seem to many people outside this House, that this Bill is of relatively little moment or that the question of a half-holiday is not one which agitates the minds of the men who have to work for wages on the land, but any person who takes that view is merely betraying his ignorance of the minds of the rural workers in this country.  I have been associated with rural workers over a fair number of years and I have been associated with men who spent their lifetime in the service of rural workers&mdash;I refer to men such as the late James Larkin&mdash;and I and all others who sought at any time to improve the lot of agricultural workers were always agreed that the agricultural labourer felt strongly that he should get on some day in the week, preferably on Saturday like other workers, the right to a short day when he could go home to his family or go to the village or town if he wished to do the shopping for his family just as <Col N="1203" /> all other employees in the country have for some time been entitled to do-though we in this country were very tardy in ensuring them that right by law.</P>
    <P>Of course the Act of 1951 was sabotaged.  Whenever a meeting took place where there existed any degree of anti-Labour political animosity in this country we had the lay lawyers explaining to agricultural labourers that of course, the Act of 1951 was not really in operation at all, that it had no force and that until it was amended the agricultural labourer was not entitled to a half-holiday.  We had the interested saboteurs at work.  What prompted them it is hard for me to know.  I can never understand the mentality of such people no matter to what Party they belong&mdash;and I do not specify that they belong to any particular Party.  I cannot understand the mentality of the people who, although they know or must have known that the right of the farm labourer to a half-holiday was, undeniably, and is at the moment undeniably, written into the law of this country, nevertheless by whispering, by calling meetings at various places, by writing letters to the Sunday newspapers, strove&mdash;and succeeded to some extent&mdash;to create in the minds of agricultural labourers the illusion that they were not entitled to this half-holiday.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this Bill will make certain alterations in the law.  I am glad to see that he has admitted the fact that the principle of the half-holiday is already enshrined in law by virtue of the Act of 1951.  It is as well to remember when the Minister refers to what are alleged to be defects in that Act that it was a Private Members' Bill and was not promoted by the Government of the day.  I have already described the manner of its passing.  I have already described the miscalculation and bad tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party who sat on the ditch secure in the knowledge&mdash;as they thought&mdash; that the inter-Party group would defeat the Bill themselves.  It is as well to place on the records of this House the knowledge that the sponsors of a Private Members' Bill have, under the Standing Orders of the House, no <Col N="1204" /> authority to include any section or subsection which would entail the expenditure of State moneys.  By virtue of that regulation, the sponsors of that Bill were prevented from including any clause imposing upon the Agricultural Wages Board the enforcement of the Bill.  It will be noted that no amendment was then put down on the Order Paper by those who now seek to perfect the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am not responsible for its non-enforcement.  That was a matter for the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Such an amendment would have been out of order, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the records of the Select Committee and I am glad that the Minister reminded me about that because it had slipped my memory.</P>
      <P>There are certain advantages in the present Bill and certain disadvantages. These are matters of detail with which I propose to deal by submitting amendments on the Committee Stage.  I do want to say that in so far as the present Bill cements the already existing right of the agricultural workers to a half-holiday I welcome it, but in so far as it is a Bill which imposes qualifications which were not imposed under the Act of 1951, it must be condemned.  I daresay that every piece of legislation that comes into this House is improved upon with the passage of time.  It is inevitable that that should be so.  I was amazed at the difficulty which we of the Labour Party had when this sponsored Bill was propelled through the House by that Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what smoke-screen may be thrown out now, nobody will be deluded <Col N="1205" /> as to why this measure has been brought in.  I do not like to accuse the Minister of any ulterior motive in repealing the Act of 1951.  I accept what he says, that it is easier to repeal it than improve or amend it.  However, no matter what attempt may be made to mislead agricultural labourers, they will not be misled.  Very often the mistake is made by persons who regard themselves as highly intelligent of thinking that agricultural workers, because they are at the bottom of the wages scale and because their living conditions are at the lowest level, are thereby inferior in intelligence to other types of people, whereas of course the exact opposite is the case.  The agricultural workers by reason of their occupation and of the relatively isolated nature of their work are a much more mentally well developed section of the working people than any others in the country and much more observant and keen and can see through subterfuge and hypocrisy more quickly than any other group can.  For that reason most of them support the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I wanted to refer to that because there is a popular misconception about agricultural workers in that regard.  I hope the Minister will not fall a victim to that misconception, that when he goes back to his constituency in the future and is talking of the achievements of the present Government and seeking votes in Mullinavat or Kilmacow or some other places of that kind he will not have the temerity to include in that list the half-holiday for agricultural workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He can do that, but whether he leaves it or not, their minds will be brought to bear on it and they will have no doubt about it.  When the Minister is telling them that he cleaned up the mess, I hope he will also tell them that he was one of the cooks who made the mess in the Select Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne is not so innocent as he pretends.  When he brought in the original Bill he was then a member of a Party which had three Ministers and one Parliamentary Secretary in the Government, and he boasted often in the country of the influence of the Labour Party on the Coalition Government.  Deputy Dunne and his colleagues were not without knowing at the time that without being enforced by the Agricultural Wages Board the Bill was not worth the paper it was written on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He charges the Fianna Fáil Party with not supporting the original Bill. The Fianna Fáil Party, through their spokesmen at the time, the present Minister for Local Government and the present Minister for Agriculture, explained to the House that, as it was an important measure which affected the lives and interests of a large section of the community, the Fianna Fáil Party felt that the responsible Minister for Agriculture and the responsible Government spokesmen, should take responsibility for the Bill.  We said that until the Minister for Agriculture or <Col N="1207" /> the Government spokesman took responsibility for the Bill, or until the House decided otherwise, we were taking no action on the matter.</P>
    <P>Almost half the population of the country were being seriously affected in one way or another by that Bill.  The agricultural workers were to get a half-day. Nobody on this side of the House ever denied their right to that.  The farmers were to have put on them a severe extra charge.  They were to be seriously inconvenienced in many respects because of the nature of their calling.  It must be appreciated that under this Bill which the Minister has introduced, the farmers will be seriously inconvenienced in very many ways.  That is not saying that the agricultural workers are not deserving of a half-day.  If it can be so arranged and worked into the economy of agriculture, as the workers on the roads and all other types of manual workers have a half-day, I do not see any reason why the agricultural workers should be denied it.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude when Deputy Dunne introduced the 1951 Bill was that it should be the responsibility of the Government because the lives and interests of more than half the population were being seriously affected.  Their attitude was that the Government of the day should take responsibility for measures which affect the lives and interests of the community whether adversely or otherwise. That has always been our attitude. We have always been prepared to take responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We helped Deputy Dunne, as he will admit, to improve the Bill. At the time, Deputy Dunne was aware that the Bill would be a failure.  He knew quite well when it was going through the Special Committee that if it could not be operated by the Agricultural Wages Board or some similar body on behalf of the Government the Bill would be a failure.  But with two Labour Ministers in that Government <Col N="1208" /> he failed to get sufficient influence with that Government, and the Labour Party fell down and let the agricultural workers down.  They were trying to pretend to them that they were going to do them a service by passing that Bill through the Dáil when they knew it was not worth the paper on which it was written, and the courts in this country decided in that respect.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, he has recommended the present Bill to the House with the full authority of the Government. I have no doubt that given goodwill it will be successful.  I want <Col N="1209" /> to suggest to every section of the House that when this Bill becomes law it will need an amount of goodwill from both workers and farmers to bring it fully into operation.  I would, therefore, appeal to both sections of that great agricultural community to accept it in the spirit in which it is introduced here and that is, for the betterment of the agricultural workers who have down through the years and down through the centuries been part and parcel of the great agricultural community and the great agricultural industry.  We have no doubt that when this Bill comes fully into operation it will be for the ultimate benefit of the agricultural community, both farmers and workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Reading of a Bill in this House is confined to considerations of the principle that underlies the Bill.  The principle that underlies this Bill has already been accepted by the House.  So far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned, therefore, we feel that the principle having been accepted by the House, regardless of what anyone may have done then, it is the duty of the House now to clear up certain voids and certain difficulties that arose in the working of the previous Act.  Deputy Allen seems to think the previous Act was defective in law.  I do not think it was and I do not think any courts of competent jurisdiction found it was defective in law.  But it was not adequately capable of operation.  If we want to cast that around as criticism, then I think every Minister who has ever been in any Government will be subject to the criticism that he brought in a Bill at some stage or other that was not adequately capable of operation and for that reason had to bring in an amending Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that that of itself is any valid point for anybody to throw across the House from one side or the other.  When it comes to Committee Stage there will be certain questions of detail in the working out of the principle upon which no doubt our Party will have certain views to put forward.  But so far as the principle of the Bill is concerned it is merely carrying through a principle <Col N="1210" /> accepted previously, putting it into operative effect, and so far as we are concerned the Second Reading must be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>My real objection to the present Bill is the long delay between the time when the Minister announced that he would amend the Bill and the actual taking of the Second Stage.  I would like seriously to question the motive of the Minister in the long delay.  When an amending Bill was introduced here by Deputy Dunne in February of last year the Minister promised and satisfied a majority in the House that he himself would amend the Bill.  That was February last and this is November, that is a period of roughly eight or nine months during which there is still the alleged confusion about the granting of a half-day to the agricultural workers of this country.  Now he glibly announces that whilst the Bill may be passed this week or next week he must give the Agricultural Wages Board time enough to gear up their machinery to operate this particular Bill.  I presume that will be another long delay, possibly another three or four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it be known to the agricultural workers that, despite what Deputy Allen says, if this is the perfect legislation to grant a half-day to the agricultural workers, it has been dragged out of this House.  I do not except one side any more than the other: it has been dragged out of the House by the members of the Labour Party.  It is very dishonest of Deputy Allen or any other Deputy from any side of the House who would allege that it was the intention of the Labour Party and has been the purpose of the Labour Party to try to cod the agricultural labourers over the years.  I do not think anybody could question the motives of the organisation of which Deputy Dunne is the secretary.  If the Act was defective the Minister and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, in fact every member in this House, must take responsibility for it as well.  The Minister made one clear admission and I am glad he made that admission and that was, that in the <Col N="1211" /> last Bill the principle of granting a half-day to agricultural workers was accepted.  Since 1922 it had never been accepted until Deputy Dunne and, I think, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Kyne introduced the Act which the Minister in this Bill now proposes to scrap.</P>
    <P>What is the real attitude of Fianna Fáil towards granting a half-day to agricultural workers?  When I came into this House first I remember a motion or a Private Member's Bill being tabled by members of the Labour Party to grant a half-day to agricultural workers.  My fellow Deputy, Deputy Dr. Ryan, who was Minister for Agriculture, spent a solid hour telling us that the agricultural workers could not get a half-day and that view was subscribed to by every single member of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time. The Minister may have a different view on it.  I do not know.  He was not in the House at that particular time when we all knew the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards granting a half-day to agricultural workers.  Like Deputy Corry, a lot of other rural members in the Fianna Fáil Party said the agricultural workers should get the sun, moon and stars.  They would love to give them two days off in the week but they never attempted to give them anything.</P>

      <P>They tried to play off, and always have played off, the farmer against the farm workers. &ldquo;We would like to give it to the farm labourer but it would ruin the industry.&rdquo;  It was deplorable to hear the excuses given on one occasion by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dr. Ryan, for not granting the agricultural workers of this country a half-day.  Now we have Deputy Allen trying to give the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Minister the full credit for the granting of the half-day. Did we not see the Fianna Fáil Party, headed by Deputy Dr. Ryan as he then was, Deputy Lemass, and the present Taoiseach sitting there, as Deputy Dunne said, waiting to see if the inter-Party group at the time would themselves defeat the Bill?  When they <Col N="1212" /> saw there was no chance of that they voted on the Fifth Stage for the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It was a sad reflection by a farmer's representative to say that if the Bill were not operated by the Agricultural Wages Board it would be ineffective. Does that mean that we have to invoke the aid of some State Department or some such machinery as the Agricultural Wages Board to force the farmers of Wexford or of any other part of this country to give what has been laid down by law, a half-day to their workers?  Is that what some of the farmers traded on in respect of the last Bill, that they knew that the worker who was not given a half-day could not, because he had not the money, invoke the District Court or the Circuit Court or some higher court?  If that was the only defect in the last Bill, it was a very small defect.</P>
      <P>No matter what lip service may be paid to the agricultural workers, we know the record of a majority of the members of this House.  The weekly half-holiday was given grudgingly.  I think it was the Minister for Defence, who said at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that nobody in the last Government raised his voice for the Old I.R.A., that that was done only by members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It would be true to say that the only people in this House who have ever spoken, and spoken fearlessly, without having regard to support from a certain section, for the agricultural workers, have been the members of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holiday) Bill that was introduced in 1950 was given grudgingly. All sorts of calculations were suggested from one side or another. People talk about the flight from the land and how to make rural life more attractive.  We deplore emigration; we deplore the drift to the towns; we deplore the fact that Dublin is becoming over-populated.  Reference is made to parish halls, cinemas, wireless broadcasting.  Every Deputy knows in his heart that the only way to keep the agricultural worker in rural Ireland is to pay him and to give him good conditions.  Nobody would suggest that even at the present the <Col N="1213" /> agricultural worker enjoys good wages or good conditions but we have this body, the Agricultural Wages Board, on whom the responsibility and the onus is thrown.</P>
    <P>The Minister, maybe, on some festive occasion when he becomes bountiful and generous, suggests that the agricultural labourer should have&mdash; or did he say, will have&mdash;a rate of wages comparable with that paid to the builder's labourer.</P>

      <P>I am <Col N="1214" /> talking about a motion or Private Members' Bill that was introduced about a year before Fianna Fáil left office, in 1948.  I think it was about the year 1946, when Deputy Dr. Ryan, sitting where the Minister now sits, spent a solid hour telling the House why farmers could not or should not give a half-day to their workers.  Do members of the Fianna Fáil Party remember that?  Does the present Minister remember that?  It is for that reason that I suggest that if the Labour Party had not got this House to accept the principle of granting a half-holiday to farm workers, the Fianna Fáil Party would not be displaying the alleged interest that they are displaying now.</P>

Whether those errors were deliberate or inadvertent does not matter much now.  We hope this legislation will work.</P>
      <P>This Bill continues the provision incorporated in the last Bill on the Committee Stage but which did not appear in the Bill as introduced, that the worker can opt to work during the half-day if he so desires and if his employer so desires and can be paid at the standard rate of wages.  I opposed very strongly the compulsory half-holiday as embodied in the Bill as introduced in 1951 because I thought it was wrong to compel a man to remain idle for a half-day on Saturday without any proviso by which he could work if he so desired and be paid for it.  That defect was remedied on the Committee Stage and on the Fifth Stage I indicated, therefore, that I would not call for a division on the Bill.  Nevertheless, the Chief Whip of the Labour Government, Deputy Davin's Government, came in and challenged a division.</P>

They were going a little bit of the way with everyone and fooling them all for a little while, but it did not work in the end.  On the Fifth Stage I said I would not force a division in view of the reasonable <Col N="1216" /> attitude of the Labour Party on the Committee Stage, but Deputy Sweetman forced a division and the Bill would have been defeated but for the intervention of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The House.  I can claim to be a member of the House and this Bill is being accepted unanimously, even by Deputy Sweetman, to rectify the impossible position created, deliberately or unwittingly, by the former Government.  This half-holiday question has been causing considerable confusion amongst farmers and workers.  It is being settled now in a reasonable way.  The farmers are accepting that it is inevitable.  It means an increase in his outlay and it is coming along with many other increases.  I hope the community will also accept that the farmer's costs of production are being increased under this Bill and that there is an obligation on the community, generally, to see that the farmer is allowed some small margin of profit on his produce to enable him to carry on.  If there is a demand by him for better prices, arising out of these increases, I am sure they will be sympathetically considered by all Parties, including the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>This Bill is finding a reasonable basis of agreement between all sections. Members of the Labour Party have said that the only demands and the only real steps for the improvement of the conditions of the workers were taken by the Labour Party and by them alone.  There is no truth whatever in that suggestion.  One of the most important pieces of legislation for the improvement of the conditions of the agricultural workers was the Agricultural Wages Act of 1936, which set up minimum standards of living in agriculture.  Though farmers might resent it and feel annoyed at its provisions, I think that, in the main, it was beneficial legislation, as it put a floor under the agricultural wages.</P>

In effect, most of the employers in my constituency at any rate, particularly in the dairying industry, were giving 4/-, 5/- or 6/- a week in excess of the wages paid by the Agricultural Wages Board. Actually, they were giving the workers the benefit of this Bill all along.  So that the passing of this measure does not represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I think it is a good thing that we now, in a friendly, good-humoured way, have agreed to this Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got to recognise that outside the agricultural industry most workers enjoy a half-holiday. We have got to extend that principle as far as we can.  On the initial stage of the last Bill I suggested that there were, perhaps, other concessions which could be made to the agricultural community which would be of more importance than compelling them to remain idle for four days a week.  I hold there are other concessions which could be made to the agricultural community which would benefit them much more than the concessions embodied in this Bill.  Since the workers' representatives demanded this particular type of concession, I think it is only right to let them have it.  The only section of the people who do not enjoy a half-holiday, any minimum standard of income or any minimum conditions of employment are the working farmers of this country.  I hope that in some way it will be found possible to raise their standard of living to that of the agricultural worker.</P>

We all wish to see every section of the community advance and to see their conditions of life improving.  I do not see anybody making the slightest effort to do anything for what I describe as the largest class in the community.  I refer to the small farmer, the man who is described as a small farmer.

Would the Minister endeavour to do something <Col N="1220" /> for the small farmer who cannot be treated as if he were self-employed and who is tied to an insufficiently sized holding to make a living on it?  He works the seven days of the week during the 52 weeks of the year.  He works 16 hours a day and there is no half-holiday for him.  He is not even free on Sundays and he cannot get the few days' holiday in the summer or the autumn which most workers get.  I think this Bill is incomplete when it does not include something for that type of person.</P>

If recourse is had to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> it will be found that out of 383,000 farmers all over the country almost 300,000 are farmers under £10 valuation.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The thought of the Fianna Fáil Party and their attitude on the general question of a half-day for workers is well-known.  For juveniles looking for employment Fianna Fáil ensured, by the establishment of Part V of the vocational system, that they should get a chance of education so that they might improve their prospects in life subsequently. On this question of the half-holiday for agricultural workers, while it was easy and, I presume, more readily applicable where you could switch over the machine and so on at a certain hour of the day, it was argued that the operation of the sun, moon and stars, the succession of sunshine and shadow and day and night were beyond man's control and that it was these things that made for the success or otherwise of the operations of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that agriculture, generally speaking, has lagged behind in this matter of the organisation of agricultural life generally and the amenities of the workers in particular. We all remember in the old days that when the 25th March came many agricultural workers through the country had to take their families and furniture from the farmer's house, to which no land as a rule was attached, to get work for the following year.  Many progressive farmers at that time gave a half acre of land to their workers and gave them other amenities such as milk and similar products from the land, together with grazing for a few sheep and so on.  As time went on, the Fianna Fáil Party was responsible for the building of numerous labourers' cottages in the rural areas and to these an acre or half an acre of land was attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Deputy Dunne said that the giving of this half-holiday will enable the agricultural worker to go shopping, but he has now a very important work to do in that he has this little acre or half-acre of his own on which he can occupy himself for the half-day and help the general productivity of the agricultural community, just as if he were working for a farmer.  In this case, he is working for himself, building up his home life, with advantage to the nation generally.  It was not so easy to organise this system of half-days for agricultural workers.  Varying weather conditions in the past were responsible for a system whereby the farmer and his worker co-operated.  If there came a day on which he could not work outside but had to sit in the cowshed, when the harvest was ready, he worked a longer day, often from dawn to dark. There was that co-operation between them, and the worker ate at the farmer's table and was not placed in any menial position in most parts of the country, although there may have been exceptions.</P>
    <P>We are all glad this progress is being made and that the agricultural worker, through the instrumentality of Fianna Fáil, backed by the various organisations which cater for operatives in these lines, is being put in the same position in life as his fellow-workers in any other line of industry. We have now reached the stage where the agricultural worker has to be more skilled and have a better knowledge generally of the various types of work which, from season to season and day to day, he is called on to perform, and of the various types of machinery he is now called on to operate.  This Bill will clarify the position, but, as Deputy Allen said, no matter how strict a law may be made, the operation of the law is largely dependent on the goodwill and the approach of the people concerned to it.</P>
    <P>The agricultural worker has lifted up his head after years of struggle, just as the farmer has done.  The farmer in the past suffered under various systems of landlordism.  It took him some time to establish himself, and, as Michael Davitt said, to get a firm grip on his homestead.  The progress <Col N="1224" /> being made in the agricultural life of this nation is a matter for congratulation and joy for the whole country because on it rests the fundamental prosperity of this nation.  When the workers and farmers feel that they have their rights established, they can, by goodwill, vary the conditions to meet the varying circumstances.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill and helping in this further progressive step towards improving the community life of the rural population.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in fairness, must be congratulated on one point&mdash;his being so highly successful in keeping Deputy Cogan on the round-abouts. He has turned around so much now that he has got dizzy and cannot get back to the ground in regard to which he advocated a certain line of action so much in the past.  While I congratulate the Minister in that respect, I feel that great sympathy should be expressed with the Democrats in America that they did not have Deputy Cogan as their candidate, because, if they had had him as a candidate, undoubtedly the change in America would be noticeable, too.</P>

      <P>None, except that I think it only right that we should give great credit to Deputy Cogan for his wonderful attitude here this morning.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate the importance of this Bill and it is because we appreciate the importance of realising the necessity of providing a half-day for farm workers in rural Ireland that we say to the Minister that while the old saying &ldquo;Better late than never&rdquo; may be true, the Minister unfortunately is somewhat behind time in introducing the Bill.  Some months ago, last February, when he opposed a similar Bill, we got an assurance that the measure to be brought in by the Minister would be before the House in a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand that, in view of other important business to come before the House, it is not easy to arrange a time table, but members of <Col N="1225" /> the Labour Party who have consistently advocated the urgent necessity of providing a half-holiday for farm workers are somewhat disappointed, because this half-holiday could have been operated a long while back had this important measure been introduced before this.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy MacCarthy has left the House because I do not like talking behind people's backs.  In many parts of rural Ireland, and I am speaking now in particular about the South because that is the area I know best, the large landowners took advantage of the opposition to Deputy Dunne's Bill and refused to give their workers a half-day.  They said the law did not force them to do so and the unfortunate workers were penalised in consequence of that.  It was the large landowners who did that. The small farmer is at all times willing and ready to co-operate.  The large landowners said that when the Minister for Agriculture amended the Bill, as he promised to do, or introduced new legislation they would give the half-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister gibes he will get a little more than he likes. I am drawing attention to the fact that the farm workers were denied a half-holiday in County Cork because of the attitude adopted by the present Minister when he was in opposition, because of the hypocrisy of that opposition towards the measure before the House on a former occasion.  If the Minister were as lively in introducing his promised Bill as he is in interjecting remarks we could have had this measure before the summer recess and the farm workers could now be enjoying the weekly half-holiday that has been denied them by a certain type of employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the remarks made here were somewhat wide of the mark, but Deputy Corish touched on a vital point when he drew attention to the continuous movement of rural workers into <Col N="1226" /> the urban areas.  The only alternative to that movement is to give the workers in the rural areas conditions on a par with those in the industrial areas.  It may not be possible to do that right through.  One advantage that could be given would be a weekly half-holiday. Some amenities of that kind will help to check the flow into the cities and towns.  The Minister has himself drawn attention publicly to the importance of the agricultural industry, but agriculture can never succeed while it operates on one lung and while the only consideration given is for the benefit of the employer.  We are all anxious that the employer should get a fair deal.  Coupled with the advantages given to him, there should also be advantages given to his employees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan stated this morning that the result was inevitable and that we must move with the times.  Deputy Cogan was very slow to move with the times.  Deputy MacCarthy referred to something that used to cause abhorrence in rural areas.  That was the movement on Lady Day, the 25th March, of the farm worker, his family and his bit of furniture. Times may have changed.  When we were endeavouring to give the farm worker an annual holiday, I remember seeing the leaders of the then Opposition, including the present Minister for Agriculture, moving themselves, their families and their furniture into the Lobby marked &ldquo;Níl.&rdquo; I can remember so well the attitude of the Deputies sitting in opposition at that period&mdash; their sulking, their refusal to go one way or the other.</P>
    <P>While I prefer to face the future rather than fulminate against the past, remembering the way in which the Deputies then in opposition blew hot and cold, we have an obligation to remind them of their attitude in relation to this very important matter. There may be some things in this Bill which will need closer investigation and we will have an opportunity of discussing these points more fully at a later stage.  We want to make this Bill as watertight as we can so far as the farm worker is concerned.  Co-operation will be necessary in order to make the operation of this Bill a success.  We <Col N="1227" /> are always ready to give the fullest co-operation we can in relation to measures of this kind.  We know, too, that there are people who are always ready to evade their responsibilities. If, as the Minister has said, there was a flaw in the Bill formerly introduced, he has now had an opportunity of remedying that flaw.  He has all the machinery of Government behind him in the preparation of this measure.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious that when this Bill becomes law there will not be another hold-up.  The longer it is delayed the longer the farm worker will be denied his weekly half-holiday.  I sincerely hope the farm worker will get the benefit of this measure as soon as possible.  If legislation enacted here subsequently finishes up in the courts that may be a costly procedure for the employer and for the employee.  I hope that when this Bill leaves the Dáil and passes through the Seanad, it will be in such a form that there will be no technical faults in it and that Deputy Cogan will have occasion for rejoicing on his conversion from consistently advocating the rights of one section of the agricultural community as against the other.  In that case we realise, as I have already stated, that the importance of this measure is the full amount of support that he gets in this House.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress on this Bill last Wednesday evening I was saying that it would be a reasonably good gamble for any individual to bet on its success or failure.

I did not believe that the Minister would accept the Private Deputies' Bill as it stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to learn that the Minister's sympathies lie in the direction of doing something for the <Col N="1228" /> repair of the roads mentioned in this Bill.  I am not, however, satisfied yet that the Minister will go far enough. We have not heard what his intentions are.  They may be good but I am at sea in regard to what type of Bill the Minister may bring in here.  If he brings in a Bill containing the words &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;, such as are in this Bill, then I say that it will not be worth the paper on which it is written. To my mind, the expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; has never been properly interpreted.  I have my own interpretation of this expression, other Deputies may have their interpretation of the expression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And an administrative British officer.  My interpretation of the expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; can be found in a motion which I moved in this House on the 8th February, 1946, and which was seconded by Deputy Cogan.  The motion read as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925, be amended to empower local authorities to repair and maintain from local funds any road which ordinarily is of service to two or more tenants.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing that motion, I did not include the expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;; I did not mention any specific number of householders; I referred to a road which is ordinarily of service to two or more tenants.  I did not specify any number of houses.  In his Bill, Deputy McQuillan specified eight or ten houses but afterwards made a change.  I believe that any cul-de-sac road which serves people, whether they reside there or not, should be repaired by the county council.  I know quite a number of those roads.  Sometimes they are two or three miles long and farmers live there.  I know of several small farmers who, though they do not <Col N="1229" /> live on such roads, own small patches of land there.  Very often they have great difficulty in removing their tillage and produce from these patches of land because of the condition of the road leading to it.  Therefore, even if there are no householders living along such a road, if it is ordinarily of service to two or more persons I think it should be kept in a proper condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that we have had a grievance in Roscommon for many years.  I have been associated as far as I possibly could in every move for the betterment of the types of roads in question.  I am glad that Deputy McQuillan is taking as keen an interest in these matters as I am.  This Bill has been supported by Deputy Finan.  It was introduced by Deputy McQuillan and, of course, I support it also.  We are three of the Roscommon Deputies. The Minister for Justice, the remaining Roscommon Deputy, who has, so far, been conspicuous by his absence from this debate, will, I hope, come in and tell the House his views on this matter and make it clear that he knows something about what is taking place in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>When development work takes place in cities and towns, roads are built and everything is put in proper order but when it comes to the improvement of conditions in rural Ireland we cannot afford to spend even one shilling on the improvement of roads there.  I have visited many such roads in rural Ireland and I realise only too well that the people who live along them are existing under intolerable conditions. I am not surprised that there is a flight from the land.  I cannot see how the present generation or future generations will be content to reside along cul-de-sac roads and by-roads in rural Ireland unless they are put into a proper condition of repair.  An appeal has been made to farmers to increase production, to go in for more tillage, and so forth.  How can anybody expect a small farmer whose farm is situated perhaps two miles from a main or a county road, and whose only access to it is a by-road or a cul-de-sac which is in such a bad state of repair that when he walks along it he is up to his ankles in slush and muck, to put his <Col N="1230" /> shoulder to the wheel in an endeavour to produce more food?  If he has a grain crop he cannot get any machinery into his farm and he has great difficulty in getting the crop out.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that the Minister's attitude to this matter is sympathetic but I should like him to translate that sympathy into some practical step to remedy the matter.  He should tell us what he intends to do.  The people of Roscommon have always been interested in this matter and I can assure the Minister that our interest is even keener now than ever it was. In my time I have been a member of the Roscommon County Council and also chairman.  Let there be no uneasiness about the desire of the county council in regard to these roads.  This year, each county council was asked to submit details of about two miles of these roads which were considered in need of repair.  That was done. Every one of the county councils submitted details.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that amount to 52 miles of additional roads?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exactly 52.5 miles of additional roads.  The estimated expenditure on these two miles of roads is something in the neighbourhood of £4,000 or, in other words, roughly about 3½d. in the £ on the rates.  That was one year's programme.  The next year's programme would cover a further 52 miles of roads, and so on, until the problem was solved, to a great extent at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Deputy give any suggestion of the cost of the annual maintenance of these new miles of roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures, but I can say that it would be negligible.  In some cases there are only two families concerned and in other cases five or six families so, as a matter of fact, there would not be any such thing as annual maintenance on these roads for a considerable number of years.  If they were looked after every three, four or five years it would <Col N="1231" /> be quite sufficient to keep them in proper order.</P>
      <P>The motion which I moved in 1946, and which was seconded by Deputy Cogan, got a very mixed reception in this House.  I am glad to see that this Bill which was introduced by Deputy McQuillan and which is supported by Deputy Finan, by myself and by some other Deputies, is getting a different reception.</P>
      <P>What was the reason for the change of heart that took place?  It was an extraordinary thing that in 1946 the motion got a rather bad reception, but in 1952 things have changed very much.  I am not going to say how that change has come about, but, to be honest about it, I realise, and I am sure the Government and the Minister realise, that Fianna Fáil is not the powerful instrument it was in 1946 and that the axe is hanging over their heads.  They have got to accept this Bill; they dare not refuse to accept it. If they refused to accept it and put it to a vote of the House, the Government would be defeated.  They are, therefore, adopting the line of least resistance in saying that they are ready to accept the Bill.  That is a bit of a surrender from the days of 1946 when they would not hear a proposal of this kind at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me if there is anything wrong&mdash;I should be delighted to hear if there is&mdash;in the local authority providing the contribution which is necessary in the case of a rural improvements scheme and taking it out of a private individual's hands?  Is there anything wrong in that?  That has been the case in Roscommon County Council, on a few occasions, when a rural improvements scheme was suggested for repair of the roads which might have cost £50, £60 or £100. Perhaps the local applicant and his friends might be responsible for a 75 per cent. contribution in that case.  If that was taken out of the individual's hands and passed over to the county council, allowing the county council to make the 75 per cent. contribution, is there anything wrong in it?  For the life of me, I cannot see that there is. Speaking on behalf of the members of <Col N="1232" /> the county council, I can say that we are prepared, in cases such as that, where a rural improvements scheme is to be adopted to meet the needs of the people, to contribute, say, one-fourth or up to 90 or 95 per cent. of the cost, so as to have the work carried out for the benefit of the individuals who make the application.</P>
    <P>To show the sincerity of my Party and of myself in this matter, ex-Deputy Commons and myself introduced a motion on 23rd November, 1949, suggesting that the Minister should increase the grants under rural improvements schemes.  I am grateful and happy to say that the grants were considerably increased by the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnellan.</P>

    <P>Having said so much and having heard the Minister's offer here the other night to consider this Bill and to bring in some legislation, perhaps in the early spring, I am wondering whether it is not a waste of time to consider it further or whether those who have already spoken on the Bill have not been wasting the time of the House.  I wonder what Deputy McQuillan feels about it?  If I were <Col N="1233" /> satisfied that Deputy McQuillan were prepared to accept the offer of the Minister, I would save myself a lot of trouble but I wonder what Deputy McQuillan's attitude is?  I should not like to see him withdraw this Bill and I think he is not such a fool as to buy a pig in a poke.  My advice to him is not to withdraw it.</P>

I am prepared and my Party is prepared to accept the principle of this Bill with <Col N="1235" /> amendments.  That is pretty definite. Neither I nor my Party can accept the Bill as it stands.  We have always supported the principle of the repair of by-roads and culs-de-sac in this country and shall always continue to do so.  I should like to know what Deputy McQuillan's intentions are.  Does he intend to withdraw the Bill?  I have advised him before that he has got no definite promise.  Nothing has been offered to him, so that I would advise him to go ahead with the Bill.  At a later stage, amendments from this Party will be put into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to understand the attitude of certain of the Opposition regarding this Bill of Deputy McQuillan's.  All of us are interested in the type of road that will be covered by the Bill.  It is quite evident that the Clann na Talmhan people, particularly in Roscommon, are very annoyed because Deputy McQuillan has stolen their thunder.  They want the principle of the Bill.  The Minister has offered them that, and has offered to bring in a Bill to cover all the matters that Deputy McQuillan wants covered. Yet, they are not satisfied.  Listening to a number of the speeches which have been made, it was evident that there was not a lot of enthusiasm behind them other than political tactics.  So far as the roads under discussion are concerned, neither this Bill nor any legislation was required, because an enormous amount of this work in Galway, Roscommon and other western counties and probably in every county, could, under the present legislation, be done by the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have these public utility roads leading from one public road to another.  You have them in Roscommon. I am sure there are thousands of miles of such roads in County Galway.  They have not been made in County Galway, nor can the Galway County Council make them, and seemingly no effort is being made in County Roscommon to make them.  So far as the attitude of Clann na Talmhan is concerned regarding roads in County Roscommon, I think they have the most discreditable record of road making in <Col N="1236" /> Ireland.  It was the county which, a few years ago, refused to strike a rate for the making of roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The county council never refused to strike a rate for the making of a main road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the main roads, or any other roads, you struck a wallop at the road workers when you put them out of employment and cut down the grants.  You had to be forced to make your roads.  That seems to be the attitude of Clann na Talmhan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is right to misrepresent the matter like that. In the interests of truth, I want to say that the Roscommon County Council never suggested a reduction in the estimate or in any expenditure on county roads.  They were concerned mainly with the main roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about roads in general, and of the attitude of the Roscommon County Council.  We have thousands of miles of roads that could be made, but they are not being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you say that you want them made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this, that if I go back to Roscommon in ten years' time, and if Deputy Beirne is chairman of the Roscommon County Council, I am sure I will find an awful lot of roads in the County Roscommon that will not be made.  That will not be Deputy McQuillan's fault.  There are thousands of miles of roads in the country which the county councils could make, and the reason they are not making them is this: In my county, at any rate, we used to strike the rate for something like £15,000 for new works. We arrived at the stage when that sum of money was found to be of very little use because the amount of work that it would do would not be noticed, due to the fact that the cost of materials, wages and all the rest, so far as the county council was concerned, had gone to such a point that <Col N="1237" /> we would have to strike a rate or at least make three or four times the amount of money, that formerly was spent, available before we could do any useful work.  For the last few years, we have been unable to make any money available for that particular type of work.</P>
      <P>I want to say that I welcome this proposal.  We have always been favourable towards the construction and improvement of roads over the country. That has been the policy of Fianna Fáil all the time.  Let there be no misunderstanding about that.  I listened to Deputy Beirne, and other Deputies, tell us about the rural improvements schemes and say that Fianna Fáil had made 75 per cent. available for them. That is not the case.  Long before the inter-Party Government came into power, Fianna Fáil had made 100 per cent. available for such roads.  When these roads were finished under the rural improvements schemes they were taken over by the county council and are to-day county roads.  What those Deputies have said about the improvements done under the rural improvements schemes was only eyewash.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Donnellan the other night slating the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It is well known to everyone that a motion was tabled in this House by two members of the Coalition Government away back in 1949, and that the statement that was made on it by the then Parliamentary Secretary was a bit of eyewash.  The two Deputies attempted to withdraw the motion, but Deputy Beegan forced the motion and forced the then Parliamentary Secretary to bring in what he believed was a bit of an improvement on the previous position, although it did not do all the things that we were told it would do.  The Parliamentary Secretary led everyone to believe that he would not be two years in office until every road in County Galway would be made, and I suppose he gave the same promise in Roscommon.  The roads are still there and they are not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, the county councils will be faced with a very heavy burden.  I doubt if they will be <Col N="1238" /> able to undertake it.  We have an unfortunate position which arises from the policy of the Land Commission over all the years of making roads ten or 12 feet wide.  If, under this Bill, the reconstruction of these roads is undertaken, fences will have to be removed and the work will have to be started from the foundation.  That will be a very expensive item.  I welcome this Bill and the Minister's attitude to it.  I think that the Clann na Talmhan Party should not be hedging in their attitude towards it.  The Minister has made an offer to accept the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He has made an offer to accept the Bill if Deputy McQuillan wants it.  He has offered to bring in legislation covering everything in the Bill and perhaps a little more. I wonder what greater offer could be made by any Minister.  The Opposition should make up their minds one way or the other.  They cannot have it both ways.  Deputy McQuillan would be well advised to accept the Minister's offer.  It is the usual thing when Private Members' Bills are brought in. It is usual with regard to this Government. I do not want to say that those were the tactics of the previous Government.  Their Deputies brought in Private Members' Bills, for example the Agricultural Workers' Half-Holiday Bill, and the Coalition Government could not make up their minds about it one way or another and the Bill was a flop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Then our Minister for Agriculture had to bring in a new Bill and do the thing properly.  Surely Deputy McQuillan has learned from that the lesson that it would be better to let somebody else handle this?  He has brought the matter to the attention of the House but he would be well advised to let the Minister handle the rest of the job.  The Deputy has done his job and done it well and the Minister will be able to put the finishing touches to it.  He has been acquainted with local authorities for a long time <Col N="1239" /> and has particular experience of this type of work.  I am satisfied that he is prepared to help local authorities to do this type of work in their own way.</P>
      <P>A lot of play has been made here about roads of general public utility. The Minister said the other night that he was prepared to let local authorities decide for themselves what could be termed roads of general public utility. If a local authority cannot decide that, surely the Minister or the officials of any Department cannot put it down in black and white for them.  This is something that must be decided by a local authority and the Minister was perfectly right when he said that.  It was a reasonable explanation of his attitude and must be accepted by us all.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that the Opposition will make up their minds and will not run with the hare and chase with the hounds until they kill it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has approached this measure. I understand that he is willing to accept the Bill as it was brought before the House.  I say, without any disrespect to the Minister or allowing a different interpretation to be put on his remarks, that I would like if he would accept the Bill as I have it here before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>His decision to accept it means that he has done two very important things: first, he has brought fresh hope to thousands of families who live in rural areas on these neglected cul-de-sac roads; secondly&mdash;this is a very important point to remember&mdash;he will restore some of the prestige and status of local authorities, the prestige and status that was stripped from them by the managerial Act.  I was very pleased indeed to hear him state the other night his belief that local authorities throughout the country were on the whole responsible <Col N="1240" /> people and that he was confident, that they would not misuse the power given to them by this measure.  I think the members of local authorities throughout the country should note with appreciation the Minister's views on that point.  It is a step in the right direction and local authorities may in future get back more of the power which was rightly theirs but which was stripped from them by the managerial Act.</P>
      <P>There is no question at all in my mind that local authorities are the best bodies to decide what local roads should be repaired.  Nobody is in a better position than the local councillor to know what roads are of general public utility and what roads serve the people in the various areas. It is time that that power was given to those responsible bodies in order that the necessary work should be carried out throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot understand the attitude of some members towards the Bill.  I will have to put down their remarks to a lack of knowledge of what the Bill really contains.  I do not like to suggest that they would in any way hinder its passage but I am afraid that they have shown a complete lack of knowledge of what is contained in the measure.  Some Deputies have mentioned the question of general public utility.  Personally I think that the question is covered very fully in Section 2 of this Bill and if there are Deputies who are dissatisfied it is open to them to submit suitable amendments.  It is stated in the section that if such road authority&mdash; meaning local authority&mdash;is satisfied that the road is of general public utility&mdash;that means that the local authority is entitled to decide what general public utility is&mdash;they have power to declare that particular road to be of general public utility and, as a result of that declaration, to spend money on it.  The Bill is simply an enabling measure and does not mean that every council in Ireland will take immediate advantage of its provisions. There is no question in the measure of deciding how many families must live on a cul-de-sac road.  That can be <Col N="1241" /> decided by the local authorities.  That is the power now being given to them under the measure.  If local authorities feel like it they can ignore the Bill completely.</P>
    <P>Another important thing has come to light in the course of this debate.  I know for a fact from my experience during the period I supported the inter-Party Government and since that many councillors like to shelter behind the provisions of the 1925 Act whereby local authorities have not the power to repair these cul-de-sac roads.  In other words, quite a number of county councillors will tell people throughout their localities: &ldquo;We would do these roads if we had the power, but the Minister of the day is responsible and he will not give us power.&rdquo;  This Bill will now show the sincerity or otherwise of these particular councillors, because they will now have power to decide whether or not certain roads should be repaired and the people will be soon able to judge their sincerity or otherwise with regard to improving conditions in their localities.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency about this measure so far as County Roscommon is concerned.  One of the reasons which prompted me to introduce it was that Roscommon County Council has been repairing and maintaining approximately 140 miles of cul-de-sac roads since as far back at 1900.  In 1947 the council was surcharged £2,700 for repairing these roads, although the council had practically repaired them on a three-year basis since 1900.  Nothing has been done with these roads since 1947, and they have been left in a deplorable condition.  I should like to see this Bill passed as quickly as possible so that the Roscommon County Council will be enabled this year to do a very necessary work by repairing those roads.  That is one of the reasons why I ask the Minister to accept the Bill, as I believe there is great urgency for it.  With regard to the Deputies who are worried about provisions in the Bill, they will have their opportunity to put forward suitable amendments if they so desire.</P>

      <P>I drafted this motion immediately after the proposals of the Central Bank had been published and submitted to this House.  I drafted it in the hope that the Government would have found it possible to accept the motion, if not as a whole at least in part.  That is why the resolution is presented in a number of separate parts, so as to make it possible for the Government to indicate that it would accept some parts of it.  At the time that the Central Bank Report was published and submitted to this House, the attitude of the Government seemed to be somewhat undecided.  As I understood the attitude of the Minister for Finance, he accepted the views contained in the report and the recommendations contained in the report.  On the other hand, as I understood the attitude of the Tánaiste, he rejected the report and said that it was not going to be hung around his neck.  Many months have now passed by since the report was published and since the House discussed this report.  We are now in a position to judge the extent to which the report has been accepted and acted upon by the Government.  It is quite clear, on retrospective examination of the Central Bank Report, that its main recommendations have been acted upon by the Government and have been accepted.</P>
      <P>In my view, this report and this resolution raise matters of grave constitutional importance.  It appears to me that the Central Bank, in that report, usurped or attempted to usurp the functions of the Government appointed by this House, and sought to dictate policy to the country.  They are not authorised by the Currency Act, under which they are entitled to make this report, to enter into the political field.  The report contains proposals which are clearly of a political nature.  It contains proposals which, in my view, are contrary to the national interest.  We are entitled to know by what authority this conclave of bankers and civil servants is entitled to attempt to dictate policy to the Government, to this House and to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> The House will remember the broad outline of the report.  I think it is well I should underline certain aspects of it.  The report sought in the first instance to depict the economy of this State as being in a dangerous condition. It repeatedly dealt with the question of what was termed inflation, which seems to be one of the favourite expressions of a particular school of economists who, apparently, are in a position to influence the policy of the Government.  It then went on to advocate the reduction or the removal of food subsidies.  That advice has been at least in part accepted by the Government and implemented by the Government, because the food subsidies were removed at least in part.  It advocated the restriction of bank credits.  That advice has already been acted upon by the banking system with either the direct or indirect connivance of the Government.  It advocated the imposition of additional taxation if possible on consumer goods, so that additional taxation would have the effect of reducing the consumption of consumer goods by the people.  That advice has been acted upon.</P>
    <P>It also advocated what, to my mind, is one of the most dastardly and sinister lines of policy that any responsible economist could advocate in this country.  It advocated the curtailment of public works on account of what it called &ldquo;the unusually favourable state of employment&rdquo; in the country.  In other words, the report advocated the creation of a pool of unemployment, advocated the creation of conditions that must inevitably lead to increased emigration.  It is seldom that those views are put in black and white by any responsible person.  Probably the nakedness with which those who framed that report, those who submitted a report of that kind to the Government, to the House and to the people, expressed those views, is in itself sufficient condemnation of their ineptitude.</P>
    <P>In dealing with public works, the Central Bank in its report said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the unusually favourable state of employment for a considerable <Col N="1247" /> time past, there is the less need at present for the artificial stimuli provided by such a programme, especially as prevailing high costs cause it to encroach rapidly on resources which may be badly needed at a later time when conditions afford more justification for this expedient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report then went on to point out that public works imposed a strain on the balance of payments, and then: &ldquo;They have, for example, entailed the immediate import of materials and equipment.&rdquo;  Of course, the building of houses, the building of factories, any public works programme, any capital investment programme, will involve the import of raw materials.  Then they go on, and I would like the House to pay particular attention to the next sentence: &ldquo;They have (that is, the public works) through their labour content created a demand for imported as well as other consumer goods.&rdquo;  Because housing, because public works have a labour content, they are to be stopped. That is the advice which is given to the Government by this conclave of bankers, advice which the Government possibly did not accept openly, but advice which the Government has certainly helped to implement.  The result is, of course, that unemployment has risen.  The result is, of course, that emigration has increased.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the report which the Central Bank propose to issue this year.  Presumably it will be made available in the near future.  I do not know to what extent they expressed satisfaction with the results which they have been able to achieve so far in regard to unemployment; whether they were in a position to congratulate themselves that they have been able to create a pool of unemployment in the country, that they have been able to increase the rate of emigration, that they have been able to reduce the purchasing power of the people and the standard of living of the people.</P>
    <P>It is no longer a technical report by economists or by civil servants.  This is an entrance by these people into the political arena.  If they want to come into the political arena, let them come <Col N="1248" /> out in the open; let them stand for election and come into this House; let them tell the people what their policy is.  The only authority given to them by Statute is to present an annual report of their proceedings to this House.  I need not seek to define what the word &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo; means.  This House has knowledge of it in its own procedure.  The House keeps a journal of its proceedings in which it records main decisions, what it does, and so on.  It would be a strange thing if, under cover of publishing a report of its proceedings to this House, the Clerk of this House were to start expressing views on the various political issues that came before the House or that faced the country.</P>
    <P>While these gentlemen are not slow, apparently, to enlarge upon their functions by publishing documents of this nature, they are reluctant, apparently, to give more factual information concerning their proceedings. We do not know from this report how often they meet, what they do at their meetings.  We know very little about the business they actually transact. True, they publish an annual statement of account, which they are bound to publish.</P>
    <P>The last one was made available to this House two days ago.  Although it is dated 8th April, 1952, it was only laid on the Table of this House on the 5th November of this year. There is no explanation as to the long delay that took place.  It was submitted to the Auditor General and was signed by him on the 6th June, 1952.  What happened this statement of account since 6th June, 1952, I do not know.  But it is an interesting document, little publicised; we have not seen any note of it in the papers yet.  It does not contain very much information but the information which it does contain is well worthy of notice.  We learn from it that the expenses of this institution have more than doubled.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but it is very difficult to limit one's remarks to this actual report without making comparisons with other reports of the Central Bank.  I merely want to draw the attention of this House to the fact that the Central Bank in its report is very shy to give information which the public might like to have.  As an instance of that, I think the public might well like to know why the expenses of the Central Bank have more than doubled in the course of a few years.  One of the directors of the Central Bank, who is also secretary to the Department of Finance, I think, the other day, speaking publicly, made a speech about whirlwind inflation.  It seems to me that it is whirlwind inflation for the expenses of the Central Bank to be more than doubled.</P>

      <P>The Minister's colleague thought it would be well if some more of their members were present to hear this.  The Central Bank, in its balance sheet for the year under review, ending 31st March, 1951, held £50,552,000 in British Government securities as part of the Legal Tender Note Fund.  The dividends which it received on its investments in British Government securities amounted to £536,000&mdash;somewhere around 1? per cent. on this vast sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> This House and the public might have been interested to know why the rate of interest at which the Central Bank lent its money to the British Government was so low.  The people might be interested to know why the Central Bank did not invest any single portion of its money in Ireland.  Perhaps this year the Central Bank will, in its report, give some explanation of these matters.  It might possibly explain, in its report this year, why the total amount of British Government securities held by the Central Bank in respect of the Legal Tender Note Fund increased from £50,000,000 to £55,345,000.</P>

      <P>The country is entitled to know why the rate of interest on the money lent by the Central Bank to the British Government is as low as one and one-eighth per cent. this year, while at the same time this Government has to pay 5 per cent. on a loan it obtains here.</P>
      <P>These are some of the matters which the people are entitled to know.  I have already dealt with the type of political advice given by this conclave of bankers and civil servants in their report.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to which I would like to refer.  The Report of the Central Bank which is under discussion took great pains to decry the economic and financial position of the country.  At page nine it referred to &ldquo;The long continuance of the deficit position and the progressive weakening of the economy by loss of external reserves and the incurring of foreign debt&mdash;the United States dollar loan under the European Recovery Programme...&rdquo; The whole report is couched in terms that are bound to be damaging to the credit of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, if we were correctly informed, was published without alteration by the Government.  I can conceive of no document and of no statement that would be more likely to damage the credit of this country than a report of this nature published by the Central Bank with the authority of the <Col N="1255" /> Government.  It is interesting to note that within a short time of the publication of this report the value of Government stocks began to decline on the Stock Exchange.  I think we may well infer that one of the reasons why the Minister for Finance had to offer 5 per cent. in order to raise £20,000,000 was the adverse reports that had been published by the Central Bank.  That was undoubtedly one of the reasons which damaged the credit of this nation.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister himself would realise the dangerous precedent which is being allowed to go on where this organisation, under the guise of publishing a report of its proceedings, is permitted to damage the standing of this country in the economic and financial world.  If it suits the Central Bank at any time to create a panic among investors because they dislike a particular Government or the views of a particular political Party, it is open to them to publish a report of this kind, scare people and damage the position of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should try to approach this question with reason and without seeking to make Party capital out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I have approached this whole question with reason and logic.  I think it is highly dangerous to vest powers in a body of this kind which has no real responsibility, powers which can do a considerable amount of damage to the country as a whole.  The Central Bank Report is clearly a political document.  I do not think it was ever intended that the Central Bank should enter into the political arena.  It is a dangerous precedent and one which the Minister should resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Report of the Central Bank will be like in the coming year.  They will hardly be likely to congratulate themselves on having achieved complete success.  They may well congratulate themselves that they have succeeded in creating more conditions of unemployment and reducing <Col N="1256" /> the standard of living of the people. They may well congratulate themselves on influencing the policy of the Government.  As far as I know there is no statutory function given to the Central Bank to entitle them to do these things.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Central Bank will probably say that the Government did not go far enough, that there are not sufficient unemployed in the country, that there is still too much being consumed in the country and that there is still too much capital development going on. No doubt they will express these views but I think they may well feel a certain degree of satisfaction at the success of their handiwork.  I would ask the House to reject this report and make known in no uncertain terms that they will not allow this conclave of bankers, financiers and high civil servants to dictate policy to this House or to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a lot of this discussion from Deputy MacBride before he got into a Government, and we have had it since, although for three years Deputy MacBride might have been able to do something.  In the circumstances, a lot of what he says becomes a matter of mere talking. The subject raised is something of importance. If we are to relate it to the actual situation here now or a year ago we must take into account the background before we deal with the subject matter of the motion at all.</P>
      <P>What is the background financially? No matter how one looks at it, one has to admit that this country is subject, as are other countries, to the general repercussions of the economic situation in the world at large, that these repercussions were not altogether favourable from about 1949 onwards, and that there is a background to the financial problem of the country at the moment. Deputy MacBride was talking about credit, the restriction of credit, the credit of the country.  He made the statement that damage had been done to the credit of the country, and, if I heard him aright, also made the statement in connection with the loan which was floated.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  The facts and the background are that, during three years of Coalition Government drift here, the finances of the country were so managed that the total expenditure of the State was allowed to grow and grow out of proportion to the revenue of the State, and that a progressive gap was allowed to develop between revenue and expenditure.  Compare that with an ordinary private firm in business.  Looking at the country from the point of view of its being an economic unit, here was a concern whose expenditure was not being balanced by its income, a concern which, to use ordinary language, was getting more and more into the red.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was allowed to continue and to become aggravated by the Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member.  While the country got more and more into the red, no action was <Col N="1258" /> taken by the Government to correct the trend.  The trend was allowed to continue.  It was a case not so much of mishandling as of non-handling, of doing nothing, and that is the most dangerous thing of all.  People in business know that, when looking at the credit of a firm, the most damning thing they can find is to find that the firm is drifting, that nothing is being done.  Most businessmen would have more confidence in a firm that was doing something positively wrong than in a firm in which things were allowed to drift.</P>
    <P>That is what was happening to the country regarded as an economic concern. Deputy MacBride talked about credit.  That was the first big damaging thing to the credit of this country and anybody looking at it could not fail to have his confidence damaged by such a picture.  The people asked where this was going to end.  We were asking people to invest in their confidence in the future of the country, but any hard-headed businessman in these circumstances would have asked how he could have confidence in such a situation, because, if it were allowed to continue, there was inevitably going to be a crash.  The phrase &ldquo;putting the country in pawn&rdquo; was used and used with great justification in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what was happening, because, in allowing the country to get into debt, in allowing its expenditure to exceed by far its revenue, they were ultimately putting the country in the power of somebody outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, we had a world situation which aggravated that trend, but, before coming to that, we must look at another factor.  When talking about loans, let us not forget the history of the three loans the Coalition Government floated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1259" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They floated a loan at the normal price of 3 per cent. and it was not fully subscribed.  They raised it to 3½ per cent. and the result was not completely satisfactory, either. Again, not only was there damage to the country's credit by letting expenditure far exceed revenue but there was the damaging situation that we were borrowing more and more&mdash;going to the well too often for water&mdash;and naturally people were asking where it would all end and what would happen next.  That was what was happening internally, owing to the incompetence of a Government that did not know its own mind and had not the courage to face up to facts or to get things adjusted.</P>
      <P>Externally, there was another situation developing which aggravated that position.  Externally, there was a situation in which the trend was towards dearer borrowing.  If anybody studies the exchanges of the past 18 months or more, he will see that the tendency is obvious&mdash;that the price at which one could borrow was going up.  That was related to a number of factors.  In the beginning, it was perhaps related to the rather high return from industrials at one period. It was related to a number of things, but it was undoubtedly related also to the fact that here and elsewhere, in the sterling area anyway, there was a feeling that gilt-edge was not so much gilt-edge as it used to be and that many of the considerations that weighed to secure money at a relatively low rate of interest in respect of such solid securities were not as weighty as they were heretofore.  In other words, we were back to the matter of confidence again, and I am not talking so much of confidence in ourselves locally as of confidence in the whole economic set-up of the sterling area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result was that, culminating in the rise in the bank rate, there was a situation in which, if we were to borrow money, the terms would have to be more attractive than theretofore.  I suggest to Deputy MacBride that a little down to earth study of the lists of returns over the past year might help towards a more sober contribution <Col N="1260" /> to a debate of this sort.  One will find that the average yields were such as to preclude the possibility of borrowing at the old rates, the rates varying between 4 per cent. and 6 per cent. as being more or less the possible limits. That was the situation the Minister for Finance found himself faced with when he took over.  He first had the difficult task of correcting an unbalanced situation.  He had to restore the confidence of the people and of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was you did it. The ordinary common-sense investor did not need any reports, statements or anything else to see that there was a Government in power which was going to spend more than it earned and to leave nothing but liabilities behind it, a Government which was not managing the affairs of the country in a business-like manner, and it required nothing more than that fact to bring about the situation of which I am talking.  There was the other factor which would have to be faced&mdash;I am certainly not blaming the Coalition Government for this one, but it was a factor in the situation&mdash; that the rates at which one could borrow were rising.  In other words, the cost of borrowing was becoming greater, to borrow was a dearer process than it had been heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many business people will tell you that it was an achievement to get that loan at 5 per cent., and the biggest and the most important factor in getting it is that it illustrates that the Minister has been able to restore confidence.  This loan was subscribed. The argument the Opposition have is only a very small portion of a per cent. That is all they argue about.  The fact is the confidence was there to subscribe the money and that confidence obtained because it was obvious that the country was going to balance its <Col N="1261" /> affairs and get itself on to a sound financial basis.  Deputy MacBride has in the past talked a lot about sterling assets, link with sterling and many other things about which we heard very little from him from a practical point of view when he was in government because, when in government, there were certain hard facts that could not be got over.</P>
    <P>In relation to the basic argument&mdash; this is a fact we have to face&mdash;most of us in our arguments with Deputy MacBride over a number of years on this subject have always conceded this point: it may very well be that, if one looks at the over-all situation and the difficulties that beset sterling, and so on and so forth, in principle it would be a very good thing for us to be completely separate without any formal association of any kind with sterling. The snag arises, however, when one faces the practical problem.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact, first of all, that at any particular moment&mdash;and when I say any particular moment I mean at any point of time from the first occasion on which Deputy MacBride started discussing this in, let us say, 1947 until the present day &mdash;when one comes to consider that problem one is faced with the fact that we are already part of the set-up and there are certain balances, the adjustment of which is a matter of some complexity.  So far nobody has proposed a practical method of making the disconnection that some people advocate.  It is being talked round; it is being talked &ldquo;about it and about,&rdquo; to use Fitzgerald's phrase in <i>Omar Khayyám</i>, but we get no nearer an answer to our problem than he did to the problem he was considering.  When we try to get down to a practical solution or approach to the problem&mdash; a problem which everyone admits is worth considering&mdash;nobody has been able to say how we can overcome the difficulties with which we find ourselves faced.  There are so many millions in sterling assets there already.</P>

      <P>The fact is one cannot consider these issues unless one gets down to fundamentals.  The net point I am making in relation to this question of external assets, because it has a bearing on this matter, is that one must take into account the situation as it is.  The accumulation of these assets has resulted from a certain trading and financial set-up.  It is impossible to do anything radical in the situation as it is, and the Deputy knows that from his own examination. Short of the importation of equivalent <Col N="1263" /> goods or services, I wonder can we actually, by monetary transaction alone, effect any repatriation of assets.</P>

      <P>I will not be cross-examined.  I have a little experience of that game myself.  Our relation with sterling is fundamental in all this connection.  It is fundamental to the extent that you cannot consider our case as completely isolated while the relationship is there.  In so far as Deputy MacBride has stated that, I accept his statement.  We must accept the position as we find it.  It is no harm to say that trying to overcome the disadvantages of the connection is not so easy.  Indeed the question of breaking away is so difficult that so far nobody has been able to suggest a practical method of doing it leaving aside completely the question of whether or not it is desirable.  Nobody has ever been able to say specifically: &ldquo;We will do it this way.&rdquo;  Nobody has ever been able to set down the concrete steps that must be taken.</P>

      <P>Coming from that, there are the transitional problems of isolating yourself from the repercussions in the sterling area.  One particular repercussion from the sterling area was the one I mentioned already.  You can take it as typical.  It was the change in the price of money, the rise in the bank rate and the trend of investments.  These were things that, whether we like it or not, while you have that set-up, are going to have their repercussions here and you must take account of it.  Take one instance alone.  If the bank rate were <Col N="1265" /> not adjusted here, I invite Deputies to work out the consequences.  A lot of the other adjustments were simply automatic.  One of the contributory factors in forcing up the price at which a Government loan must be floated now, even if the disadvantages of the sabotage of credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This type of motion is completely misleading unless it takes into account the whole background that is there, and that is the one I am talking about.  Even though the answer may be that that background would not be there if we were not part of the sterling area, my answer is that nobody has been able to put up a workable plan consistent with our economy for changing that situation.  Even if there were a concrete proposition for the change, one is immediately faced with transition problems, as I tried to point out to the Deputy years ago&mdash;and I think we came back to it in this House. Through the hospitality of the columns of the <i>Irish Times</i> I invited Deputy MacBride to deal with a certain number of specific questions at a time when he was ranting round the country about breaking the link with sterling.  My questions were as follows.  How are you going to provide for certain transition problems?  For instance, if you break, you will still, because of our direct trade relationships with the sterling area, have the problem of what the relation of your own unit and your <Col N="1266" /> own currency is to be.  There were three possibilities, as I pointed out to the Deputy.  You either had your £ unit par with sterling, in which case you made no change, or you had it at a premium or at a discount compared with sterling&mdash;and in either of those two cases you were faced with certain problems.  You would have been faced with a problem that tended completely to depress your exports and you were faced with a different type of problem. But in any case you were faced with two very serious economic and social sets of consequences.  The simple question for Deputy MacBride in so many facts and figures, was: how do you get out of these dilemmas? Deputy MacBride, who will get the ready answer if he can get it, with all the advocate's astuteness for the immediate political point, would have had the answer as quick as pat if it were there, but we never to this day got that answer.  We are still, on this particular day, talking in the air.</P>
