      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state how residents in the Lee valley will be compensated for (i) damage caused to their land and buildings by floodings caused by the Electricity Supply Board hydro-electric schemes, and (ii) land and property acquired by the board; further, if he will state what period of notice these residents will be given before flooding of the area is undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that, in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, residents in the Lee valley affected by the hydro-electric scheme will be compensated on the basis of settlements negotiated between the owners of the properties concerned and the board.  In the event of a settlement not being reached by negotiation, the compensation payable by the board will be determined by arbitration under the provisions of the Act referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, also provides that one month's notice, in the case of land, and three months' notice, in the case of an occupied dwelling must be given to the occupiers of such land or dwellinghouse where the land or house is to be flooded or will be required for the purposes of the hydro-electric development scheme.  I am informed by the board that in order to prevent hardship to residents, it is the practice of the board to serve notice so as to allow the owners and occupiers affected the maximum period possible in which to arrange for the acquisition of new holdings.  In following this policy the board state that as much as three years' <Col N="1577" /> notice will be given in some cases but in a few instances, i.e., at the site of the dams possession of the necessary land will be required at an early date. The board further state that negotiations for the purchase of this land have already been initiated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Ballinamult area County Waterford which includes Touraneena was again considered in December, 1951 but was not selected for development due to the low financial return.  The board further inform me that recanvasses take place only when there are clear indications that an increased number of householders are prepared to take supply and that the results are likely to have an appreciable effect on the economic return.  The area will be reconsidered from time to time, but the prospects of it being selected for development in priority to other areas are not considered to be good unless a much higher percentage of householders agree to accept supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 a grant to the Cork Harbour <Col N="1579" /> Board of a sum not exceeding £350,000 was authorised towards a scheme of works in the upper harbour and the purchase of a dredger for general harbour use.  The total cost involved was then estimated at £852,000, but the most recent estimate puts the cost at over £1,312,000.  At the same time a grant was approved towards the cost of borrowing by the board for improvement works during the years 1948, 1949 and 1950.</P>
    <P>In 1950 a State grant of 90 per cent. of the cost (estimated at £29,000) for the construction of improved accommodation for transatlantic liner passengers at Cobh Railway Station was authorised.  Early this year the harbour board were informed that if they proceeded with their proposals for the widening and deepening of the liner anchorage at Cobh (estimated to cost £74,000) a grant of £50,000 would be made available from State funds.</P>
    <P>In the case of all these works the balance of the cost falls to be met by the Cork Harbour Board.  I am not in a position to state the total amount proposed to be expended by the harbour board on the development of the port because the improvements are not necessarily confined to works for which grants are made available, and because the harbour board have recently indicated that having regard to the increase in their share of the cost of extensions and improvements it may not be possible for them to complete all the works contemplated.</P>

      <P>The date of emigration does not of itself affect citizenship, but date of birth and date of naturalisation abroad do.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that there is no provision for spiritual assistance for boys who are on remand at Marlborough House; that the boys are marched to the nearest church on Sundays for Mass; that during their period of detention, they do not have an opportunity of receiving the Sacraments; and that there is no segregation in respect of age or gravity of offence; and, if so, whether he will arrange to have an oratory provided at the house of detention and a chaplain appointed, who will make daily visits there, and whether plans are being made for the erection of a new house of detention, as the present one is Dickensian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that there is no provision for spiritual assistance for boys who are on remand at the Place of Detention, Marlborough House.  By arrangement with my Department a member of the Irish Christian Brothers, who has had long experience in dealing with troublesome boys, visits the institution twice a week.  In addition to giving the boys religious instruction and spiritual advice, he sometimes supplies them with suitable reading material and acts as a sort of unofficial probation officer for boys who are temporarily detained in the place and not subsequently committed to an industrial school or reformatory.</P>
      <P>It is true that the boys hear Mass on Sundays at a neighbouring church, the practice being for them all to attend together when the number is small, and to break them up into two batches when that arrangement is the more suitable.  In regard to opportunity for receiving the Sacraments, careful inquiries are made in each case as to regularity in this matter and, where neglect is established, special arrangements are made to provide the necessary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the small number under detention at any one time, and to the <Col N="1583" /> shortness of the period of detention in the vast majority of cases, segregation in respect of age and gravity of offence would hardly seem to be necessary or to justify the consequential commitments as to accommodation and staffing.</P>
    <P>The question of having an oratory provided and a chaplain appointed was explored by my Department some years ago and, again in view of the small number under detention which at times falls as low as three and does not on the average exceed ten, the matter was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>No plans are at present being made for the erection of a new house of detention.</P>

      <P>The recent increase of 25 per cent. over pre-war rates in both telephone rentals and charges was necessary to avoid substantial loss on the working of the telephone service. As the Deputy must be aware there have been much greater advances over pre-war rates in the costs of engineering materials and in wages.  It is not possible, therefore, to meet the request in the latter portion of the question, as the total revenue anticipated cannot under present circumstances be reduced.</P>

    <P>Standing Order 51 empowers the <Col N="1587" /> Ceann Comhairle to name to the House for its decision a Deputy who refuses to obey the directions of the Chair, and the operation of this Standing Order is reserved to him in this connection.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this Bill on the last occasion on which the matter was before the House, I referred to the condemnation of the Social Welfare Bill of 1950 by certain insurance officials.  I quoted one such official as saying on 4th April, 1951, that &ldquo;he had no use whatsoever for elaborate social services as envisaged in the 1950 Bill&rdquo;.  I stress the fact that considerable pressure was put on Deputy Norton, the then Minister for Social Welfare, to drop the death benefits and retiring benefits provisions of the scheme.  I suggest that it is most significant that these two particular benefits have since been dropped.  Only a week before the present Bill was published certain insurance officials in this town indicated that they believed that when the Bill would be published the death benefits would be found to have been dropped. <Col N="1591" /> The fact that that particular section has been dropped from the Bill represents a definite success for the vested interests over the welfare of the ordinary people of this country.  Due to the dropping of that section, the worker will have to continue to pay his week-to-week industrial premium which costs a considerable amount more than he would have to pay if this benefit were contained in the Bill, as it was in the 1950 Bill, to secure the necessary cover for himself, his wife and his children, should he have the misfortune to die at an early date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne took advantage of his speech on this Bill to suggest that Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, backed down from his support of the mother and child scheme at the behest and in fear of the Irish Medical Association.  I wonder why Deputy Dr. Browne does not now cry out publicly against the fact that the people whom he claims to represent&mdash;the ordinary plain people of this country&mdash;are being deprived of the particular benefit that he admits is the most needed of all.  Why does Deputy Dr. Browne not claim that the present Minister and the present Government have backed down not because of objections by the Irish Medical Association but because of objections by the vested interests of industrial assurance companies?  If he is sincere in his protestations of his interest in the ordinary worker, his voice should ring out in this Dáil and throughout the country in the very same way as he has made it ring out to decry and belittle the Labour Party and to decry and belittle his former colleagues and the members of his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne won the admiration and the respect of all the members of my Party for his work in the Department of Health.  He won our thanks and appreciation for his work in administering the tuberculosis schemes.  For the improvements of our county hospitals, of our county homes and of the various other centres where the sick are nursed we were appreciative of the work he did.  For the fact that he brought about better pay and better hours for all, be they nurses or <Col N="1592" /> attendants, who catered for the sick we gave him our sincere thanks and tried to help him in every way.  We still admire him for all that he did but when he seeks to condemn the Leader of the Labour Party I suggest he does so merely for the sake of trying to vindicate his action in the past. Deputy Dr. Browne must know that Deputy Norton and many others in the Cabinet were prepared to fight by his side had the mother and child scheme been a simple issue with the medical association.  He must realise that it was not until Maynooth, at Deputy Dr. Browne's request&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I stopped Deputy Dr. Browne from discussing the mother and child scheme and I cannot now allow Deputy Kyne to proceed on that line.  We are not discussing the mother and child scheme under this measure and the Deputy must find some other line.  I specifically stopped Deputy Dr. Browne from discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  I suggest that the action of Deputy Dr. Browne in attacking the Leader of the Labour Party only detracts from his own protestations of fair play and justice.  At column 1008 of the Official Report of 1st April, 1952, discussing the present Bill, Deputy Dr. Browne said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As to Deputy Norton's amendments, I completely agree with him and I consider that they would improve the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Later on in the same speech at column 1010, Deputy Dr. Browne said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will conclude by saying I am not impressed by Deputy Norton's amendments and I am asking the House to reject them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a Deputy who commences his speech by stating he is in favour of particular amendments and concludes by stating he is against them is not a Deputy whose opinion is to be valued or whose criticisms of any Leader of the Labour Party are to be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan at column 246 of Volume 125 of the Official <Col N="1593" /> Report, on 5th April, 1951, in reference to Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the Deputy has somersaulted and said that we do not need any increase in contributions but can raise the necessary funds by taxation What does that show to me? It shows a Party that is dishonest. It shows a Party which knows, which must know, that it will not assume the responsibility of office again; it shows a Party in defeat attempting to gain the few miserable votes that will keep some of them in Parliament after the next election.  That is the total reason for that somersault.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 249, Deputy Captain Cowan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Kissane and other Deputies say it is wrong to give a retiring allowance to a man of 65 who has worked probably 50 years. That is the Party that introduced here and passed into law legislation to give £500 a year pension to Ministers of the Government after a few years in office.  Fianna Fáil gave £10 a week to a man after a few years in office as a Minister, yet they say it is wrong to give a retirement allowance of 24/- to a worker in the rural areas or in the city who has worked and sweated over a period of 50 years.  Where is the honesty about that sort of thing?  I want to know from Deputy Childers or from anybody else in Fianna Fáil where the honesty is in that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Captain Cowan in 1951.  Speaking on 4th April, 1952, he maintained a significant silence in relation to the dropping of the retiring pensions.  How, then, can he justify the fact that in 1951 he believed the most important section of the Social Welfare Bill was that dealing with retirement pensions?  How can he justify the fact that he taunted Fianna Fáil with opposing that section?  How can he justify the fact that in 1952, on a very similar measure, he expresses appreciation of the fact that the Bill has excluded from it both death benefits and retiring pensions?</P>
    <P>Something new has been added to the 1952 Bill.  A marriage grant has <Col N="1594" /> been included.  I believe it is a rather modest figure and I suggest that the money needed in the administration of that section of the Bill would be more advantageously spent in increasing the maternity allowance from its present figure of £2 to its former figure of £5 or in adding the money to some of the other benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister has remarked that the type of work generally in this country is not heavy enough to justify the claim that retiring benefits are required at 65.  I would suggest as a trade union official, and one with a good deal of experience of men working on the docks, in the building trade, and similar heavy industries, that the percentage of workers who continue to work beyond 65 is very small.  Only in exceptional cases and because of urgent financial need do men work beyond the age of 65.  How can the withdrawal of such benefit from this scheme be justified when we realise that the Government have suggested to local authorities, and have in fact sanctioned, a scheme whereby all officials of local authorities will be compelled to retire at 65?  The duties of a policeman cannot be described as heavy from a manual point of view but still there is provision to enable a policeman to retire at that age and to receive his pension.  I feel that the claim that the age of 65 is too young for retirement cannot be justified on any grounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on national health services.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Esmonde that the increase in benefits was badly needed and is to be welcomed.  I have had, for eight years, practical experience as an agent working for the National Health Society.  I am aware of the many difficulties that confront the society in the administration of benefits and I am also aware of the hardships that have been inflicted on the members.  It has been claimed that Fianna Fáil has been the progressive section of this House over a long number of years past.</P>
    <P>I have heard repeatedly thrown across this House the taunt that Cumann na nGaedheal cut the old age pension by 1/-.  That taunt was justified <Col N="1595" /> but I wonder if Fianna Fáil members remember that during the whole war the disablement benefit as paid by the National Health Society under their régime was 7/6 per week and that the person drawing disablement benefit was required to live, to feed and clothe himself or herself on that miserable allowance of 7/6 per week.  That was even 1/6 lower than the 9/- that Cumann na nGaedheal asked old age pensioners to live on.  It was only in 1947 that any improvement in national health benefits was made and it came only then as an emergency measure.  It remained for the inter-Party Government, acting through Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, by legislation to increase sickness benefit to 22/6 per week, and disablement benefit to 15/- a week in the case of a man and 13/6 a week in the case of a lady.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that considerable improvement is required in the way of expediting payments, especially payments on the first certificates.  Considerable delay has often taken place in agencies and in branch offices.  Errors of numbers, errors made by the members in not completing their certificate or their original claim form, have often to be rectified by the slow method of returning to the agency or the branch office the original claim form or the original certificate.  Sometimes a period of three or four weeks elapses during which a member who is ill is left completely without any financial help.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the national health insurance to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention&mdash;to my mind it is one of the very serious defects in the Act&mdash;is the fact that a national health agent or sickness visitor acting for the society who has no medical qualifications of any sort, can recommend the suspension of benefit to a member of the society.  When such suspension takes place the member is left waiting without benefit for as long as two, and sometimes three, months pending the visit of the district medical referee.  I suggest that no agent or no sickness visitor should have the power of recommending the suspension of benefit and that the total power left to <Col N="1596" /> them should be to recommend an examination by the district medical referee.  I can quote from the first Report of the Department of Social Welfare to show the number of members so reported.  The reference is page 192 of the first Report of the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;1947-1949.  In the year 1945, 30,362 were so reported to the society.  The number of applications rejected as unsuitable for reference to the referees by the society itself was 1,115.  The number of applications cancelled by the society as the members had declared off benefit was 6,508.  The number of cases summoned for examination by the referee was 22,575. The number that the referee, contrary to the reports, found incapable of work was 10,304, and those capable of light work only 457.  The total number found fit for work was 2,270.</P>
    <P>That table goes on to give figures for the various years.  I suggest that anybody reading it will find that five times as many people are found unfit for work, having being reported by agents and sickness visitors, as have been found fit on examination, and that in many of these cases the member is completely deprived of benefit over periods ranging from one week to two or three months.  Many of these members have been forced by hunger, and by the fact that they and their dependents can receive no financial assistance, to give up their right to benefit and go back to work sooner than await the report of the district medical referee.  I feel that is a glaring injustice on the people, that a member who is ill, certified by a medical doctor, can be suspended from benefit on the mere word of an agent or a sickness visitor, and that his benefits will not be restored to him until such time as the district medical referee will have an opportunity of examining him.  I feel that the Minister would be doing well if he were to issue an instruction that such a thing cannot happen in the future.</P>
    <P>In most small towns, agents are appointed by the society.  They are paid a salary which does not permit them to rent or to provide a suitable office for claimants.  I believe that in the future it should be the responsibility <Col N="1597" /> of the Department to provide such offices.  I trust, now that the National Health Insurance Society has been incorporated in the Department of Social Welfare, that it will be possible, in the smaller towns at all events, to see that a suitable office, with suitable waiting accommodation, is provided for the members who have to attend there to hand in their certificates and to receive their benefits.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  The society has power to recover from an employer any stamps which that employer has failed to affix in the case of an employee working with him.  Should an employer fail to do that, and should the worker become ill, benefit will not be paid to the member even where it is reported that the cause of the stamps not having been surrendered to the society was due to the fact that the employer had not carried out his duty.  Where such a report is made, the society will compel the employer to affix the stamps and will receive the revenue that is due to the fund, but the worker will have completely lost his benefit for the period he is ill.  The only consolation he will get is to be told that, under a section of the Act, he has the right to institute legal proceedings for recovery against his employer.  I suggest that requires alteration.  If a member can satisfy the Department that he was in employment for the period required to govern his contribution year, and that his employer had not carried out his duty by affixing the stamps, then the member concerned should, I suggest, receive full benefit. The society can proceed against the employer for recovery of the benefit, if that is thought fit, but the member should certainly not be deprived of his benefit because of the failure of his employer to stamp his cards.</P>
    <P>The reduction of maternity benefit from £5 under the 1950 scheme to the sum of £2 in the present scheme is to be deplored.  The figure of £5 was surely small enough at such a time. The figure of £2 is only to be considered good in so far as it is better than nothing, because £2, in the event <Col N="1598" /> of a confinement, would go very little way towards providing any help at all. We all know that the value of money has been steadily decreasing.  I suggest that, if this Bill is to be compared with the 1950 Bill, and if the benefits in the 1950 Bill are to be contrasted with those in this Bill, they must be taken as being over and above them because of the fact that they guaranteed benefit a year ago.  If calculated according to the cost-of-living index figure to-day, the present benefits would need to be increased considerably so as to reach the same level.</P>
    <P>There is the point that when a claimant for national health initiates his first claim in any year, for the first three days no insurance is payable.  That is, I understand, to prevent a certain form of malingering so that a worker would not be encouraged to stay at home from work for a day or two because he or she suffered from a hangover.  I suggest that the fact that benefit for the first three days is to be stopped, in a case where a worker is genuinely ill, is tantamount to a 50 per cent. reduction in his benefit for the first week.  In short illnesses it is essential that every day's benefit should be paid from the first day.  I suggest also that, in like manner, unemployment benefit should become payable from the first day a person becomes unemployed.  While these penalties may have been put in with very good and sincere intentions. I suggest that they have been known to cause hardship to people at a time when they are most in need.</P>
    <P>I would say that everything good in this Bill is taken completely from the 1950 Bill.  I would say that the principle of increased disablement benefit, the unemployment system of credits being allowed, the uniform rates for widows, the maternity allowance of six weeks before and six weeks after confinement all appeared in the 1950 Bill.  That was the first time they appeared in the life of social welfare in this country.  That these are incorporated in the present Bill is desirable and is to be welcomed but the fact that the other points to which I have alluded&mdash;death benefits and retirement <Col N="1599" /> benefits&mdash;have been completely dropped is regrettable and certainly should be remedied in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, when speaking on this Bill, said that it was not the last Bill.  I certainly hope that a new Social Welfare Bill will be introduced in the immediate future and that it will incorporate retirement benefits and death benefits.  We, in the Labour Party, will always support any progressive legislation which helps the widow, the orphan, the sick or the disabled.</P>
    <P>We could take the attitude of Deputy Lemass on the 1950 Bill and say: &ldquo;What is the question we are asked?&rdquo; Whether we should oppose this Bill and so hope to make way for a better one or whether we should say we will support this Bill because of the good that is in it and by our speeches on the various stages indicate that while this Bill is a step in the right direction it does not meet with our full desires.  I would say that we in the Labour Party support this Bill for the good that is in it but we reserve the right to be put on record as saying that we believe there is need for further legislation and that we will always bless and vote for an advance and an improvement in social legislation so that the worker himself, his wife and his family will be protected from the economic hazards of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, the fact that a measure of this kind is introduced in the Dáil is, in effect, a condemnation of the economic structure of our society and our State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Any scheme of social welfare, particularly one that seeks to deal with unemployment, is an admission of the failure of our State and society to enable each family unit to earn an adequate family wage to enable the family to maintain itself in reasonable standards.  Therefore, a scheme of social security, however well devised or however well-intentioned, is in reality but a patchwork quilt to conceal the failure of our State to organise its economic life in such a way as to <Col N="1600" /> enable every wage-earner in the country to secure work at a decent family wage.</P>
      <P>Instead of seeing a measure of this kind introduced in the House, I should much rather see the State boldly assume responsibility for the provision of work for the whole population.  I refer particularly to these portions of the scheme that deal with the accident of unemployment&mdash;an accident which, I am afraid, is far too common in this State.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty which I see in regard to any scheme of social security that may be introduced in the House which depends on the payment of contributions and provides for the payment of cash benefits is that these benefits, having regard to the constant depreciation of money, cease to have any definite value.  Benefits provided for in this Bill, however small and however inadequate they may be to-day, may be still smaller and quite useless this day 12 months by reason of the depreciation in the value of money and by reason of increased prices.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the Government in this case has already made quite certain that it will reduce the value of these benefits by the fact that it has decided to do away with subsidies on essential foodstuffs and has also decided to impose additional taxation on commodities used by the population as a whole; so that already we know to-day that the benefits which are provided in this Bill will, in three months' time, have been considerably reduced by the action of the Government and, God knows, these benefits are already meagre and inadequate enough.</P>
      <P>I feel that in relation to social security benefits and, indeed, in relation to wages, we will soon have to develop a completely new approach. Wages and social benefits are only worth the amount of goods which they can purchase.  We are living in an era where the purchasing power of money is constantly depreciating and where prices are constantly fluctuating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has come when we should seek a completely new approach to the wage structure and also to the <Col N="1601" /> payment of social security benefits. This could be done by determining a basic minimum wage that would be related to the cost of living&mdash;a basic minimum wage that would be anchored to a comprehensive cost-of-living index and which would fluctuate with the cost of living.  In that way, I think, we could avoid a considerable amount of the constant industrial strife which occurs by reason of the fact that, owing to increasing prices, the value of real wages is constantly depreciated and has to be remedied by an increase in wages.  We have a situation in which there is a constant spiral and a constant chasing of prices by wages. That is a situation which benefits nobody and which causes a considerable amount of friction in the industrial life of the country.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there is no reason why a system should not be adopted whereby benefits payable under any scheme of social welfare should not be related to the cost of living and should not fluctuate automatically with the cost of living.  It would obviate the constant agitation that naturally takes place when the value of money goes down or when the cost of living goes up, whichever way you like to put it, and would save this House a considerable amount of difficulty in dealing with the whole problem of social security.  My view, therefore, is that there should be a basic minimum wage related to the cost of living and that that basic minimum wage should itself form the basis of the wage structure and of the benefits payable under any scheme of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I also hold the view that there should be a separate social security Budget; that the expenditure of the State should be divided under three main heads; (1) a Capital Budget to deal with capital and national development schemes; (2) a Housekeeping Budget to deal with ordinary Government expenditure; and (3) a Social Security Budget.  I feel it would be of considerable help if expenditure under the heading of social welfare was segregated and dealt with in one Budget and if the taxes for the social welfare Budget were dealt with separately so that people should know exactly the <Col N="1602" /> cost, first of all, of the social welfare scheme and also know what particular taxes were applicable to that.  Such a system has been adopted in some other countries and I think it is a good system.  I think the taxpayer will much more readily agree to the payment of a particular tax if he knows the purpose to which that tax is being applied, whether it is a tax on dancing, a tax on whiskey, or a tax on the importation of luxury motor cars. Whatever it be, that tax should be appropriated particularly to the cost of whatever social security scheme is in force in the State at the time.</P>
    <P>In regard to old age, I would much rather have a scheme of general application which would enable everyone to live in the knowledge and in the security that at the age of 65 they would be automatically entitled to a retirement allowance and that this should be made available to everybody irrespective of means.  A system of that kind would have several advantages, particularly in our particular society.  It would have social effects which would be desirable in the country. People would have the knowledge that when they reach, say, the age of 65 they would be provided for and would receive a pension for the rest of their days irrespective of their means.  The effect of that would, I think, be the transfer, at a much earlier date, of the control of farms to the younger generation who, in present circumstances, are often forced to emigrate before they can obtain control of the family farms.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I regard the scheme which is before the House or any scheme of this kind as merely a sort of stop-gap, as merely, as I said before, a patchwork quilt to hide many of the defects in our economic organisation. But, while it is a patchwork quilt, while it does conceal many defects in our economic organisation, it is nevertheless essential to have a scheme of this kind.  My concern, therefore, is to make it as comprehensive and as inclusive as possible.</P>
    <P>The development of industrialisation has rendered our economic structure much more complex and much more liable to sudden changes.  We must, <Col N="1603" /> therefore, try to insulate, as far as we can, the population from the effects of sudden changes.  We have had a recent example of how sudden these changes can be.  In a very short period of time, we have had an increase of some 12,000 in the number of people unemployed. As I said, I would much rather see the State accepting responsibility for the provision of employment for these 12,000 people than to see it escape that responsibility by providing them with doles of one kind or another.  The provision of doles, whether by way of unemployment benefits or home assistance, is really only a method of avoiding the responsibility which the State should shoulder.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a position reached where the Department of Finance would have the responsibility of either providing work for the working population or of paying them a basic minimum wage.  I think we might have a completely different approach to our economic problems if the Department of Finance found itself faced with that task instead of seeking to impose a policy of retrenchment and deflation.  It would probably take a period of years, or possibly a generation, but the Department of Finance would become one of the most progressive Departments in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not imagine that I shall convince the present Government that that is the right approach; but, in our case particularly, it is of vital importance to have a comprehensive scheme of social security at the moment for two reasons.  In the first place, we suffer from chronic unemployment, unemployment which is relatively higher in this country than in most other countries in Europe.  Our rate of unemployment is abnormally high.  The published rate of unemployment is very far from giving an accurate picture of the real situation, because our unemployment figures here are always masked by the fact that a large section of the unemployed population are forced to emigrate. Therefore, we never really have a proper picture of the full extent of our unemployment problem.  The figures we have merely indicate the balance of <Col N="1604" /> people who are unemployed after the others have emigrated.</P>
    <P>Another reason which, in my view, makes it vital to have a comprehensive social security scheme is the fact that one of the arguments used with considerable effect to influence the population of the Six Counties is that they would suffer considerably if they were to unite with the rest of the country, by reason of the low rate of social benefits payable here.  In the Six Counties during the last elections the main leaflet and poster used by the Partitionists was one setting out in one column the social benefits payable in the Six Counties &mdash; not by the Tory Government, but by the British Labour Government, but nevertheless fully exploited by the Partitionists &mdash; and in another column the social benefits payable in this part of Ireland.  That was the chief piece of propaganda used in the Six Counties during the last elections, and it was a very effective one.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by the present Government is a truncated copy of the Bill which was introduced by Deputy Norton.  I regret that the present Government felt it necessary to introduce such an emaciated version of the Bill sponsored by the last Government, which secured its Second Reading in this House.  I am inclined to ask myself why the Fianna Fáil Government decided to depart so radically from the provisions of the Norton Bill.  It certainly was not because of any difference in principle and it certainly was not for the purpose of adopting a different structure, because the Bill now introduced is more or less identical with the Norton Bill save as regards certain cheeseparing and cutting down of benefits.  I wonder whether it was done out of sheer perversity, in order to do something different, or whether it represents the ingrained conservatism of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If it were done out of sheer perversity, one would have thought that Fianna Fáil would have adopted a more imaginative and a newer approach to social security. However, they did not do that.  Instead they copied the Bill introduced by the last Government, practically word for word, in its main portions.  I cannot help remembering that before the <Col N="1605" /> change of Government in 1948 the Fianna Fáil Government stoutly refused to increase the old age pensions by 1/-. They also refused to modify the means test any further, and I am driven to the conclusion that the principal reason why this Bill is introduced in its present form is the ingrained conservative outlook which most of the Fianna Fáil Ministers possess.</P>
    <P>However, I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies and grateful that, in the course of the last three years, the Fianna Fáil Government should have been brought to the point of recognising that an old age pension of 10/- per week with a voucher valued at 2/6 was inadequate and that they are now prepared to accept the figure of 20/- set by the last Government. I am glad that that lesson has been learned by the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, the lesson which they have learned in that respect is probably more apparent than real, because this Bill, taken in the context of the present Budget, is little short of a fraud on the public.  The Minister for Social Welfare told us that he intends to spend something under £2,000,000 this year on social welfare; that is the additional amount which is to be spent on social security this year.  On the other hand, the Minister for Finance is going to relieve the people of £15.1 million as a result of the removal of the subsidies and by imposing additional taxation.  Therefore the net loss suffered by the people will be in the neighbourhood of something like £13,000,000.</P>
    <P>This Bill has a vice which is possibly even greater than the vice of being completely inadequate.  This Bill is probably one of the most flagrant examples we have had in recent times of bad faith in public life.  I am afraid, a Chinn Chomhairle, that I shall have to deal with this in some detail here, as I heard some Deputies on the other side of the House the other day questioning various statements made by Deputy O'Higgins when attention was drawn to some of the promises made by the present Minister for Social Welfare when he was in opposition.  I suppose election promises are inseparable from a democratic Government. <Col N="1606" /> It is unfortunate, however, that public men, with a sense of responsibility, should deliberately make, just for the sake of securing votes, promises which they, apparently, have no intention of carrying into effect.  When the Norton Social Security Bill was under consideration by this House, just about a year ago, the present Minister for Social Welfare, then Deputy Dr. Ryan, criticised the Bill on a number of scores.  He complained that it was not comprehensive enough and explained that he himself had the heads of a scheme which he proposed to put before the House on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This was not just a casual election promise, and I would like to refer the House to what Deputy Dr. Ryan said on that occasion with, apparently, a full sense of his responsibility. At column 1109, Volume 124, No. 7, of the Dáil Debates of 2nd March, 1951, Deputy Dr. Ryan said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... I am going to state definitely a scheme that is workable and that will be worked by Fianna Fáil, not to state a scheme for the electors and then come back like the Minister, but to introduce a scheme that is workable.  I say that old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions are needed by all classes except, of course, the very wealthy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that speech Deputy Dr. Ryan emphasised more than once that he was speaking with a full sense of his responsibilities of a scheme that he and his Party were to introduce in this House if they were returned to office. He specifically stated that he was not then making a speech in order to try to catch votes.  At column 1112, Deputy Dr. Ryan went on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said that I was going to make certain proposals and that if the Minister did not implement them a Fianna Fáil Government would implement them.  Keeping that in mind, I have to be careful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely there has never been a clearer example of a responsible man, who had been for a great many years a Minister, making a statement which amounted to a complete pledge than the statement made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, now Minister for Social Welfare. <Col N="1607" /> He outlined a number of the provisions of his scheme to the Dáil on that occasion, on the 2nd March, 1951, about a year ago.  He told us that all except the very rich should have old age pensions&mdash;not the rich, but &ldquo;the very rich&rdquo;.  He told us, indeed, that he did not see very much virtue in a contributory scheme; indeed that he did not see very much virtue in any means test.  At column 1103, he told us in regard to the means test:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas can at any time abolish it if they want to.  As Deputies of this House are aware, it was done in respect of the children's allowances.  There is no reason why the Minister could not, if he wished, bring in a Bill at any moment to abolish the means test completely in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to the contributory scheme he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think there is any great substance in the Minister's arguments in favour of the contributory system, and there are objections which would lead me, at any rate, to resist, as far as I could, any increase in contributions.  I am not advocating that we should abolish contributions as they are&mdash;and I shall give reasons for that, too.  However, I think that the arguments against the contributory system would make us hesitate before increasing the contributions on either the employer or the employee.  It is an unfair system as between one employee and another; it is an unfair system as between one employer and another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is that system which the Minister described so eloquently as unfair then, which he now introduces into this House with a shameless disregard of the assurances which he gave this House, not casually but with a full sense of his responsibility, expressing to the House that he had to be careful because he was making proposals which he would implement if the people trusted him, if he was returned to sit on the Government Benches where he now sits.</P>
    <P>That was bad enough but the Minister <Col N="1608" /> did not stop at that.  On the next day, the Fianna Fáil Party published in detail their social welfare scheme. It was published in table form, comparing it with the Norton Social Security Bill.  It was issued from Fianna Fáil headquarters and published in all the daily papers of that day.  Deputy O'Higgins, the other day, referred the House to that table and to the statement issued by the Fianna Fáil Party on the 3rd March, the day after Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, had given this solemn assurance to the House.  When Deputy O'Higgins was addressing the House, he was subjected to a constant barrage of interruptions from Deputy Briscoe and some other Government Deputies who suggested, inferentially, that Deputy O'Higgins was not being fair because he was not quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i>  and that the <i>Irish Press</i> might contain a different version of the Fianna Fáil Proposals.  I have taken the trouble of getting the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 3rd March, 1951.  We have on the front page, in panel form, under the heading &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Proposals: Government Proposals&rdquo; a table setting out Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposals. Let me read the paragraph that introduces that table:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Below in tabular form are Fianna Fáil's proposals on social welfare, as outlined by Dr. James Ryan in the Dáil yesterday, contrasted with the Government's proposals,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and we have, one by one, their promises, not given casually, but given with a full sense of responsibility, not given, as Deputy Dr. Ryan then told the House, to deceive the electorate but given with the full sense of responsibility of an ex-Minister who intends to put them into operation if he secures the support of the people.</P>
    <P>We were told that there would be no means test for farmers under £25 valuation or people with £100 cash income.  Could there be a clearer undertaking to the people of the country than that?  Yet, it is shamelessly broken in this House now.</P>
    <P>We were told that there was to be no increase in contributions: that a <Col N="1609" /> scheme would be financed by additional revenue, estimated at £4.6 million.  They even went to the trouble of calculating figures in order better to mislead the people.  Surely there must be a limit to what can be done in public life?</P>
    <P>The other day when Deputy Briscoe and some of his colleagues were suggesting that Deputy O'Higgins was not giving a correct version of the promises made at that time by Fianna Fáil it was also suggested that these were not election promises.  I do not know what difference can be drawn between a promise given in the newspapers and an election promise.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble of looking up the speech made by the present Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, at the G.P.O., O'Connell Street, on the night before the general election.  It is seldom that the present Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, ever commits himself to anything. The House will know, and indeed the House will have suffered from it on numerous occasions, how Deputy de Valera, the present Taoiseach, is capable of making a speech lasting for a considerable period of time but of saying little or nothing in it.  The whole country is aware of that failing of the present Taoiseach.  However, on this occasion, he took his courage in both hands. He actually committed himself&mdash;and it very seldom happens that Deputy de Valera commits himself.</P>
    <P>Less than a year ago&mdash;on the 29th May, 1951, the night before the general election&mdash;the Taoiseach, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, the 30th May, 1951, said in the course of his speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That being their record&rdquo;&mdash;the Fianna Fáil record&mdash;&ldquo;how can anyone suggest, as their opponents were suggesting, that Fianna Fáil were opposed to the extension of social services?  They wanted these social services to enable our people to live as happily as the community resources would permit.  These were Fianna Fáil aims.  It was Fianna Fáil who set up the Department of Health and Social Welfare in order that schemes might be devised to <Col N="1610" /> help the people and to give them greater social security than they had.  How then could it be suggested that Fianna Fáil were against these things?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to the next sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Their plan in regard to social services was before the Dáil a short time ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Fianna Fáil plan was before the Dáil a short time ago.&rdquo;  Was that speech not made in order to deceive the electorate?  Let us read a little further in the same speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They will only talk&rdquo;&mdash;says the present Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera&mdash;&ldquo;of the pint but I would remind you that we brought down the price of tea from 4/10 to 2/8 a lb., the price of flour down by 1/- a stone or £1 a sack, and the price of a four lb. loaf from 1/1½d. to 1/-.</P>
    <P>In brackets, and note the brackets&mdash;&ldquo;(Applause)&rdquo;.  I can well see the scene in O'Connell Street that night. I can visualise Deputy de Valera, the present Taoiseach, explaining to the assembled multitude how, by putting on subsidies, they had brought down the price of bread, tea, sugar and butter.  Then &mdash;&ldquo;(Applause)&rdquo;.  The speech further continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... and we brought down the price of sugar from 6d. to 4d. a lb. Butter was subsidised by us.  So also was fuel.  £15,000,000 was being provided by us in order to keep down the cost of living.  We were not putting it in abeyance.  I have too much regard for the people to think that they did not see the advantages and that they only thought of the disadvantages at that time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That speech was made by the present Taoiseach less than a year ago.  I can understand that sometimes a statesman or politician may change his view on a certain problem.</P>

Surely, however, there has never been any responsible statesman who has changed his views so rapidly in regard to a matter which was such a vital issue in a general election than the present Taoiseach in that general election?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is seeking to suggest, while retiring from the House now, that his Taoiseach is not a responsible Taoiseach.  Turning now to the Taoiseach's speech in his final appeal to the electorate, I have here the leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the same date.  It is needless for me to point out that the <i>Irish Press</i> is governed and controlled by no less a person than the Taoiseach and his Party.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is this fidelity of the average man and woman to Fianna Fáil that explains the kind of propaganda the Coalition has used in this election. It has been aimed at creating fear among the wage-earners in shops and factory, and of farmers and farm labourers.  If Fianna Fáil is elected, they are told, they will attack the pay packets of the factory workers (for whom, by the way, it was Fianna Fáil that produced most of the factories), cut the social services, tax the things the poor consume, make life more difficult for the family (the family that has always been Fianna Fáil's special care).&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I submit that a question of public morality <Col N="1613" /> and public decency should always be a matter for this House, and there has never been a more clearly defined breach of a public undertaking than has been brought about by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>We were told in the scheme that was promised, and to which I have already adverted, that there would be no means test in relation to old age pensions except in the case of the very rich.  That was subsequently modified and we were told that there would be no means test in the case of an old age pensioner receiving £100 per annum&mdash; that is, £2 per week.  We turn to this Bill and we find that if an old age pensioner receives £1 Os. 3d.&mdash;mark the 3d. &mdash;he will be docked 5/- in his pension. If he receives £1 Os. 2d. he will get the full old age pension.  The Bill provides that an old person may receive 30/3 per week and an old age pension of 10/- per week but if he receives 40/3 per week he will only receive a pension of 5/- and if he receives 40/4 he will get nothing.  Has there ever been a narrower definition of a means test?  Has there ever been a more nonsensical definition of a means test?  If one has £1 Os. 2d. per week one will receive the full old age pension: if one has £1 Os. 3d. per week one will lose 5/-.</P>
      <P>The Bill has dropped&mdash;I do not say that this is any breach of any undertaking given by the Minister either here or elsewhere because he did indicate his disapproval of giving retirement pensions at the age of 65&mdash;the provision for a retirement pension at the age of 65.  It has been quite erroneously suggested by some speakers that the Norton Bill provided for compulsory retirement at the age of 65.  That is quite untrue.  There was no such provision in the Bill.  It merely provided that a person who had given 40 or 45, or possibly more, years of gainful work to the nation could retire at the age of 65 and receive a retirement pension.  There was no question of compulsory retirement.  Anybody who wished to do so could continue working after that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told now that there is no necessity for anybody to retire at the age of 65 and that, indeed, most people would prefer to continue working. <Col N="1614" /> That may be so.  It depends on the individual.  Nobody suggests anybody should be prevented from working. But if the provision is so unnecessary, why then do we compel our civil servants to retire at the age of 65 and why do we provide them with a pension at the age of 65?  Why do we compel the members of the police force to retire at an even earlier age and members of the Defence Forces? Surely the State has not arbitrarily decided to retire civil servants at the age of 65 and pay to them a pension from that time onwards unless the State considered it proper and right to do so.  Is there any reason why other sections of the community should be treated less favourably?  Are civil servants so hard worked that their health is likely to break down by the time they reach the age of 65?  Is that the reason?  Is it a particularly dangerous kind of occupation?  I do not think so.  I do not think anybody here would suggest that it was.  Civil servants are rather healthy and seem to enjoy life quite well.  I do not see that there exist greater hazards or risks amongst civil servants than amongst any other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Norton Bill provided for the payment of a maternity grant of £5. Frankly, I thought it was a miserable amount at the time but miserable and all as it was, the Minister cut that miserly sum down to £2 and abolished completely the provisions contained in the Norton Bill for the payment of a weekly maternity attendance benefit of £1.  That is from the Party that complained that the Norton Bill was not comprehensive enough and that they would introduce a bigger and better one.  We heard a lot in recent times about the mothers and children of the country and about means tests.</P>
    <P>I have not heard one word from the Deputies, who sought election from the people on the basis that they were against the means tests, that they object to the fantastic and ridiculous means test in this Bill.  I have not heard one word of protest from the Deputies who professed such considerable interest in the mothers and <Col N="1615" /> children of this country, at the fact that this Bill deprives mothers of the already miserly amount provided for them.  Nor was there any protest from them on the score that it deprives mothers, in addition, of the weekly maternity attendance grant of £1 per week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke in this House on this measure and tried to justify his support of the measure.  He informed the House that he was going to support this measure and then tried to justify his support of the present Government.  He never adverted to the fact that there was a more stringent means test in this Bill than in any of the proposals in regard to any mother and child scheme.  He never adverted to the fact that the mothers were to be deprived of more than half of the maternity grant under this Bill or that the mothers were to be deprived of the provisions for a maternity attendance of £1 per week which were contained in the Norton Bill.  His speech to the House consisted of the usual type of personal attack in which he seems to revel whenever he speaks.  He took the opportunity of repeating an accusation which he made against me elsewhere in regard to a photograph which was taken.  The accusation which he made is misleading in the extreme and is just a perversion of the facts.  I did not deal with this matter in this House before because I felt that it was one of those irresponsible accusations which he might have made in a fit of bad temper and that the sooner it was forgotten the better, from his point of view.  I should like briefly, with the permission of the Chair, to deal with it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the ruling of the Chair I shall limit myself to saying that the statement made by Deputy Dr. Browne in reference to that incident was completely misleading and was calculated to create a completely false and wrong impression. In the course of the same speech, Deputy Dr. Browne, who seemed to be making his speech from a prepared script, took occasion to refer to some conversation which, he said, he had with &ldquo;a distinguished prelate&rdquo; whom he did not name.  The purport of his conversation, so far as one could make out from Deputy Dr. Browne's speech, was to suggest that this unnamed distinguished prelate had indicated to him that the very poor were not worth being concerned about.  I do think that there are some limits beyond which Deputies in this House, even Deputy Dr. Browne, should not stoop in matters of this kind.  It is always improper to make an accusation against a named person who is not able to answer it in this House.  It is far more improper still to make an accusation of this kind against an unnamed person, belonging to a class of persons, making it completely impossible for the statement to be controverted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every responsible Deputy in this House will know, and accept it, that no responsible prelate, that no, to use the words of Deputy Dr. Browne, &ldquo;distinguished prelate&rdquo; of any Church, would ever say that the very poor should not be considered.  I cannot help, however, commenting on the animus which seems to impel Deputy Dr. Browne to raise religious issues in this House and to try to stir up sectarian feelings.  Statements made by Deputy Dr. Browne in this <Col N="1617" /> connection have already done considerable damage to this country throughout the world and have been used extensively as propaganda against this country; not merely against this country but against the Church to which most of the members of this House belong.</P>
    <P>However, to return to the actual issues, it seems to me there is a complete conflict of view between the different sections of the Government who support this Bill.  On the one hand, we have this declaration by Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;I am quoting from column 1003, of the Dáil Debates for the 1st April, 1952, Volume 130, No. 7, where he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I have said I believe fervently in the Welfare State.  I intend to pursue ruthlessly and relentlessly, as long as I am in public life to the extent that I can so do, the achievement for our people of that equality in the treatment of these accidents and of the inevitable developments amongst the old and the weak.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, everybody agrees in general with this declaration, but in that statement Deputy Dr. Browne declares himself to be a fervent believer in the welfare State.  On the other hand, we have Deputy Kennedy making his statement dealing with social security. It is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 19th February.  In this statement he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;If the welfare State ever came to Ireland the present system of farming, for which great sacrifices were made, would go,&rsquo; said Mr. M. J. Kennedy, T.D., Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare, speaking in Mullingar at a Fianna Fáil cumann last night.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;The social welfare schemes,&rsquo; Mr. Kennedy said, &lsquo;are for those in want as are housing schemes and every other State help.  If free-for-all grants and allowances have crept into any schemes, it is wrong in principle and dangerous for the future of the State.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that, and I hope we will get a categorical pronouncement from the Government about the welfare State.  At the moment, I am only drawing attention to the complete conflict that seems to exist on the Government Benches. On the one hand, we have the declaration from Deputy Dr. Browne saying that he stands for the welfare State, and on the other hand we have the declaration from Deputy Kennedy apparently echoed by his colleague now.</P>

      <P>I object to any terminological definition in regard to social security, because I must say there is always a danger in adopting a word or two words to describe a whole system.  The use of the words &ldquo;Welfare State&rdquo; is capable of a considerable amount of misconstruction in two opposite directions, and may have a different meaning, according to the understanding of the person who uses them.  Therefore, it is always unwise to tie yourself to definitions of that kind.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the House to some of the bitter attacks made by Deputy Cowan about a year ago on the Fianna Fáil Party for opposing the Norton Bill, bitter attacks that led Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, and now Minister for Finance, to indulge in one of his usual vitriolic personal attacks on Deputy Cowan in which he described him as &ldquo;this Nuncio of the Red Pope in the Kremlin.&rdquo;  Deputy Cowan is now one of those who is going to support this measure.  He is now one of Deputy MacEntee's allies.  Nevertheless, his criticism of the Fianna Fáil Party then in regard to social welfare is worth quoting.  Speaking in the House on the 5th April, 1951, just a year ago, Volume 125, No. 2, column 245, Deputy Cowan said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a very old dodge to oppose <Col N="1619" /> a Bill such as this on the grounds that it is not good enough, that it does not produce adequate benefits and, at the same time, that it is too costly.  Many of us are familiar with that state of mind.  It is a typical Fianna Fáil approach.  We had it during the 16 years that Fianna Fáil were in office.  When we endeavoured to get increases in wages for road workers we were told: &lsquo;You cannot do it; it would seriously upset agricultural workers,&rsquo; and when we tried to get an increase in wages for agricultural workers we were told: &lsquo;You cannot do it because it would upset the balance between agricultural workers and local authority workers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, dealing with this question of increased contributions, Deputy Cowan referring to the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, said at column 246:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the Deputy has somersaulted and says that we do not need any increase in contributions but can raise the necessary funds by taxation.  What does that show to me?  It shows a Party that is dishonest.  It shows a Party which knows, which must know, that it will not assume the responsibility of office again; it shows a Party in defeat attempting to gain the few miserable votes that will keep some of them in Parliament after the next election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the gallant Captain, Deputy Cowan, finished with a flourish:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once Fianna Fáil have taken the line of opposing progress, there is a war on between the progressives and Fianna Fáil and in that warfare Fianna Fáil are going to the wall. They deserve to go to the wall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a public representative who apparently, with such a complete disregard for his promises, is now going to vote for this measure.</P>
    <P>I indicated, at the outset of my statement to the House, the approach which I would suggest should be taken to the whole question of social welfare. I am sorry that this measure is introduced <Col N="1620" /> in the kind of atmosphere that precludes any reasonable or objective discussion of the social welfare requirements of this State.  I think that the Minister in reply should at least seek to give some justification for the flagrant breach of election promises in this case.  I think this is called for if public life is to maintain any vestige of respect in the eyes of the people.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not in the House now as there is another matter to which I want to refer before concluding. A good deal of heat was engendered the other day during the discussion of this measure because some Deputies in the House referred to the fact that the Minister was a director of an insurance company and is closely involved in an insurance company.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for a number of years and have respect for his personal integrity.  I want, therefore, to make it quite clear that anything I say in this respect is not intended to convey that the Minister has acted dishonestly in the personal sense in this matter but I feel that, as a public representative, it is my duty to enter a protest at the fact that the Minister in charge of a measure of this kind should be somebody who is closely involved, financially and otherwise, in the operation of a private insurance company.</P>
    <P>The Bill which passed the Second Reading in this House and which was introduced by the last Government provided for two particular features of vital importance, the payment of retirement pensions at the age of 65 on the one hand and the payment of death benefits on the other.  These two provisions were opposed by the insurance companies on the ground that they cut into the business of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>To say the least of it, it is undesirable that a Minister who is himself closely allied and involved in the workings of an insurance company should be in charge of a measure which cuts out the death benefits and which cuts out the retirement pensions; the two provisions of the Social Welfare Bill which were opposed by the insurance companies.  I feel that I am entitled <Col N="1621" /> to make this comment now to the House particularly because some months ago I drew the attention of the Taoiseach in this House to the fact that it was undesirable that the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare should be entrusted with the particular task of drawing up a Social Welfare Bill having regard to his close association with an insurance company.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I pointed out to the Taoiseach in this House that a maxim which we have in the law world is one that should also be applied to such a situation.  We say in the law world that justice must not only be fair but must also appear to be fair. I would suggest that in public life there must not only be complete personal integrity but there must also appear to be complete personal integrity and that it would be very hard to eradicate from the minds of the people that a decision to remove death benefits from the ambit of this Bill and the decision to do away with retirement pensions were not in some degree influenced by the fact that the Minister in charge of this Bill is himself closely associated with an insurance company.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not suggest that the Minister is consciously doing this because of any question of personal gain but I do think that it is undesirable that in this case the Minister should have been involved with the cutting out of these two benefits.  I hope the Minister will not think when he reads this&mdash;he has just returned to the House now&mdash;that I have brought this up merely to make a personal attack on him.</P>

      <P>Since the <Col N="1622" /> Second Reading of this particular Bill was introduced the debate and the attitude of the country have been marked by certain significant features. The one that struck me particularly was the silence of the Fianna Fáil Deputies on this particular measure. I do not know what their reason is but it is significant that we had about four or five speakers, excluding the Minister, from the Fianna Fáil Benches as against the spate of speakers we had last year when the Norton Bill was being debated.  I think I would be correct in saying that any of the Fianna Fáil speakers who did rise to their feet did so because they were dragged to their feet by their opposite numbers in the various constituencies.</P>
      <P>I rather imagine, therefore, that the silence of the Fianna Fáil Deputies can only be explained by saying that they anticipated or had some prior general knowledge of the Budget proposals and that even to them Deputy Dr. Ryan's Social Security Bill did not seem one-tenth as attractive as what it was represented to be when Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, spoke in this House on the measure of last year. I think that even since the terms of the Budget have been made known the Bill fades into absolute insignificance as far as the insured workers, the old age pensioners and the widows and orphans are concerned.</P>
      <P>The second feature was the provocative speech of a Minister who is generally a reasonable man, especially when moving the Second Reading of a Bill.  Knowing him slightly better than most other Deputies, I wondered why he went out of his way on this occasion to be bitter and spiteful. Then I remembered the bitterness and spite of every single one of the Fianna Fáil Ministers since they returned to office nine or ten months ago.  If we are to gauge his fury, bitterness, and spite from his first speech, we may expect twice as much bitterness, spite and provocation when he winds up this debate this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather imagined that the Minister's Second Reading speech would be merely an explanation of the Bill. Actually, the Minister was on the defensive at one stage and at another <Col N="1623" /> stage he was on the offensive.  In short, his speech was a personal attack, in my opinion, on the man responsible for introducing a Bill during the régime of the inter-Party Government.  It is true that there was a delay in the introduction of the Norton Bill, but I think the Minister would be the first to admit and appreciate the difficulties a Minister would have and the difficulties his officials would have in framing a comprehensive scheme of social security. It must be remembered also that for the first few months he was in office Deputy Norton, when he was Minister, was engaged in preparing another Bill which was framed to relieve the circumstances of old age pensioners and widows and orphans.  If it were to be boiled down, I should say that the alleged delay would be in the region of one year and nine months as far as the Norton Bill was concerned.</P>
    <P>There was no genuine attempt by the Minister or by the members of his Party to refute the allegation that, when Deputy Norton went into the Department, he saw nothing more there than a scrap of paper from the previous Minister.  I do not allege that the Minister intended to deceive the House.  I would like, however, carefully to scrutinise the bundle of documents which he laid on the desk in front of him which he sarcastically referred to as &ldquo;the scrap of paper&rdquo;. For all the House knows, it might be a collection of reports from the international Labour Office or documents in connection with the Beveridge Plan.  It could be merely the ordinary information contained in any Department of Social Welfare in any State.  But the significant thing in connection with social security is that, despite the six or seven questions which Deputy McGrath put down, there was no real clamour and no demand from the Fianna Fáil Party during that three years for a comprehensive scheme of social security as envisaged by Deputy Norton.  It was merely in the nature of a taunt from the Fianna Fáil Party to Deputy Norton to try to rush him into producing some sort of comprehensive scheme of social security.  There was no real clamour from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> In his speech last March, Deputy Cowan recognised that and accused the Fianna Fáil Party, and rightly so, of not having any real interest in the production of a comprehensive scheme of social security.  The Minister tells us that it took him only nine months.  I think I would be correct in saying that the last major piece of legislation in respect of social security under the Fianna Fáil Government was passed in 1943 with regard to children's allowances. From that up to 1947, or the beginning of 1948, there was no major piece of legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil with regard to social security.</P>
    <P>I would say that, by their silence, when Deputy Norton's scheme of social security was introduced, the Fianna Fáil Party did a great disservice to the insured workers and those people who are dependent on social services, because Deputy Norton at that time had to meet a barrage of criticism from every conceivable source which condemned the very principle of social security.  Every chamber of commerce, every organisation of employers, practically every employing section in the State who would be forced, if you like, to contribute in one way or another, raised their voices as loud as they could, not against any particular scheme, but against a comprehensive scheme of social security.  It was only when the Second Reading of Deputy Norton's Bill was being discussed in this House that we got the &ldquo;pipsqueak&rdquo; declaration by the spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party that they were in favour of the principle of social security.</P>
    <P>We wonder now where does Deputy Cogan stand, where does Deputy Lehane stand, where does Deputy Flynn stand.  We did not hear them in this debate quoting the moralists or alleging that social security was bad on moral grounds.  But, merely because they are more interested in keeping their seats, we have their defence for voting for this particular Bill and the allegation that Deputy Norton's amendment is a mere political trick.</P>
    <P>As far as the actual Bill is concerned, there is no necessity for me to repeat what has been said by the members of <Col N="1625" /> the Labour Party, that we do not oppose this Bill.  A Bill like this, which will undoubtedly improve to some limited extent the lot of certain people. has our approval.  But this amendment has been tabled in an effort to demonstrate that this Bill does not represent a comprehensive scheme of social security.  Therefore, I propose to deal with the things that are not in the Bill and which we suggest, through our amendment, should be in the Bill if it is to be regarded as in any way approaching a comprehensive scheme of social security.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quite casual when he dismissed with a sort of wave of his hand the necessity for having domestic workers and female farm workers included.  I think there is a case for that.  The Minister says that he is advised that unemployment, as far as domestic workers is concerned, is not frequent.  I think it is, to a limited extent.  Where there is unemployment amongst that particular class, even though it is limited, I think that they should be given the benefit of anything the State can offer.  There is another question which I should like the Minister to clear up, and that is whether or not domestic workers in hospitals or other institutions would be regarded as being outside the scope of this Bill.  If they are to be deprived of the benefits under this Bill, I think it is very undesirable.</P>
    <P>One of the most important omissions, as far as the Bill is concerned, is that in connection with retirement pensions.  Now I would like to refute an oft-repeated allegation by a member of the House from my own constituency, Deputy Allen.  In the House last year, Deputy Allen stated very emphatically that the Norton Bill endeavoured to compel people to retire at 65 years of age.  That was not so bad because it could be contradicted here but at column 576 of the Official Debates of 11th April, 1951, Deputy Allen said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are not, however, agreed that everyone in this country, when he or she comes to 65, should be compelled to retire and should be given a retiring pension.  We are not <Col N="1626" /> agreed on that, and that is where we join issue in the main with the Minister on this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But that was not sufficient for Deputy Allen.  Next I heard him state it down in his constituency.  At every public meeting which he addressed in the last election he broadcast to his various audiences, as far as the inter-Party Government was concerned, and as far as Deputy Norton was concerned, that they wanted this social security measure to compel people to retire at 65.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister ever stated that or not but I give him credit for having a little more political honesty in that respect than his colleague would have.  Such unscrupulous statements are not worthy of a man like Deputy Allen who has been in public life in his own county for so long.  We do not want people to retire at 65.  What we want, by our amendment, what we had intended in the Norton Bill was that if a man found that he was not in a position to work, if he was unable to work or if he could not get work, he could have the security of knowing that at the age of 65 years he would be entitled, without a means test, to a retirement pension. The Minister for Social Welfare, in his Second Reading speech, put forward various reasons as to the undesirability of not even offering a man a retirement pension at the age of 65.  I think Deputy McGrath instanced cases of workers in the City of Cork who were still working at the age of 65.  It is possible, but they are the exception rather than the rule.  I think Deputy McGrath will agree, and it has been my experience as well, that on any of the local authorities' building schemes on any particular job where the work is heavy, there are very few employers, if any, who will take a man at that particular age.  There are pitiable instances in my own town where a man who is over 60 years of age approaches the local ganger, the local foreman or the local engineer asking for a job and the reply is always in the negative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The same provision is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>The same provision is not there.  The provision here means that they are subjected to the very same scrutiny as they would be in the ordinary circumstances when they were applying for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit; they must prove to the satisfaction of the local labour exchange overseer that they are suitable for work and willing to work.  I do not think that is much of a concession to a man at 65 because the cases I have in mind are those of men who consider themselves to be suitable for work, able to work and, above all, willing to work, but no employer will take them.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think the Minister ought to reconsider his decision not to include retirement pensions in social security schemes in this country. I can tell the Minister on behalf of the people I represent in my constituency, that there is a strong and urgent demand for retirement pensions or, if you like, old age pensions, at the age of 65, giving the person the option of continuing work beyond 65 or 70 if he or she so desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joke of the whole business is that retirement pensions are denied to manual workers.  We have heard a lot of criticism about social security and the principle has been attacked. Deputy Cogan says we are pampering one section of the community, that a minority section in the country must contribute to do this.  I know that Deputy Cogan and every other Deputy in this House keep in close contact with their constituents, but do they ever stop to realise the insecurity that the majority of the workers, especially in the rural areas, have at the present time?  Do they ever stop to think of the times when a rural worker, who is depending for his employment on the local county council, has to suffer the indignity&mdash;and no other word can describe it&mdash;of going either to the ganger or the local district engineer three or four times a year to ask him, for God's sake, to give him employment? Everyone knows there is not continuity of employment as far as the local authorities are concerned. Hundreds of people in each county who are dependent for their employment on the local authorities are idle for three <Col N="1628" /> or four or five times during the year and, as far as security is concerned, in their cases there is no such thing.</P>
    <P>The critics of social security in this country are the people who have security, either by reason of the fact that they are in pensionable employment or by reason of the fact that their income during the year is sufficient to enable them to provide against the different hazards that beset the ordinary individual during his or her lifetime.  Therefore, I think it is a pertinent question for each and every one of us to ask: if retirement pensions are to be denied to the carpenter, the mason, the bricklayer, the agricultural labourer, the dock labourer, the road worker, why have we in this country a system whereby civil servants are given free non-contributory pensions at the age of 65?</P>
    <P>I think again it is pertinent to ask why local government officials are given pensions at the age of 65; in the majority of cases they have not to contribute one penny for them.  I wonder would Deputy Cogan imagine, urge or submit to this House that civil servants were being pampered and that the ordinary taxpayers of this country were paying for that, because as I said, these pensions are free and the taxpayers of this country have contributed. The same applies as far as Local Government officials are concerned and no less than a week or two ago we had the Minister for Local Government defending his action in directing a local authority to require rate collectors in the different local authorities to retire at the age of 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not attempt to take responsibility for the actions of the Cork Deputies.  I think one of the most important features of the Norton Bill was the death benefit.  As Deputy MacBride has rightly said, this is a hazard of life which is certain to beset practically every single family.  I would reiterate what has often been thrown against one of the <Col N="1629" /> members of the Fine Gael Party: social services are a lot of medicine bottles to be taken out when necessary.  It will be ever thus until we can get, first of all, a decent wage standard in this country, and secondly, until we can get for the workers of this country some security as far as continuity of employment is concerned.  As long as wages are not what they should be and as long as there is no security in employment, we will have to have schemes of social security.  I feel that one of the most charitable acts, despite what Deputy Cogan says, which the taxpayers of this country can do is to partially contribute towards the payment of a gratuity to certain workers in this country when they meet the unfortunate and expensive hazard of a death in the family.  In my opinion, if this were included in a scheme of social security it would be an absolute and real benefit for all families.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that I would not say anything derogatory with regard to any of my opposite numbers.  Deputy Dr. Browne, when speaking on this measure, said at column 1010 of the Official Reports, on the 1st April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will make certain that I will try very hard indeed before giving Deputy Norton and his associates in the inter-Party Government&mdash;the Fine Gael organisation and the other organisations&mdash;an opportunity of restoring the medical association to the Custom House and the other similar powerful vested interests...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging from that, Deputy Dr. Browne infers that Deputy Norton and his colleagues capitulated in favour of the medical association.  My feeling is that the Minister and the Government capitulated to the insurance companies of this country as far as the dropping of the death benefits is concerned. Even though the Norton Bill provided for an increased contribution of 1/2 per week, that 1/2 would have been justified so as to meet the various expenses which a family has to meet when a death occurs.  We are all aware that, in the majority of the families, whether they be in the <Col N="1630" /> towns, the cities or in the rural areas, contributions of 2d., 3d., 4d., 5d., 6d., and, in some cases, up to 1/- per week are being paid in respect of every single member&mdash;father, mother and children&mdash;so as to provide against the hazard of death and so as to have-something to offset the abnormal expenses of such a time.</P>
    <P>I feel it is deplorable that a marriage gratuity should be substituted for the death grant.  Death comes unexpectedly and is a real hazard.  I feel sure I would not get universal support if I said marriage was not a hazard.  However, marriage is something for which a couple prepare.  They are aware it is coming off for some weeks or months before the actual date of the marriage. On the other hand, death may strike at a family quite suddenly and they are not prepared for it usually.  We should, therefore, make certain that these families would be insured against the abnormal expenses which crop up when a death occurs.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil members, to my view, feel very strongly on the dropping from this Bill of the maternity grant.  This also is a time of abnormal expense.  It is a time when money has to be gathered and gathered quickly. The proposals in the Norton Bill, whereby a maternity grant of £5 was to be given and whereby an attendance allowance for three or four weeks after the birth of the child was provided, was a desirable form of insurance.  The tendency is, of necessity, when a death or birth occurs, that the family concerned find themselves paying off for weeks afterwards the abnormal expense which arises on these occasions.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Fianna Fáil Party would feel more strongly about the point of including the small farmer than on any other point.  However, they have turned completely on their heels.  That, I feel, was evidenced by the very, very short contribution which Deputy Corry made on this measure last week.  I was in the House expecting to speak, and I felt that Deputy Corry was good for an hour and a quarter.  I was robbed of my opportunity to speak, however, because when I returned to the House after an absence of ten minutes I found <Col N="1631" /> that the long-winded Deputy Corry did not say two words about the small farmer or about any other type of farmer.  Deputy Tom Brennan waxed eloquent on the subject of the small farmer last year, as also did the present Minister for Finance and practically every other Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  These people were against the Norton Bill because it did not include enough benefit for this section of the community.  The Norton Bill did something for the small farmers, but this Bill does practically nothing.</P>
    <P>As far as the reversal of the Fianna Fáil policy, to some extent, on social security is concerned, perhaps it would be no harm to quote the present Taoiseach.  This, I must confess, even though the storm had been going on for months, was the first indication from Fianna Fáil, and, indeed, it was only pipsqueak, that they favoured a comprehensive social security scheme. I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 12th February, 1951.  On this occasion the Taoiseach was addressing the County Cavan Comhairle Dáil Ceanntair. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was becoming a more and more serious question for every State in the world.  You have two extremes of thought.  In one, the position is that of <i>laissez faire</i>&mdash; don't interfere, let things be, let the State keep out of it, and let the individual be free to act for himself in whatever condition he may find himself.  Those who supported that point of view claimed that, if that system was allowed to operate fully, the best would come to the top and that there would be no more inducement to everyone to think harder and work harder, and that the whole position of the community under such a system would improve.</P>
    <P>On the other side, they had those who stood for what might be called the welfare State, a State which would entitle the individual, by reason of his being a member of the community, to be safeguarded by the community's actions from the sufferings which might befall him and which were outside his own control. <Col N="1632" /> These included such things as special demands on the family at times of birth, during the infancy of the child; demands made by incapacity from work, unemployment, disablement and death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that the Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, thought we should provide help for a family in the case of a birth and above all that he thought we should provide insurance for them against the abnormal expenses when a death occurs.  He said that not less than 12 months ago; and here we have a situation, whether it is due to the pressure of the little man from Threadneedle Street&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;or whether it is due to the Central Bank, where even the Taoiseach is forced to turn in his tracks and say that we cannot provide adequately for maternity and that we cannot provide anything in the way of death grants.</P>
    <P>Above all, as I have said already, we find that the Fianna Fáil Party have turned in their tracks as far as the small farmers are concerned.  Deputy Tom Brennan stated in the Dáil on 11th April, 1951 at column 547 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I bewail the fact that almost one-half of the workers of the country, represented particularly by the small farmers, are not covered by the scheme.  I hold that it is a misnomer to call any scheme of social insurance which does not make provision for these people, comprehensive.  A big number of workers are not covered by this scheme, such as the small farmers, the self-employed man, fishermen, and other classes.  We are making provision for people who are earning good wages and whose income is, perhaps, treble that of the small farmer on the hillsides or on the bogs.  To me, the irony of the whole thing is that, while we are making a certain section of our people secure, the small farmer on the hills and on the bogs and the fishermen, the people who always upheld the national tradition in this country, are left out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Norton left them out, the present Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1633" /> kicked them out.  The Minister for Finance, when Deputy MacEntee, also waxed eloquent about the non-inclusion of the small farmers.  Again, somebody seems to have got his way&mdash; either Deputy MacEntee, in a change of policy, or the Central Bank.  The small farmers have not been included in a scheme of social security.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that Deputy Norton's Bill was opposed on the grounds that it was not comprehensive enough.  I wonder, if the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were to express their honest view, if they would say whether the present Minister's Bill is comprehensive or not.  I think the most important feature with regard to this particular measure is the question of paying for the scheme.  I admit that the big attraction of Deputy Dr. Ryan's pronouncement last March, or the attraction in the general election promise, was that under his particular scheme the workers would not be asked to contribute anything.  When Fianna Fáil tramped the country in the general election of 1951, it was belled into the heads of the workers that if they put Fianna Fáil back they would get exactly what was in the Norton scheme and would not have to pay 1d. for it. They are now getting what was in the Norton scheme&mdash;with six omissions&mdash; and they have to pay an increased contribution.  The contribution is not as high as it would have been under the Norton Bill, but the extra benefits under the Norton Bill very well compensated the worker.</P>
    <P>I warned the workers in my constituency that if Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, introduced a comprehensive scheme of social security and did not demand a contribution from the workers they would be forced to pay it by way of taxation.  I think last Wednesday has admirably demonstrated that if Fianna Fáil were prepared to give a scheme of social security to the workers of this country they would make them pay dearly for it.  The terms of last Wednesday's Budget have indicated to every worker in this country that if he is getting a scheme from the Fianna Fáil Government he will pay dearly for it.</P>
    <P>As far as the scheme itself is concerned, the worker must pay an extra <Col N="1634" /> 5d. per week.  I submit that, with the withdrawal of the food subsidies, the contribution in respect of the averagesized family will be two and three times what was required under the Norton Bill.  Let us take, for example, a family of five&mdash;a man, his wife and three children.  The reliefs to be afforded to that family by way of children's allowances will amount to 4/- per week&mdash;2/6 for the second child and 1/6 extra for the third child.  If that family consume the ordinary ration of tea, sugar, butter and bread they will pay an extra 6/7 per week which, with the extra 5d. which must be paid under this Bill, will amount to 7/- per week.  I am talking now only of the increase in the price of tea, butter, sugar and bread and of the reliefs afforded to such a family under the Budget which the Minister for Finance read last Wednesday.  I am not even mentioning beer and cigarettes&mdash;things that the Fianna Fáil Government have declared, by inference, to be luxuries to the ordinary workers of this country.  When the reliefs which the Minister proposes to give are deducted from the increased price of butter, sugar, tea and bread that family will have to pay an extra 7/- per week on the ordinary ration of these foods.</P>
    <P>I do not think a family of six would be an abnormal example to quote as far as this Bill is concerned.  Taking merely the present ration of tea, sugar, butter and bread it means that, if one offsets the reliefs afforded by way of children's allowances, the increased cost of food for that family, consisting of a man, his wife and four children, will amount to 7/8 per week. Again, I would point out that that does not give one halfpenny extra to buy a bottle of stout or a packet of Woodbines or a packet of Players.</P>
    <P>Now let us consider a family of seven consisting of a man, his wife and five children.  Again, I do not think such a family could be regarded as abnormal in size.  Under the recent Budget proposals such a family will get relief to the extent, I think, of 7/- but they will have to pay 14/10½ extra for their foodstuffs. That means, when the reliefs are deducted, an increase of 7/10½ plus the 5d. which will be required under <Col N="1635" /> this scheme.  That family of seven will, therefore, have to pay 8/3½ or 8/4 extra.  In these circumstances was it not absolute fraud for the Fianna Fáil Party and their spokesmen in the last general election, and even within the past ten months, to say that they would give the people a comprehensive scheme of social security and that no contributions would be required?</P>
    <P>I submit that, even though the Norton Bill was objected to by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Lehane, and though it was approved of by Deputy Cowan, it was a more reasonable scheme than the present Fianna Fáil scheme when we couple with it the proposals announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget of last week. The workers are paying through the nose for this scheme.</P>

      <P>I was absent from this House on Friday as I was attending a family funeral.  The Minister must have been well aware that I was absent and the reason for my absence, but that did not enter into any explanation.  It is necessary for me now to explain what happened on account of the publicity the statement got in the House and throughout the country.  As is customary, a copy of the Budget statement was given to me as well as to others.  I placed the copy of the speech in front of me and I followed it as the Minister read his speech aloud.  Other Deputies sitting beside me read it as the Minister was reading his speech.  I did not read it in advance of the Minister.  I want to make that point clear.</P>

I <Col N="1638" /> have not shown them to any of my colleagues on the back benches or those sitting alongside me except perhaps on an occasion when the Tánaiste may have had a copy or the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Aiken, may have had a copy to direct their attention to a particular point, but never were those copies which were circulated as a matter of courtesy treated by us with the same lack of discretion and lack of responsibility as they were on last Wednesday.</P>

      <P>We are discussing social security at a time when the country is completely bewildered. Last year we had talk of hair shirts and overall gloom in conneetion with a measure similar to this.  This year we are discussing it in an atmosphere of sunshine, but the people generally do not believe that anything good will come out of this Bill.  There are Bills galore, and the people are always told <Col N="1639" /> they must pay for them.  I have always believed in social security, but I believe the country should be well organised before an attempt is made at such security.</P>

      <P>Before a scheme of this kind can be brought before the country the country should be educated for it.  There should be a publicity campaign, and it should not be a race between Parties to see which will gain the most votes.  Some time before the change of Government Deputy Norton brought in a Social Welfare Bill.  That Bill was built on sound principles, but it was met by an organised Press campaign denouncing it.  The present Government has brought in an almost identical Bill.  There is no Press campaign now, and seemingly there is a blessing on the Bill.  I hate that kind of hypocrisy.  Principles remain the same, and if they are admitted they must be admitted for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this measure has been brought in, not so much for the good of the people but rather out of a desire by the Government to down the Norton Bill by bringing in a cheap type of social security on their own lines&mdash;on austerity lines.  Some form of social security was inevitable in the present set-up as some scheme was badly needed because we have too many people living in insecurity and <Col N="1640" /> the least sign of depression brings them to the border of destitution.  If Deputies were reasonable, I am satisfied that there should be no need for conflict on a measure of this kind. The people's co-operation should be sought and Church and State should have joined together to see that a measure was brought in here which would have the blessing of all the people.  Instead of that, we have a race between politicians to see who will get the most votes out of these schemes and, unfortunately, you never get a good Bill in conditions of that kind.  I agree, however, that a Bill of this kind, having a contributory basis, is good because it gives people self-respect, feeling, as they do, when they come to draw benefits that they are getting something for which they paid out of their own pockets.  Certainly, this measure is a great step forward from the system of doles and sops which so degraded the people of this country over a long number of years.  Doles and sops have always made schemers of the people and led them to evade the law whenever they could.  We do not want a repetition of that situation.</P>
    <P>If this scheme is worked on right lines I am satisfied that it should eventually mean a saving to the people in many other directions.  If Christianity were practised in its fullness, as it should be in this country, there would be no need for schemes of this kind. We all know that the root cause of social insecurity is man's inhumanity to his fellow-man.  We are living in an imperfect age and the greed of the few has brought about the suffering of the many.  There is such a vast number of people who have no security of any kind that schemes of this character are necessary to stem the tide of Communism that threatens to engulf Europe.  I am satisfied that social security on a Christian basis is a bulwark against such a danger.  Communism is a direct result of greed-the greed of the few to possess what should belong to the many.  There are many good points in the present Bill but it contains many defects also.  For instance, the fact that the farmers are excluded from the Bill is a very grave defect.  While the farmers have to contribute, not once but twice, they <Col N="1641" /> get nothing for it.  He, however, has to pay his labouring man on Saturday night and make a contribution for his security and at the same time he has got to pay his own contribution.  The two contributions come out of the same pocket, still we exclude the farmer from any benefit.  That, I say, is a mean way of dealing with him because we all know that the most insecure people in the country are the small farmers.  They have to carry the biggest load and I do not see why they should be excluded.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Norton brought in his Bill, the present Minister asked: &ldquo;Why not include the farmers?&rdquo; and he added that when he was bringing in a Bill he would include them.  Now we have his Bill before us and he is deliberately excluding them.  I think that is a shame, because it is the hard struggle of the small farmers that is keeping the country going.  We know what the farmers have had to go through over a long number of years, from the time of the Famine up to the present.  When I speak of farmers I mean, of course, the working farmers, men holding anything from five to 50 acres, not the big wealthy farmers who carry on farming only as a sideline. These working farmers, if they have to contribute to this scheme, should be entitled to all the benefits which it confers on any other section of the community and I hope that before the Bill passes the House, an amendment will be inserted whereby these worthy sections of the community will be brought within the Bill.  The Bill represents an injustice to the nation if they are excluded.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that this State really never got a chance.  We have had a surfeit of politics in this country for the past 30 years, of politics of stunts. There was hardly a decade in which some stunt was not introduced.  We had a stunt in 1922, a stunt in 1927, a stunt in 1932 and now we have a stunt in 1952.  Shock after shock was administered to the people.  What do you expect from a people who have had to undergo all that?  If you want honesty and principle, you cannot get them by giving shock after shock to the people in that manner.  After all <Col N="1642" /> these shocks, they are certainly not in a position to bear the further shock of the Budget they got last week.  They are now being told that they are going to bask in the sunshine of social security.  I think we should be honest and tell the people that if they are going to bask in the sunshine of social security, it will be at their own expense. I certainly am satisfied that the people of this country were badly trained for the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  They were trained to evade and to deceive for years and years; they were trekking to and from the labour exchanges to draw doles or sops.  The dole was only a miserable pittance upon which they were not able to live and they had to try to evade the law to get something additional.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that if the State were properly organised on a right basis this Bill could bring an immense amount of good.  As matters stand, we see a race between different Parties to see who is going to get the most votes out of it.  That is bad for the country.  There are very many heavy calls on the people, and the farmers especially are not one bit happy about the Bill.  I am a farmer myself and I think that the farmers should have been put in a position to understand this Bill, but they got no chance whatever.  This measure is being forced on a country that is unprepared. If the country got a chance there would be a proper publicity campaign carried on over a reasonable period; the people could then see the good points and the had points of the measure. The heads of the different Parties should have put these points before the people and Church and State should have come together to lay a proper foundation for a social security scheme.  Instead of that, we have confusion upon confusion and that is the time that is chosen to bring in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, as I have said, many defects in this Bill, too many defects. I am satisfied that one of the greatest <Col N="1643" /> benefits that could be provided for the masses of the people is a death benefit. That is excluded from this Bill for some reason which I cannot understand. Then we have a marriage benefit provided for.  Surely we all know that the death of any member of a family involves considerable expense and that is the time we should be able to give aid to the unfortunate people concerned.  Yet this Bill absolutely excludes any death benefits.</P>
    <P>We all know that when people get advanced in years their sons or daughters take out an insurance policy on them.  They pay the premium for, perhaps, 15 or 20 years.  Sometimes they have it paid three times over when the old person dies and they expect to draw about £40.  They draw, in fact, about £20.  That is a defect which, I think, should be remedied, because it is wrong.  It is legalised robbery of the people.  This Bill could have included a death benefit.  If it had, it would mean cutting out a good deal of this so-called insurance, which is nothing more than robbery.  Of course, there is something behind it. Why it is excluded I do not know. There seems to be some kind of a pull, some big pull, with the insurance companies all over the country.</P>
    <P>It is the same with the old age pensions.  I do not see why we should not give them to people at 60 or 65 years of age.  At the present time, in the County Meath, we have been ordered to pension off five or six men who are hale and hearty and in the full vigour of their life.  They are rate collectors who were in the employment of the Meath County Council, men who could have worked on for the next five or ten years, and who are just as good to-day as they were 15 or 20 years ago.  But no, an Order came from the Government and they must get out at 65 and must be given a reasonably big pension.  Young men will have to be put in their places. But while that could be done, there is nothing in this Bill to give hope to the small farmers and workers of the country, men who have worked hard all their lives.  If they could retire at 65, there would be a chance for a <Col N="1644" /> son or a daughter taking over the homestead.  Surely it would be just to give those men a retirement pension during the few years of life left to them.</P>
    <P>They have been excluded from the Bill.  The age laid down is 70 years. At that age a man will have very few years left to him to enjoy any benefit. I think that men who have sweated and toiled up to 65 years, and in most cases have reared families, are entitled to retire at 65 and to enjoy reasonable benefits.  Such a provision was in the Norton Bill.  I regard that omission from this Bill as a very bad defect.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why a marriage allowance should be paid because there are very few hazards attaching to a man when he is getting married.  He is then hale and hearty and full of life and should be left to fend for himself.  Now, the proposal is to give him a prop before he starts in life, but we will not give a prop to the poor old man who is tottering on the edge of the grave.  The Norton Bill provided death benefits.  These would be a help to an old person's relatives because, as we know, most of those old people leave debts that have to be paid after their death and these are often a source of worry to their relatives.  If that were done, of course, it would be following the Norton scheme in every detail.  That would not do at all because Fianna Fáil must have their own scheme.  Their idea is: &ldquo;How could Norton or the Labour Party bring in anything good for this country; no, they are not a national Party and they do not belong to the great Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a farmer, I have doubts about those schemes.  I would not have much doubt about a scheme if it were comprehensive, covering all sections of the people.  There is no reason why this scheme should not be comprehensive. What we have lacked in this country for a long number of years is a co-operative effort.  We have not given it the slightest encouragement.  If the small farmers had been included in this Bill then we would be making some move towards co-operative effort. They, surely, should have been included. We are not going to make much headway in this country until we <Col N="1645" /> have co-operative effort on the lines I suggest.  I hope it is not yet too late for the Minister to bring in amendments which will make this Bill a fully comprehensive one covering all sections.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Bill were it a contributory one under which the people, all classes of them, would get benefits as of right.  As it is only some classes will be entitled to benefit.  A comprehensive Bill should include all classes and the benefits would be there as of right for all.  I am satisfied that the Minister and this House will have to enlighten the people far more than has been the case so far before measures of this kind are put across.</P>
    <P>The farmers are not what I would call enemies of this Bill but they are enemies of a House that would force down their necks a Bill without either consulting them or the country.  They will have to pay contributions for themselves and their workmen and will then find themselves excluded from all benefit.  I say &ldquo;shame on the Minister for the insult he heaps on the farmers.&rdquo; They have to drag the load for everybody else.  Fianna Fáil blows its trumpets about social security but there is no social security for one section of the people&mdash;the farmers. They are being used as a Trojan horse, and always have been, for other sections.  They have to drag along in the mud.  I wonder if their consciences tickle Fianna Fáil for the political mistrust and bewildered confusion which they are creating?</P>
    <P>Where are the masses of votes to be found?  Are they to be found amongst the workers or the farmers? The Government know well that you have five labouring men to one farmer. That is the reason for this and that is why the farmers are neglected. They never grumble but even when they do they will not hit back.  I repeat that they are fully entitled to be included with other sections of the people in this Bill.  Who could need the benefits of it more than the small struggling farmer with ten or 15 acres of land trying to make ends meet? He is depressed at all times and has no help from the State or from anybody else.  He is going around in <Col N="1646" /> tatters and rags.  I am afraid that these will become less so.  That is the way we found them and that is the way we are leaving them.</P>
    <P>While this scheme may be an advance as regards social justice, in my opinion it is an ill-considered and an ill-advised one.  I think that the people are not educated for it.  The people down the country need more education in regard to these schemes.  We have had a flood of them in this House and they have left the people bewildered. As I said at the opening, we had hair-shirt hysterics last week, and now we are told that the people are going to bask in the sunshine of social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The provocative and very bad tempered type of speech made by the Minister when introducing this Bill proves to me, at any rate, that he has brought in this Bill, or has been forced to bring it in against his own good judgment&mdash;if he has good judgment&mdash; but certainly against his own wishes. Outside this House, the Minister is a good tempered, jovial, gentlemanly type of man.  I do not know why it is, since he went back in June last to the seat which he now occupies, that every time he gets up to speak he must pour out all kinds of personal abuse against the Leader of the Labour Party and Labour Deputies for not doing everything that he would like them to do. However, that is not going to affect in the slightest our outlook or attitude to this measure.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister would never have brought this measure before the House were it not for the fact that his predecessor introduced a better Bill on the 3rd March last year.  Now Fianna Fáil as a Party&mdash;since the day they were baptised or re-baptised as Fianna Fáil, and since the day they came into this House in particular&mdash; have claimed to be the successors of the Republican Parliament in 1919.  To that extent they claim&mdash;in my opinion they cannot prove it&mdash;that since they came in here, or since they came into power they have done their best to give effect to the Republican declaration, that is, to the democratic programme of Dáil Éireann that was read to that Assembly in 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge their right to make that <Col N="1647" /> claim.  I challenge their whole history. I assert that it is a very bad history if they claim to be the successors of the men who were responsible for the declarations contained in the democratic programme.  I challenge their right to claim that they have done anything to justify their attitude on matters of that kind.  Their history in respect to matters of social legislation is very much open to criticism and to question so far as they claim to be the successors of the men who were responsible for issuing the democratic programme in 1919.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, on many occasions in this House since October, 1947, has challenged the accuracy of statements that I have made here concerning what he said on the 22nd October, 1947, when he was asking the House to reject a motion of mine, which was brought in by the Fine Gael leaders at the time, for a modification of the means test so far as it then applied to the aged, the blind, the infirm and the widows and orphans.  On a number of occasions the Minister challenged the accuracy of my statement, and I repeatedly reasserted that the passing of that motion would not mean a cost of any more than £750,000.  The Minister himself agreed that it might be as low as £500,000.  Here is what the Minister said at column 822 of the Official Report on the 22nd October, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To carry out the terms of this motion would, so far as I can calculate&mdash;it is difficult to calculate it&mdash; involve a sum of between £500,000 and £750,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister also appeared to be under the impression, when he spoke without reference to files or notes, that it was not actually a motion brought in for the purpose of modifying the means test.  But later on on the same occasion he said in the same column of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However, what is being sought is a modification of the means test.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister further challenge me in view of the fact that I am now quoting from the official printed record what he actually said?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> I would ask the Deputies, especially the Deputies who were not here in October, 1947, to read the speech made by the Minister on the date to which I have referred, and compare it, so far as it is comparable, with the speech that he made when he introduced the Second Reading of this Bill.  If you read the speech that he made on the 22nd October, 1947, and relate it to the relevant portions of this particular Bill and the speech he made when introducing this Bill, there is much more convincing evidence required to prove that the Minister gave the correct story regarding his attitude to social security and his association with the preparation of the Bill which he now asks the House to adopt.</P>
    <P>In October, 1947, the Minister made no reference whatsoever to the legislation that he now alleges was then in the course of preparation.  He made no reference to the documents he had inspected and to the conferences he is supposed to have attended.  He made no reference in October, 1947, to those particular matters although he came along and stated on Second Reading that the preparation of this Bill was well advanced in October, 1947.  Why did he not take his own supporters and the members of the House as well into his confidence and tell them that what he actually did in October, 1947, so far as the preparation of this Bill was concerned up to that time, was to keep the whole business a complete secret, a fact which leaves me and other Deputies entitled to question the accuracy of what he said on the Second Reading of this Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister did, however, make some remarkable admissions.  He attacked Deputy Norton and asserted that what Deputy Norton said on a previous occasion was not correct.  On the Second Reading speech on the 22nd March at column 623 of the Official Report the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Outline of a Scheme of Social Insurance&rsquo;, produced before Deputy Norton became Minister for Social Welfare, had not received my approval.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does not that seem to contradict entirely what the Minister said in other portions of the same speech?  The <Col N="1649" /> matter was only in the preliminary stages and Deputy Norton, who succeeded the present Minister and held that office for three years and four months, said that out of 21 or 22 conferences which took place between the staff officers of his Department responsible for getting the preliminary information for the Minister, the present Minister was present only at one.</P>
    <P>However, it is not now a question of what the Minister had done up to the time he was obliged to hand over his office in February, 1948, but what the Minister has done since he came back to office on the 30th June last.  If the Minister's proposals, as indicated to this House, had been so far advanced before he went out of office in February, 1948, and if the Minister's scheme which he gave to the public on 3rd March, last year, was the scheme which was approved by the Fianna Fáil Party and by the ex-Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party, why has it taken him from the 13th June of last year until the 27th March of this year to bring in a Bill which he said was almost ready for introduction in February, 1948, and which required only a simple O.K. when he went back again to the same Department on 13th June last?  What is the explanation of the delay from the 13th June last to the 27th March of this year in bringing in this particular measure?</P>
    <P>I know it is not the same measure. It does not contain the same proposals as he even promised to the public in a statement which he issued on behalf of Fianna Fáil on the 3rd March last year.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to matters that are relevant to his Bill. I was christened by people in my own constituency and by other people outside it as one of the seven sinners that voted Fianna Fáil into office in 1932.  I want to assert&mdash;I challenge the Minister, if he will, to deny it&mdash; that, before we cast our votes on that particular occasion, we had talks with the Taoiseach and with two leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party who know the many matters upon which there was general agreement. One was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Government, particularly if we <Col N="1650" /> gave them our votes to put them into office on that occasion, that they would bring in a Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  There is no doubt whatsoever but that we got that undertaking from the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party in their offices in Merrion Street before they were put into office in 1932.</P>
    <P>We met them periodically during that period, as is well known, since it was publicised, and after seven or eight months we made inquiries as to what was being done in connection with the promised measure for widows and orphans.  We asked them at the end of nine months and at the end of 11 or 12 months, and the present Minister will not deny that they refused point blank to take any steps whatever during their first year in office to bring in a Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill.</P>

      <P>I publicly charge the Minister and his colleagues, because they voted against the Norton measure on the 2nd March, 1951, with being responsible for not having that scheme in operation from the 1st January this year.  I challenge the Minister to ask the head of his Department or any of the senior officials who were associated with the Social Security Bill, to deny that there were instructions given by his predecessor in the early part of last year to take all the necessary steps to have the Norton social security scheme brought into operation on the 1st January, 1952.  I assert that Deputy Norton had the authority of his colleagues in the Cabinet for giving that instruction.  It would be correct to say, in fairness to the officials, that they expressed the opinion that that was a tremendous job and that they might not be able to carry out his instructions in the matter.  Notwithstanding their opinion, Deputy Norton and all his colleagues in the Government, to my personal knowledge, had the courage at any rate to take their own policy decisions and tell the senior civil servants to carry them out.  They did not take instructions from their senior civil servants as the Minister for Finance has taken them in connection with his brutal Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am correct in charging the Minister with misleading the people who were intended to be covered by the Norton measure.  I will prove that he misled them by a document issued by the Minister himself after he left this House on the 2nd March of last year.  This document has been made use of by members who have spoken already.  It is a statement issued by the Fianna Fáil Party, and published on the 3rd March last year, in which the provisions of the Norton scheme were compared with the Fianna Fáil promises.  In the majority of cases it is exactly what was proposed in the Norton measure, which passed its Second Reading on the previous day.  They never made any reference then to the dropping of the death benefit or the retirement benefit, both of which were included in the Norton measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister on the 2nd March last year compared the cost of <Col N="1653" /> the proposals contained in the Norton Bill with the cost of the alternative scheme which he promised to put into operation if he came back to this Department as a member of the Government. Dealing with the question of cost, the Minister in this statement said the cost of the Norton scheme would be: &ldquo;£3,500,000 in increased contributions from employers and employees, plus £3,000,000 increasing to £4,000,000 after five years in taxation.&rdquo; What did he say his alternative proposals meant?  &ldquo;No increase in contributions, but an increase of £4,600,000 in taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The workers and those covered by the Norton scheme who were deceived by the propaganda machine that he had at his disposal at the time, and which infiltrated into every one of the trade union meetings in this country, now know where they stand.  The Minister is not passing the whole of the cost on to taxation.  He proposes to take £750,000 out of the pockets of the workers and the employers and, in addition to that, the poorer section of the workers, the old age pensioners, and everybody else will be taxed through the present Budget.  They will have to pay more for their tea, sugar, bread, butter, flour, all the essential commodities which are consumed by the poorer section of the people.</P>
    <P>What explanation has the Minister for coming in here with a Bill which so glaringly repudiates the public promises which he issued to the people on the 3rd March last year?  It takes a brazen man to do what the Minister is doing through the medium of this Bill. What does he do in addition to that by an Order made since this Bill was introduced?  When Deputy Norton was Minister there was an arrangement between the national health insurance section of the Department and the hospitals of this country to pay out of the Insurance Fund a sum of £2 12s. 6d. per week for every insured person who went into a hospital.  The hospitals put up a case&mdash;it must have been a convincing case&mdash;that that sum of £2 12s. 6d. was too low, as their losses on the administration of the hospitals were piling up from month to month and year to year.  Deputy <Col N="1654" /> Norton then increased the sum from £2 12s. 6d. to £4 4s., and the total amount of that came out of the surplus funds of the national health insurance section of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done by Order since this Bill was introduced?  He has done this: Under his Bill the amount to be paid from the national health insurance section to the hospitals of the country for maintenance is five guineas, but he is going to compel the unfortunate insured person, who is to-day in receipt of 22/6 per week, to pay an increase of £1 1s.  He has to pay a guinea out of his 22/6 per week for maintenance in the hospital and, if necessary, he will have to pay 10/- extra for an X-ray photograph.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion on this matter.  As I said here earlier to-day, I do not want to take up the time of the House. We are not taking up the attitude with regard to this measure or with regard to any other mild or good measure that we will not support it simply because it was brought forward by a Fianna Fáil-Cowan Administration. That has been our attitude since this corkscrew Government came into operation.  I feel I am right in thus describing it.  We said in our committee room when Fianna Fáil came into office that we would consider on its merits any sound and good measure which they brought forward. We were not going to adopt the tactics followed by Fianna Fáil when in opposition; they obstructed every measure&mdash;the Land Bill, 1950, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, and the Norton Social Security Bill, 1951.  We are considering this measure also on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> Will the Minister who appears to be so touchy on the question of the death benefits, tell the 700,000 or 800,000 who are going to be covered by this measure what the reason is for dropping the death benefits?  He did not propose to drop them according to his statement on the 3rd March last year. I do not propose to make any personal attack on the present Minister or on any Minister but I am sure the Minister will not object to my saying that he did not want to go back to his Cabinet and that he proposes, when he has got this Bill through the House, to go back to his insurance job.  I am saying this because I want the Minister, if he is only going to remain here until this Bill comes into operation, to honour the promises that he made in connection with social security just a year ago.  He did not say it in any positive way but he made a sort of a conditional promise.  He said at one portion of his speech in connection with death and retirement benefits, at column 638, Volume 130 of the Official Reports of the 27th March, 1952:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If at any time I am satisfied that workers generally want such a scheme, I should be prepared to produce it and, if they so desire, a scheme of death benefits as well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister be frank with the House?  He is very frank in his criticism of the members of this Party and in his criticism of our whole Party's attitude on everything with which he does not agree.  That is his conditional promise.  That is not the kind of thing the Minister should hold up in front of the people who want a definite decision and who want to know where they are.  Will the Minister say definitely, one way or the other, whether it is his intention to bring back into this scheme the death and retirement benefits which he promised on the 3rd March last year in an advertisement at the expense of the Fianna Fáil Party organisation?  I appeal to him to be frank, especially if he does not intend to remain in the Government after this Bill has gone through the House.</P>
    <P>In any case, I would appeal to the Minister in the most sincere way, if <Col N="1656" /> he is going to take credit in the future for this measure, both as an individual Minister and as one of the strongest planks of the Fianna Fáil Party in this country over a long period, to realise that it is well worth doing the job well rather than putting a patchwork scheme through the House and changing his mind later on, or having his mind changed for him by somebody else in his Party and having to bring these benefits back in the manner in which they were provided in the Norton Bill last year. In any case, let him be frank with the House.  Will he take the opinion of the trade union movement in this country?  Let him forget about the Labour Party, with which he disagrees so much.  Will he take the opinion of the Congress of Irish Unions and of the Irish Trade Union Congress?  Will he take the opinion of the bigger unions of this country on this matter, or is he going to leave it to the decision of the Fianna Fáil cumainn all over the country whether or not to introduce death and retirement benefits?</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister to be frank with regard to this matter, because it has been brought to his attention by many other Deputies who have spoken earlier on this measure I am a member of a superannuation fund.  Before I retired from the railway service, I was a member of what I am informed was the biggest superannuation scheme of clerical workers in the world.  I had to pay, from the day I was a junior clerk, a percentage of my salary towards a retirement allowance and also towards the provision of widows' and orphans' pensions.  I was a member of an advisory committee, though, probably, not a very useful one, in that particular body.  Through my own trade union organisation, I know a little about figures concerning the administration of a contributory superannuation or pension scheme. Will not the Minister admit, from his own experience and also from the knowledge which, I feel sure, he can get from his advisers, that the insurance companies, whether they be British or Irish, derive the major portion of their profits from lapsed <Col N="1657" /> policies?  Foolish and stupid people allow their policies to lapse after paying into an insurance company for a long period.  However, most of them allow them to lapse as the result of circumstances beyond their control, for instance, the fact that they are thrown on the scrap-heap of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact, therefore, that the insurance companies are strongly opposed to the provision of death benefits? Is there a letter in the file&mdash;the big file which the Minister held up here the other day from the insurance companies&mdash;protesting against the inclusion of death benefits as proposed in the Norton scheme?  Deputy Norton had to interview a deputation from the insurance companies protesting against the inclusion of death benefits but he was determined to go ahead with the idea.  A good deal of the cost of the propaganda provided in the newspapers of this country was found by the insurance companies&mdash;by the big insurance companies.  However, I am not attributing the criticism of the death benefits to one insurance company.  All of them had the same outlook, and out of the pool of their huge profits, they provided money for the propaganda carried on against the Norton Bill which was framed to include a provision for death benefit. Who has persuaded the Minister to drop this benefit, seeing that he did not say last year that he was going to drop it?</P>
    <P>I would like to put another question to the Minister in regard to the death benefit.  What additional amount would be paid by the worker and the employer if death benefit was included in the scheme now before the House? Although I do not know what figures the Minister has to support him in this matter, I guess that in connection with the new benefits to be paid for under the Norton scheme or under the Ryan scheme&mdash;if the Minister does not mind me calling it the Ryan scheme&mdash; death benefit would have the highest percentage contribution of all.  Will the Minister deny that?  If you provided retirement pension and death allowances the contribution from the point of view of the contributor would <Col N="1658" /> be much greater than it would be for retirement benefit, for marriage gratuity, for increased national health allowance or for any other new benefit or any old benefit increased.</P>

      <P>I am asking for the information not for the purposes of criticising the Minister here or elsewhere. We are entitled to that information. This is a serious measure which will cost an additional £750,000 to the workers and to the employers, and legislation is being introduced for increased taxation on the necessaries of life.  This Bill linked up with the Budget is not understood by the people of the country.  Of course, the Budget is the most brutal Budget in my 30 years of public life.  I can only conclude it was framed by some mad Minister or some mad adviser of the Minister.</P>

I asked for it not for the purpose of making political capital.  We want to consider the measure on its merits, and if we are to consider it thus, I say to the Minister <Col N="1659" /> that we are entitled to all the information which within reason we are asking for.  I hope he will drop the provocative and bad-tempered type of speech he made when he was introducing this Bill, that he will forget, for the time being at any rate, that Deputy Norton, his predecessor, was responsible for bringing in a better measure; and seeing that Deputy Norton is not in the House, if he is going to reply now, I hope he will forget, because he should never have said, some of the things he said when introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister is from my own constituency, and since this Social Welfare Bill has come before the public the people in his own constituency have asked me to appeal to the Minister on their behalf.  The people who were expecting to benefit by the Norton Bill on retirement must now resign themselves to continue working in industries at hard, manual labour.  It is regrettable that the Minister has cut out some of the good things that were in that Bill.  As has been said here to-day, the death benefit was very necessary.  Throughout the whole country in the days gone by poor people had to be buried by what is known as the &ldquo;shake of the hat&rdquo;. They were not able to pay anything to the insurance companies.  When I look out from my own door every day of the week I see an insurance agent and his inspector going into poor people's houses to collect sums from 1d. up to 3/- a week which are to provide something to put them under the clay.  It is unfortunate that the Minister should have omitted the death benefit from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad thing also that in his own constituency to-night there are over 1,200 people on home assistance with no provision for them under this Bill.  If they are unable to work or if they are invalids they must exist on home assistance at the miserable rate of 5/- or 6/- or 10/- in very odd cases.  What relief will this Bill afford to those people if it is passed?  What relief is it to the man who is an invalid who may be drawing a paltry 15/- a week, or what avail is it to have inspectors and <Col N="1660" /> doctors going around holding courts of referees in hotels that are costing more money than would provide an increase for these people?  Is it not time that this situation was remedied?  The Minister knows as well as I do that he was mistaken in cutting out the death benefits and in compelling the worker to continue working after 65.  There is many an Irishman to-day, who went over to Britain for a few years and came back to his own country at 65 years of age and is drawing a pension and an allowance for his wife from the British Government, while our own Irishman at home in industrial employment is compelled to carry on because he cannot get a pension at 65.  I would like to ask the Minister how many men on his farm in Delgany or in any of his property around are 70 years of age? How many agents has he in the insurance company carrying on at 70 years of age?  I am sure there are none.  Yet he tells us that the workers must continue and that he will not give them a pension at 65.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in opposition he said that there was a Social Welfare Bill in the Custom House, which, if he had remained in office, he would have brought into operation. He has taken Deputy Norton's Bill and adopted its most important points, and this is what he now intends to implement.  When he was in opposition he said: &ldquo;I have a Social Welfare Bill; if you give us a majority, we will put it into operation.&rdquo;  That is a trick that has often been played by the present Government.  They are now back in power with the support of four Deputies, two of them denounced by the Bishops of Ireland&mdash;Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan&mdash;and Deputy Cogan, who has been put out of the Farmers' Party and who has been denounced throughout his constituency of County Wicklow.  At column 1819, Volume 112, 29th July, 1948, Deputy Cogan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  Many Deputies have said that it does not go far enough, but, at any rate, it goes a long distance to meet the claims of the weaker sections of the community.  Deputy MacEntee attacked this Bill so <Col N="1661" /> vigorously that I am rather expecting that he will marshal his entire Party into the Division Lobby to vote against it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know the intentions, but it seems plain that this Bill is a retrograde step.  I do not think any Deputy would agree with him on that point so far as social services are concerned. A great man said the truth is to be found at the bottom of the well, but when Deputy MacEntee puts on his diving-suit he hardly ever succeeds in bringing up the truth.  He brings up a lot of other things that do not, as a rule, look well, sound well or smell well.  I wonder if the names of Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne, aye, and Deputy John Flynn, smell well to-night in their constituencies after the Budget statement which the Minister for Finance made last week?  These are the men who are keeping the present Government in power.</P>
    <P>What provision is there in this Bill with regard to disability pensioners&mdash; the special allowance people?  What help will be given to them?  It is all very well to say that there has been an increase in the number of registered unemployed.  As a worker, I prefer to see work provided for our people.  The workers want work.  It is only the men who cannot get work who want social services.  I happened to go into a shop not far from this House for a paper to-day.  There were two old ladies behind the counter.  A big shot came in.  They said: &ldquo;We do not want social services&rdquo;; and he said: &ldquo;I am with you in that statement.&rdquo;  I followed him out of the shop and he got into a big Chrysler car.  The people in the shop were well protected because they had their trade.  They did not, therefore, want social services.  However, there are thousands of unfortunate people in the country to-day who are waiting for some help from this House.  They are honest, genuine cases and, God knows, they need help and the sooner they get it the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his Budget speech last week that he was giving an extra 1/6 to the old age pensioners.  Does the Minister consider <Col N="1662" /> that that is a fair relief to the old age pensioner in view of the increased prices for food which will come into force in July next?  What can the people of this country expect from a Government that is hanging on to power?</P>
    <P>Listen to what the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, said at a Fianna Fáil meeting in his constituency in Cavan: &ldquo;Mr. Smith, T.D., who presided, said that nothing was so distasteful as to see members of the Government shivering in fear and afraid to meet the electorate.&rdquo;  Is that not the case to-day with the Fianna Fáil Government?  Are they not shivering after last week's Budget?</P>

How ever, they got in by trickery and this Social Welfare Bill is merely window dressing.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Social Welfare, had the cheek to tell his followers at a Fianna Fáil meeting at Wexford that he left a better Social Welfare Bill behind him than the Norton Bill.  We now have evidence that his Bill is not nearly as good as Deputy Norton's Bill.</P>

Did you not reduce the maternity benefit from £5 to £2?  What good is £2 when a midwife charges three guineas? I always welcome any Bill that will help the down-trodden people of this country.  They have no protection and they have to submit to a means test before they get anything.</P>
      <P>I want to quote, now, from a letter which I received from a man in Foulksmills. It is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My age is 66 years and two months.  I spent one month in the Enniscorthy Hospital by reason of my back... I do not see, Sir, why I and all my class, invalids, should be expected to exist on a lower weekly pension than the old aged. I can hear the people in general commenting earnestly upon it and I am advised to appeal to you about the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The writer of that letter also said that he had notified the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, and appealed to him not to let people such as him down in their disgraceful plight.  He further stated that for the past eight years he has been in receipt of 15/- national health. What hope has that person of getting anything out of this Social Welfare Bill?  None.  Then the Fianna Fáil Party are blowing that it is a great Bill.  They hinted that the Labour Party were going to oppose it.  Since I came into this House in 1943, the Labour Party has never opposed anything that was for the good of the people&mdash;and they never will.  The propaganda used against us in the last general election was shocking.  We were told that we sold ourselves to Fine Gael.  The last Government promised the people a ten-point programme and before the inter-Party Government left office that programme was almost fulfilled.  An increase of 5/- was given to the old age pensioners who were made paupers by the Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, and who had to exist on 12/6 a week and 2/6 home assistance.  We did away with that <Col N="1664" /> pauperism.  We gave them a pension book and the pension could be drawn at the post office.  We had the Old I.R.A. men's pensions reviewed&mdash; which is something that Fianna Fáil turned down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to clarify some points in the Bill.  He stated that in future disablement benefit and compensation will come in under this measure.  At the present moment an adult under the Workmen's Compensation Act is entitled to 50/- a week, while under this measure he would be entitled to only 24/- a week. I am sure it is not the Minister's intention to worsen the position of these people but perhaps he will clarify the matter when he is replying.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan pointed out&mdash;and here I want to dissociate myself completely, as senior representative of County Wicklow, from Deputy Cogan's remarks&mdash;that this clause would be of great advantage to farmers who employ men, because by paying their contribution they would have compensation cover for their men in the event of an accident.  Has the Minister considered the position that exists during harvest time when casual workers are taken on?  These workers would not be insured because they would not have sufficient stamps.  What, then, will be the position with regard to them?  Will they be covered by this Act or will the farmers have to insure them?</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that if he received sufficient evidence he might amend the Bill on the Committee Stage in relation to death benefits.  I am sure the local authorities will be able to supply the Minister with all the evidence he desires in that connection. The local authorities have to come to the assistance of numbers of poor people by making a contribution towards burials.  I am sure the Minister will be able to find out from the local authorities the amount paid out each year in death benefits in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
      <P>In 1947 I made an appeal for some measure of social security for our people.  I mentioned at that time that I recognised we could not have a scheme similar to the Beveridge scheme in England because we are an agricultural country.  At the same time I thought we could do somewhat better.  The Minister opposed our plan last year and I was led to believe that he could produce something much more far-reaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> Recently I had a case which I think deserves the Minister's consideration. A worker in my own constituency went to England for six months and worked there as a builder's labourer.  He fell from a scaffolding one day and was killed.  He left a wife and six children. When we looked for compensation for the widow and children we were told it was an accident, that we could not prove the employer was negligent and that, therefore, we were not entitled to any compensation.  Because the husband had not been quite six months in England the widow was not entitled to any pension for herself or the children.  Her case is now before the Minister's Department in an effort to secure a contributory pension for her.  Trouble like that is bound to arise unless we come to some definite arrangement with the British.  In Ireland of course the widow would be entitled to full compensation.  If something is not done in this particular case this unfortunate woman will be dependent on charity in the form of home assistance or through the St. Vincent de Paul.  I can give the Minister all the particulars he wants, including a copy of the solicitor's letter stating she could not receive any compensation or qualify for the widows' and orphans' pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not included domestic servants in this Bill.  I do not think that is right.  A number of these people are now in receipt of home assistance and other assistance having reached 60 years of age and being unable to work.  Even though the number may be small I think these people should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  They will not then be compelled to seek charity and they will have some security.  I have been connected with public bodies all my life and I know that numbers of these people are anxious that they should be covered by some pension scheme which would enable them to pay their rent so that they would not be forced to go into the county home at the end of their days.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the points I have raised between this and the Committee Stage.  I am sure that any improvement will be welcomed. I would like to take this opportunity <Col N="1667" /> of pointing out to Deputy Cogan that he is not in touch with people. Neither is he a member of any public board in County Wicklow.  If he were and if he had the knowledge I possess he would make a similar appeal to the Minister in connection with the improvement of various clauses of the Bill.  I make it not from any political point of view but as one who has been interested in social security from 1947 onwards.  I should like to see the Bill improved so as to obviate the infliction of hardship on a large number of people, and the imposition of a big burden on the ratepayers.  It would be well if the Minister would amend the Bill so as to remove some of the snags which I have pointed out and to bring a greater sense of security to the people affected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a rural constituency, where the number of contributory workers is very small in comparison to the number who might be termed non-contributory workers, I am very disappointed that this Bill provides no concession for the small farmer who works as hard as any industrial worker in Dublin or elsewhere. The weekly income of these small farmers in many instances is much smaller than that of the industrial worker in the cities or any provincial town.  It is very discouraging, when we hear so much about social security and about the need for a comprehensive scheme to relieve the working man of the many handicaps which he has to encounter in life, to find that the small working farmer is left out in the cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I protest against the Bill for that reason, much more so than from any desire to argue as to whether the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton, when he was Minister, or the Bill introduced by the present Minister is the better measure.  Neither of these two Bills makes provision for the small working farmer.  I was as much disappointed on the occasion when the former Bill was introduced a year ago as I am on this occasion, that the small working farmer was left out, but there is the difference that there existed some hope under Deputy Norton's scheme that, in time to come, some <Col N="1668" /> ways or means would be provided under which the small farmer could be included.</P>
    <P>I cannot see in this Bill any ways or means whereby the small farmer can be considered, for the simple reason that the moneys necessary for the implementation of this scheme come mostly from the taxpayer.  That being so, we cannot envisage this scheme being able to pay its way apart from the taxpayers' contributions.  If the Norton scheme were implemented, when one considers the contributions which it sought from the worker as against the contributions which the present Minister is seeking, one could envisage the time when that scheme would eventually pay its way, with, perhaps, something over, and, in due course, the sum which Deputy Norton's scheme would require from the taxpayer would be reduced to an insignificant amount.  One had the hope that, eventually, the Government would not have to appeal to the taxpayer for any aid for the financing of that scheme, and the moneys which would be required in the early stages of its implementation could then be utilised to bring the benefits of the social welfare scheme to the hard-working small farmer and non-contributory workers.  Unless the present Bill is amended, we can see no hope of providing any concession for the small working farmer.  I wish again to stress the point that the small farmer in my constituency and in similar constituencies works as hard for much longer hours, and at much heavier toil, than any man engaged in the heaviest industry that exists in this or any other city, yet the Government deliberately left him out in the cold.  As if that were not bad enough, they are being taxed to make a contribution towards the financing of this scheme.  That, I think, is utterly unfair, seeing that there is no hope that, in future, they will get any consideration under it.</P>
    <P>When we consider that when the other Bill was introduced by Deputy Norton a year ago, it was opposed violently by the then Opposition, now the Government responsible for the introduction of this measure, on the ground that it was not sufficiently comprehensive, <Col N="1669" /> that every class and creed did not come under it, and because it was not sufficiently generous, are we not entitled to ask the Minister to-night why he has not included in the scheme now before the House the many benefits which he urged Deputy Norton's scheme should have contained 12 months ago?  We are entitled to ask him why this Bill is not in keeping with the promises he made to the electorate during the election campaign.  Why did he not take the Bill which Deputy Norton had prepared and add to it all those features which he thought it should have contained when he was opposing it from this side of the House?  All that was needed was the re-introduction of the Bill prepared prior to the dissolution.  If Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, was serious when he attacked the Bill, if he was serious when he walked up the aisle and into the Division Lobby to oppose it, he would have taken Deputy Norton's Bill, re-introduced it and added those extras which he advocated when he was speaking from this side of the House.  Knowing the circumstances, we are entitled to come to the conclusion that he was not serious, that he was merely playing politics both in this House and in the election campaign throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>What has he done for the non-contributory old age pensioner down the country?  What has he done for the non-contributory widow and the other classes of non-contributing persons excluded from this scheme?  Nothing whatsoever in comparison to what he is expecting to extract from them in the form of taxation.  I feel as a representative of hard-working small farmers that it is unjust and unfair, when one takes into account the suggestions put forward by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was speaking on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>What explanation has the Minister to offer for taking Deputy Norton's scheme and putting it through the meat mincer, for pulverising it and reducing it to what it is at the moment, or for the elimination of death benefits and retirement benefits for domestic employees in hotels, boarding houses, etc?  Are they not entitled <Col N="1670" /> to consideration?  So far, we have got no explanation.  We have certain grounds to work on, whether these are genuine or otherwise.  Suggestions have come from this side of the House as to why these benefits in the Norton Scheme were omitted.  We hope the Minister will give some explanation to-night.  We believe in advance, however, that no explanation will be forthcoming, and that he will merely try to cover up things for the time being.  That, in our opinion, is just a mere bribe in regard to those sections of the people which are going to benefit.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a man who falls sick or becomes unemployed.  He will receive certain benefits, in some cases better benefits than under the Norton scheme, but there is this difference. Under the Norton scheme, when out of work or sick he no longer was asked to contribute.  Under this Bill, a demand will be made on the taxpayer to meet the increased sum required to finance this scheme, due to a reduction in the contributions which Deputy Norton had in his scheme. That means that the man when sick or unemployed will indirectly be contributing to the benefits he is in receipt of.</P>
    <P>We consider that most unfair.  The ordinary worker recognises the significance of that.  No amount of propaganda by the Minister, or his colleagues, is going to convince the ordinary insured worker that, under this scheme as against the one presented by Deputy Norton, he is going to enjoy better consideration.  He is not, because the Norton scheme was designed primarily to provide benefits for him when out of work or sick. Under this scheme he will have to contribute his share towards the benefits he is to receive, because a big proportion of the necessary finance is in the form of indirect taxation.  That is unfair, especially when you consider that the whole community is not going to enjoy benefits under this Bill.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dr. Ryan was on this side of the House he asked questions time and time again over a period of three years, and brought pressure to bear on the then Government and the <Col N="1671" /> then Minister for Social Welfare as to the necessity for speeding up the introduction of a comprehensive security scheme.  The then Minister was told time and time again that there was a Bill prepared in his Department and all that was needed was to introduce it.  In fact, on the occasion that Deputy Norton introduced his Bill, he was told that there was an even better Bill than it in the Department of Social Welfare. If that were so, may I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to-night why it took him almost a year to prepare this new Bill?  Why did he not take the old Bill that he said was prepared in 1947, a better Bill, as he said, and introduce it at once?</P>
    <P>The reason is that no such Bill existed, no matter what he or his colleagues may say.  That is so, that there was no such Bill when Deputy Norton took over the Department in 1948.  We know that to be the truth, and we do not accept one word that was uttered by Deputy Dr. Ryan from this side of the House or since he again took over the Department of Social Welfare.  We know, of course, that Deputy Norton's word as against the word of the present Minister for Social Welfare may not convey the same strength of argument, but what we do know is that the Minister, when moving the Second Reading of this Bill, made very little reference to his prepared Social Welfare Scheme.  He did not charge Deputy Norton with failure to introduce it.  But we have had allegations made that the scheme was prepared and was in existence.</P>
    <P>We now want the Minister to admit the truth and to confess publicly in this House that there was no such thing as a scheme prepared when Deputy Norton took over the Department. Honesty of purpose is a good thing, and particularly in this matter. It is no use for the Minister or his colleagues to try and lead the public astray by misrepresenting Deputy Norton.  If anybody is to be congratulated on the fact that we have a Bill of this type before us now, it is Deputy Norton and his Party and the inter-Party Government, who brought pressure to bear on this Government, <Col N="1672" /> which was in office from 1932 to 1948, to introduce a comprehensive code of social welfare with a codification of the various Acts passed over the years.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to the two Fianna Fáil Deputies for South Mayo, my two colleagues, Deputy Moran and Deputy Seán Flanagan, talk about what they did during their term of office from 1932 to 1948.  If I were to try and rival them by going back over all that happened during the past 30 years, both inside and outside this House, there would have to be an awful lot of dirty linen washed, and it would not all be on one side of the House.  I do not intend to do that or to bring this debate down to the level they did.  I have more interest in social security than that.  They talked about the restoration of the shilling that was taken off the old age pensioners by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  It was said time and time again, not only across the floor of this House, but from many a platform, that the reduction of the shilling a week was an indication of the mentality, outlook and desire of the Cuman na nGaedheal Government as far as social security and an interest in the ordinary poor people were concerned.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies forget that if we were to debate that subject fully they would find that they should be the last to bring that up.  It could be shown that the situation was much more difficult for the Government in office from 1922 to 1932 than it was for the Fianna Fáil Government from 1932 to 1948.  If the Opposition from 1922 to 1932 was as law abiding and as helpful as the Opposition from 1932 to 1948, perhaps greater progress could have been made in the field of social security and social welfare.  I do not wish to go along the road that was travelled by Deputy Moran and Deputy Seán Flanagan in the course of their speeches.  I would like them to understand that the progress made by their Party when the Government for almost 16 years was insignificant and anything that was done in the latter years of their term of office was due to the pressure brought to bear from within and without this House.  I am quite certain but for that pressure we would see very <Col N="1673" /> little social welfare.  As an indication of that, Sir, we find that on the 22nd October, 1947, when I was a member of the House, there was a motion tabled in the names of Deputies Costello and O'Higgins requesting a miserable increase of 2/6 a week with a very moderate amendment of the means test in relation to the old age pensioners and the widows.  We find that the then Government in office opposed that motion violently because it was going to cost an extra £500,000. Am I not, therefore, entitled to suggest that that was the outlook and mentality of the Government and an indication of how far that Government was prepared to travel in the field of social welfare if they were left in office and if they got their way?  But for the pressure brought to bear by the opposition of all Parties we would have had very little development in that particular field.  If the 1/- was restored it was not because they could not go back on their promises but because they made a mountain out of a molehill in the elections of 1932 and 1937.</P>
    <P>I want to be clear&mdash;very clear&mdash;that my reason for supporting the Labour Party amendment is because I do not look upon the present Bill as comprehensive enough.  I admit it is a step in the right direction but it falls far short of the Bill we expected when Deputy Dr. Ryan took over the Department of Social Welfare.  It falls far short of what we were led to believe would be forthcoming, but something more important still, it falls far short of what we and the people outside were led to believe existed when the present Minister held office in 1947.  It is because of that and that alone that I am prepared to walk into the Lobby if a division is called and support the Labour amendment.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why a man who claims to be responsible and who holds a responsible position can take things so easily and go back on his word and refuse point blank to give an explanation. I cannot understand how Deputy Dr. Browne and his colleagues can walk into the Lobby in support of a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>In fact, it was very interesting to listen to Deputy Dr. Browne give his <Col N="1674" /> views of social welfare.  I do not know whether that view represents the majority of the Fianna Fáil Party or not but let us hope it does not. Having listened carefully to Deputy Dr. Browne express himself for three-quarters of an hour in a detailed prepared speech I cannot for the life of me understand how he can justify his conduct in walking into the Lobby and supporting this Bill, which has been, as I have said, put through a mincemeater, chopped up and all the important provisions taken away.  I should not like&mdash;and I want to be quite candid about it&mdash;to be in Deputy Dr. Browne's position when going before the electorate in two, three or four years' time from now.  If he thinks the people of Dublin have a short memory he is making a big mistake.  I would not like to stand here and say one thing and in an hour's time or so go into the Lobby and vote against what I said.  I like to be as consistent as possible.  But there is neither reason nor consistency attached to his speech.  I assume that he will trail in to the Lobby behind the majority of the Government Deputies if there is a division.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Minister, I should like to put this to Deputy Kennedy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, that he should ask the Minister for Social Welfare, in the course of his reply, to indicate to the House, first, why is it that the Minister did not introduce the comprehensive scheme that he had prepared in 1947 and left behind in his Department?  I take it that Deputy Norton did not destroy it.  It must be still there, pigeon-holed somewhere.  I am sure some group of officials would have discovered it for him if he had asked.  Why was not that introduced eight months ago?  They could have introduced it the second week after they took over office.  We had to wait until now for this sample of social security to come before the House.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to request the Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, to explain to the House on what grounds has he excluded the domestic servants and on what grounds he did away with death <Col N="1675" /> benefits?  I do not want to be personal. I do not want to make any attack upon any insurance company, but where there is smoke there is fire, and we are at least entitled to base our reasons on certain assumptions.  I am not going to start assuming.  I will wait for the Minister's explanation as to the reason he excluded the death benefits.  The Dublin Deputies have elaborated on that aspect very fully and I am not going to traverse the same ground as to the need for death benefits in Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, the same need for death benefits applies in many rural areas where it is a nightmare when a boy, a girl or a father or mother is taken away and it becomes necessary to find the money for a decent, respectable burial, which is the wish of every Irishman and woman as it is the wish of the children to bury their parents when the time comes.  As I have said, it is a nightmare to find the necessary means in rural areas where the cost of defraying many burials goes on for many years.  They have to go in to the local businessman or undertaker in order to get sufficient money to defray the cost.</P>
    <P>Death benefits to-day would be a boon, and the fact that they are cut out of this Bill is nothing, more or less, than a deliberate act, dictated by some outside influence.  I do not believe it is the Minister's desire.  I do not believe it is his Party's desire, but I do believe that pressure of a nature was brought to bear on the Minister which forced him to cut out that section.  I should like to know why the Minister has cut out the provision relating to a retirement pension at the age of 65.  The Minister knows full well that there are many people who would wish to retire at 65.  There are many people who are anxious to retire at 65.  The Minister has now come into the House, and the Parliamentary Secretary can tell him that many Deputies have asked these same questions.  That is something that we must keep on repeating if we feel there is going to be any success, because every effort is being made to misconstrue the Norton scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> Deputy Cogan said that the inter-Party Government and the Labour Party, in particular, never had any intention of implementing that Bill. They said it was a political trick, introduced on the eve of the election with a view to deceiving the electorate. We all know that that is not true.  I do not think there is a Fianna Fáil Deputy who believes that.  If it were a political trick, if there was no sincerity in the introduction of that Bill by the inter-Party Government, why was there organised opposition to it?  Why did the then Opposition go into the Lobby to try to defeat it? The then Opposition were then as determined in holding up the implementation of that scheme as they were in holding up the Local Authorities (Works) Bill.  They voted eight times against that Bill, and every county council which had a Fianna Fáil majority, opposed it, and held it up for a considerable time.</P>

      <P>There is no connection, but I want to point out that the tactics of the then Opposition were very consistent not only with regard to the Social Welfare Bill but any Bill designed to bring benefit to the masses of the community.  The reason why their tactics were consistent was, not that they did not want to see the community benefiting from social legislation of one kind or another, but because they wanted to prevent at all costs the then Government from having any claim to the development of social legislation or the bringing in of any Act to remove the evils which existed when they assumed office in 1948.  They were determined at all cost, irrespective of the damage and the injury they would do and of the unemployment and emigration which they would create, to oppose it with a view to preventing the then Government from deriving any benefit from removing the evils left by a Government which held office for 16 years.  The people are not so simpleminded or so foolish that they can be &ldquo;kidded&rdquo; by the conduct of the Government to-day.  Their memory is not so short as not to remember the <Col N="1677" /> speeches of the members of the Government when they were in opposition bemoaning the failure of the inter-Party Government to do this and that. When they took office, instead of implementing the schemes of the inter-Party Government, they introduced them under the same heading but with much curtailed benefits.</P>

There is no comparison between these two Bills.  It is quite clear that the inter-Party social security scheme was one of the best pieces of legislation introduced since the establishment of this State.</P>
      <P>From mere political jealousy and spite, the Minister could not see his way to reintroduce that scheme because it might be said: &ldquo;You are introducing the Norton scheme which was prepared for you.&rdquo;  He is now introducing a scheme under the heading of social security which does not deserve that title and, if he was honest, he would not give it that title.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to a fair amount of this debate last week and to-day.  It ranged over a very wide field.  Some Deputies, notably Government Deputies, spent a good deal of time talking about the civil war as usual, as if it had any connection with this Bill.  Other Deputies showed evidence of going back to Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet if they got a chance.  This Bill is a snare and a delusion.  It was obvious from its introduction that an effort was being made by the Government to rush it through the House at all costs, and get it out of the way before the Budget was thrust on the people.  However, let it be said to the credit of the members of the Opposition, whose ideals are dedicated to democratic principles, that they were concerned with discussing this Bill in all its aspects, and were not going to be made a party to any steam-rolling of legislation for purely party purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the onslaught upon what has come to be known as the Norton Bill, a Bill which was denigrated and abused by the present Minister and those who sit behind him when it was being discussed on the Second Reading last year.  As has been pointed out, we had practically every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party on his feet, saying how little was being done by William Norton on that occasion, how inadequate were the provisions of that Bill and what would be done by Fianna Fáil if they got a chance.  How many Deputies of Fianna Fáil have spoken on this Bill?  Not half a dozen; I think about four&mdash;obviously acting <Col N="1679" /> under Party orders as part of the plan to hurry the Bill through, before the bombshell Budget burst on the people.</P>
    <P>The present Minister made it one of his chief arguments, when introducing this Bill, that he was only going to ask the workers of this country, that is, the industrial workers, to pay an increased contribution of 5d. per week, as opposed to an increased contribution of 1/7 which was required under the Norton plan, and mind you, at the time, it looked a very plausible kind of argument, that is for those who allowed themselves to be misled by it. The Minister knew, of course, that in order to have this Bill put into operation under the Fianna Fáil policy the workers, nominally, were going to pay an additional 5d. per week, but in reality there was in the background this instrument of oppression that was revealed to us last week, the Budget which was going to make the workers pay, not 1/7 but 10/-, 15/- or £1 per week per family more for this feeble document that we have described as a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Those of us who listened to some, at least, of the Minister's Second Reading speech, were not impressed by the manner in which he approached this whole subject.  It was obvious that he was more concerned with trying to make capital for his Party than with the problem of providing adequate social legislation for the people of this country.  It is also obvious that the Minister was not the author of the introductory speech or at least of his Second Reading speech.  I have no illusions as to where that speech came from.  I have no illusions as to why the Norton provision to provide retirement allowances for workers at 65 was dropped from the Bill.  I can place my finger upon the very individual responsible for that, because it is in line with his past history in relation to other services of public bodies, in relation to the treatment of workers in the Dublin County Council who were thrown out on the roads after 40 years' service.</P>

      <P>It is a callous thing in my view, to require industrial workers to continue in employment until they are 70 years of age.  I think it was Deputy MacBride who referred to the fact that we in this country do not require civil servants to work after they are 65 and do not require certain other public servants to work even until they are 65, but pension them before that.  I would like to ask any Deputy here to consider the case of the ordinary worker who is not a civil servant, not even we will say, a white collar worker of any kind&mdash;and we know that many classes of white collar workers require retirement pensions at as early an age as any other category of worker&mdash;but a manual worker, a farm labourer, a road worker or a builder's labourer in the City of Dublin.  How many building trade employers will hold out their hands in welcome to a man offering himself to work for them on a building job after he is 65 years of age?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Or after he is 60.  Anybody who has any conception of hard manual work on a building job should know that once a man passes the halfway house, the midde-age mark, he will find it harder and harder to get employment, until eventually he will get employment no more.  Then he becomes a burden, if you like, on his family and a prey to his own thoughts. Very often he goes down in old age feeling unwanted, uncared for and unprovided for: he is a symbol of the tragedy of the carelessness that the State can show towards the people who built it up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, now the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, said that people should be encouraged to work until they are 70. They should be encouraged to work, but he does not suggest starting with civil servants whom he likes so much, some of whom he is prepared to reemploy and to whom he is prepared to pay a higher salary than he receives himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, it is very <Col N="1681" /> apposite to this Bill, but I bow to your ruling.  The vast mass of the people of the country have been urged every day by representatives of industry and politics to work harder and produce more, as if they were not working hard enough.  As if the ordinary people of this country were not working hard enough, now they are being told they are going to eat less, because it will not be possible to pay the people because of the impositions of the Budget. The mass of the working people must be encouraged, if you do not mind, to work until they are 70 and the encouragement will take the shape of their being compelled to work until they are 70 or else go to the poorhouse or depend upon the charity of their relatives.  Of course, if the mass of the ordinary people were to follow the objurgations of the &ldquo;Minister of Charm&rdquo;, as he has been described by the English <i>Sunday Express</i>, they should save 10 per cent. of their wages for their old age&mdash;10 per cent. of the wages which will not be sufficient to enable them to live owing to the increased cost of living now imposed on us as a result of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a provision in the social welfare plan devised by Deputy Norton to enable workers to retire at 65 with a pension of 24/- a week and an allowance of 12/- a week for a wife. This was a provision which could be availed of voluntarily by the workers concerned.  It is being completely cut out of the Bill now presented to us by the progressive Fianna Fáil Party. We heard that they were supposed to have done a great deal for the advancement of social legislation. However, all of us who have studied the facts and who have any experience of what has gone on in this country over the last 15 or 16 years know the truth.  As Deputy Larkin very truly said, the only time Fianna Fáil moved along the road of social progress was when they got pushed along the road and had no other alternative.  I feel that the exclusion of the provision enabling workers to retire at 65 is the greatest deficiency in this Bill.  It springs, as I say, from the minds of people who have absolutely no conception of the lives of working people or of their problems.  What is more, <Col N="1682" /> this ideal springs from the minds of those who seem to enjoy the lowly conditions into which people have fallen.</P>
    <P>Domestic servants are excluded from the Bill on the pretext that: &ldquo;Well, sure it is very difficult to get a domestic servant these days.&rdquo;  However, I have met domestic servants who could not find employment. Anybody who wants to examine that question will find that there are domestic servants who would benefit greatly by the provisions which were in the Norton Bill for their protection. Even if there were only one domestic servant in Ireland who might benefit by the provision in the Norton Bill, it should have been allowed to stand. However, it has been thrown out of this Bill, as have the retirement allowances.  Domestic servants are part of the great mass of people upon whom Fianna Fáil has trampled to power on many occasions.  They are an awakening section of the people.</P>
    <P>How many people realise what happens in a working-class family when a death occurs in the house?  Deputy Cafferky has referred to the matter. It follows a pattern which not alone occurs in the rural villages or the small towns throughout the country but everywhere throughout the State. A death in a family is invariably a shocking and a stunning blow to those concerned and unless they are well-to-do it means a tremendous degree of expense.  This expense may be obviated if the parents of the child who dies, or the other members of the family if it is the parents who have died, have taken the precaution to insure over the years with a commercial insurance company against the death of the particular individual concerned. Unless they have taken this precaution they are forced to do either of two things: those who live in rural areas must borrow the money from the local trader or shopkeeper.  They need not go to the bank, particularly since this Government came into office. If they did go to the banks they probably would not get collateral, being ordinary people with no rich or influential friends.  If they happen to be living in the cities they must go to <Col N="1683" /> the moneylenders, the result being that for years and years their families will have to struggle without ever being able to escape from the grip of the moneylender.  In my view a very important moral principle is involved with regard to this matter.  Why should commercial insurance companies be allowed to make money out of death?  Why should any authority in the State be allowed to amass profits out of the grief, the misery and the suffering of the masses of the people?  Yet is not that what is going on?  We know it is going on.  We see the well-paid, well-heeled officials of the insurance companies going around in their fancy cars calling upon their customers and hundreds of thousands of pounds are amassed as a result of that grizzly trade.</P>
    <P>In my view, there devolves upon the State the responsibility to see that all its officials, so far as is humanly possible, are treated equally, and the responsibility to see that an act of God in the shape of death should not be a matter for the amassing of profit.  It was the idea of the calamitous effect which death had on the working-class family which impelled the Labour Party and Deputy Norton to write into his Bill a clause whereby a family would receive allowances at the time of the death of one of its members. The allowances were to range from £5 to £20, and those of us who have contact with the people know what a boon that would have been.  The Fianna Fáil Government and the Minister for Social Welfare cut all that out.  The Minister did not consider that it was so essential or, perhaps, it was because he thought had he left it in that the higher contribution would necessarily have been asked of the worker.  By leaving it out he felt he would have a better chance of getting away with the bluff which he has placed before the House.  On the Second Reading of the Deputy Norton Bill some of us probably listened to the present Minister for Social Welfare making a puerile and feeble effort to attack what was undoubtedly a very fine social proposal. Later in the day, following a hurried meeting of the Party chiefs, the Fianna Fáil plan was hurriedly <Col N="1684" /> unveiled.  With all due trumpetings it was announced in the following morning's <i>Irish Press.</i>&ldquo;Sceala Éireann.&rdquo; Is ceart an focal sin sceala&mdash;stories of Ireland, or fairy tales of Ireland.  As I say, we remember the promise that was made that there would not be any increase in contributions demanded by Fianna Fáil because these financial wizards, particularly the financial genius who was then Deputy Dr. Ryan, was going to evolve a scheme that would give not merely the benefits of the Norton Bill but much more&mdash;and all for nothing.  They were not going to increase the contribution at all. Along they come then, in their usual brazen fashion, not content with bluffing the people and misleading them and getting them down, but anxious to kick them while they are down.  They come along with the proposal not merely to increase the workers' contribution by 5d., as I have said, but to increase it by anything from 10/- to £1 per week per family, under the monstrous Budget presented by the Minister for Finance last week.  That is the tie-up.</P>
    <P>We have in this House certain representatives who posture as Independents. God help them.  Some of them have made an issue at other times of what they refer to as &ldquo;the means test&rdquo;.  Some of them would have us believe that they were so pure-souled in their idealism that they would die politically before they would vote for a means test.  What have we in this Bill but a means test&mdash;because anybody earning over a certain figure will be prevented from enjoying any advantage under the Bill?  Is that not a means test&mdash;or have words lost their meaning?  Words can have a different meaning for different people, depending on the kind of mind they have. But to ordinary people who are not as well-versed in the use of words as other people&mdash;ordinary, simple people such as myself&mdash;words have just one meaning and a means test is a means test no matter what name you call it. In this Bill there is a means test and let nobody try to delude himself that there is not.  It is a travesty of the English language to call these Deputies &ldquo;Independents&rdquo; unless we can conceive of such a thing as a dependent-Independent, <Col N="1685" /> because that is what we have in this House.  They are dependent in the very fullest sense of the word&mdash;dependent upon the whim of the Leader of the Government as to how long their political future will last. Once the Irish people get a chance, these Independents will be gone with the wind.</P>
    <P>Can anybody say that the dropping of the maternity attendance allowances is not a very serious defect in this Bill, that the proposal in the Norton Bill for after-care, and so forth, was not a very good proposal and should have been contained in this Bill?  Amongst the working class, with the way the cost of living is going now, even childbirth is a luxury: having children is a luxury.  It was proposed in the Norton plan to help working people to try to follow through the Christian concept of large families and to help the people to provide for such families.  That is not the position under this Bill.  The Minister was not concerned with that consideration.  It did not enter his mind.  All he wanted was to try to score a few cheap political points against Deputy Norton.  He might as well have been idle&mdash;because while he was burning the midnight oil along with his adviser, the &ldquo;Minister of Charm&rdquo; was simultaneously laying the foundation of the ruination of the Fianna Fáil Party with his Budget.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me, and I am sure to other Deputies, on behalf of that very brave but very unfortunate section of our people&mdash;those suffering from poliomyelitis.  We have been asked to ask the Minister to do something in this Bill for these people. Anybody who has come into contact with the Association of Polio Victims is aware that that organisation is doing very fine work in bringing back into the channels of ordinary life people who have been stricken by that dread disease&mdash;helping them to take up gainful employment and bringing a little sunshine into their lives.  There are not, I suppose, a very large number of such victims&mdash;that is, those who suffer the after-effects of poliomyelitis&mdash;but I recommend consideration of these very deserving people by the Minister on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> We all remember the heroic speeches about the small farmers which were made last year by Deputy Cogan.  We all remember his speeches on the terrible injustice that was being perpetrated on the small farmers because they were not going to be included in the Norton Bill.  In an endeavour to meet what was, undoubtedly, a problem, the Labour Party and Deputy Norton evolved a plan of voluntary membership under their scheme for the small farmers.  We have not heard one squeak out of Deputy Cogan now about the small farmers&mdash;not a single syllable.  He just trots into the Lobby and votes for whatever may come, no matter what its colour may be and whether or not it is good for the small farmers.  So long as Fianna Fáil puts it forward, it must be voted for.  But Deputy Cogan must know that what I am saying is the truth&mdash;and if his conscience troubles him he has the remedy.</P>

How many times have we listened to the mellifluous voice of Deputy Corry on the Adjournment talking about barley and wheat and the devil-knows-what and the wrong that would be done under the previous Bill to the small farmers.  Now we hear nothing about the small farmers being excluded from benefit under this Bill.

I have suffered enough listening to long speeches without wishing to inflict similar suffering upon my colleagues, even upon the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, much as I dislike some of them.  It is very disconcerting to see this Bill thrust upon the people in the fraudulent manner in which it has been thrust upon them. Quite clearly it represents the mentality of individuals who are completely out of touch with the ordinary people.  Fortunately, it is of little moment, because when we come back very shortly we will bring in a Bill that will put this one completely in the shade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in many respects similar to that introduced by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  All the good points in the Bill are the points that were in the previous measure but unfortunately many of the good points in that measure have not been included in this one.</P>
      <P>We have every reason to be critical of the manner in which the Minister introduced this Bill and we have good reason to be especially critical of the terms in which he introduced it.  I think it was a departure from normal practice for the Minister to speak as he did on the introduction of this measure a couple of weeks ago.</P>
      <P>It is only right that we should remind the Minister that he was either right last year or right this year.  Last year he stated he opposed the Bill introduced by the inter-Party Government because it failed to provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community.  It certainly covered more sections of the community than this Bill purports to cover.  Speaking on 2nd March, 1951, at column 1092 of Volume 124 of the Official Report, Deputy Dr. Ryan said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I put down this amendment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in an endeavour to get a better scheme <Col N="1689" /> of social insurance, and I think it is the duty of every Party in this House, even though we have to face the scathing remarks of the Minister, to say what they think is the best scheme of social insurance.  I am approaching this scheme in that way. The Minister took three years to produce this Bill.  He gave it very mature consideration and we may take it that it is, in his opinion, the best that can be produced in the circumstances.  It is, in my opinion, as good as can be produced in the circumstances for certain sections but this Party believes that there are certain sections who are not covered by the Bill&mdash;at least who were not covered nearly as well yesterday as they are to-day&mdash;because the Minister has announced one amelioration for certain sections in the form of old age pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote that to show what the Minister's attitude was towards the Bill.  He believed there were certain sections, notably the small farmers, which were not included in the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton.  Further on he says: &ldquo;If the Labour and other Deputies are anxious for a good scheme of social welfare, let them listen.&rdquo;  He has now spoken.  He spoke a few weeks ago.  We heard his scheme.  Any shortcomings in his scheme are, in the main, the departures from the Norton scheme. They are the Minister's own innovations. At column 1,093 on the same date he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... When this new Department was set up by the Fianna Fáil Government, it was intended to bring in a comprehensive scheme, so that we are all agreed that a comprehensive scheme is necessary. Let us accept that and go ahead and see what is the best scheme that can be produced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister now comes in with the skeleton of the Bill that was introduced last year and that passed its Second Reading.  The only good points in this Bill are those taken from last year's Bill.  But the Minister has introduced his Bill at a time when his colleague, the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1690" /> has imposed an extra 10/- per week on the average family because of the increase in the price of tea, the increase in the price of butter, the increase in the price of sugar, and the increase in the price of bread and flour.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister, then Deputy Dr. Ryan, complained that the Bill was not sufficient to offset the rising cost of living.  Remember, last year the cost of living had risen by only 3 per cent. during the three years of inter-Party Government.  To offset that 3 per cent. increase there were two and, in some cases, three rounds of wage increases.  Last year the present Minister said there should be no increases in the charge for stamps either on the workers or on the employers.  He said his scheme would be financed completely out of taxation. We did not know what his scheme was until the next day, when we read the newspapers and found a tabular statement showing the then Deputy's scheme and the then Minister's scheme side by side.  Both schemes were almost identical, though Fianna Fáil pretended that theirs was a better one. At the end there was a note that the cost of their scheme would not involve any extra charge on stamps.</P>
    <P>Now to prove the attitude of the Minister, let me quote from column 1101, Volume 124, of the Debates on 2nd March, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe that certain of the schemes should be done through contributions and that certain of them should be done through taxation.  In that respect I am not departing very much from what the position is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although I am not saying that we should do away with the contributory system, we should be clear on the arguments for and against that system, and we should be clear on the arguments for and against taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All the time he harped on the fact that the Norton Bill proposed to ask for increased contributions from employers and workmen.  This scheme asks for increased contributions from <Col N="1691" /> employers and workers, but last year, when the present Minister was in Opposition, he opposed that idea.  Now he has come to the stage when he is giving fewer benefits than were offered last year in the Norton scheme and he is charging increased sums on the stamps of employers and workers.  We say, too, that in some respects this scheme is not as good as the one which passed the Second Reading last year. The benefits are not so good for certain classes of people, while several other classes included in the Norton Bill are left out altogether.</P>
    <P>I should like also to remind some of the other people who spoke on this matter of the attitude which they adopted last year.  We had Deputy Corry wailing and moaning because the small farmers were not included in the scheme last year.  This year there is not a word out of him when he finds his own Minister has no scheme at all for the small farmers.  It is interesting to recall what Deputy Corry had to say on 5th April of last year as reported at column 199 of Volume 125:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have but one deep regret in this matter and it is that Deputy Flynn has given notice of his intention to withdraw his amendment.  I am sorry to see him leave the House now because I should like to put a few figures before him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course they have become very friendly since.  They are now brothers-in-arms. I wonder has he any figures to give Deputy Flynn regarding the cost of living for the past year?  Deputy Corry went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are in Deputy Flynn's constituency in Kerry some 21,000 farmers, if we can call them farmers, living on less than 30 acres per family.  The Deputy's amendment says that no provision is made in the Bill for the payment of benefits to small farmers and casual workers who are not included in the Bill as at present constituted.  I wonder whether Deputy Flynn considered that the 2/6 promised to the old age pensioners in Kerry, and which he knows as well as I know can be screwed out of the Minister whether <Col N="1692" /> this Bill passes or not, is a full justification for throwing overboard these 21,000 farmers who live on less than 30 acres per family in County Kerry. Is the Deputy prepared to do that? That is a question which I should like the Deputy to ask himself before he walks into the Lobby.  The total income per family of these men would not be £3 a week and Deputy Flynn knows that as well as I know it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say in column 200:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The unfortunate fellow who has 15 acres of Kerry bog will wake up on Monday morning and find that if he wants his little plug of tobacco for the week there will be an extra bit on it.  To pay for what?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the criticism of Deputy Corry last year on the Bill which passed its Second Reading, because the small farmers were not included, but now we have a Bill that does not mention that section of the community whatsoever, and not alone will they be paying their little bit on the ounce of tobacco for this Bill, but they will be also paying a little bit to the new Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy MacEntee speaking on the Bill last year in the following strain:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill is a selfish Bill, framed by self-seeking politicians whose mind is fixed on one ulterior object and that object is the purchase of urban political support.  The Bill I think has no higher motive than that.  It is not concerned with social justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mind you that was a better Bill than this one.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee as he then was went on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If it were, it would not freeze out, as this Bill freezes out from all benefits and advantages the hardest working element in our community, the primary producers, the farmers; neither would it be so callous and indifferent to the needs and vicissitudes of the self-employed person as this Bill is.  The self-employed person is usually a person of independent character.  He likes to stand on his own two feet and not <Col N="1693" /> be beholden to any man for his livelihood, but that great good quality of his leaves him the more vulnerable to ill-fortune and ill-health than any who hold cosy jobs. Yet this Bill does no more for the self-employed person than it does for the working farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There he was criticising the arrangement whereby the working farmer could not participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In short, they give much but they get nothing.  One half almost of the producers, of the workers of the country, are discriminated against by the provisions of this Bill and they are victimised by it.  Will anyone tell me, will the Tánaiste tell me, where is the social justice in that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then Deputy MacEntee continues to criticise his new-found friend, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Desmond is a newcomer to our public life and I know little about him but Deputy Cowan I do know and when I hear this, shall I say, nuncio of the red pope of the Kremlin getting up in the House as he did last Thursday and belabouring, through column after column of the Dáil Debates, a Catholic priest because he had the audacity to set out the principles upon which proposals such as these now before the House should be judged and in doing this dragging in the Papal Encyclicals, I am reminded of the signal ability with which Satan can quote the Scriptures to suit his own purpose.</P>
    <P>But who is this Gamaliel who proposes to teach ethics and sociology to our clergy?  He is the man who, a few years ago&mdash;a very few years ago &mdash;proclaimed the imminent triumph of Communism in Europe.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, it is a complete change of attitude.  We remember that, in 1947, the Minister refused to ameliorate the means test which would have meant an extra 2/6 per week for the old age pensioners.  At that time the argument was put to the House that the country could not afford it. Yet, when the change of Government took place we were able to find 5/- per week immediately for the old age pensioners. At the same time, we abolished the taxes in respect of stout, <Col N="1696" /> cigarettes and cinema seats.  Now the position is somewhat the same as it was four years ago.  We find that these burdens are to be imposed again.  We find that the benefits which may come from increases under this scheme will be more than offset by the drastic increase in the cost of living which is bound to result from the proposals put before the House by the Minister for Finance in his Budget last week.</P>
      <P>I was wondering if the Minister could tell us whether it would be possible to have the benefits of this scheme extended to inshore fishermen, a good many of whom would need benefits of this nature?  The Minister himself is aware of the hazards which confront inshore fishermen.  I was wondering, since he has not provided for them in this Bill, whether it will be possible for him to make that provision. There is provision made for seamen in the Bill, but not for the inshore men.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear of the case made on behalf of polio cases.  Those people, who fight the battle of life so well, certainly deserve any kind of help that can be given to them.  We have noticed in recent times, particularly across the water, that those people who are only disabled in one respect but who have keen intellects, can be very good typists, clerks, telephone operators and factory workers.  We find that many factories in England have schemes under which they take a percentage of these polio cases, and that those people are able to lead, in their own sections, in the matter of applying themselves to their work and as regards their skill and capacity for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister provide in this Bill something in the nature of a disablement benefit or, perhaps, some kind of an allowance which would enable them to be educated for a trade or craft which would permit them to take their place side by side with the rest of our workers in the factories or at the desks.  Those people are quite capable of doing a day's work if they are equipped to do it either in the matter of education or in the matter of employment being made available to them through the <Col N="1697" /> various factories or organisations. There is no point in going any further regarding the capacity of these people. Those of us who are familiar with any of them know that if they got the chance at all they are certainly anxious to avail of it.</P>
    <P>There was an argument put up last year against this question of retirement pension.  The argument was put up strongly that a retirement pension should not be made available.  There are certain classes of people all of whom can readily be brought to mind who have to struggle, who live alone and reach the age of 55, 60 or 65 years of age.  They have then to retire from active life and try to live, perhaps, with some of their own people.  They wish to be independent financially and they would like to have some kind of a little pension coming to them.  Many of these people are in employment of a non-pensionable nature and, when it comes to the time when they just cannot carry on any longer, they have to go begging for accommodation and probably for a home with their own family, having been far away from their family all through their working years.  Those people are not now being provided for.  There will be no retirement pensions for those kind of people who have worked all the years, fought the battle of life and are facing their later years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to find that no provision has been made for that class of people.  I know that many of them were looking forward to such benefits as a retirement pension.  The argument was put up that there are many people who reach 65 years of age who would like to continue working, but there are many people who reach that age who are not just able to continue to work, even though they are expected to do so.</P>
    <P>Then we have this action of the Minister for Local Government in compulsorily retiring the rate collectors at the age of 65.  Theirs is not very hard work.  It demands a certain effort from the rate collectors concerned. They must be well able for their job, but certainly they are well able to do it after the age of 65.  Yet, as a result of a Government Order <Col N="1698" /> a couple of months ago by the Minister for Local Government, when a rate collector reaches the age of 65 years, he is not allowed to continue to work.  He is compulsorily retired.  He must retire from work and make way for somebody else, even though he wishes to carry on and is well able to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he would consider the introduction of some kind of an amendment which would enable a person to have the option of retiring after 65 years of age instead of fighting on until he reached the age of 70 in order to get the old age pension.</P>
    <P>The previous scheme provided for the payment of retirement pensions at 65 for men and for women at the age of 60.  That particular part of the Norton Bill has been scrapped altogether.  It is disappointing to find the Minister departing completely from the attitude which he adopted last year.  All through the years when the inter-Party Government were in office we had Deputy Lemass, every couple of months, pressing Deputy Norton for the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of social security. All he wanted was a comprehensive scheme of social security.  The Minister for Social Welfare has now brought in a very skimpy scheme, but we do not hear the Tanaiste, Deputy Lemass, complaining that it is not the comprehensive scheme of social security about which he was so anxious during the years when the inter-Party Government was in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to add to the Minister's fatigue.  I quite realise that he has patiently listened to the speeches on this Bill coming from the opposite side and even from his own Party.  I do not desire to detain the House to any great extent on it.  I would just like to remark that the Bill is a Bill which I viewed with very great suspicion.  It is a Bill that I had very little admiration for and it is a Bill for which I had no admiration whatever during the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the speeches from the present set-up when they were on this side of the House, I was expecting that the moment they occupied the <Col N="1699" /> seats of office in this country we were going to have no more poor people.  I was given to understand that we would have old age pensioners in a position to live in the height of comfort and end their days in the glory of prosperity. I thought we were going to have no more unemployed and I was expecting that those who would be unemployed would be in receipt of such benefits that they would be equally well off with those who were fortunate enough to occupy good positions in the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to remark, Sir, that I view this probably from a rather strange angle.  I think that attempting to improve the lot of the unemployed is merely endeavouring to patch up a completely worn-out quilt. Would it not be better and sounder for the Government to devote more of their time and energy towards ensuring that there would be no unemployed whatever to cater for by way of unemployment benefits?</P>
    <P>It is the duty of every Government to provide work for all the citizens and for all the able-bodied men and women within the State.  It should be the primary concern of the Government, and particularly of the Minister for Social Welfare, to see that there is as little unemployment as possible.  We know, however, from our experience of Fianna Fáil when they were the Government that, instead of endeavouring to find work for the unemployed they bent all their energies towards providing free milk, free boots, free beef, free soup, free chops and free everything&mdash;in other words, to make complete paupers and beggars out of decent men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am doing, Sir, with all respects. Within this Bill provision is being made for increased benefits for the unemployed.  I maintain that there should be no such thing as unemployment if the Government were doing their duty and I do not believe there should be any benefits at all for able-bodied men of any type.  I have made <Col N="1700" /> that speech in my constituency.  It is wrong and it is demoralising.  No man wants unemployment benefit, whether small or great.  All he wants is work if he can work.  It is completely wrong that such attention and consideration should be given to building up allowances which would even tend to encourage unemployment.  I know workers who are in receipt of unemployment benefit and who have a miserable existence on that unemployment benefit while there is work all round them waiting to be done. Because of legislation they are compelled to eke out a miserable existence on a few shillings unemployment benefit rather than undertake work which is there to be done.</P>
      <P>Do the Minister and the Government not consider it their duty to see that there is no such thing as unemployment benefits and that every able-bodied worker is given full-time employment with a decent wage and a standard of living which would enable him to bring up his family under decent conditions?  From the speeches of the present Minister and his colleague, the Tánaiste, I was expecting that that would have happened when they held the reins of office again, but we find that we have been completely disappointed.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill presented to this House by the Minister and presented to the Minister by his political adviser.  I want to say this when dealing with the Minister, his advisers and his political adviser: that if we ever see the day, which I believe we will soon, that we will have another inter-Party Government, I will support no inter-Party Government unless I have a guarantee that the political adviser to the Minister for Social Welfare goes on the spot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill copied from Deputy Norton's Bill.  The only difference is that all the good points in Deputy Norton's Bill are deleted from this Bill&mdash;the sections that would really mean something to this country and to its people.  The section dealing with death benefits has been deleted.  I should like to know what objection Fianna Fáil have to death benefits.  I have not heard any satisfactory explanation from the Minister as to that.  Does he still want paupers' funerals?  Does he still want the mean-looking, unvarnished elm coffin on parade out of the poorhouse? He is too busy concentrating on the high quality oak coffin with the panelled sides for the rich and it is to be the unvarnished, plain elm coffin, the poorhouse coffin, for the poor.  As Deputy Dunne pointed out, no greater calamity could befall a family than death.</P>
      <P>The angel of death knocks at the door of the rich and of the poor.  The only difference is that the rich are better able to bear that heavy cross than the poor.  The poor were the primary concern of Deputy Norton and the Labour Party and of the inter-Party Government.  We realised what a death in the family meant to them. We were anxious to save them the embarrassment of having to go to the relieving officer in the event of a death and ask for a red ticket so that they might get a 50s. coffin.  But because people are unfortunate enough to be poor they must now get a pauper's coffin when they want it.  No allowance is provided in this Bill to safeguard people from having to avail of a pauper's coffin and a pauper's grave. The Fianna Fáil Party have even deprived the poor of the sounding of the dead bell in the churches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I am raising the point.  The people should be safeguarded against that. The inter-Party Government saw to these things.  But the Minister has failed to respond as a Christian Irishman should as he has deleted that important section from the Bill.  The poor have always been the primary concern of the inter-Party Government.  The poor should be the concern of everyone who has any heart.  Would it not have been more decent to scrap the Bill altogether rather than omit from it the sections which meant everything to the very people who needed this Bill the most, namely, the poor?  The poor will grow in numbers every year as long as the present Cogan-Cowan-de Valera set-up remains in office.</P>
      <P>I hope and trust that no member of this House, gets a pauper's coffin.  I do not believe we will, because we are fortunate enough to belong to the right class.  That will save us from that fate, but the same guarantee does not hold good for all our constituents.  I wonder how many paupers' funerals are going to take place henceforth in Wexford&mdash; the constituency represented by Deputies O'Leary and Corish and by the Minister.  If a pauper's funeral takes place in that constituency, people can raise their hats and say: &ldquo;Thanks to Dr. Ryan, a pauper's funeral is passing.&rdquo;  If we were in office there would be a respectable and independent funeral entering that churchyard.  I think it is the most disgraceful, disgusting and unchristian act that I have ever experienced during my ten years' membership of this House to delete from this Bill the one section which would be of outstanding advantage to the poorer sections of the community.  I hope that the Fianna Fail-Cowan-Cogan-ffrench-O'Carroll set-up will carry full responsibility for every pauper's coffin, for every pauper's grave and for every pauper's funeral which takes place from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is bad enough.  In fact, it would be difficult for it to be worse, but we have another extraordinary <Col N="1703" /> feature in the Bill.  The Norton Bill had a provision for retiring allowances for men at 65 and for women at 60.  I can recall the gladness and the joy of the tired, weary, old country workers of 66, 67 and 68 years of age who had served their families and their country well.  Old age had now crept upon them as it will creep upon everybody without exception.</P>
    <P>Is it not lovely to have the feeling of security, which makes you feel young even if you are getting old, in the knowledge that you will not want for anything during old age?  We of the inter-Party Government, especially Deputy Norton of the Labour Party, gave the aged people of this country a youthful feeling by guaranteeing them security in their old age.  That meant a lot to old people.  However, it meant nothing to the Minister for Social Welfare, and it meant nothing to the Fianna Fáil Deputies representing my constituency.  It carried no weight with Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll or with Deputy Cogan, who wept about the small farmers, or with Deputy Cowan.  That in itself did not even mean anything to Deputy Dr. Browne or to any member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I recall, very shortly after the present Coalition Government taking office, the Minister for Social Welfare speaking in this House in connection with old age pensions.  When the question of retiring allowances was raised, he clearly and definitely stated that he considered it improper that there should be retiring allowances at 65 years of age.  He said people should be made work at 65.  Surely to the Lord, if they are walking around unemployed at 21 and 30 years of age, they can hardly be expected to be able to procure work at 60 or 65.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense, rot, trash and downright bunkum as to say that there is work for people between the ages of 65 and 70 when there are 75,000 able-bodied unemployed young men who cannot get an hour's work at the present time?  Yet, the Minister says: &ldquo;You will have to work between the ages of 65 and 70.&rdquo;  I would like Deputy Corry, limited and all as is his <Col N="1704" /> intelligence, to tell this House why he is opposed to retiring allowances at 65.  I would really love to hear his reason.  I would also like if Deputy Dr. Browne would explain to us what he sees wrong in rescuing a man or a woman from the poorhouse when old age comes upon them.  I fail to see what is wrong with the idea, and I would like to hear from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party why they object to it.</P>
    <P>However, paupers' funerals are about the only thing we could expect from Fianna Fáil.  The sad part of the whole thing is this; it is very regretable that some of the very people who are now being deprived of retiring allowances at 65 and who are being guaranteed a pauper's coffin were those who were shouting: &ldquo;Up Dev, and put back Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  I am really sorry for that, seeing that the only guarantee they now have from Fianna Fáil is a poorhouse coffin and the iron wheels of a union hearse.  If they are poor they can be very sure of having a poorhouse coffin and the union hearse.  In fact, that is the only guarantee they have from the Fianna Fáil-Cowan-Cogan administration.  I believe that they have now reached the stage of having the common sense and the intelligence which they did not display at the last election because they were so gullible.</P>
    <P>The widows, the orphans, the blind and the aged are the concern of all of us, and the chief concern of this side of the House.  I am not satisfied with the allowances provided under this Bill for these people.  I was inclined to view these provisions with disgust prior to last week, but now I view them with horror seeing that the old age pensioner only gets an increase of 1/6 per week.  Surely, the old age pensioner drinks tea?  Surely he does not want to sit at a black hob and have a dry crust which he will have after July. He wants butter.  He will need sugar; so will the widow and the young orphans who are deprived of probably both father and mother and left to the ways of the world and left to an angry Government who guarantee them a life of disaster with poor provision for them.  Bread up, tea and sugar up, <Col N="1705" /> and butter up.  We all know that the majority of the old age pensioners of this country are men and women of the past generation&mdash;the fathers and mothers of the present generation and the grandfathers and grandmothers of those who now find the top of their scalp becoming bare.</P>
    <P>We must face facts; when we are expected to provide for these people we must do it fully and amply.  This Bill does not do that.  This Bill does not improve them in the least, because any improvement whatever that should be accomplished by this Bill completely disappears as a result of the conduct of no less a person than the Minister for Finance who recited the <i>De Profundis</i> over the taxpayers of this country last week.</P>

      <P>The old age pensioner&mdash;and every old age pensioner loves and lives for his Friday pint&mdash;now finds that this item is a luxury not for him.  He cannot have it.  The old age pensioner has got an increase of 1/6, which I consider is an insult and the Fianna Fáil slap in the mouth to the several old age pensioners in this State.  They got 1/6 with one hand and the Government took 3/- with the other.  As well as taking the 3/- they have said: &ldquo;No more pipe, no more bottle of stout; stop your smoking; you can forget it after you are 70 years.  But,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you can dance all you like, free, no trouble whatever.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that under this Bill the old age pensioner gets more in order to enable him to smoke, to enable him to drink, to enable him to get a small whiskey.  He does not want to dance; he can stay at home and he will be quite satisfied with that.  He will say: &ldquo;Leave us what we can get cheaply and take your hands out of the taxpapers' pockets.&rdquo; We are asking the Government to do that but they have not done it.  Every old age pensioner, every widow and every orphan is expected to eat less and to save.  We are told they are to save, too.  Widows, orphans, even the blind, the sick, the invalids, even those with crutches, are expected by the Government and even by the Minister for Social Welfare, according to his speech, to save, to put away one-tenth of their miserable unemployment benefit, of their blind pension, of their widow's pension, of their orphan's allowance: &ldquo;Put away one-tenth and save that up.&rdquo;  They are to tighten their belts and eat less; smoke none and drink none; as I said a moment ago they can dance all they like but they can eat nothing.  That is Fianna Fáil's policy.  That is what Peadar Cowan has given the people of Dublin. Worse than that&mdash;I do not mind if the people of Dublin must suffer&mdash;he has inflicted this on the people of Leix-Offaly as well.  I thought Deputy Dr. Browne was in the House but he is gone.</P>

I want to say this much, that Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll must take responsibility for this extraordinary state of affairs and must take responsibility for giving us this sham, this excuse, this despicable Bill that guarantees nothing but a pauper's burial.  That is all I see in this Bill.  That is all that is guaranteed in the Bill.  Women are to go out and work from 60 until they are <Col N="1707" /> 70 and men from 65 until they are 70. We all know that Deputy Cogan wept bitterly and sadly this time 12 months ago because Deputy Norton presented a Bill that left out the small farmer. It was the greatest calamity and the greatest disgrace that ever befell this country, according to Deputy Cogan, that the small farmers should not be included in the legislation.  Deputy Cogan had more friends with him on this.  He had Deputy Corry, who gave such a display of insincerity as it now has proved itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we were to have provision for the small farmer.  Surely if the Bill was wrong last year in the eyes of Deputy Martin Corry and in the eyes of Deputy Cogan <Col N="1708" /> because the small farmer was not catered for, it is wrong to-day when they are not catered for? What does Deputy Dr. Ryan or the Minister for Social Welfare know of this?  What does he see wrong with including the small farmers in his Bill?  Why can he not have provision in his Bill for the small farmers or the farmers, say, of under £12 valuation?  Why can he not provide for them by way of giving them free hospital treatment?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare must know, like every Deputy in this House, that the correspondence which comes to Deputies day after day includes letters from small farmers, moaning and groaning sadly and bitterly about the manner in which the hospitals and the medical profession fleece them after an illness.  The county managers and the local authorities usually display very little sympathy for those small farmers.  They usually send them the writ to pay up at once.  I was expecting that provision would have been included in this Bill for every small farmer with a valuation of less than £12.  I was expecting that under this Bill they would be provided for so that at least they would have a free hospital bed.  There is not even provision for a bed for a small farmer's wife and family in the event of illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expected that the comprehensive scheme of social security that Fianna Fáil promised us would be a scheme whereby every section of the community would be covered.  The small farmer is left out under this Bill.  On more than one occasion the present Minister for Social Welfare, when he was in opposition, condemned Deputy Norton and the Labour Party and the inter-Party Government because of their failure, as he alleged, to cater for what he termed the poor unfortunate small farmer for whom he had so much sympathy.  Let him now demonstrate his sympathy in a practical way by inserting, within the next few weeks, a section in this Bill whereby the small farmers will be given at least free hospital treatment. They could be given free dental treatment and free medical treatment.  The Minister can make an arrangement <Col N="1709" /> with the local authorities to give small farmers some concessions in their rates in the event of illness.  He can help the small farmer in many ways. Is it, however, any wonder that he is not helping the small farmer when his adviser knows sweet damn all about the small farmer?  That is why the small farmer does not come under this Bill.  The reason why there is no question of consideration for the small farmer is because a city mentality is behind the working of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I remember attending a meeting in a small parish hall in my constituency. It was in the parish of Doonane, not too far from the town of Carlow.  The meeting was held in a small hall and it was presided over by the Parish Priest.  The T.D.s representing the constituencies of Leix-Offaly and Kilkenny-Carlow were invited.  There walked into that little hall no less a person than the present Minister for Agriculture, who was then Deputy Walsh.  He was greeted by his constituents and by my constituents in no unfriendly fashion.  He sat amongst them and spoke with them and laughed and smiled with them.  He listened attentively to everything they had to say until who should walk in but the present Minister for Lands, who was then Deputy Derrig.  Deputy Derrig informed us all in that hall that evening that he had motored down from Dublin specially because he was so gravely concerned about the coalminers in Castlecomer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, it has every reference to it.  The Deputies for Leix-Offaly and Deputy Derrig and <Col N="1710" /> Deputy Walsh, as they then were&mdash; now the present Minister for Lands and Minister for Agriculture, respectively&mdash;were present.  They asked the coalminers of Castlecomer, Rossmore and Wolfhill if there was anything that they could do for them and the coalminers replied: &ldquo;Yes, we want you to make special provision in your Social Welfare Bill for silicosis, the disease contracted by miners in the coalmines.&rdquo; Deputy Walsh, our present Minister for Agriculture, cried for everyone who ever died from silicosis and Deputy Derrig wept for everyone who was going to contract the disease. They said: &ldquo;If we are returned to office, silicosis will be a thing of the past.  We will have a remedy for silicosis&mdash;and the remedy will be a special section in our Social Welfare Bill giving special benefits to coalminers in Castlecomer, Rossmore and Wolfhill who contract the disease. Every miner who is unfortunate enough to have an X-ray which shows silicosis will get special benefits under the Social Welfare Bill.&rdquo;  The moment the Social Welfare Bill was circulated, I examined it and searched for the section dealing with silicosis.  I am still looking for it.  It is not in the Bill.  I now challenge the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture to go back to that parish hall and to explain to the coalminers of Castlecomer, Rossmore and Wolfhill why the promise which they gave to these men has not been carried out.  I will arrange that, within the next month, another meeting will be held in that parish hall.  I will see to it that the present Minister for Lands and the present Minister for Agriculture are invited to that meeting, when they can explain why they failed to provide for miners suffering from silicosis, and why those miners were betrayed by these two Ministers.  Poor Deputy Dr. Humphreys escaped all this.  At that time, he was in the wilderness.  Deputy Walsh and Deputy Derrig, as they then were, made a solemn promise and gave a solemn undertaking in my hearing that if ever they got back into office they would get the Minister for Social Welfare to provide specially for these coalminers. They have not carried out that promise.  Hence, they have failed to <Col N="1711" /> fulfil the undertaking that they gave to the miners.</P>

I appeal on behalf of the coalminers of my constituency to the Minister to make some provision for these people.  We have a very limited number of workers in our coalmines.  We have those in my constituency and those in Arigna and those in Leitrim.  This disease is one peculiar only to coalmining and those who are engaged in it and because the numbers are so few I think special provision should be made for them.</P>

      <P>I was accused by many speakers of making a bitter speech when I introduced this Bill.  I was accused of being unkind to Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party.  All I did was to outline the history of social welfare, and detail what was done and what was not done during the three years from 1948 to 1951. I can accuse Deputy Norton with a <Col N="1714" /> greater degree of accuracy of being unkind when he introduced his Bill in 1951 for he traced the history of social welfare up to 1932, and said nothing about the years between 1932 and 1948. If I wanted to give the full history I could give the performance of Cumann na nGaedheal in the first ten years, the performance of Fianna Fáil in the next 16 years and the performance of the Coalition Government in the last three years.  Because I gave the facts I am accused of making a bitter speech.  The members of the Labour Party wanted it to be understood that nothing is done here for social welfare except by them.  If that is contradicted and facts are produced to prove that it is wrong, then the person who produces those facts is accused of making a bitter speech.</P>
      <P>We will leave the bitterness and deal with the points that were raised. Deputies on the Opposition Benches talked about what I left behind me in 1948.  I never said I left a scheme. I have said over and over again that I left the material behind me upon which a scheme could be based and that that could be done in a few weeks by any Minister.  That was the statement I made over and over again.  Why should Deputy Norton get up now and accuse me of claiming that I left a scheme behind and then proceed to spend a quarter of an hour knocking that claim down?</P>

Later, Deputy Norton said I had no scheme.  But Deputy MacBride said it had to be scrapped.  That shows the way the Coalition Government talked about schemes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and many other Deputies said here&mdash;Deputy Larkin said it although I do not want to class Deputy Larkin's speech with some of the others because it was a good constructive, very critical speech; at least it was constructive if critical &mdash;that when I was talking about what I left behind me, I had never mentioned that matter.  Deputy Davin said that I made a speech here on an old age pension motion, which I shall refer to again, on the 22nd October, 1947, and that I did not refer to the comprehensive scheme and that that went to prove that I had no intention of introducing a comprehensive scheme at all.  Is it not extraordinary that Deputy Davin could make a speech like that when I now, a few hours after he sits down, can take the volume of the Dáil Debates containing the report of the debate of the 22nd October, 1947, and quote the following from column 824?&mdash;I am quoting myself now:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I said when I took over this Department that I hoped within 12 months to have a scheme of social services published.  I still hope it may be done within the 12 months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet Deputy Davin here this evening, a few hours ago, said bitterly that I had no notion of introducing a scheme in <Col N="1717" /> making my speech on the 22nd October, 1947, although I did refer to the scheme there two or three columns from the point at which he was quoting. That is the sort of statement you get from people like Deputy Davin. You cannot rely upon them.  After all if we are going to try to improve the social services of this country let us at least base our statements on facts and not on imagination.  There is too much imagination in that part of the House.  They are living on their imagination since 1950 and they go on living on that imagination, the imagination that they were going to bring in a social security scheme themselves.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the facts in this case and see how far we can get.  They talk about how long I was in bringing in this scheme.  We are nine months in office and if my claim is correct that I left data behind me in the Department in 1948 on which a scheme could be based, it is not a bad performance to base a scheme on that within nine months and have it put before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we come to this question of a comprehensive scheme.  I said when introducing this Bill that Deputy Norton's scheme was not comprehensive and I said the same thing last year.  I should like Deputies in <Col N="1718" /> referring to the amendment which I proposed last year to quote the words used in that particular amendment. Deputy Rooney in his long series of quotations referred to it.  In the amendment which I moved to Deputy Norton's Bill I asked the Dáil not to give it a Second Reading because &ldquo;it does not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community.&rdquo;  I am going to show Deputies on this side as well as on that side&mdash;because I am afraid Deputies on that side do not want to be shown&mdash;that so far as this scheme is concerned, we have carried out our intentions and that so far as Deputy Norton's scheme was concerned last year, it did not cover other sections of the community in any way. I want to make it clear again that I pointed out in that speech that you cannot bring the self-employed into a contributory scheme.  I pointed out that you cannot collect contributions satisfactorily except from an employer; in fact it would be impossible.  Imagine going around collecting contributions from small farmers, fishermen, etc. Therefore, as I pointed out on that occasion, whatever we do for these classes must be done by assistance, not by insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is more, I pointed out that Deputy Norton's scheme was designed to cover only insurable classes, that is, those who are working for employers and that there was nothing done for the self-employed. There are as many self-employed in this country as there are people working for employers.  Deputies on the opposite side got up one after the other; it was a tedious four days, I can tell you, because the speeches varied very little.  They were all directed to the point that we objected last year because the scheme was not comprehensive and that we are now doing less. We are not doing less.  We pointed out in our amendment last year that there was no provision in the Coalition Bill for old age pensioners.  We know how that provision came about.  We know that the Coalition Government realised that they were going to be beaten on <Col N="1719" /> the Bill because nothing was being done for the small farmers or the rural population and at a Government meeting, they agreed to an amendment of the Bill, which was announced only when Deputy Norton was making his Second Reading speech but when our amendment went in there was nothing about old age pensions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>You mean about co-operative societies?  We shall deal with that later.  I am talking about the self-employed&mdash;the small farmer, the tradesman, the fisherman and even the small shopkeeper.  What I pointed out in my speech was that old age pensions, non-contributory widows' pensions and children's allowances should be improved.  Practically every Deputy here produced the <i>Irish Press</i> of the following day's date, giving a summary of the Fianna Fáil proposals.  In these proposals they will see that there was provision for increased old age pensions, increased non-contributory widows' pensions and increased children's allowances.  These were the things we asked for in moving our amendment and they were the things that the Coalition Government did not provide for in their Bill.  We brought in the Old Age Pensions Bill and now we come along and we raise the non-contributory widow's pension in this Bill. That was not done by Deputy Norton; it was not contemplated by Deputy Norton so far as I ever heard.  It was not advocated by any single member of the Coalition side of the House on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I listened very patiently <Col N="1720" /> for four days to Deputies opposite in this Bill.  I had to interrupt a few times; it was hard not to.  I want Deputies to listen to the history of this thing now.  No member of the Coalition side of the House advocated at that time that the non-contributory widow should get an increased pension. Nobody did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>And no member on that side of the House advocated that the children's allowances should be increased.  These were things that we mentioned when bringing in our amendment to Deputy Norton's Bill at that time.  That is what we outlined in our amendment.  If Deputies say that we have not stuck to the idea of our amendment, I say that is wrong. We did stick to it.  We have already, as I say, increased old age pensions. We are improving the lot of the old age pensioner in this Bill, too, by raising the means test.  We are providing in this Bill for a substantial increase in the non-contributory widow's pension from 10/- to £1 a week.  That is something that would be far too big for members of the Labour Party to comprehend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. Deputy Leary need not help me to make my speech.  I will not forget any of these things.  I say that we are doing something for the self-employed, the small farmer and others by our old age pensions, non-contributory widows' pensions and children's allowances which I should say I mentioned in my Second Reading speech would be brought in at a later stage.  That was before it was contemplated doing something in respect of children's allowances in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want Deputies to realise this, that I made it very plain in my speech on that occasion that I did not think contributions could be collected from the self-employed.  Deputies should read that speech as an example of the type <Col N="1721" /> of speech that should be made from the Opposition Benches.  I said to Deputy Norton that, as far as benefits were concerned for the unemployed, the sick and the widow, I thought that under the circumstances, they were all right.  Are there any members of the Opposition Benches over there, however they may feel, will ever say that in respect to any Bill from this side of the House?  They will always ask for more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>None of them did.  I defy Deputy Sweetman to quote a responsible statement from any Fianna Fáil speaker at the last election that the benefits for unemployment, sickness or the widows were too low.  We all agreed they were high enough because we were a responsible Opposition and we agreed where we could agree.  We did not find fault when Deputy Norton brought along his proposals for old age pensions.  I said that I agreed that, in the circumstances, nothing better could be done.  Then you have these&mdash; I do not know whether or not it would be in order to refer to them as moborators&mdash;but at any rate, you have these orators like Deputy Flanagan coming in here and thumping the desk and talking about the way the old age pensioners have been treated.  Why did his Government not treat them better when they had a chance to do it, the Government that was able to find money without increasing taxation? It should have been able to do a lot of things that we could not do because we cannot find money without increasing taxation.  That is our trouble.  Deputies ask us: &ldquo;What did we do for the small farmer?&rdquo; As I have told you, we did that with regard to the old age pensions, the non-contributory widows' pensions, the children's allowances and so on and, in addition, as far as medium-sized farmers or large farmers are concerned, we have levied a contribution off them for the worker, and that is not going to hit them very hard.  I think that Labour Deputies really believe that they did more for social welfare than <Col N="1722" /> anybody else.  Well, you know that is a very dangerous thing because, if you begin to have a delusion like that, God knows where it will stop.</P>
      <P>After all, Deputies should study the figures because that is the only way to settle the matter.  The figures are there and anybody can study them. Get the Book of Estimates for 1931 and you will see there that the amount provided was £3,250,000.  That was as far as the Party opposite had reached. They had marked time on what the British provided.  Then let them go and take up the Book of Estimates for 1948, and they will find that the sum we provided was £11,250,000.  In other words, during the time Fianna Fáil were there the amount provided for social welfare went up by £8,000,000. Let Labour say what they like, they cannot deny those figures.  Let them go down the country and make speeches to their followers and deceive them, if they like, but if they want to quote the true figures there they are &mdash;the amount went up by £8,000,000 during those 16 years.  Of course, Labour Deputies say that anything that was done they made us do it. That is the grandest claim in the world for the Labour Party to make: that everything that was good and that was done by Fianna Fáil&mdash;I think the same applied in the Coalition time&mdash;it was done at the instance of Labour.  But when they go along to their followers and when they are asked: &ldquo;Why did you let Fianna Fáil do something that we do not like?&rdquo;, the answer is: &ldquo;We could not stop them from doing it&rdquo;, so they can always take it that the good things were done by Labour and the bad things were done in spite of them.  Mind you, they said the same about the Coalition when it was there. They said to their followers down the country: &ldquo;Well, whenever we have the power, we do things well, but of course these other Parties they are not doing the things they should do&rdquo;.  That is the grandest attitude at all for any Party to take.</P>

      <P>I will make it as soft for them as I can.  Taxation was going up.  That is a thing we must keep in mind.  It was only right that a certain amount more should be spent on social welfare but here is a point.  When I left the office of the Minister for Social Welfare, 18.5 per cent. of the income was spent on social welfare.  When Deputy Norton left, 16.5 per cent. was spent so that he was not able to keep up in the race for his Party as against the other Parties of the Coalition.  He lost the race and went down.</P>

      <P>We have to make up for that and we will do it.  There is not a Deputy who will deny that he is out for the best possible scheme and anxious to see the best possible thing done for the country.  If we are agreed on that, let us base our conclusions on the facts.  When Deputy Corish gets up and talks about the 6/7 per week increase, the thing is not right. That is all.  The increase in the family allowances of 2/6 for the second child and 1/6 for the others, means that no matter how big the family is it cannot have a higher cost than 3/6 a week as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>

      <P>Here is an example of the statements made by Deputies in their speeches and which were altogether wrong.  Deputy Keyes said&mdash;I think other Deputies said more or less the same thing&mdash;that the 2/6 extra for the old age pensions in 1947 had to be certified by the home assistance officer. Now, that is not true.  As far as I remember, it was in the middle of February, 1947, that I became Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;I have already said this on my Second Reading speech but I have to repeat it because there is so much misunderstanding whether deliberate or not I do not know&mdash;and by the end of March, that is a period of six weeks, I had a scheme in operation giving a 50 per cent. increase on all social welfare benefits with the exception of rural old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>In their case they got 2/6, bringing them up to 12/6.  I am just taking facts and let us stick to them. Deputies tried to draw a distinction between benefits conferred in 1947 by an emergency Order and the same benefits conferred by the Coalition Government in a Bill in 1948.  As far as the recipient is concerned, he got the same benefits before and after the Bill.</P>

      <P>He was wrong in both statements.  Deputy Rooney thinks he <Col N="1726" /> was right but he was not.  As a matter of fact, Fine Gael restored the 1/- on the old age pensions because they were beaten in the Dáil on the old age pension resolution.  They then got windy and put back the 1/- before we came here at all so that Deputy Larkin was not right.  Neither was he right when he said we sat down.  It must be remembered&mdash;it is terrible to have to remind the House so often&mdash;that Fianna Fáil added £8,000,000 to social welfare while the Coalition added only £1,500,000 so that we did not sit down. That was a rhetorical statement of Deputy Larkin's and, I should say, a typical statement of a member of the Coalition group.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some dispute about a motion on the 22nd October, 1947.  Deputy Sweetman sent for the book and got it.  I asked him to read it again but the Deputy would not do it for me.  I have no respect for any Deputy that will not read a thing again when he is asked so that one can get to the truth of a particular matter. That is Deputy Sweetman's technique. Silence your opponent and say what you like about him whether it is true or false.  That is what Deputy Sweetman did.  My point was that I did not accept the motion on the 22nd October, 1947, because it was a motion which no Minister would accept.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Norton was Minister for three and a half years and did not accept it, nor would he if he were there for another ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the motion which was so loosely worded by an eminent lawyer, Deputy Costello, and a social welfare worker, if you like, Deputy O'Higgins. Section (a) of that motion was that gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family whether in cash or in kind should not be counted.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party spent many hours advocating this motion.  When I got up I said: &ldquo;That is already the case.&rdquo; They did not know that.  Section (b) was that any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash should not count.  They spent hours in advocating that and then I said: &ldquo;That is already there.&rdquo;  Then we come to section (c) that casual moneys earned by the pensioner should not count.  I gave this as an example as to why I voted against that.  I said: &ldquo;Take two people over 70 years of age, one a charwoman who works on three days a week in different houses and earns 5/- a day or 15/- a week.  That counts as means against her.  Then take a member of the Press Gallery who retires and is over 70.  He writes an article for which he gets £5 5s. 0d. That would not count against him.  He would get the pension all right, but the poor charwoman would not.&rdquo;  That <Col N="1728" /> is why I voted against it.  Deputy Davin never loses an opportunity of quoting the 22nd October, 1947.  But Deputy Norton did not bring that into operation when he was Minister and he never would have.  That will not prevent Deputy Davin from saying it again.  Deputy Davin has come to the stage where he has a set speech against every Minister and nothing will put him off that speech.</P>
    <P>Now I come to these things which were left out of the Bill.  I mentioned them on the Second Reading.  The first is in regard to maternity benefit. I explained that on the Second Reading but Deputies did not take any notice of the explanation.  I said that, as far as the insured woman was concerned, we were giving the same benefits as Deputy Norton was giving in his Bill, that is, 24/- a week for six weeks before maternity and six weeks afterwards.  The only difference was in regard to the maternity grant, which is £2 at the moment for the wife of an insured man.  It was proposed in Deputy Norton's Bill to make it £5. I left it at £2.  Why?  I explained that I was bringing in, I hoped in the near future, a health scheme and part of that scheme would deal with maternity.  I should like to say to the Coalition opposite that I have a Party which will stand by my scheme.  I will not have people who will rat on the scheme when it is brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the position of female domestic employees under the Bill.  What I said on Second Reading was that I did not think it was fair to bring that class under unemployment insurance because they would be paying a contribution for a benefit they could never draw.  I think it is fairly obvious to any Deputy that there is no female domestic employee who could say at the moment that she was looking for work and could not get it.  If she could not say that in truth, she could not draw benefit.  That is why they were left out. It is possible that conditions may change and, if they do, that may be changed also, but in the meantime I think it unfair that they should be levied.  I was asked by certain Deputies whether that ruling applied to female domestic employees in institutions and hotels.  The answer is no. They are in a different position.  They have always been treated differently and will be treated differently in this case.  They will be fully insured against unemployment.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies raised the question of chronic illnesses, such as poliomyelitis. I mentioned in my Second Reading speech that in the case of these chronic illnesses, it was a matter to be dealt with by the health scheme and not by social welfare.  Deputies know, of course, that those who suffer from tuberculosis at the moment get a certain help to keep them going and it is intended, when the health scheme comes along, to apply that to other diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the very big question of retirement pensions and I want to reiterate that there is really no very big difference between us.  I have approached the matter in a different way from the Coalition, but so far as the person is concerned, at least between 65 and 70, there is no great difference.  I do not want to go over all the arguments because in my Second Reading speech I gave a fair amount of time to the arguments against retirement allowances, one of the big arguments being that people are living longer and I was afraid that in years <Col N="1736" /> to come it would not be possible for those under 65 to keep those over 65 in idleness, to keep them pensioned. If we started a contributory scheme of that kind, it would be impossible to change it in years to come, because those who had been paying contributions would claim that they had paid for their retirement at 65 and therefore had a right to retire.  It is a very big question and a very dangerous line to embark on.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to ensure that a person will receive sickness benefit, if unable to work from 65 to 70, or if he is able to work but cannot get it, which appears to be the fear of many Deputies, he will continue to draw unemployment benefit without requalifying during those five years.  He will get the same amount as was proposed in Deputy Norton's Bill as retirement allowance and in fact he will possibly get more&mdash;24/- for himself, 12/- for his wife and, if he has children, 7/- for each child. Under Deputy Norton's scheme, he would not get anything for the children.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a difference of opinion on many aspects of this.  For instance, members of the Opposition hold that there was no compulsion in the Norton scheme.  Theoretically, there was not, but it must be remembered that if a man loses his employment and gets sick, under the Norton scheme, he must retire because he cannot get sickness benefit and cannot get unemployment benefit.  He must take the retiring allowance and cannot get away from it.  To that extent, it is compulsory.  As I described it in the beginning, the difference between the schemes is that we say we should encourage a man to work and the Coalition say: &ldquo;No; encourage him to retire.&rdquo;  There is not a lot of difference and there is no point in getting &ldquo;het-up&rdquo; about it and saying that we are making the poor fellow go on working beyond 65, when we know that most people who are earning a wage would prefer to go on earning rather than retire on 24/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have not finished. I said that the Government had not closed its mind against retirement allowances, that it was not in the Bill but that if there was a demand, a scheme would be produced.  Now, it strikes me this way that if any Deputy opposite were really concerned about retirement allowances and really anxious to see they were brought in, he would not have attacked me the way he did but would have caught on to what I said, that if there is a demand the scheme will be brought in; and he would have tried to do something under that offer.  Instead of that, they went off to attack the Bill up and down and all those opposite were more violent against that particular proposition than they need have been.  In my opinion, it is a matter that could have been discussed in a sensible way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not thought about that, I must admit to Deputy Corish; but I think we would need to have a genuine indication that people want this provision.  I am told&mdash;Deputies may not agree&mdash;that very many workers do not want this&mdash;that is, they do not want to pay for it; I am sure they would all like to take it if they got it for nothing.  The workers could be told it would cost so much <Col N="1738" /> and they would get certain benefits and they could be asked whether they want it or not.  How we are going to determine that, I do not know; but I can assure the Coalition that we will determine it in the best and widest way possible.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to say, either&mdash; this is another matter that has to be considered&mdash;that it is a thing the worker has to pay for himself&mdash;he and his employer.  As we know, the employers in most instances will pass that on, so it is really not much better than taxation; and the workers will pass it on if they are able.  There is no such thing as black and white in this, no such thing as a clear-cut argument governing it.  We have had the arguments for and against and I say we should not do it unless we are sure of our ground.  I want to warn the House that if we once bring it in we cannot go back.  It is like one of the things mentioned already, one of the things I was up against, as to whether I could promise the changing over of contributory widows to noncontributory widows.  I was up against the position that I was going to put a hardship on people who were paying into this fund in that any person who would have a claim as a widow would still have that claim even in 30 years' time.  There would be a claim still there and there is nothing you can do about it.  We have to remember when we talk about these matters that in ten or 15 years' time we may find that population over 65 is higher and the population under 65 is lower.  Then we cannot go back and it would be putting an intolerable burden on the people below 65.  That is why it is necessary to decide in a sensible way now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>Is there to be an opportunity for discussing the last bit before the Bill is passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come up on the Committee Stage again.  I am sure there are clauses where it can be discussed on the Committee Stage.  There is clause 60, the clause that was not in this Coalition Bill.  Neither was it in the &ldquo;heads&rdquo; or &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; that was left behind at the end of 1947. <Col N="1739" /> There was nothing in the Norton Bill, in fact, that was not in that &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; and this was not in it.  No one can state, then, that I am taking away a right.  The idea is that if any trade union or any employer puts up what they say is a scheme of their own for retirement allowances, death benefits and so on, a scheme of which the Minister approves, he can then contribute to that scheme.</P>
      <P>I think we should proceed on those lines for a while.  If possible, we should get employers to provide these schemes themselves.  We could get trade unions to do it.  There are certain trade unions that will occur to anyone as being fairly compact, where there is no possibility of people going into that union or out of it because there is only one union catering for that particular type of worker.  Unions like that might draw up a scheme of their own and then get a contribution from the Minister for Social Welfare and give better benefits, naturally, than would be given by a scheme brought in by a Minister.  I suggest that is the way we should push that clause and see that it is adopted by as many people as possible.  There are Deputies here who talk of vocationalism.  There is an opportunity of applying vocationalism in a very practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point was the death benefit. There is room for disagreement here, too.  From what Deputies said on that side, you would think that the Norton scheme about death benefit was the most important thing in that particular proposal.  Every Deputy spoke about it; we heard about the paupers' coffins and all the gruesome things that would occur because that was left out. Why?  After all, there is room for disagreement there again.  There were two Ministers of the Fine Gael Government&mdash;Deputies Morrissey and McGilligan&mdash;who argued consistently and strongly against it.  I have the files where they made those arguments against that particular provision. Deputy Norton, I admit, was strongly in favour of it and Deputy Norton went ahead with the scheme in spite of these two Ministers.  I am mentioning that to show there is a difference of opinion, <Col N="1740" /> that men like the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance in the last Government&mdash;even though they were not connected with an insurance company&mdash;could say there were points against it.  I suspect, and I have every right to suspect, that they spoke in glowing terms of the death benefit because they thought they were able to make a personal point against me.</P>

It is true that where a scheme was suitable only for the employed person it should be contributory, but where the scheme was suitable and needed by both it should not be contributory because you cannot get contributions from the self-employed.  Anyone will agree that the self-employed person&mdash; the small farmer, the fisherman, the tradesman working on his own&mdash;all need retirement pensions just as well as the ordinary worker.  They all need the death benefit just the same.  That was one of the reasons that guided me in keeping that out of the insurance scheme under this Bill.  Again, I would like to remind Deputies that I offered to bring in a scheme if there was a demand for it.  We will leave it at that for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about this clause regarding the farmers' co-operatives that I dropped and why I dropped it.  It was absolute and pure eye-wash and nothing else.  Could any Deputy ever seriously imagine a co-operative <Col N="1741" /> society of farmers going in for unemployment benefit?  It was too ridiculous to consider.  I know that Deputy Norton, in his difficulties, put it in to satisfy some farmers and so that some Deputies in turn could try to hoodwink some people in the country.  That was not necessary in my case and I did not put it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This place becomes laughable when that happens, but I think it is an example where probity in public life should be resorted to and we should leave that provision out.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, who is a very frequent speaker on behalf of Fine Gael, said that the farmers would have every benefit under that scheme.  He may have been wrong but I took it that he was speaking authentically with regard to the meaning of that Bill, so I accepted it.  I suppose I should not be so simple in accepting the speeches of the Fine Gael members in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard various criticisms and comparisons between what was referred to as the Norton Bill and this Bill, but we never heard a word from a single Deputy in regard to the fact that the contributions were much heavier in the Norton Bill than in this one.  It must be kept in mind that when the amendment was put in by me last March, I estimated the cost of this Bill at £4,250,000.  Deputy Norton said it was going to cost £10,000,000.  So much did he impress the members of his own Government that, a few days afterwards, the Taoiseach of the time went down the country and made a wild statement that the amendment put in <Col N="1742" /> by me would cost £10,000,000.  That was to frighten off some of the doubtful Independents who were shaky about supporting Deputy Norton's Bill.</P>
    <P>I said at the time I was bringing in that amendment that I calculated the cost would be about £4.6 million, including the £4,250,000.  I have referred to; £500,000 for children's allowances, which was mentioned at the time; and a few other items.  At any rate, even if all those were added, I would be much nearer the mark than Deputy Norton, the Minister for Social Welfare at that time, although he had a Department to advise him and to give him figures.  I suspect, however, he did not ask the Department for any figures but thought of a figure and then mentioned it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride, as I said, gave us a lecture here to-day on election promises and I suppose many of the gentlemen sitting behind me will hardly believe that.  He asserted that I said there would be no increase in contributions and that in fact it went up by 5d.  That is true.  There were certain changes in the estimate but I think that anybody will admit that when a person in opposition draws up a scheme of that kind he may find when he comes to office that it is not practicable&mdash;leaving out the finances; after all we did not baulk at the cost; we only made changes because some of the proposals I had made were not workable.  Deputy MacBride, for instance, had a leaflet issued &mdash;I keep it carefully amongst my treasures&mdash;and proposed in 1948 that there should be a minimum living wage and that sickness benefit should be the same as the minimum living wage. Deputy MacBride had in mind £6 a week and that would be the sickness benefit if Deputy MacBride took office in 1948; in fact, he approved of Deputy Norton's Bill at 24/-.  Therefore, there is no use in talking; I do not want to hear lectures from Deputy MacBride about election promises.  I could even take them from Fine Gael but not from Deputy MacBride.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>If Deputy MacBride wants to get personal, we can do that too.  Deputy Norton said, after my speech here, that he did not mean the low wage group to include agricultural workers and that they had more than £3 10s. now.  That is not true.  Many of them are under the £3 10s. at this moment.  I think they will all be over the £3 10s. in a week or two; so he was a little bit wrong in his statement. Why did he put it in?  I cannot imagine a Minister putting in that unless he had some object.  He did not say why he put it in, to quote the Ceann Comhairle, <i>in vacuo.</i>  He gave no reason whatever.</P>

      <P>The officials may not have been interpreting his mind properly but that was the impression he gave them in regard to the low wage group. However, it is all over now, but the thing is this, if he allowed that they would come into the high wage group, then of course the contribution of the agricultural labourer would be 3/6 instead of 1/3, which is a terrible difference to a man who is earning about £3 10s. per week, a difference of 2/3.  The same applies to the farmer. I would like Deputy Rooney to take a note of that because he talked about farmers to-day.  As between the two Bills there is a difference of 2/3 in the contribution, and also for the labourer.</P>

I cannot see it.  I never knew a life insurance company to deal in retirement allowances of that kind and I do not see why they would object to the Government bringing in a scheme of that kind.  I imagine if I were looking at that from the point of view of an insurance director I would say it was a good thing because at least they would have a bit of money to pay premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit we would be competing with insurance companies, in providing death benefits, but it is a very small matter.  The income, counted in contributions, was calculated to be about £200,000 per year. Life insurance companies in this country collect about £5,000,000 per year and these death benefits would only be a very small part of the total business of Irish companies.  In fact, <Col N="1745" /> there are two Irish companies, I was connected with one of them, which add more than £200,000 a year to their business, so it is not a matter of any great importance to them.  According to the Parties opposite we are being forced to do things, if not by the insurance companies, by the Minister for Finance, and if not by the Minister for Finance by the Central Bank.  Therefore, one would be tempted to ask how the Coalition was run.  It was evidently run by people from outside making the Government do things all the time, because the Opposition are obsessed with the idea that we are being made do things all the time by other people. I can assure them, however, that we ourselves do our own business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton brought in contributions in 1948, but I had given the benefits before that.  I could have said to Deputy Norton at the time: &ldquo;The bankers made you do it.  They are always making you do it.&rdquo; If I had said that I would know myself that I was nothing but a common liar.  If he said &ldquo;the bankers and the insurance companies made you do it&rdquo;, he would be a common liar.  I never knew the bankers to suggest that such and such a commodity should be taxed, or that contributions should be increased.  I never heard any such suggestion from them.  That is all imagination, as well as being an undesirable allegation.</P>

This practice is dishonest and wrong, and the £10 grant is being offered by way of paying off these girls.  We will give them the £10 and say: &ldquo;That is the end of it. You are finished with benefits.&rdquo;  It will be well worth giving this grant so as to put an end to this dishonest practice.</P>

      <P>I must say I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the Fine Gael Party.  There is nobody who can deny Fine Gael's record with regard to social welfare.  When they had complete control of the Government, they did not increase any benefit whatever.  When it came to 1932, they had left things as they were in 1922. A statement was made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in 1947.  When we were considering bringing in a scheme, they described it as undesirable, and so on.  It is surprising to hear the members of that Party now finding fault with our scheme because it appears to them not to go far enough.  I did not hear a single Fine Gael Deputy saying that we were going too far.  Indeed, I suppose some of them felt that that was so.  Nevertheless, they all said we were not going far enough.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult, I must say, to understand and to make out what the Fine Gael mind will be on any particular occasion.  They are unpredictable.

      <P>It is very discouraging to a Government and to a Minister to propose a Bill, because, however good the Bill is, it will be opposed by Fine Gael.  If they would show a little discrimination, they might encourage Ministers to do their work even better.</P>
      <P>I think I mentioned already, in connection with this comprehensive scheme, that you cannot do insurance as against assistance except for those who are employed by an employer because it is the only way the contributions can be collected.  I have tried to adhere to the principle where service is needed both by those working for an employer and those who are self-employed but that it should be an assistance scheme such as pensions, children's allowances, and unemployment assistance too, I suppose.  The sickness and unemployment schemes are really for those who are working for an employer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked if I was satisfied with the scheme I brought in. I am not.  I do not think you will ever get a Minister for Social Welfare who is absolutely satisfied with the scheme he brings in.  I think he would always be inclined to do more, if he could.  Therefore, he is doing only what is possible under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be certain amendments as a result of the Budget.  I think I should mention this to give notice of certain amendments that will be introduced. As you know, I have introduced a Children's Allowances Bill. That will be a separate Bill.  However, the increase in the old age pension will be brought in as an amendment to the present Bill and the increase in the case of unemployment assistance will also be brought in.  You have already been told that the increase in the old age pensions is 1/6. That is calculated to cover the increased cost arising from the removal of the food subsidies.  But I could not give the unemployment assistance rates at the moment.  It is a very involved scheme which has to be <Col N="1750" /> simplified as well as giving an increase. In any event, the increase will cover the increased cost and in many cases it will go further.</P>

Let us take the year 1950-51 as the last year of the Coalition régime and compare it with 1953-54 when the new Bill will be in full operation.  The difference between the two years will be £9,250,000.  In other words, Fianna Fáil, in their first two years in office, will have increased social welfare benefits by £9,250,000.</P>

I have often heard Deputy Norton make an extravagant statement but to say that the increased benefits would come from workers' contributions when, in fact, £9,250,000 will be devoted to increased benefits while the workers' contributions will go up by £400,000 is ridiculous.  Just compare the difference between the £400,000 increase in workers' contributions and the total amount of £9,250,000 which will be devoted to increased benefits. That is an example of the type of extravagant statement which Deputy Norton makes&mdash;and he made that statement outside the G.P.O. last Sunday night.  I recommend it as an example of Deputy Norton's veracity and accuracy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton, in the <Col N="1752" /> course of his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This country is the most backward country in Europe from the point of view of social services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>and&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even those behind the Iron Curtain have schemes incalculably better than we have.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said that that statement could not be challenged.  I challenge it.  I say it is not true and I do not know why any Deputy would make such a statement. After all, why should he bring down his own country like that for the sake of a temporary and a small political advantage?  In fact, I will go this far and say that, even if it were true, Deputy Norton should try and hide it rather than shout it from the housetops, as he did.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride in his speech to-day said that one of the arguments used in the Six Counties against union with this part of the country is that there the social services are better than they are here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain Deputies have signified their intention to vote for the amendment.  They ought to know what the amendment will cost.  In so far as I could have it costed by the experts in my Department, it will cost about £2,500,000 rising to £4,000,000.  I presume Deputies are not prepared to knock anything out of the Bill, so that will be another £2,500,000 rising to £4,000,000 from the Exchequer.  If any Deputy thinks that it could be done by <Col N="1755" /> contributions, he can adopt a ready rule-of-thumb method in calculating the cost: 1d. contribution would come to less than £100,000.  It will be seen from that that it is not so easy to finance these things.  I do not know how this amendment will be paid for because we know from our experience last week and the discussions on this Bill that the Opposition Deputies want more benefits but are not prepared to provide the moneys to pay for them.  They even voted against the income-tax, a relief which would confer a benefit on the workers.  They threw that out as well as everything else.</P>
      <P>I was very anxious to find out why there is such very strong opposition to this Bill and I was reading through the debates that took place this time last year because Opposition Deputies have been quoting extensively from the speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies last year.  I admit there was some criticism by us of Deputy Norton's Bill but I think that nearly every Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke did say that the Bill, as far as it went, was all right though they had fault to find with some particulars in it.</P>

      <P>We cannot understand why there is such very strong opposition to this Bill and we cannot understand why it should be stated from a public platform at the G.P.O. that the workers will have to pay for this.  I do not think it is fair to the workers to tell them these stories.  I think they should be told the truth, whatever it may be, and there is no use in the Labour Party adopting these tactics because they will not succeed in deceiving the workers.  It is no use trying to pretend that they are the people who are responsible for bringing in social welfare schemes and that nobody else ever does anything.  They may as well give up that kind of propaganda and go back to their old tactics: Fianna Fáil did it all right, but we made them do it.</P>

      <P>This amendment will cost somewhere between £2,500,000 rising to £4,000,000.  It will have to be paid for, and the Deputies in the Fine Gael Benches, who so airily vote for things of this kind, should keep in mind that these benefits must be paid for and give us their suggestions as to the way in which they think they should be paid for.</P>
      <P>It was given as an excuse for Deputy Norton because he delayed so long in bringing in his social welfare scheme that he had to bring in a Bill to cover old age pensions increases in his first year in office.  I must admit that it gives me a certain amount of pride in myself, considering that it took Deputy Norton three and a half years to add £1,500,000 to social welfare, that we in our first year in office can add £9,250,000.</P>

      <P>I do not know what may be the explanation of the very strong opposition to the Bill unless it is that the Opposition Deputies feel that it will be very bad for them with certain sections of the community to let Fianna Fáil get away with it, as it were.  I have been sitting here for practically four days and the Opposition Deputies have taken it out of me. They have shown very strong hostility to this particular measure.  We were accused of trying to rush this Bill.  We discussed it here for four weary days and we said we could sit this week for the Second Reading.  We did not rush it on our side.  We were quite prepared to sit two days this week if necessary.  We want to give everybody time but, at the same time, we want to get the Second Stage through because we want the Committee Stage after Easter.  We must do that in order to have the Bill in operation before July and we must have time for the Committee, Report and Final Stages and for the Seanad to consider it.  There has been no rushing and I think it is unfair criticism to say that we tried to rush it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy who spoke wants extra benefits.  No Deputy was prepared to <Col N="1757" /> tell us where we would find the money to provide these benefits, and they would probably oppose us if we tried to provide the money.  They have done that in the past and I am quite sure they would do it again.  I have been here for four days with this Bill and I think the Opposition are in a bad mood.  They are in a bad humour. They want a holiday.  I hope when we resume after Easter they will be in better health and better spirits.</P>
