    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was drawing attention to a statement the Minister made in the Seanad on the sale of local authority houses, and trying to relate that statement to the preparation of purchase schemes by local authorities.  Members and officials of local authorities, while they are anxious for the co-operation of the tenants, are faced with many problems in preparing their schemes.  I believe that the Minister would do well to give suggestions to local authorities.  I have no intention of going into a matter which we cannot claim to have discussed on this Estimate, but we do know that the existing purchase Act leaves us in grave doubt in many respects.  I may recall without going into detail the instance I mentioned last night While on the one hand we ask tenants to purchase their houses from the local authority, we have on the other hand such interesting cases as this: a tenant of an old local authority cottage, a kitchen and two rooms, has purchased his cottage under <Col N="1665" /> the Act; a son of his with that son's wife and three children occupy one room; the local county medical officer decides that under the heading of overcrowding the son is eligible for a cottage of his own from the local authority.</P>
      <P>That was agreed to, and the son went into occupation of his own cottage.  Then the old man, believing that, under the Purchase Act, he was entitled to sell, offered his cottage for sale.  We believed that that could be done under certain circumstances.  It seems extraordinary, then, that the county manager, believing that the powers vested in him warranted such action, should decide that the tenant was not entitled to sell.  However, that is beside the point at the moment. Instead of adopting some reasonable measure, he proceeded in court, not against the old man, but against the son, and claimed possession of the newly-given cottage.  That new cottage had been given on the advice of the county medical officer and on the responsibility of the county manager himself.  Apparently they considered they were entitled to prevent the sale of an old purchase cottage by moving in court for the eviction of the son from his newly-given cottage.  If we are interested in getting tenants to purchase their cottages, some other attitude must be adopted.  Local authorities are now preparing purchase schemes which will eventually be submitted to the Minister.  Instead of waiting until they are submitted, however, and then referring them back, it would be more appropriate if the Minister would now send them, not directions, but advice, which would help them to expedite the preparation of those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an everyday complaint&mdash;and people are justified in making it&mdash;that there are too many Acts in connection with local government.  Even local officials and members of local authorities who want to inquire into any given subject find that the Act they refer to is tied up with another score of Acts.  In the last few years a sum has been included in this Estimate each year for the preparation of a textbook on local government law.  Surely <Col N="1666" /> the time has arrived when that textbook should be in the hands of local officials and others anxious to work within the law to get certain work carried out.  The publication of that text-book is long overdue.  It should be in the hands of all local officials at the earliest possible moment.  It is not within the last 12 months alone that this has been pointed out; it has been brought up over the last few years.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this point and see that something is done about it.</P>
    <P>Another item of vital importance in every rural area, as well as in cities and towns, is provision for fire-fighting. As the Minister's predecessor mentioned in his time, it is most important that local authorities should treat this question with the seriousness it deserves.  It is only on rare occasions that we have disastrous fires, but local authorities should be told, through the Minister, that preparation to meet any such event is a matter of urgency.  My colleague, Deputy Tom Kyne, raised this matter here by a parliamentary question, drawing attention to the absence of protection in hotels in case of fire.  We were given to understand in reply to the question that it was a matter for local authorities.  Now, if so, it also must be a matter for the Minister and he should draw the attention of local authorities to the fact that where hotels have not proper facilities available in case of fire the lives of their guests are not safe and proper precautions should be taken. The Minister should ask local authorities to insist that all hotels within their jurisdiction provide any necessary equipment for this purpose.</P>
    <P>We now come to another part of the Minister's statement in introducing this Estimate, the part dealing with housing in the Cork Borough area.  The Minister stated that less than 10 per cent. of the programme was completed by March 1951, that is, a total of 332 houses; yet he stated that he was quite satisfied with the progress since his period of office began, because up to the 31st May, 1952, 644 houses were completed.  Of course, to commence with, if we are <Col N="1667" /> to take into consideration the number of houses completed by the 31st May, we must assume that those 644 were constructed, not in 12 months but in a period of 14 months.  He also mentioned that there are 495 houses in course of construction or in progress. The view I get of the Minister's statement is that he is satisfied with the progress made by the housing authority in Cork City.  I can tell the Minister that generally the people are not satisfied with the progress. Not being a member of that local authority, I have no desire whatsoever to try to place responsibility on the members of the corporation if the responsibility is not theirs.  I cannot say whether the members of the local authority, have pulled their weight or not and therefore I do not wish to criticise their actions.</P>
    <P>While, according to the Minister's statement, very little satisfaction was being shown in the Cork Borough area up to the time of his advent to office, it is well to remember that his predecessor, in 1948, was also faced with a grave and difficult problem in Cork Borough area in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>A member of the Minister's Party, who is as interested in the housing problem in Cork City as any Deputy, went so far as to state in July, 1948, when we were discussing the Estimate for Local Government, that there was no site available in Cork City on which to build houses at that time. He stated, I believe correctly, that they were preparing a site at Ballyphehane, with a view to building on it, but he mentioned that, unfortunately, it was being held up for this sanction and that sanction.  He clearly stated, as can be seen from the Dáil Debates of July, 1948, that no blame could be placed on the local officials concerned because it was the withholding of sanction prior to 1948 that held up building in Cork City.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of discussing the merits or demerits of the case so far as the members of the corporation are concerned, but we cannot say that satisfactory progress is being made in the building of houses in Cork City.</P>
    <P>A woman told me a week or two ago <Col N="1668" /> that she was pleased, after being ten long years on a waiting list, that she was getting a house.  That woman has four children, including a boy of ten, and they were all living in one room. That woman has succeeded in getting her house after ten years, but what of the large number of families in that city who are still waiting?  Some of them are giving up hope of getting a house. Instead of being satisfied with the progress in housing in Cork City, we should devote every ounce of energy to building houses for those who require them there.</P>
    <P>We know of the long waiting list in the offices of the Cork Corporation.  I appreciate that for the members who represent Cork City and the members of the corporation, the problem is much greater than it is for those outside the city, because they have to meet day-to-day complaints of prospective tenants and their repeated pleas for housing.</P>
    <P>We need in Cork City in any year at least twice the number of houses mentioned by the Minister.  In rural areas, facing much graver difficulties in the matter of sites and other items, we are showing much better results. The necessity to speed up the building of houses in the Cork Borough area should not be overlooked.  While the Minister, naturally, is satisfied that progresss is being made and while we are all pleased to see houses being built, it must be admitted that much greater progress is required in this important feature of the lives of people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should relate this matter to the views expressed by members of this House a few years back.  Thanks be to God, the prophecy of a prominent member of this House, in 1948, that he was prepared to bet that when his successor retired from office there would be as many homeless as there were then, has been proved, in many respects, in rural areas, completely incorrect.  The views expressed by Deputy MacEntee, in July, 1948, have proved incorrect so far as we are concerned in rural areas.  We can take pride in the fact that the work done by the inter-Party Government, particularly by the Labour Minister for <Col N="1669" /> Local Government, has given hope to those who for so many years were living in tenements and in slumland, people who almost despaired of getting a home.  We want a continuation of that policy.  Within the last 12 months, as many Deputies have mentioned, delays have been noticeable in building. That should not be allowed to continue. Housing should continue at full swing and we should aim at a higher target each year than an average of 7,000.</P>
    <P>People, both in city and country areas, are faced with another great problem.  In reply to parliamentary questions, both the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance said that they have no direct connection with this matter.  It was then raised with managers of local authorities, who said it was not their responsibility.  I am referring to the increase in rates as a result of improvements to premises.  According to the terms of their employment, rate collectors must submit reports when city or rural dwellers, who wish to keep their premises in a decent condition, carry out some repairs.  The result of the reports is that there is an immediate rise in the rates.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government have informed us that the question is outside their jurisdiction, and the same holds good for managers of local authorities. Surely somebody must accept responsibility, and the Minister for Local Government should clarify the position.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my notice that valuations have been increased even when no improvements have been carried out.  People have to provide money for the rates at all costs, and I consider it very unfair that they should be subjected to a repetition of the rack renting system carried out by the landlords in bygone years.  The rates are increased if people improve their premises.  I believe the reverse should be the case, and that a rebate of rates should be allowed to them to compensate them for carrying out improvements. We are aware that this is a matter which cannot be remedied immediately, but I would suggest to the Minister that he should at least tell us with whom the responsibility <Col N="1670" /> lies.  I assure him that the members of the local authorities are determined to follow up this matter until they can pin the responsibility on somebody.</P>
    <P>As I stated last night, our housing problems, from start to finish, are tied up with this question of finance.  Local authorities are saddled with a heavy burden by allocating out of the rates a certain amount of money to meet housing costs.  It would be well, even at this late stage, if the Minister investigated a minority report submitted a few years back, which suggested that money for housing and national development generally should be free of interest.  We should reach the stage when it would not be necessary for any member of any Party in this Assembly to draw attention to increased interest rates on loans for these important matters.  This problem will have to be faced eventually; the sooner we tackle it the better, both for the central Government and for the local administration.</P>
    <P>I now wish to draw attention to another important matter of direct concern to local authorities.  I am sorry to say that it is again necessary for me to repeat the complaint about the delay in giving sanction to local authorities to commence water and sewerage schemes.  Time and time again members of this House have had to draw attention to the fact that, in their own particular areas, local authorities have had to wait for long periods before they could get sanction from the Department to carry out these important schemes.  It is very often our experience when we inquire at local authority offices about certain water and sewerage schemes to find that the schemes have been sent up to the Department for approval.  After a while, we learn that a reply has come back suggesting certain changes and improvements. Local authority engineering staff must then examine the scheme again and carry out suggested improvements.</P>
    <P>The project is then sent back to the Department, and after another time lag it is sent to the local authority office again with more suggestions. What is the point in our local authorities paying engineers and qualified <Col N="1671" /> architects?  The Minister and his Department seem to have adopted an extraordinary attitude towards these professional men.  In my view, it is totally unjust that a Department of State should keep a scheme going back and forth between itself and a local authority office recommending trivial changes the meanwhile.  Each one of these trivial improvements delays a scheme by at least a period of three to six months.  We would like the examination of these schemes to be expedited.  This delay has not been created since the present Minister took office.  It is one that has been in existence for a long period, and it has been discussed on all sides of the House, year after year.  We consider that we have a right to draw attention to the fact.  Local authorities are of primary importance to the Department of Local Government, and the sooner the system of sending schemes back and forth, for trivial improvements, is abolished the better.</P>
    <P>A few years ago members of the Minister's Party drew attention to the fact that the committee set up to investigate piped water supplies had been abolished.  I could not say if the Minister himself mentioned that fact. Perhaps the members of his Party considered they were justified in so doing.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are in connection with this project.  In my view we have too many of these committees; we have too many of these commissions investigating matters.  The reports&mdash;if they are good ones&mdash;of these commissions will probably not be put into operation for 50 years.</P>
    <P>We have our difficulties in the local authorities when we discuss questions relating to piped water supplies and public pumps.  If we can get over our immediate problems, which are of greater concern to us than a general report dealing with piped water supplies all over the country, it would be much more advantageous and beneficial to the people concerned.  It would be much better than a report from any committee that may be called in the future to examine and report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> I can appreciate that financial difficulties are the greatest problems in connection with the provision of public pumps.  Local authorities are assisted, through the Local Loans Fund, to provide public pumps, but I should like to ask the Minister to help the local authorities to a greater extent in connection with the provision of money for public pumps.  All of us who are trying to do our best in the administrative areas in which we work know that it costs an average of £220 to £230 to bore and sink public pumps. Naturally that involves a large amount of money, having regard to the necessity for providing hundreds of pumps throughout a particular administrative area.  It would be of great importance were the Minister to come to the assistance of the local authority to a greater degree than at present in helping to have this matter attended to.  Such assistance would automatically assist local authorities from the point of view of their own finances.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters upon which I wish to touch briefly.  Unlike some other Deputies who find themselves in opposition, I am not shouting for increased grants for this, that and the other thing.  We ought to realise the responsibilities and the difficulties which confront any Minister or any Government.  It should be possible, even in the immediate future, to provide local authorities with increased grants.  Even where loans are available, grants should be given to local authorities in connection with such matters, matters which are of vital importance to small towns and villages, as the provision of public conveniences. Money seems to be the difficulty there. If we are to make any advancement in regard to local government, if we are to give facilities and amenities to local authorities which they, in turn, will pass on to the various areas under their charge, it would be well if we could devise some means of coming to the aid of these local authorities.  In that way we would improve the standards throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of great importance, a matter which has a direct bearing on administration in Cork County.  I believe this equally affects other counties on the sea coast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> The Cork County Council considered the necessity of employing life guards at their seaside resorts.  After all, not a year passes and not a summer leaves us without there being an account in the local papers about some life having been lost in an unfortunate bathing accident.  Cork County Council took cognisance of that position even though the provision of life guards would mean an extra burden on their financial resources.  They considered it essential to employ these qualified life guards.  A grant towards this important work would not mean a very large amount of money.  It can hardly be said that such people will be needed in the Midlands nor can it be said that the number of life guards who may be employed will be large. I, therefore, consider that it would be a great help to local authorities if the central authority came to their aid by giving a grant each year towards this important work.</P>
    <P>I know that other Deputies&mdash;especially Deputy Corry&mdash;are anxious to participate in this debate.  I will not keep them much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the question of housing and such matters and go on to the problems facing us in connection with the roads.  I have tried, in my own way, to make it clear that our approach to local government affairs is somewhat different from the approach of the member who said in this House on the 5th July, 1950, at column 697, Official Reports, dated 5th July, 1950:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I shall leave a more detailed criticism of the administration of the Department to other Deputies who may wish to participate in the debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement was made by the present Minister for Finance when he was in opposition.  In speaking on this debate, we are attempting at any rate to draw attention to matters that we consider are of primary importance to our people.  Neither the Minister nor anybody else can suggest that we are doing that for ulterior purposes. We are doing it simply because we <Col N="1674" /> realise our responsibilities to the people who want these matters investigated.</P>
    <P>There are many problems confronting us in connection with our roads.  These problems seem to be increasing instead of diminishing year after year.  I cannot now, no more than I did in the past, adopt the same line of approach of the Deputy who was so anxious to come in on this discussion.  I am not saying that the Road Fund is an inexhaustible source of revenue which can be placed at the disposal of local authorities to carry out all the improvements suggested by members and officials.  In spite of the improved financial position in regard to the Road Fund, we must admit that if that money was apportioned to the administrative areas in our Twenty-Six Counties it would not go very far towards solving our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Before coming to this question of the roads, I should like to say that I deeply regret the fact that the amount of money being expended this year in important work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been reduced. There is no use crying about spilt milk, but if we are to criticise, we must be prepared to extend that criticism to everyone to whom responsibility can be attached.</P>
    <P>As reported in column 687 of the Official Reports for 5th July, 1950, in a discussion on the Vote for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee as he then was, referring to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, said: &ldquo;But there is something more than spending money merely in order to get thousands of schemes under way and tens of thousands of men employed&rdquo;, although at an earlier period when that Act was going through the House he said that it would give little or no employment. I consider that that statement of his was a reflection on the engineers employed by local authorities, and Deputies who are members of local authorities can refute that charge.  We can say that these improvement works have certainly given more satisfaction than even the most optimistic of us hoped for.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the money provided for schemes under this Act should be reduced to any extent.  After all, we <Col N="1675" /> cannot yet say that the works which were being so ably attended to under this Act have been completed.  Many of them have been completed, but many of them still remain to be attended to.  I have a suspicion that the work under this Act is not alone being cut down this year but that it is on the road to complete oblivion.  There is no use in saying that these projects which are giving satisfactory returns should not be continued.  We should not say, as the then Deputy MacEntee said, that much of this money was misspent in order to gain political kudos. If he were correct in that statement, surely it must have applied to members of his own Party, because I know members of his Party in County Cork who, like myself, have taken pride in the improvement works which have been carried out under that Act.  I must say, in justice to these members of his Party, that I have never yet heard them trying to claim political kudos for the works executed, any more than I have.  It is fantastic that we should now be placed in the position of having that work reduced because it may be considered that some Deputies are looking for political kudos.</P>
    <P>As reported in column 688 of the Official Reports of the same day, the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, said: &ldquo;Public money should only be spent if the results of that expenditure, in terms of the executed work, justify it.&rdquo;  I suppose it is a case of the end justifying the means.  Surely no Deputy can say, even before the works have been commenced, that public money should only be spent if the results of that expenditure, in terms of the executed work, justify it.  Surely we must see the results before we arrive at an honest and just decision as to whether these schemes are giving the return we had hoped for.  In my opinion, these statements have a direct bearing on the fact that we are now faced with a reduction in the money being provided under that heading.</P>
    <P>The present Minister and members of his Party stated a few years ago that they believed that the Minister for <Col N="1676" /> Local Government in the 1948-49 period was anxious to get as much money for the upkeep of the roads as possible, and that they considered it was the hand of the Minister for Finance that was tying up the purse strings.  If they believed that, we are entitled to say with regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act that we consider that the same approach is now being made in connection with this matter, in view of the statements made by the present Minister for Finance when in opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputies may say that under the present Administration road grants have been increased.  That is so.  They may even go so far as to say that the increase in the road grants makes up for the reduction in the amount provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If, in 1948, when they drew attention to the robbing, as they called it, of about £2,000,000 from the Road Fund, they considered that that money was being taken unjustly from the Road Fund, and that more money should have been given for the roads, why is it that now, when the responsibility is theirs, an increased amount of money has not been given to the roads?  If they believed in their own statements at that time, instead of giving the increase which they have given from the Road Fund for the upkeep of the roads, they should have at least trebled the amount.</P>
    <P>At that period I knew that the Road Fund could not continue to provide the amount which we would wish, and I say that this problem must be faced from a different angle perhaps.  The only point on which I differ with other members of local authorities is with regard to finance for road works.  I find no great pleasure as a member of a local authority in saying that members of local authorities, certainly in my county, have a somewhat conservative outlook.  The problem is a grave one, but it must be faced ultimately.</P>
    <P>The longer we let it go on without facing it the greater the problem will be.  Members may say that we have no suggestions to make in regard to it. I shall not deal with the suggestion which I made in my own county, nor the statements made by members <Col N="1677" /> opposing me, because they knew that the statements made were not correct. They knew that the important matter as far as we are concerned is to keep down the rates.  In order to justify opposition to any proposed scheme it is unfair for members to take out of its context any statement regarding the amount of money and the responsibility of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest to the Minister that the proposed five-year plan which we are hearing about and which is now going into operation will not help to solve our problem in Cork to any extent.  In Cork, we have up to 7,000 miles of county roads and 1,700 miles of main roads.  The five-year plan, no matter what way we tackle it, will not give us the results which we are anxious to get.  The task is so enormous that we must be prepared to throw all our weight into the solution of this problem.  At this stage we are asking for advice from the Minister and his Department as to how we can, without placing an undue burden on the ratepayers, deal with this very great problem.  Whether this is a long-term or a short-term problem we want to surmount it, and we surely are entitled to ask the Minister and his Department for any information at their disposal to help us to try to solve it.</P>
    <P>We have heard mentioned in debates on this Estimate on different occasions the question of the use of stone, quarried locally, for various purposes. We have come to the point, apparently, in the history of local government when anything produced locally cannot be considered satisfactory.  I should like to point out a fact known to other Deputies in my county that the majority of our roads&mdash;and I am speaking of our good roads, not the bad ones&mdash;have a foundation of stone from local quarries.  No complaint was made at the time these roads were made about the quality of this stone.  Now it appears that we have advanced so much that a stone analysis must be carried out to test the quality of the stone, to ascertain, against the records of all time, whether the stone in local quarries is of suitable standard.  The rejection of stone locally quarried as <Col N="1678" /> material suitable for public works means that there is a lowering of the number of men employed in local quarries.  Many of us can recall that some years back a large number of men found constant work in these quarries.  The fact that the contract for the supply of necessary materials for the upkeep of the roads is now very often confined to a few individuals is but another indication of the extent to which centralisation has been carried on in recent years.  When we consider the large amount of money involved, we surely are entitled to question the whole procedure inasmuch as we are not satisfied that it has ever been proved satisfactorily that local stone is not of a quality suitable for this important work.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which affects not alone Cork but every county in the country.  I recall a statement in that connection, made a few years ago during the period of office of the inter-Party Government, by Deputy Burke, of County Dublin.  In that statement he called attention, and I think he was justified in doing so, to the fact that apparently the time had arrived in County Dublin when local stone could not be considered as suitable material. We do not wish to be too parochial in our outlook but we do say that an obligation should be placed on the central authorities to insist that local stone will, as far as possible, be used and that local quarries will be kept working so that the people engaged in this work will be assured of continuous employment.</P>
    <P>Another problem with which local authorities are greatly concerned is that of car parking and the question of motor taxation.  It would be well, even at this stage, if we could get a directive from the Minister or his Department, by way, for instance, of suggestions to mitigate the difficulties attendant on the problem of car parking on both sides of the streets in towns. Another matter which the Minister might consider, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, is the question of ensuring the sobriety of drivers of motor vehicles.  Coupled with that, he might discuss with his colleague the question of speed limits in our cities, <Col N="1679" /> towns and villages.  There is no security of life at present in many of our villages due to the fact that many motorists drive at a rate of from 40 to 50 miles an hour through these villages.  I hope that the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Justice will soon arrive at a decision with regard to these matters.  A request was sent by the Cork County Council to the Department some considerable time ago asking for an inquiry into the question of speed limits in our towns and villages.  We should like to see that request dealt with within a reasonable time.  We do not wish to have it merely stored in some corner of the Custom House for the next few years.  It is a pressing problem but one which can be solved if we have the will to find a solution.</P>
    <P>Some time ago by way of parliamentary question I drew attention to the problem of motor taxation charges. When we remember that it is the employees of local authorities that are concerned with the administration of these matters, I consider that is totally unjust and unfair that such heavy charges are made on lorry owners or car owners, if a vehicle is taxed for part of the year.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government would not be responsible for the taxation of cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done through the local authorities.  I do not wish at any time to question the ruling of the Chair but the question which I put down in this matter previously was answered by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am simply saying that I would appreciate it if the Minister would have the matter investigated.  Whereas it costs a lorry owner something like £44 or £45 to tax his lorry for the year, if it is not within his financial resources to pay that amount all in one sum, and he wishes to have the lorry taxed by the quarter, he will have to pay £10 or £11 more.  The same applies in the case of cars.  I consider that that is a matter which should be investigated with a view to <Col N="1680" /> having the position remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Many members have mentioned, and I suppose will continue to mention, the question of the allocation of grants for roads.  The method by which these grants are made available has not been made clear.  I speak not only of the grants given to County Cork.  The suggestion which I am making will not make much difference to Cork but it could, and should, make a big difference to other counties such as Leitrim and Donegal I believe that we should be prepared, first of all, to take into consideration not only the total road mileage of each county, but the valuation of it as well.  By dividing its total valuation into its total mileage, we can then see to what extent the ratepayers of that county are being handicapped as regards the amount of money that is made available to it.</P>
    <P>I believe that some counties have, so to speak, been getting away with this for many years past.  You have small counties near Dublin with a small mileage of road and high valuations. These high valuations mean, naturally, that the circumstances under which their inhabitants are living are altogether different from those that obtain in the counties where the valuations are low.  In the case of the latter, the holdings of the people are small and the land is poor in quality. I therefore suggest that the time has arrived when counties such as Leitrim and Donegal should be getting a higher percentage of road grants than some of the other counties where valuations are high.  The situation amounts to this, that under the present system there is no hope that the roads in the counties with low valuations can be improved because, in my opinion, a just share of the road grants is not being made available to them.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing I have to say in connection with the roads, and I believe that the present Minister must take on himself full responsibility for it.  Some time ago a request was sent up from a local authority for sanction to an increase of 6/- a week, or 1/- a day, for the carters employed on the roads.  That request was sent forward only after the <Col N="1681" /> county manager had gone into the matter in great detail, and had received the views of his county and deputy surveyors.  It is an extraordinary fact that the brains in the Custom House under the control of the Minister should think it suitable to send back that request and ask why it should be made.  The request was for a 1/- per day more for the carters, cottiers with an acre of land who find it so hard under present conditions to feed a horse and keep him on the road, and for small landowners, men with a few acres of land who also get employment as carters.  Apparently, the position is that the administrative staff in the Custom House, assembled under the Minister, do not consider it correct for a county manager of high repute to make such a request.  It is well known that he never makes any request unless he has a very good reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our system of local government that such a request should be refused almost immediately it is sent up.  It is a continuation of the policy of ignoring the requests of local authorities and of driving people out of employment in rural areas.  It represents, too, the total ignoring of requests made either by local officials or by members of local authorities.  We may get poor satisfaction&mdash;I do not mind&mdash;by raising the matter here.  We may get poor results from doing so and be told that certain parties are interested in road workers and carters.  I suppose I would be a fool to expect that this request will be considered, or that the present Minister would even think of having such a matter investigated, especially when the investigation would mean nothing more than a request concerning carters in the County Cork.  Time, I think, will prove again that the policy of 2d. per day increase in the past, and the present refusal of 1/- per day increase to carters, means that local government is coming to a period of crisis in this country, when even county managers will be made the slaves, willing or otherwise, of the dictatorship of the Custom House.</P>
    <P>It has frequently been said throughout the country that many people <Col N="1682" /> refuse to go forward for membership of local bodies because such little power is vested in them, and when they realise that the smallest matter which comes before a local authority has to be sent to Dublin for sanction.  If the Minister and his staff in the Custom House were prepared to give the same co-operation to local authorities as the local staffs give to the members of the local authorities there could, I believe, be some results achieved in trying to improve local authority work in the country.  We could then hope to see improved conditions in local areas.  We can never hope for that, however, when requests dealing with the smallest matters have to be sent up here to be checked by officials.</P>
    <P>I am in doubt as to why it is necessary to have so many officials in certain state Departments.  I am not going to say that any of them are sponging or idle, but I believe that many of them could easily be transferred and employed on national work in other Departments if the Minister would agree to give to local authorities the responsibilities which they have been asking for.  The present policy is certainly not to the advantage of the local areas.  I refer, in particular, to the policy of refusing permission to a county manager to promote local authority officials.  We hear a good deal about various appointments having to go before the Local Appointments Commission contrary to the views of officials such as a county manager and the county and deputy surveyors.  These men know the capabilities of the officials whom they would be prepared to recommend for promotion to higher positions of trust when they become vacant.  It is because of that knowledge that they would be prepared to recommend them for promotion.  I consider that the less we hear of the Local Appointments Commission the better for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I want to refer to.  I would not draw attention to it were it not for the importance and seriousness of it.  I believe every man and woman in this country is entitled to his or her views on any matter, be <Col N="1683" /> it political or otherwise.  Not for one moment would I suggest that a man, because of his particular type of employment, should not be free in this democratic country to express his views, within reasonable limits.  We are aware that men in certain types of Government employment must be careful about what they say.  I recognise their right to whatever political views they may hold.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say, however, that a man who is not a minor official nor a secretary of a Department nor a secretary of a section, but at the same time a prominent official connected with local government, has thought it suitable on certain occasions to attack the reputation of a man who is no longer able to defend himself.  It is possible that the official forgot himself owing to certain circumstances.  I have no objection if that official sees fit to attack members of the Party to which I belong, including myself.  I do not know the official concerned, and I have heard of him only recently.  However, I can answer for myself.  It is a serious matter if a prominent official of the establishment section of Local Government finds it suitable to attack and slander the name of the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, who was, at the time of his death, Minister for Local Government.  If that official wishes to continue those attacks, or if they are made simply because on certain occasions he may be worshipping Bacchus, I will demand a full investigation into the matter.  The late Deputy Murphy cannot answer for himself, but so long as some of us have the breath of life in our bodies we will answer for him and, should the attacks continue, we shall ask the Minister to have the matter investigated.  I regret that I have had to mention this matter. That official is, however, in the section which deals with staffs throughout the country.  Having mentioned it briefly, I hope that that official will realise that he has made a mistake.  I trust that this matter will not have to be mentioned again, but, if it should, I will go all the way to have it investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of a local authority I have succeeded in getting 20 motions on the agenda through at <Col N="1684" /> every meeting, with Deputy Desmond as a member of that local authority.  I think that, having listened to Deputy Desmond for the past three days, the House will now realise the feats I have accomplished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond dealt with housing I thank no Minister of any Party for the position of housing in this State to-day.  I am glad Deputy Davin is present, because Deputy Davin was in this House when his present allies, from these benches, made a solemn statement that they were not going to look after rural housing.</P>
      <P>It was only when Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, as Minister for Local Government&mdash;I am glad to say that he is now the first citizen of this State, and he deserves it&mdash;started to prepare a decent rural housing scheme for this country that housing went ahead. Every Minister who followed him in that Department only followed in his footsteps.  Some of them were pretty good and more of them were fairly bad. From the moment that that line was taken by Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly in his capacity of Minister for Local Government, housing in this country depended practically altogether on the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing in any area is the direct responsibility of the local authority. Whether the housing schemes are good or bad and whether or not the work is proceeding at a satisfactory speed, the local authority is partly responsible. The only thing that Governments and Ministers have succeeded in doing&mdash; particularly during the régime of the inter-Party Government&mdash;was to saddle the ratepayers with a larger burden in respect of the financing of housing in this State.  That is the only thing the inter-Party Government succeeded in doing during their period of office. Consider the loans for housing and the new scheme of grants for housing. How many people realise that the majority of the individuals who benefit by these schemes are far better off, financially, than the ratepayers who have to pay the piper?  I remember a scare and tally-ho by Deputy Desmond recently in my board of health area. We had got some houses built and the <Col N="1685" /> people were living in them.  What was the next move?  If you do not mind, the rents were too high.  We had to have an investigation into the means of the gentlemen whose rents were too high. Here is what we found.  The worst-off person had £6 10s. a week and 75 per cent. of them were drawing between £15 and £21 a week.  Those are the people whom the ratepayers and the unfortunate farmers in Watergrass Hill must subsidise to keep their houses at a low rent.  There is too much of this game.  I do not know where the training for it came from but it did not come from inside this State.  The training that I have seen worked out to a fine art by some members of local authorities at the present day did not come from inside this State.  The first move is to get the houses built.  The second move is: &ldquo;Keep the pressure on now and we will get the houses for nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, in the course of his speech, mentioned the purchase of labourers' cottages and purchase schemes.  The present Minister for Local Government acted as chairman of a committee of which I was a member dealing with the purchase of labourers' cottages.  That scheme was prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government and it was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was designed to put the labourer in possession of his house and his acre as independently as the farmer on his farm.  Why was that scheme not a success in my county, at any rate?</P>
    <P>You can directly place responsibility for the failure of that scheme and responsibility for the fact that so many labourers in my constituency had not purchased and are not the owners of their houses on the Labour representatives in the Cork County Council and the Labour representatives of Cork in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>That is absolutely true, and carried on that way for the sole reason that Labour feared that the ordinary labourer in the country would become too independent if he became the owner of his own house.  I speak with a certain amount of pride as being chairman of a local authority which has done more in the line of housing than any other local authority in the State, taking population on both sides into consideration.  The only barrier I, as chairman, placed on my members was: &ldquo;Go out and, every man who requires a house, bring his name and address in here; as soon as we have him vetted by the doctor we will build the house for him.&rdquo;  It did not matter what Government was there.  No Government that ever existed had anything to do with it.</P>
      <P>We carried on with scheme after scheme and it did not matter what Minister was there to open them up or close them, the schemes went ahead just the same.  My only complaint in connection with housing is the burden that is being thrown on local authorities by the State in those matters.</P>
      <P>There were other statements made here in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and we had quite a stream of speakers lining out from Deputy Sweetman down.  We had Deputy Sweetman speaking on this Estimate on the 8th July&mdash;column 362, Volume 133 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the reductions which will be considered by many Deputies on this side as being a very unfortunate reduction and an unfair reduction, is that being made in the Local Authorities (Works) Act allocation.  The reduction, as the Minister indicated, is £570,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on and returned to it again to tell us the amount of trouble that was involved.  He was very ably followed up by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Keyes, who said at column 378 of the same Volume:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I deplore the slashing of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The cut of £570,000 is a very drastic one. It almost looks as if the Government is anxious to put the Act out of operation altogether.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was followed up again by my friend <Col N="1687" /> Deputy Desmond, who attacked us and said it was due to the influence of Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Finance, who hated this Local Authorities (Works) Act, that the slashing was done.  Then we come back and we consider the angels themselves when they were here, and it even went as far as the last hour that they sat here, or at least the last day, for on 2nd May, 1951&mdash;column 1900, Volume 125 of the Official Debates&mdash;Deputy McGilligan, speaking on the Budget and accounting for his cuts, told us that local authorities' drainage expenditure was now estimated at £1,220,000: &ldquo;The more urgent work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has now been completed, and this accounts partly for the lower provision this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes when he was Minister for Local Government sat as mute as a mouse while Deputy McGilligan was slashing £570,000 off the Local Authorities (Works) Act in 1951.  He sat as mute as a mouse and there was not a word from him, when he was told that the more urgent work had been done and that in regard to what was left to be done, anything that could be spared would be thrown into it.  Deputy McGilligan slashed the amount by £570,000, and then the Opposition come along and complain because there is a further reduction this year.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction this year. There was a change and a very big change.  For three years the roads of this country were robbed of £2,000,000 a year in grants.  They were deliberately robbed.  Then we hear Deputy Desmond coming along pleading and talking about grants and looking for money.  It is very easy for the old spendthrift who has gone and put the last blanket on the old bit of land and raised the last bob that could be raised from the Jew or the moneylender in mortgage to come along to his successor who comes in to find the cupboard bare and say: &ldquo;Why not give more grants.&rdquo; Surely when they were borrowing so much there was no necessity for slashing the road grants or for taking that £2,000,000 a year off the roads.  I have a totally different viewpoint on roads from that of Deputy Desmond.  I believe that the State has responsibility just as the man who <Col N="1688" /> might come along and do damage by trespassing on my land and have to pay for that damage.  I am sorry that I have not got the latest figures.  May I point out that the yield in petrol taxation went up from £782,000 in 1944-45 to £3,078,000 on 31st January 1951; for 1949-50, which was the last complete year the figure was £3,213,000. Receipts for customs and excise duties on motor cars and the parts thereof coming into this country went up from £25,000 in 1945 to £1,089,000 in 1949.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in the revenue collected through the medium of motor taxation, and that increase is represented by the difference between £620,000 collected in 1944-45 and £2,600,000 in 1949-50.  One cannot have that increase in motor taxation and petrol taxation unless there is more taxable traffic on the roads.  If there is more traffic on the roads then more damage is being done to the roads. The roads are the property of the local authorities.  The State is drawing increased revenue for the extra damage that is being done to the tune of something around £7,000,000 this year, as compared with 1944-45.  The question is whether or not that £7,000,000 in revenue should be turned in by the State for the purpose of paying for the extra damage that is being done to the roads.</P>

      <P>The self-same argument that I put up two years ago I am putting up now.  Extra damage is being done to the roads which are the property of the local authorities because of the extra motor traffic. The State is drawing increased revenue out of that motor traffic.  This Government is proceeding on the same lines as the previous Government, namely, borrow, borrow, borrow.  We will soon come to the time when the roads will no longer be fit for motor traffic.  I have taken the line in the county council&mdash;it is one for which I am not a bit sorry and one that I shall continue to follow&mdash;that I will not ask the ratepayers to put their hands in their pockets and pay for the extra damage done to the roads because they get no extra benefit from the increased revenue drawn by the State.  That increased revenue is put to other uses. That is my attitude.  I make no apology for it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Higgins pulled in with a tractor into one of my fields and started digging it up and Deputy Madden had to come along subsequently and pay for the damage, the position would be analogous to that in which the ratepaying users of the roads now find themselves. Damage is being done to the roads by the increased motor traffic.  The local authority do not get any of the increased revenue that accrues from that traffic.  The State gets it.  It is not <Col N="1690" /> passed back to the local authorities. That is my grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1944-45 £782,000 was collected in petrol taxation.  In 1949-50 £3,213,000 was collected.  If Deputy Madden can show me where one penny of that extra revenue went into the roads, then we can talk business.  The revenue from that taxation has increased since 1950 by at least another £2,000,000 a year.  There is £2,000,000 more damage being done to our roads, Yet the poor man with the donkey and cart or the horse and butt on the side of the mountain has to pay his rates for the upkeep of the roads to facilitate the motorists.  It is flagrant robbery by the State from the local authority. Whilst I am in this House and so long as I remain a public representative outside I will endeavour to see that the local authority and the ratepayer will not be called upon to pay the piper even if there are potholes big enough to bury a man in on our roads.  Whilst the present Minister took a pretty brave step in increasing the road grants this year considering the position of our finances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry will speak, no matter who interrupts, I promise you.  That is the case I want to make in connection with roads.  I expected from the representatives of local authorities in this House better support, support to which we, as representatives of ratepayers in another sphere, are fully entitled.  We find that a burden is being thrown on a body of people who should not be asked to bear it.  It was a fine decent gesture of the Minister who gave us the increase this year, but he should remember that the roads of this country were robbed by the State of over £6,000,000 in three years and that money has to be put back by the Government which followed that Government, just as they have to pay the £6,000,000 a year for the money they squandered.  The responsibility is still the responsibility of whatever Government is in office.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words now in connection with the Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust.  I understand that legislation in this respect is to be brought before this House.  At present, that trust are engaged throughout the country in evicting the tenants of houses.  Where one of these houses is taken over by an ex-soldier who dies, the wife then gets the house.  If she dies a month afterwards, the trust fire out on the roadside the children of these tenants.  There are at present two cases listed for the courts in my district and here is one who will resist by every means in his power any manouvre by these people to get away with the kind of stuff they are trying to put across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a number of complaints in connection with water supplies.  I asked a question on 31st May, 1950, in connection with the Boultra-Ballynoe water supply.  I was told that the preliminary reports had been received in the Department on 4th May, 1950, and that the scheme was being proceeded with.  This is July, 1952, and I can state publicly here that proposals seeking <Col N="1693" /> tenders or sanction for that scheme in any completed form have not yet been received in the Department concerned. I want to know the reason for the delay.  On 13th March, 1950, I asked a question in connection with the Ballyhooly water supply.  I was told that tenders were being invited.  This is July, 1952, and there is no trace of water there yet, although houses are being built there with bathrooms, God save the mark.  What they are to put into the baths, I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the same conditions of affairs with regard to Ballycotton sewerage scheme, which has been dragging along for five years now between the Department and the local authority.  I suggest that it would be far easier and simpler for the Minister to send one of his officials down to Cork, or better still, to open a branch office of his, Department in Cork to deal with these matters on the spot. I was amused listening to the Dublin Deputies when the debate on this Estimate opened.  One would think that the Custom House was 200 miles from the Mansion House, in view of the difficulty which the engineers and architects of the two authorities concerned had in getting agreement.  The proper thing to do, when any difficulty turns up, is to have somebody from the Department, if the Department are not satisfied with the proposals, to go down and meet the engineers of the local authority on the spot and have the matter rectified there and then, instead of this letter-writing from one to another which is being deliberately carried on in order to make work for the overpaid and underworked gentlemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter to which I want to refer has been a bone of contention between the Minister and myself recently in connection with an outrageous manæuvre.  I know that most of the Acts passed by this House during the past three and a half years were half-baked.  The Acts shoved through here were passed without consideration and without any knowledge of their effects, and it is only by <Col N="1694" /> degrees that we are finding the unfortunates who are paying the piper.  I raised here the position in regard to certain urban councils who wrote to the Department for grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, who got the grants and administered them themselves, who had no connection whatever with the Local Authorities (Works) Act as administered in the county, and who now find themselves plastered with a levy of 8d. in the £ to pay for the administration of that Act in the county.  In that respect, the town of Cobh was levied in the sum of £700, a town where 1d. in the £ brings in something like £70 or £80.  The same applies to Fermoy, Youghal and Midleton.  I got from the Minister here a fortnight ago the exact sums levied on each of these four urban areas, to pay for work for which they have no responsibility whatever, and for which they did not get one penny.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the county council that this is due to faulty legislation by those responsible for the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I am told by the Minister's Department that legislation is not required, but if not why the levy?  The Minister tells me that as a last resort it will be recouped.  We all know how recoupment is done.  You must get a sheet &ldquo;Repayments under Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;£700; levy for 1953-54&mdash;£1,000.&rdquo; Fourpence to pay&mdash;that is the recoupment.  I want to end this game by which a section of my people are levied for something for which they should not be levied. Eightpence in the £ is a big levy on any section of the population and 8d. in the £ would do a lot in Cobh besides paying the debts of others or paying for faulty half-baked legislation which was shoved through this House.  On four urban councils alone those sums amounted to close to £2,000.  That should not be borne by those urban areas.  I am demanding that that money be recouped now or that it is not levied, which would be better still.  I suggest that the Department of Local Government have ways and means of doing that. If they have not we will find ways and means of inducing them.  I insist on this matter being rectified at once.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> We have other troubles.  I hope that the acting Ceann Comhairle will be free from interruptions while I am dealing with these matters.  I do not wish to hold up the House although I admit that my colleague who spoke before me took a long time.  I hope that when next we are dealing with the Local Government Estimate the Minister for Local Government will have got after the Minister for Finance and extracted from him the money which is the rightful property of the local authorities, namely, money for the use and deterioration of the roads which are the property of the local authorities and for which the State draws revenue.  It is time we had a definite showdown on that.</P>
    <P>On housing I have given my opinion. The man to be thanked for the housing programme from 1932 onwards is the man who is at present the first citizen of this State, Seán T. O'Kelly.  He is the man who brought that programme here.</P>

It is the duty of this House, apart from politics or Party, to see that that policy is carried out and that no Government is allowed to rob the local authorities so that the central authority may benefit.  The robbery <Col N="1697" /> and the damage is being done to the roads, which are the property of the local authority.  The money is being drawn by the State and it should go back to the local authority and nowhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Corry, one would think he was sincere in his strident attack on the Minister and his Department.  Just as he is running from the House now, he will run very shortly to vote for this Estimate and for the continuance of the policy announced by the present Minister.  I prefer to listen to Deputies from either side of the House sincerely advocating what they believe in, rather than the show of windmilling we have had from Deputy Corry&mdash;it is all hot air and no sense.</P>
      <P>Naturally, the Estimate for this Department is concerned with housing and roads, and, as a result, with employment.  If there is any radical change in housing or road policy, there is an immediate corresponding change in the employment situation.  When we come to discuss employment under local authorities as affected by the policy contained in this Estimate, I am afraid it shows that a very serious situation confronts the country to-day. Some years ago the then Government reduced the temporary road grants which were made in the financial year, 1947-1948.  Those grants were made by the previous Fianna Fáil Government on the basis that they would not be renewed the following year.  In the following year the inter-Party Government slightly reduced them&mdash;in my own two counties the reduction was not very much, but they were reduced&mdash; and that reduction was met by an ollogón here from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I recollect that Deputy Walsh, as he then was, and Deputy Davern, in 1949, moved what was in effect a motion of no confidence in the inter-Party Government on account of the reduction in the road grants.  That motion was defeated, with the opposition of Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan, Deputy John Flynn and others who now support the present Government. Deputies of that kind appear always to support any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was then made that the <Col N="1698" /> reduction in road grants was going to cause wholesale, widespread, drastic, serious unemployment throughout rural Ireland.  In fact, that unemployment never took place.  In fact, by reason of the passing of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, considerable stable employment was maintained in rural Ireland throughout the three and a half years that the inter-Party Government was in office.  These facts cannot be denied.  There is not a Deputy representative of any rural area who is not well aware that from 1948 to 1951 local authorities were able to maintain a full list of employed persons.  I do not believe that ever before in the history of local government employment were the figures as high as they were from 1948 to 1951.  Deputy Allen seems to disagree with me.  I am willing to bet Deputy Allen £1 that in the County Wexford there was in these years, 1948 to 1951, the highest number ever employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different issue, but I am prepared to argue it with Deputy Brennan.  The fact is that from 1948 to 1951 suitable employment was maintained in rural Ireland under various local authority schemes, housing, road-making and works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That was apparent on all sides of the House during those years, and can only make one doubt the sincerity of the kind of propaganda that Deputy Dunne had to meet from Deputy Burke in County Dublin, and that other Deputies had to meet from Fianna Fáil Deputies during the days of the inter-Party Government&mdash;that we were &ldquo;throwing everyone out of work; the reduction in the road grants had swollen the unemployment <Col N="1699" /> queue, and swollen still larger the emigrant ship&rdquo;.  I believe in hard-hitting every time; hard-hitting is necessary, and therefore I welcome this opportunity, 12 months after the present Government has come into office, to call attention to the present situation which obtains in my constituency, and which I am certain obtains in other constituencies.</P>
      <P>This Estimate shows a drastic reduction in the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The figure shown is merely a book-keeping entry. We should be more concerned with the results which follow that reduction.  In the County Laois in the spring of this year, 300 men either married or single, were thrown out of work.  Three hundred county council employees were sacked overnight because the Laois County Council had not received a sum equal to what they got last year for works under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>These 300 former employees of the Laois County Council are still unemployed.  They were amongst the first victims of the change of policy which resulted from the formation of the present Government.  I do not know what the situation may be in Deputy Burke's constituency.  I hope that in the part of County Dublin that Deputy Burke represents there has not been a 50 per cent. reduction in local government employment, as we have had to face in the County Laois.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that that serious unemployment would have been ventilated in this House by some of the people who had been so noisy some two years ago&mdash;Deputy Corry, Deputy Davern, Deputy Burke, Deputy Allen, and all the rest of them.  Look at them now, as silent and as mute as the proverbial mouse.  Not a word have they to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to know why that change of policy has taken place.  Is it to be suggested that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was a bad Act?  I could understand the Government if they came in and said: &ldquo;We disagree with the policy that suggested the passage of that Bill.  We think it is bad policy.&rdquo; At least, that would be understandable and logical.  It would be, of course, in keeping with Fianna Fáil's initial opposition to the Second Reading of the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, an opposition that died when Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, got his ears boxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That case is not made.  The Government, so far as I understand it, have agreed to carry on the Local Authorities (Works) Act, as they have agreed to carry on all other inter-Party Government schemes, and they do not suggest that the policy is <Col N="1701" /> wrong but they proceed to destroy the policy by failing to provide money to carry it out.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Government and the Minister that, in my opinion, as a Deputy representing two counties in the Midlands, there never was an Act which had more beneficial results than the Local Authorities (Works) Act had. That Act catered deliberately for the in-between drainage problem, the problem that could not be solved satisfactorily by an employment scheme or a special scheme of that kind, that was too small for arterial drainage. The Act catered for the countless numbers of cases of flooding which were in between special employment scheme cases and arterial drainage cases.</P>
    <P>In County Laois in the last year of the inter-Party Government, a sum approaching £100,000 was spent on work under that Act.  The benefits from that expenditure are apparent now. The expenditure, apart altogether from the preservation of public property such as roads, and so on, was able materially to assist small land holders and people who had not the resources to do drainage for themselves, even in co-operation, over years back.  Much good work was done and I am sure that the same story can be told of other areas.  All that work has been done and, if the Government are seeking to spend money, they could not spend it on a more worthwhile object than minor drainage schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>They talk about spending money on other things, a new airline to America, and all the rest of it.  Whatever arguments may be advanced for schemes of that kind, they do not compare with worthwhile work which will give employment and lasting benefit.  That is the type of capital expenditure which was part of the inter-Party Government's policy, which was put into practice, which has had a result and the benefits of which are apparent to the people now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the situation, and I would like to hear from the Minister for Local Government the reasons which prompted this reduction.  It could not be that the money was not there.  There is plenty of money always available for any worthwhile scheme.  The Minister for Defence only had to raise his finger and he got £2,500,000 for increasing the Army, taking young lads from the land, where they could be working and putting them in barracks.  I would <Col N="1703" /> prefer to see that money spent on drainage.  I would prefer to see it spent on reclaiming land.  However, that, apparently, is a difference in policy, and it is on that that I think the Minister owes some explanation to the House.</P>
      <P>The second matter I want to refer to is housing.  I do not think anyone, in spite of the bluster of Deputy Corry, can be satisfied with the present housing situation.  Whatever the reason may be, the housing drive has slowed down considerably in the last 12 months.  That may be due to circumstances outside the control of the Government, but it is a situation that requires immediate and urgent attention. I think it was rather a pity that Deputy Corry spoke about records in relation to housing.  Members on any side of the House cannot afford to be complacent with regard to the housing problem.  Members on both sides spent a number of years knocking down houses, and there are more demolished houses than new houses in this country to-day.  In spite of all the boasting we heard from Fianna Fáil about housing in 1948, 100,000 families were in need of houses.  If tributes are to be paid to anybody for the initiation of a new housing drive, a tribute is surely due to the work and worth of the late Tim Murphy as Minister for Local Government. It was he who initiated and put into operation the greatest housing drive that this country had ever known.  It was his sincerity that put that drive into operation.  I suppose it was only natural that, after a period, the drive would begin to slow up.  That would probably have happened even if Tim Murphy continued to hold the office of Minister for Local Government. Enthusiasm always begins to wane after a period in any movement or in any undertaking.  It should be the concern of both sides of the House to arrest immediately any suspicion of a reduction or a loss of enthusiasm in the housing drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency we are again getting back to the days when there did not appear to be much done in relation to rural housing.  I always judge the housing requirements of an area by a simple method: every time a <Col N="1704" /> labourer's cottage becomes vacant in either Laois or Offaly, I get 20 letters from people in the hope that I might be able to assist them in securing the tenancy of that particular cottage. That is an indication to me that, in that particular area, there are 20 or, perhaps, more people whose housing conditions are not good or proper, and that a very serious want in the matter of housing is still evident.  I feel that considerably more could be done in the matter of the erection of labourers' cottages and for rural housing generally. I realise, of course, that local authorities have problems, but they seem to be more and more frightened of building costs and more and more anxious to say: &ldquo;Well, now that we have finished that scheme, the housing requirements of this particular area are satisfied.&rdquo;  A housing scheme was started very recently in the town of Portlaoighise, and a similar scheme will shortly be started in Mountmellick. I was sorry to notice in recent months that it is the opinion of officials of the local authority concerned that those contributions will solve the housing needs of Mountmellick and Portlaoighise. I do not propose to bore the House by giving details of the housing requirements of these towns.  I am sure that whatever I might say would hold good for the towns represented by every other Deputy.  We all know that rural housing requirements are an urgent matter.  The houses built already or the schemes that are at present planned should not give any grounds for complacency.  I appeal to the Minister to make housing a number one priority and to continue the drive that may be waning by reason of familiarity with the problem.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to be so kind as to tell the Minister that I again raised the problem of housing in the Pullough area of Offaly.  I have pointed this matter out so often to the Minister that I am beginning to doubt whether or not he hears me or whether he reads the Official Reports.  This is a barren and desolate area&mdash;one of the worst in the country&mdash;where over 1,000 people live in 80 houses.  More than 20 people live and sleep in many of these tworoomed <Col N="1705" /> cottages.  I have seen them myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They make a living from turf.  The houses in which they live were built many years ago.  They are small houses, because only small houses could be built on that bog; foundations for larger houses could not be got there.  I have raised this matter with the Department, with the Offaly County Council and, with the assistance of other Deputies, I have done my very best.  In this House recently the Minister offered a housing scheme in Ferbane to the people in the Pullough area.  However, this scheme would not be at all suitable, because it is four or five miles away from the bog on which the Pullough people make their living.  Therefore, that scheme would not meet their requirements.  I suggested to people there that they should build their own houses, and that they would get a housing grant from the county council.  They are only too anxious to do that, but the houses which would have to be built to comply with the minimum standard requirements suggested by the Department would not stand in Pullough; they would sink into the bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Houses with an area of 500 square feet.  Not being an engineer, I do not know anything about the technical side of the matter.  However, I suggested to the Minister, time and again, that he should send some knowledgeable official from his Department down to the area, to find out the conditions existing there, and to devise some house that will stand in the bog. After all, 80 houses have been standing there for over 100 years.  Surely, it is not beyond human power to build houses which will meet the requirements of the inhabitants of this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions obtaining there are not Christian.  They are certainly ones that should not be tolerated in this country.  I recall going into one of these cottages.  It was occupied by five families&mdash;all relations; 12 people <Col N="1706" /> were sleeping right around a small kitchen floor.  These appalling conditions tend to make one annoyed.  I realise that the fault does not lie with the Minister, but it is very difficult to understand why, when this matter is raised by way of a parliamentary question, the Minister's reply should be: &ldquo;I have had the requirements of Pullough investigated, and I am quite satisfied that no houses are required in that area.&rdquo;  I would like if the Minister would inquire into that matter again.</P>
    <P>There is only one final matter I want to raise.  I am sorry the Minister is not here, because I want to raise, as a matter of principle, certain proceedings which took place in the County of Cavan arising out of the local inquiry and a decision by the Minister in the last 12 months.  I raise this as a matter of principle.  I think an important principle is involved.  I know nothing about the rights or wrongs, the allegations or the counter-allegations which gave rise to the Cavan inquiry which was held in September, 1950.  That inquiry lasted a period of 22 days.</P>
    <P>It was initiated and called, of course, by the Minister's Department.  The board of inquiry heard the evidence, listened to the charges made against the county manager and by him against the county engineer.  The board also listened to and heard evidence in relation to other matters that arose as charges against other officials and persons in Cavan.</P>
    <P>That was the job of the board of inquiry.  I am not concerned and the House should not be concerned with anything that took place at the inquiry or any evidence that might have been given or any report that might have been made to the Minister. What I am concerned with, however, is that the Minister, as a Deputy for the constituency of Cavan, took an important part in the deliberations of that inquiry.  I am told that he attended the inquiry himself on a number of occasions.  As a Deputy for the constituency and, perhaps, being friendly with some of the people who might be involved in the inquiry one could understand his attending and taking an interest in what was <Col N="1707" /> going on.  Unfortunately the Minister went further.</P>
    <P>In the General Election of 1951 the Minister campaigned the County of Cavan with the thesis that the Cavan local inquiry was a fabricated inquiry by the Fine Gael Party and by the Labour Party to show the faults of the county managerial system.  In a speech&mdash;portion of which I am going to read to the House&mdash;the Minister went so far as to say that the whole business was a dirty business, that it would end in a bottle of smoke and that he challenged the then Minister for Local Government to publish not merely his findings but the report made to him by the board of Inquiry and the evidence on which those findings were made.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech reported in the <i>Anglo Celt</i> on the 26th May, 1951, dealt with the Cavan inquiry in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had a sworn inquiry here in Cavan last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was on the 28th May and the inquiry was in September.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have not heard since of the findings, but there are all sorts of reports in circulation to the effect that it has sort of ended in smoke. It will not end in smoke for the ratepayers of the county, I fear, but may end in their having to pay an additional charge of 4d. to 6d. in the £ in their rates.  Why was this inquiry held is the question that has agitated the minds of many.  It had, at least, in my opinion two objectives, none of which appears to have been fully achieved.  There was a Bill promised by Labour to amend the Managerial Act.  Fine Gael did not like it too well, and it was Fine Gael who first mooted this system&mdash; or Cumann na nGaedheal, I should say.  Anyhow, Labour pressed and all was set for amending Bill.  To justify this course though, it was necessary to have some evidence that all was not well with things as they were, and about the same time the Bill came up for consideration the inquiry was in full blast.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister smiles.  The Minister <Col N="1708" /> thinks, on recollection, that was an amusing speech but the Minister's sense of humour does not appeal to me. It would, I think, have been a nicer thing if the Minister, on reflection, had hung his head in shame that a speech like that should have been made.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no reason for the delay in reporting the findings to the county council and the public.  I invite the Minister for Local Government to do so in order that it will not be said that we later will have suppressed, or in any way cooked the evidence in the case.  I challenge the Government to do this now, and in a very special way I challenge those here in this county who were primarily responsible for the inquiry at first, to see that the findings are made known before the 30th May, 1951.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It was very noticeable, during the progress of that filthy business in the courthouse, that certain people were completely absent.  It was not a matter of their being so busy that they could not attend. Their failure to be present at some stage of that long-drawn-out affair suggests to me that, just as the murderer squirms on being taken to the scenes of his crime, so would the prime mover in causing the inquiry squirm, should he allow himself to be present during the proceedings. If it was necessary to have a victim so as to convince the many who were in doubt as to the need and wisdom of the proposed amendment of that Act, why should the County Cavan ratepayers have to bear the expense, apart from any attempt at injustice <Col N="1710" /> to the individual, that was not too hard to detect in this whole affair?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want you, Sir, to hear me on that.  This House is asked to pay a sum of over £2,000 to Deputy Patrick Smith in this Estimate.  I am, therefore, entitled to suggest that Deputy Smith is not a proper person to be paid a single penny piece by the taxpayers of this country and I am about to do it.  Deputy Smith is a man who got into this House by campaigning against the Cavan inquiry, by suggesting that it was a Party business, by maligning responsible legal people.</P>

      <P>I am raising a point of order to prevent, if I can, a continuance of this attack on the Minister.  The Minister is a Minister <Col N="1713" /> of this House selected as Minister by the President on the recommendation of the Taoiseach in accordance with the Constitution and, in my submission, it is not permissible to make an attack on the Minister by saying that he is not fit to be a Minister, on an Estimate in regard to his Department.</P>

      <P>Again, on a point of order.  I consider that this is most important.  If anything Deputy Smith has done since he became a Minister, in the opinion of a Deputy, unfits him to be a Minister, I say that is relevant. Anything which he did when he was not, in fact, a Deputy, during the general election campaign and before his election as a Deputy or before he was appointed a Minister by the President, in my submission, is not relevant.  If it were relevant, we could go back 40 years over the lives of every Minister if we wanted to do so.  I submit that that is not relevant or proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Chairman</NameTxt>

In case I might hurt the tender susceptibilities of Deputy Cowan, I want to assure him that I am tying up this conduct of Deputy Smith with the conduct of the Minister for Local Government, who, incidentally, is <Col N="1714" /> Deputy Smith, because Deputy Smith, having made the speech I have read, having carried out that campaign, proceeded without hesitation in the last 12 months to judge the inquiry and to term it a pall of smoke and a Party business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think cross-talk and withdrawals would be completely <Col N="1716" /> unnecessary if Deputy Cowan ceased to hold the opinion that it is his job to defend every Fianna Fáil Minister who comes into this House.  The present Minister for Local Government is quite capable of looking after himself, and I wish we had, in relation to his conduct as Deputy Smith, the same recognition of the proprieties of debate as we have in relation to his conduct as Minister.  Deputy Smith is a Deputy for whom, personally, I have the highest regard, but that should not prevent me from expressing my view in regard to his administration in the last 12 months.  I think nothing could be more prejudicial to the satisfactory work of a Department than that a person who has formed a point of view on a certain issue should come to judge that issue later.  I would have thought that I would have the unstinted support of Deputy Cowan in these remarks.</P>
      <P>Apparently that is not so but, for the record, I should like to protest in the strongest possible manner on a question of principle that a Deputy who held these strong views should have acted later as Minister in dealing with the findings and with the report. Would it be unfair in those circumstances, in order to ensure that not merely justice is done but that it should appear to have been done, if I repeat the Minister's demand in the Minister's own words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I demand from the Minister for Local Government that he will publish (1) the Minister's findings and (2) the report on which the findings are based.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a fair demand.  If, in fact, the Minister's findings are in accordance with the report made to him, then justice will have been done and will appear to have been done.  I know it is not customary or usual in local government inquiries of this kind and certainly it is not a practice that has been followed by Fianna Fáil Ministers to publish more than the findings.  That system was condemned by Deputy Cowan and other Deputies in relation to the Cork Street inquiry but apparently it was considered a good practice by the Minister for <Col N="1717" /> Finance when he was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>In this case, however, Deputy Smith who made the demand in the first instance is now called upon to deal with this inquiry.  Will he now be prepared to do what he asked his predecessor to do, to publish not merely the findings but also the report and the recommendations upon which these findings are supposed to be based?  I should be glad if the report justifies the Minister's findings.  It may; I do not know, but I hope it does.  If it does, the Minister need have no hesitation in publishing the findings. In doing so he will be able to say: &ldquo;Well, now, I told you so.&rdquo; I hope he will be able to say that.  Apart altogether from political matters, no matter what side of the see-saw happens to be on that side of the House, I think that none of us should enter on the affairs of Government&mdash;I speak metaphorically&mdash;with dirty hands.  I think that is unfortunately what happened here.  It would have been far wiser if some other member of the Government had been charged with the administration of this Department because of what happened.  I think it unfortunate that the present Minister should have entered upon an adjudication in relation to an inquiry which he described in that language.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that in relation to my remarks in regard to the Cavan inquiry heat should have been introduced, not by myself and not by the Minister.  I think it was Deputy Cowan who, with the best intentions in the world, precipitated the degree of heat which has characterised the later stages of the debate.  That will always happen if one fancies oneself as a Don Quixote in shining armour tilting at windmills.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, on two or three occasions while the Chair was occupied by Deputy Davin, I raised points of order directed to the Chair.  I did not make any observation to any Deputy in this House.  I spoke to the Chair and, on the substantial point of order, the Chair held that I was correct.  I think <Col N="1718" /> it is unfair to suggest that by raising these points of order with the Chair I caused any heat in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly withdraw that suggestion which was not what I intended to convey.  What I meant was that Deputy Cowan's interruptions or points of order, though raised with the best intentions in the world, in my opinion caused a certain amount of cross talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be strange if on this Estimate somebody did not rise to speak about the housing position in Cork.  I want again to draw the Minister's attention to the great necessity for dealing with the housing problem, especially in the City of Cork.</P>
      <P>There are 3,000 or 4,000 houses needed in Cork City for people who are living under very bad conditions, and I hope that there will be no slowing up in dealing with that position.</P>
      <P>During the past year we had an investigation into the housing position in Cork, and as a result of it I think that the Minister and his Department are satisfied of the need there is for houses in that city.  I think they are satisfied, too, that there could have been a better housing drive.  I believe that, as a result of the attention that was drawn to the housing position in Cork by the Cork City Deputies over the past couple of years, there has been an improvement in the number of houses built during the past 12 months.  In that period we had, I think, 300 houses built compared to something over 100 houses in the previous year.  But, even so, that figure of 300 houses built in the past year is only about half, or less than half, the number that should be built if the position there is ever going to be dealt with as it should be.  If we are going to build only 300 houses a year, that means that it will take from ten to 15 years before the housing needs of the city are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the investigation I have referred to was going on, I suggested that the officials should go around and look at the conditions under which the <Col N="1719" /> people of Cork were living.  They assured me that there was no necessity, and said that they did not think it would help.  I still believe that it would have helped, and that they are not aware at all of the conditions under which some people in Cork are living. It would be a great relief to the Cork City Deputies if there was an improvement in the building of houses because it is true to say that 75 per cent. of their time is taken up meeting people who are looking for houses.  They have people coming to them from one end of the day to the other telling them of the conditions under which they are living and those conditions are really very bad.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there was an improvement during the past 12 months.  We felt, as a result of the investigation that was made, that at least 800 houses a year should be built.  I think the Department said that we should aim at trying to get 400 houses a year built first.  We did succeed, as I have said, in building 300 houses during the past 12 months. I hope that nothing whatever will occur to prevent that position from being improved on.  From the point of view of getting houses built, the weather conditions during the past 12 months were extremely favourable. That probably accounts for the improvement in some small way.  We have more tradesmen available now than before, and there can be nothing to hold up the building of houses, except as somebody might say, that money was not available.</P>
    <P>As regards general building in Cork, we have not so far, thank God, been held up for want of money, but we are held up as regards building under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I would appeal to the Minister to have the position that arises under that Act remedied as soon as possible, because I think there will be general agreement that the man who undertakes the responsibility himself of building a house and of finding portion of the money required should be encouraged more than anybody else.  I think that there should be no obstacle put in his way.  It is a pity <Col N="1720" /> that people in that position were not able to go ahead, as they should be, during the past year when we had such good weather for building.  I hope, as I say, that that position will be remedied, and that the Minister will succeed in the efforts which, I believe, he is making to see that the Cork Corporation will have access to the Local Loans Fund.  I cannot understand why a body like the Cork Corporation, with a valuation of about £250,000, cannot have access to the Local Loans Fund while the Cork County Council, with a valuation of about £2,500,000, has free access to it I believe that is not the Minister's fault.  I wish him success in his efforts to see that the Cork Corporation will have access to the Local Loans Fund at least for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I would ask him to see that when plans are sent up to his Department for houses that there is as little delay as possible in dealing with them, and not have them being sent up and down from Dublin to Cork with suggestions for a little alteration here or there.  Let someone take a firm stand with regard to them either in Dublin or in Cork, and say that the work is to be executed in a particular way, and be done with it.  I know of cases under the Cork County Council where people with great experience in the planning and carrying out of hundreds of housing schemes have sent up plans, and of holes being picked in those plans by people who, I understand, have no such experience.  Surely, we have gone beyond the stage now when there should not be any delay.  We have town planners and highly qualified architects.  Once a type of house is considered suitable, I think there should be no more of this up and down business and speedy decisions should be given.  We have people with high qualifications employed under the local authorities in Cork, and one would think that they must not be fit for their jobs at all judging by the way their plans are delayed when sent up to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would <Col N="1721" /> come to Cork some time and visit some of the houses that I am talking about. If he were to come, I think he would realise that we have great numbers of young married couples living in apartments or with their people-in-law when, as only too often happens, there is a good deal of bickering going on in the house.  We have overcrowding, too, in a number of corporation houses because, owing to the scarcity of houses, young married people with families have to live with their parents.  The Minister, I think, would realise from his visit that the Cork Deputies have not been stressing the need for more houses year after year just in order to have a grumble.  There is a real necessity in Cork for more houses.  We have, as I have said, people coming to us every hour of the day looking for houses.  I think myself that, with a local push and with a push from the Department, this position could be improved.  There is no doubt, I believe, that we could speed up the housing drive in Cork if there was greater expedition in regard to the acquisition of sites and in giving approval to plans.</P>
    <P>Cork and Dublin are the two places most in need of houses, no matter what the people in the rural areas may think.  I appeal to the Minister to take an interest in that problem in the coming 12 months.  Plans were sent to the Minister's Department about a week ago for houses for the suburbs of Cork.  I appeal to the Minister to sanction those plans immediately because they also will help to relieve the housing problem in Cork City.</P>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question during the year about pedestrian crossings.  I understood the Minister to say that it was proposed to introduce legislation in connection with that matter.  It seems that, at present, a pedestrian has no right in this country whether or not the crossing is marked.  I understand that in other countries if a pedestrian puts his foot on the crossing the traffic has to stop.  The present position in this country is a great hardship, especially to old people who are trying to cross busy thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by appealing again <Col N="1722" /> to the Minister to speed-up the housing programme in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to refute allegations made against Labour members on the Cork County Council by Deputy Corry during the course of his speech on this Estimate.  I treat remarks made by Deputy Corry very lightly.  I am well aware that so far as public affairs are concerned he has neither honesty, integrity nor consistency.  I am very interested in the question of grants for county and main roads.  In the course of his comments, Deputy Corry shed a lot of tears because of the plight of the harassed taxpayers.  He has a deep sympathy with them.  He feels that they are unable to bear the burdens which are imposed on them. He has made statements to that effect in this House on various occasions and at the Cork County Council.  It is very seldom that I am in any way personal but I should like to give an instance of Deputy Corry's concern for the ratepayers of Cork County. When the Local Authorities (Works) Act was put into operation in 1949 the Irish Engineers' Association applied to the various county councils of this country for a 3 per cent. commission on the execution of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That application came before the Cork County Council.  It was intimated that if the members agreed to the proposal the money would have to come out of the ratepayers' pockets and out of the revenue and that so far as central funds were concerned there would be no recoupment.  At that particular county council meeting, Deputy Corry stood up and vigorously opposed the application made by the Irish Engineers' Association.  He said that the ratepayers of County Cork had a sufficiently heavy burden to meet without having to give 3 per cent. to the engineers in the county for a job for which they were adequately paid.  He made his point firmly and he mentioned that his main ground for objecting was the extra burden which it would entail on the ratepayers.  Eventually, it was decided at that meeting that the matter would be referred to a committee set up by the council.  The committee would deal <Col N="1723" /> with the matter privately and report back to the county council.  I agreed with Deputy Corry's comments at the meeting.  I was actually speaking to the committee on similar lines when Deputy Corry appeared.  What did Deputy Corry say at that private meeting at which neither Press representatives nor the public were allowed to be present?  He said: &ldquo;Give those boys the 3 per cent.&rdquo; He fought as hard as he could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought I could comment on statements made by a previous speaker in this debate.  I am glad to say that the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Keyes, fixed up that matter.  He refused&mdash;rightly, in my opinion&mdash;to accede to the recommendations of any county council in regard to payment of commission on those local authority schemes.  Deputy Corry cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>He cannot curry favour with those senior officials and at the same time with the ratepaying community.  That is one instance of his inconsistency. It is easy to judge his frame-up.  The statements he makes in this House should, therefore, have very little bearing on the public affairs of this country.  I would not have referred to the matter were it not for the attacks he made on the Labour members on the Cork County Council. We take these aspersions very lightly. We know the type of individual he is and we know his frame of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> My first point concerns the improvement of roads.  I agree with the viewpoint put forward by a number of Deputies that increased grants should be made available.  When the Fianna Fáil Party were in opposition they made great play in this House and in the various local authorities throughout the country of the fact that the inter-Party Government reduced the grants for the improvement and maintenance of roads.  Everybody knows that the reason for the increased grants in 1947 and 1948 was because materials for that work were becoming available again after an emergency which had lasted for six or seven years, during which time the roads had deteriorated.  Extra sums were built up in the Road Fund during the period when these materials could not be obtained.  Once they began to become available, the Fianna Fáil Government decided to increase the grants for a short period in an effort to make good the deterioration of the roads that had set in during the emergency.  Then the Fianna Fáil Government were removed from office. When they found themselves in opposition they adopted a different attitude towards the grants.  In every possible way they endeavoured to besmirch the inter-Party Government and to get people to believe that if they, Fianna Fáil, were still in office they would have increased the grants and in that way increased employment and the benefits to the road-travelling community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has told this House in a very capable way the results of the administration of the inter-Party Government so far as local authority affairs are concerned.  I agree with him that there was never more employment available in this country than during the three and a half years of inter-Party Government. Only a very small number of people, if any, except those who were unwilling or unavailable for work, were unemployed.  Everything was running very smoothly until the present Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I do not want to approach this matter from a political angle, but it is known to everyone from Donegal to <Col N="1725" /> Cork that there was never more unemployment in the country than there is at the present time, since Fianna Fáil came into power, and that applies in a particular way to local authority employees.  Unfortunately, many of them have to take the emigrant ship to John Bull to improve roads, to do mining or some other type of work for our alleged ancient enemy.</P>
    <P>I believe that conditions have changed considerably even this year as against any of the former years because the Government are now bringing in in a very cruel manner, from the taxpayers of this country, the enormous sum of £104,000,000.  I feel sure that if we were told ten or 15 years ago that it would take well over £100,000,000 to run the affairs of this country in ten or 12 years hence, we would scarcely believe it.  However, that is the position that exists, and in view of the increased moneys which they are pulling by every possible means out of the pockets of the people of this country&mdash;most of it coming out of the pockets of the plain people&mdash; there should be more money made available in the Minister's Department for the carrying out of works which would be of general benefit to the community.  No work is of greater importance to the community as a whole than the improvement of roads. From information at my disposal from people who have travelled abroad extensively, I believe that the roads of this country compare most unfavourably with roads in other countries on the Continent of Europe, and especially in our neighbouring country.  Consequently, in view of the increased money that is now going into the Exchequer, much more should be made available to local authorities by way of grants.</P>
    <P>The cost of improving roads has increased considerably during recent years.  I know very well that it is an impossibility for local authorities to carry out in any sort of efficient manner their policy of improving not only main roads but county roads with the moneys derived from rates, because it is quite true that the ratepayers are unable at the present time to bear any increased burden, many of them in any <Col N="1726" /> case, and particularly those in whom I am mainly interested, the small ratepayers, who, as everyone knows, finds it proportionately more difficult to meet his commitments to local authorities than his well-to-do brother.</P>
    <P>The grants that are made available are, so far as the more remote or isolated areas are concerned, of no benefit whatsoever because due to the limited funds at the disposal of every county council, only the main roads and the main county roads are taken into consideration.  The result is that the roads in remote and isolated areas are completely forgotten.  I would be very anxious that the Minister would devise a system whereby moneys would be made available for the improvement of these long-forgotten roads in backward areas.  I feel sure that it is happening in Cork and every other county because it must happen, due to the limited resources at the disposal of county councils, that these roads are completely forgotten, so much so that it is impossible to take a horse and cart along them let alone a lorry.</P>

      <P>I know they should not be forgotten.  As the Minister, during the period when he was in opposition shared the viewpoint of his colleagues that more money should be made available for road works from the Central Fund, I should like to see that put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>You have done so in a very niggardly fashion, having regard to the money available.  You have given it with one hand and taken it back with the other.  The Minister, as he has stated, claims that he has given increased money to local authorities for the improvement of roads. <Col N="1727" /> That, in one way, is true.  He has increased the grants in a small way, speaking proportionately, and I feel sure if the previous Government were returned that the grants given to local authorities would be equally great.  But I must relate the Local Authorities (Works) Act to what I am speaking about.  The Minister has made available this year to the Cork County Council some £84,000 extra by way of grants for main and county roads.  He has made available, on the one hand, £84,000 extra to the Cork County Council, and he has taken back with the other, since he came into office, a sum of £97,500, money that was formerly being granted by the Local Government Department to the Cork County Council. So far as the Cork County Council were concerned, the policy of the inter-Party Government was to give them £150,000 per year on a flat rate until such time as all works that would come under that scheme would be executed.  The Minister came into office before the full grants for the year 1950-51 were made available; consequently only £102,000 or £105,000 was made available for last year.  He took very good care to reduce it again by 50 per cent. this year.  I feel sure the Minister will not deny that the Cork County Council are getting only £52,500 this year, and every other county council of the 27 county councils are getting only 50 per cent. of what they got last year; and they did not even get the full allocation last year because the Minister's intervention precluded them for getting the full allocation which the former Minister intended to make available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They got exactly what he provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been debated again and again.  I am satisfied, and so are the majority of the members of the county council of which I am a member, and, I feel sure, the majority of the county councillors, public representatives and the majority of the people of this country are satisfied, that if the inter-Party Government remained in office the money that was made available in the year 1950-51 would apply down the <Col N="1728" /> years until such time as all those works were executed.</P>
      <P>So far as that is concerned I can say that there was no more beneficial measure ever introduced into this Parliament, because it served the dual purpose of providing the workers of this country with productive employment, enabling them to earn a livelihood at home; and it was of untold benefit to the farming community of this country because it enabled them to have the main rivers and streams were cleaned it enabled those people to avail of the land rehabilitation project of Deputy Dillon to clean the smaller streams running into those main rivers and streams. Taking it from every viewpoint it was a magnificent measure and definitely a measure that should have been considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred a while ago, during Deputy O'Higgin's speech, to the return derived from the expenditure involved.  One would think that there were no results from the expenditure, that it was a waste of money, doled around to workers everywhere to keep them in hands.  In County Cork the results were magnificent and I cannot understand Deputy J. Brennan's statement that the people in Donegal do not want this particular scheme.  I think that statement is incorrect.  The farmers in my county, and I am sure this is true of other counties as well, are very disappointed because of the reduction in the grants available under that Act. They and their workers are the people who will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was endeavouring to relate this question of local authority grants to road grants.  The Minister must admit that so far as local authorities are concerned no increase whatsoever has taken place in the grants made available for roads.  A good deal of the money provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was devoted to improving roads which were subject to flooding.  The level of the roads was raised in order to prevent flooding. It was not merely by the clearance of rivers and streams that <Col N="1729" /> people benefited under that Act.  They also benefited by the improvement made in the roads.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister took office he has given no increases in the grants to local authorities.  He has not been of any benefit to the local authorities and he has not been of any benefit to the farmers and workers.  I agree with Deputy Corry that the position has now changed completely.  To-day the Government is getting an extra 4d. per gallon on petrol.  Motor traffic has increased considerably and the revenue derived through motor taxation has increased in proportion.  The revenue derived from petrol must now be enormous taking into consideration the increase in price and the increase in consumption.</P>
    <P>Because of the increase in heavy lorry traffic our roads are deteriorating substantially.  The Minister must be aware of that fact and he should make more money available to local authorities for the maintenance of roads.  Some big industrial concerns send loads of 35 tons by road.  I think these people should be compelled to use the railway for carrying that heavy merchandise.  The present position is deplorable.  No road could stand up to the heavy traffic that is now operating.  Railways should be utilised for the carriage of heavy goods.  That was the purpose for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <P>Housing is a very important matter. I know it is difficult to provide all the money required to meet the housing needs of our people.  The State has an obligation to provide houses for those who cannot supply themselves with decent homes.  We are making quite reasonable headway and the speed at which houses are being built is satisfactory.  It might not be as easy as some Deputies seem to believe to improve on our present speed.  If the speed achieved over the past three or four years continues, eventually our housing requirements should be adequately met.  Possibly places like Dublin and Cork City may need a little more time.</P>
    <P>There are substantial delays in the implementation of some schemes.  We have had a rural cottage scheme in <Col N="1730" /> West Cork for a number of years, and it has not yet reached finality.  I approve of the differential renting system in local authority housing. Some people in my constituency, through no fault of their own, are unable to avail of local authority houses because they cannot meet the rent and rates.  Rent and rates amounting to 11/- a week are excessive where the poorer people are concerned, and some concession should be made on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult to have an official going from house to house ascertaining incomes in the urban areas, but that difficulty would not arise in the rural areas.  It is unfair and unjust to ask some of these very poor people to pay a rent amounting to 11/- a week.  Many of them who are unable to pay it are continuing to live in miserable hovels. It would be no use their accepting a house out of which they might be evicted in three or four months' time because of their inability to meet the rent.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why those in receipt of a decent income should not pay an economic rent.  The money must come from somewhere.  I believe in helping those who cannot help themselves but, where the income is sufficient to justify an economic rent, the tenant should be compelled to pay that rent, and public funds should not be asked to subsidise housing accommodation for such tenants.  The money will have to come from somewhere, and I believe that the differential renting system is our best method of finding the money.  Give the man who has not an income an opportunity of getting a good house at a nominal rent, but make the person who is in receipt of a good income and who gets the tenancy of one of these houses pay.</P>
    <P>Another matter I was asked to bring to the Minister's notice is the question of water rents in towns and villages. I am well aware that the provision of water and sewerage schemes is a very costly item, and that it takes an average of £20,000 to £30,000 to provide a scheme for even one village or town. I know that money has to come from somewhere.  It will not come down from Heaven, but must come eventually from the people's pockets.  A <Col N="1731" /> number of schemes have been completed all over the country, and I believe that the water rents obtaining in these areas have been revised and increased considerably.  When the matter came before the local authority of which I am a member, I agreed with the increase, having regard to the fact that the schemes cost so much money, but I was then asked by the people concerned to view it from a different angle.  Having done so, I came to the conclusion that I was incorrect, and that they have a very good case for getting a reduction in the rents now charged in some local authority areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the contention put up by representatives of development associations and so on in some of these towns and villages.  They claim, first, that water is nearly the only amenity they require; secondly, that they have no abatement whatever in rates&mdash;they are paying the full poundage in rates; and, thirdly, that they are contributing to many schemes in rural areas, such as schemes for the erection of outoffices, improvement of roadways, and the drainage and reclamation of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They claim that they are paying proportionately for all these schemes as much as the people benefiting by them.  They have raised no objection to paying their share towards the cost of these schemes, but, having done so, they believe they should be allowed water at greatly reduced rents, and that the cost should be borne out of public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bad one. They do not suggest that it should be borne entirely out of public funds, but that they should have to pay a fair rent.  In view of the taxation and rates which these townspeople have to pay, and the fact that these towns and villages are being squeezed to death slowly but steadily at present, <Col N="1732" /> due to opposition of all kinds so far as trading is concerned, they should get consideration.  They are satisfied to pay a rent of £2 or £3 a year for water but when you ask a poor publican, who is scarcely doing any business on the side of a village street, along with paying rates and taxes, to pay £5 10s. or £6 a year water rent, you are asking too much.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what are the Minister's intentions with regard to the County Administration Bill introduced by the former Government.  It has been argued time and again by some supporters of the present Government that the managerial system is a much better system than the system that previously obtained.  I know all the advantages of the managerial system and all its disadvantages, and I believe that taking a broad view, there is room for an amendment of the present system so far as the Managerial Act is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is outrageous that men who go out and contest county council elections and succeed in gaining the confidence of the people in their respective areas&mdash;many of them to the extent of 3,000 and 4,000 votes&mdash;should become members of a body which has no functions whatever.  All these functions are vested in the county manager.  We heard a great deal of comment about corruption in relation to the local bodies of old but I believe there is very little foundation for many of these allegations because a member of a county council is elected for a term of three years and if the people who elected him are dissatisfied <Col N="1733" /> with his action, his attitude or his approach to any matter during the three years, they have a right to remove him from office.  He must come before them and give an account of his stewardship.  In addition, the county councillor is accessible to every member of the general public, the people who provide the money and keep everything moving.  Contrast that with the manager.  He is appointed by the State.  It does not matter to him what the people down the country think of his rulings&mdash;he will not have to go out, as we have, looking for votes.</P>

      <P>I will soon finish.  It does not matter to him what the ordinary people think of his rulings or orders.  He is quite independent of them.  He is a fixture, who cannot, except in grave circumstances, be removed.  If the ordinary man in the street has a grievance, he cannot go within a quarter of a mile of him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>County councillors who go out and get the confidence of the people are entitled to more power.  It was alleged by the Deputy's Party that they were corruptible, but if people who go out and get sufficient votes in their own areas to be elected are corruptible, it can equally be said that the members of the Government and the elected representatives on any side of this House are corruptible because they are elected on the same basis.  They go before the people and get votes which enable them to become members of this Assembly.  I think that the manager should be relegated to a position in which he would be more of an adviser, and more powers and functions should be given to the elected representatives of the people, the representatives who will have to answer to the people.  It was a regrettable step on the part of the Minister that when he introduced the Managerial Act, he did not wipe out county councils completely.</P>

      <P>I want to make a brief reference to the cottage purchase scheme.  That scheme, I believe, is in full operation all over the country.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give the same facilities to people who bought out their cottages since 1938 as to tenants buying out to-day.  People who bought prior to last year got a reduction of only 25 per cent. of the rent, whereas people who bought out last year and this year had 14 years taken off the terminable annuity period and 50 per cent. of the rent.  The same advantages should be given to people who paid for their cottages out of their own cottages over 14 years as are given to tenants purchasing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a great deal of controversy about the improvement of premises and the excessive increase in valuation.  I agree that where a businessman improves his premises it is right that the valuation should be increased and that he should pay higher rates, but at the same time there is no sense in the wide world in <Col N="1735" /> the increases that have taken place in the part of the county I know.  The valuations of improved premises were increased in some cases, I believe, by 400 per cent.  These people would be quite agreeable to a fair increase but an increase of 400 per cent. is outrageous. One thing that is certain is that the lawyers are reaping a very rich harvest because every Circuit Court in the country is hearing nothing but valuation appeals.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> My local authority are concerned about the attitude of the Minister and his Department towards housing plans.  At the moment Wexford County Council are seeking to build houses in two very small purely rural villages.  The Department are insisting on an elaborate plan which will increase the cost of the houses so much that the future tenants who, we know, will be agricultural labourers will be unable to pay the rents.  From time to time we have asked the Minister and his Department to accept a modified plan so that the rents would conform with the people's ability to pay.  There is nothing so bad as that local authorities should build houses for which the prospective tenants will be unable to pay rent. Like other local authorities Wexford County Council pay a substantial subsidy to each rural house they build and there is a limit to what the local ratepayers can pay just as there is a limit to what the agricultural worker can pay in rent.  I would ask the Minister to sanction the Wexford County Council's own proposals to build houses in those two villages.</P>
    <P>I need not mention the names as they are well known and on the records of the Department.  The county council are the best judges of what the people can pay in rent.  There is no use in telling me that an architect or someone else in the Department of Local Government can judge what an agricultural labourer can pay in any part of Leinster or of the country. They cannot.  It is madness, insanity, to build houses for which the tenants cannot pay rent.  We want no evictions. We want to put our people into houses on which they can pay the rent.  I hope, therefore, that we will get sanction for our proposals.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about delays in house building.  One or two Opposition Deputies were satisfied, but others tried to indicate that there was no progress whatever.  There has been great progress, progress on an even keel.  A large number of houses are finished each year.  It is impossible to house three-fourths of the community in a few years.  An effort was made to do that two or three years ago when <Col N="1737" /> everybody in the country was to be rehoused in one year and that seriously drove up the cost of building.  We should build in a normal way.  I venture to say that during the last 20 years 50 per cent. of our population have been rehoused.  With the same rate of progress, I have no doubt that in five or ten years all who need to be rehoused will have got better dwellings.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of this country the Minister has given 100 per cent. of the proceeds of the Road Fund to local authorities to help in the reconstruction of the roads, but he has been greatly criticised because he did not go to the Exchequer for more. Since I came into this House the Road Fund has been raided by successive Governments and large sums from it have been spent on other things than the improvement of the roads.  I think that the Minister is to be commended on his progressive outlook in making available the proceeds of the Road Fund to local authorities for the improvement of roads.  All that is wrong with the Road Fund is that it is not large enough.  I am afraid that with all the traffic on the roads and the huge tonnage motor vehicles haul, much more money must be made available either from the Central Fund or from the local authorities.  The community will be forced to provide much larger sums in future for the highways.</P>
    <P>If the roads are made carry all the commerce and traffic and none at all is to go on the railways, a much larger sum, many millions, must be provided within the next few years to make these highways capable of carrying all the commerce of the country.  That is all dovetailed into the transport policy of the future, but what that may be I do not know.  I want to make one suggestion to the Minister, who has responsibility in one direction at least.  There is power under the Road Traffic Act of 1933 to limit the tonnage allowed over any road.  It is about time the Minister made an investigation as to whether tonnage of 30 tons and upwards should be drawn over roads incapable of carrying that tonnage.  It is a serious matter and one that local <Col N="1738" /> authorities down the country are perturbed about.  If the tonnage continues to grow as it has grown in the last five years, in a short time the motor vehicles on our roads will be drawing 100 tons&mdash;that is, within a foreseeable period of time.  In the last ten years the weight carried has gone up from six or eight tons to 30 or 35 tons and if we proceed at the same rate we will have loads of 100 tons being drawn behind motor vehicles in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to think that insufficient money is provided this year for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I am of the opinion that the amount is quite sufficient.  If the Minister had all the money in the world, he would be wise not to provide it for these works at the same rate as previously.  My experience of the way it was spent in my own county and some adjoining counties is that there was a lot of wasteful expenditure.  I agree that an amount of useful work was done, but many men were taken out of permanent employment and employed on these works and when the particular job was over they were left without any employment and had to emigrate. All these problems were created because there was too much money and proper supervision was not provided in a certain period.</P>
    <P>We would like to see men get employment in rural areas, but a large number of those employed in my county under this Act left permanent employment in order to get into local authority employment and the results were very bad.  No provision was made by the Department, apparently &mdash;for what reason, I do not know&mdash;to have those schemes properly supervised. The engineers who were supposed to supervise them had already too much money at their disposal to spend on housing, roads and everything else; and there was no planning before many of these works under the Act were started and there was bad, wasteful and needless expenditure as a result.  An engineer is given the job of building so many houses in a year, looking after all the pumps, wells, water and sewerage <Col N="1739" /> schemes and looking after hundreds of miles of roads and has a big pile of public money to spend.  He could not possibly supervise the spending of all that public money and at the same time take on the planning of jobs under this Act and their supervision afterwards.  Therefore, that money was looked on as manna from Heaven and there did not seem to be any consideration given to the manner in which it was spent or whether there would be a good return or not.  That was was my feeling about it&mdash;that the public looked upon it as money you could not spend half fast enough.  It was treated like jack-stones.</P>

      <P>My criticism is that if the Minister had all the money in the world he would be wise in curtailing the amount to be spent this year under this Act.  If he is providing more money for the roads, I suggest it can be more usefully spent in improving many miles of the county roads that badly need improvement.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins spoke of an area in his constituency&mdash;I do not know it and am not competent to speak about it&mdash;and I gathered that this area is in the middle of bogs where he stated that a considerable number of human beings were living in bad hovels and wanted a type of house built that has not been built in any part of the whole State to rehouse these people.  He said the bog was incapable of carrying the smallest type of standard house.  If so many human beings are in a bad bog in an isolated place like that, the sooner they are moved out the better. They should be moved inland sufficiently far to give them housing under decent conditions on a site suitable for housing.  I am surprised at Deputy O'Higgins advocating the continuance of so many human beings in such a state as he described here.  If he has influence with them, he should advise them to seek houses more inland, to get the local authorities of Laois-Offaly to provide them with houses on suitable sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood they had bogs of their own, that producing turf there gave them their livelihood and nothing else.  That is what I gathered from Deputy O'Higgins.  They could travel three or four miles to cut turf, as tens of thousands do in the country and it would be far better for them to be decently housed than to live under such bad conditions in the centre of a bog.  They should not continue living there and I am sure the medical officer of health in that district would condemn the idea of rehousing those people in that place.</P>
      <P>We had another charge against the Minister from Deputy O'Higgins.  I was very surprised that he developed it and it convinced me he has not taken proper steps to see that his powder was dry and the priming properly in order before he shot the bolt.  Anyhow, it was a damp squib.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give sanction to the plans that local authorities have drawn up after full consideration from all aspects, for rehousing the people.  I ask that sanction be given to those plans that the local authorities think most suitable for the people in those areas.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the policy is to be in the future on road traffic speeds.  Some local authorities believe there should be speed limits in certain towns where main lines of traffic pass through.  It appears that it is the Garda authorities, in conjunction with the Minister, who are responsible for speed limits, if any are needed.  I am told the law does not seem too clear as to who is to initiate requests for such speed limits.  I understand the local authorities do not come into it&mdash;that it is the Gardaí and the Minister who arrange it.  Many local authorities are anxious to have these speed limits and the local Gardaí are of the same opinion, but there is no machinery under the law that we are aware of for initiating such proposals.  I hope the Minister will advert to that when he is replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be doing my duty if I did not refresh the Minister's mind on the unanimous protest that was made at a meeting of Kilkenny County Council at the slashing of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  When the measure was brought in here, there was a lot of opposition and the Party opposite went into the Lobby eight or nine times to oppose it.  Apparently they realised the value of that measure and knew it would be good for the country.  As they were in opposition we cannot blame them too much if they wanted to have that postponed as long as possible.  Our council, which consists of members of every Party that is represented in the Dáil, protested unanimously against it.  They felt that a lot of good useful work, which would give useful employment, could have been given under that Act.  Apparently, the scheme is being dwindled away and I expect that in a year or two it will have disappeared.</P>
      <P>There was one passage in the Minister's opening statement at which I smiled.  He said that the Department examine every local scheme sent up so that they may reduce costs and reduce the rents of the houses to the people who will occupy them.  I have experience of one local authority; I cannot speak for the others but I take it that what happens in one local authority happens in every local authority, and that the policy of the administration that deals with every local authority is the same in each case, that it is the general policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that, due to the energies of local authorities, backed up and supported by whatever Government was in power, we have come to the end of slum clearance in my native city and county and we are now dealing with overcrowding.  We have carried out various good schemes.  Portion of one scheme was opened by the late Deputy Murphy.  The balance was opened by the former Minister.  Deputy Keyes.  It consisted of 250 houses.  It was a very difficult scheme to lay out, covering many acres of ground.  I had the pleasure of being with the present Minister when he opened a further housing scheme which also was rather <Col N="1742" /> difficult in its way because in the middle of the scheme there was a churchyard and an electricity power station, which made laying out very difficult.  The late Deputy Murphy, Deputy Keyes and the present Minister, Deputy Smith, paid tribute to the corporation and the officials in Kilkenny for the wonderful lay-out of those schemes and that tribute was well justified.</P>
    <P>Another scheme was started, which is in process of completion at present. We are continuing the good work.  Our engineer thought that he could not handle the whole business and asked the county manager to sanction the employment of a second assistant engineer to help him.  He has already one assistant engineer.  The county manager, like all officials, took the easy way&mdash;cover yourself at all costs&mdash;red tape.  He applied to the Department of Local Government for sanction for a second assistant engineer.  Such an engineer might be employed for five months at £8 or £10 a week.  That would cost £160 or £200.  We would know where we stood.  It would mean so much extra cost.  What happened? An order came back to the county manager, not to employ another engineer, but to get an architect.  We have already completed a building scheme of 250 houses, another of 99 and another of 80 to 100 houses.  We were finishing up the simplest scheme and the Local Government Department said that we were to get an architect.  Without acquainting the corporation, without asking the opinion of the local body that had spent days buying land by agreement, trying to make the best bargain for the people who will occupy the houses&mdash;the local authority was overlooked both by the Minister and the manager&mdash;an architect was foisted on us.  An architect will cost us at least £5,000 or £6,000.  It will increase the cost of those houses by at least 1/-or 1/6 per week.</P>
    <P>That is why I smiled when the Minister said that all schemes are examined in the Department of Local Government with a view to reducing costs. Yet, in connection with a scheme in Kilkenny, which was the last scheme and the simplest scheme, the Minister <Col N="1743" /> for Local Government insisted that we should employ an architect.</P>
    <P>We sent a deputation to the manager with a view to having that matter changed.  The manager said: &ldquo;No, the Department of Local Government have sanctioned it; the Minister has sanctioned it; I cannot go back on it.&rdquo; It is a terrible thing that in 1952 the Minister for Local Government would put at least 1/- or 1/6 on houses in Kilkenny.  We are most anxious to cut down the cost of those houses because building materials, timber, slates and everything else, have increased tremendously and even in the normal way the houses would be dearer than they have been for the past couple of years.  We never anticipated this bombshell from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Minister know that an architect was appointed.  Did that letter from the manager seeking sanction for an engineer ever come to him? I doubt it because the Minister, being a member of a local authority, would hardly sanction that.  Apparently, red tape is returning.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Desmond said he hoped the Minister will not adopt the dictatorial policy that was adopted in the past.  I am afraid he has adopted it.  There is a strange parallel. in 1945, when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Local Government, we were establishing playgrounds in Kilkenny. Deputy MacEntee had not confidence in our local engineer.  He said: &ldquo;You must get a landscape artist.&rdquo;  I would love the present Minister for Finance to come down to see the result of the landscape artist in Kilkenny.  The landscape artist collected his fees&mdash;£900 or £1,000&mdash;from Kilkenny Corporation.  We had to pay for the landscape artist.  I do not blame the landscape artist; we had not finished the scheme, I suppose, completely, but somebody says that Deputy MacEntee ought to come to Kilkenny and see the result of his landscape artist.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>No boats have been specially built to the order of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in Germany.  The board decided that, for very special reasons, they should get a few deep-sea boats as quickly as possible and it so happened that boats of a very suitable kind became available in Germany. They made arrangements to purchase them.  The over-all length of the boats is approximately 100 feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have investigated the complaint of privilege made in the House yesterday by Deputy J. A. Costello, when he reported that an assault had been made on Deputy Seán Collins by the Minister for Education in the precincts of the House a short while previously.</P>
      <P>In investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident, I interviewed the parties concerned and had for my information several reports from officials who had some knowledge of this regrettable occurrence.  There is no practical difference between the parties concerned as to the actual events.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the facts are substantially as stated by Deputy Costello, the Minister for Education being admittedly the aggressor and having assaulted Deputy Collins.  I find that this assault constituted an action in contempt of Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me that the reason for his action was in retaliation of a charge against the personal honour of a fellow-member of his Party made by Deputy Collins the night before.  This cannot be considered in any sense as justifying or mitigating the offence.  The charge, however, made by Deputy Seán Collins on the previous evening against Deputy Killilea was in violation of the Rules of Order of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> As the incident complained of by Deputy J.A. Costello occurred outside the Dáil Chamber, it is not covered by the rules adopted by the Dáil which vest in the Ceann Comhairle the power of dealing with disorder in the House itself.  The incident, however, constituting an act in contempt of Parliament, falls to be dealt with by Dáil Éireann in such manner as the members may in their wisdom decide.</P>
    <P>Such action must be taken in accordance with the rules governing the procedure by which decisions are reached in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, through you, Sir, as the person who is primarily charged with the responsibility for safeguarding the privileges of members of Dáil Éireann and of upholding the Rules of Order of the House, which are so essential for the maintenance of parliamentary democracy, I would like to ask the Taoiseach, as Leader of the House, what action he proposes to take following the statement made by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is essential for the reputation of this House and, ultimately, for the safeguarding of representative government, that incidents such as those that have occurred recently should be prevented in so far as it is at all possible to do so.</P>
      <P>It is not enough when these incidents are reported that there should be simply an apology.  A great deal of harm has been done, and there is only one way that I know to deal with the matter, and that is to institute here, as we do elsewhere, a definite rule of law which will govern cases of that sort.  As you, Sir, have explained, we have not any such definite code apparently to cover it.  At one time I pointed out that this question of privilege needed examination and had proposed, and did indeed at the time get a majority decision from this House, in favour of it, setting up a committee to deal with this whole question of privilege and the maintenance of the rights of this House.  It was thought proper by the Opposition at the time not to co-operate in the intention of that resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> I think the time has come when we ought definitely to set up a committee, either of the two Houses or of this House alone, to go into this whole question of privilege, abusive personal remarks and personal imputations, which are the cause of incidents of this sort, because, apparently, the view is that there is no protection given in this House against such remarks, and that those who wish to protect themselves against imputations of that sort have to take, so to speak, the law into their own hands.  That is deplorable.  The way to prevent it is to have definite rules of order agreed upon with definite penalties which can be enforced to prevent personal imputations from being cast from one side of the House to the other.  These imputations are obviously irrelevant to debate.  This is supposed to be a deliberative Assembly, where we decide a question as a result of argument on the definite merits of the question.  Personal attacks are irrelevant in regard to that, and it is essential, therefore, that strong penalties should be enforced against people who are guilty of making such imputations.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to get at the root of this matter and, therefore, I suggest that later on, as you have indicated, Sir, the action which will have to be taken by the House will have to be taken in accordance with the rules laid down.  I would propose to consider this whole question and similar previous incidents which have occurred recently, and bring a motion to this House that a committee of the House or of the two Houses be set up to deal with this whole question of privilege which will cover not merely actions in this House and in the precincts of this House but actions outside the immediate precincts.  I have not made up my mind as to any further steps that can be taken or should be taken at the moment, but I do agree that this sort of thing should not be allowed to continue as, if it did, it would bring into disrepute all our parliamentary institutions because it would tend to develop. I propose, therefore, that we should deal with this matter and set up such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express dissatisfaction with the statement of <Col N="1761" /> the Taoiseach.  I do not wish to say anything in the course of the few remarks which I intend to make which would in any way exacerbate the feelings which have been aroused as a result of recent incidents.  Much might be said, perhaps, on both sides about them.  Much might be said upon the degree of forbearance which members of my Party have had to exercise in the interests of the decorum of this House in recent months.</P>
      <P>The matter which I wish to underline and emphasise at the moment is that we are dealing with a particular incident, one of the gravest which has occurred in the history of this Parliament since it was established 30 years ago.  The Taoiseach has not dealt with that particular incident.  He has endeavoured&mdash;I hope it is not merely with a view to drawing a red herring over the real gravity of the affair&mdash;to deal with the general question as to whether or not there ought to be penalties attaching to statements made by Deputies in the course of parliamentary debate or breaches of privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion which he has made undoubtedly raises issues of very serious import.  On its face, it appears very simple to say that we ought to have an inquiry into the proper method of finding adequate measures to deal with breaches of parliamentary privileges by Deputies.  There would, however, also have to be safeguards in any measure proposed as a result of such inquiry against a tyranny which might be imposed upon Parliament by a parliamentary majority.  I venture to say that merely for the purpose of demonstrating that it is no simple matter to decide it in the way the Taoiseach has suggested to decide it and that in making that suggestion he has side-tracked the issue before us now, that without provocation a Minister of State has committed an unprovoked assault, accompanied by very unwarranted language, upon a Deputy of the Opposition.  I want to know what steps in reference to that particular incident the Taoiseach proposes as Leader of the House to take because we on this side of the House cannot, or at all events the Fine <Col N="1762" /> Gael Party cannot allow the matter to remain in the way suggested by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this is a matter to be dealt with by the House itself.  I know of no better way of doing it than by setting up a committee to deal with it and with the general question which it raises.  Justice demands in a case of this sort that it is not simply the disease but the cause of the disease that has to be dealt with and, if this is to be done properly, it will have to be dealt with as a general question and, if it is thought proper, it can be regarded as having reference back, but I do not see very well how it would be possible to have rules for penalties which would apply to an offence which was committed before the rules were made.  The fact is that we have no means definitely in this House of dealing with it except by the House itself and, if it is desired by the House, we will give time for a motion that a committee be set up to investigate this and other incidents.  I think the only way in which we can deal with this matter is to deal with it as one of a number of incidents which have occurred, and occurred for the same reason.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition says that a great deal of restraint has to be exercised by members on the other side.  There ought to be no reason for restraint, because it ought to be impossible under the Rules of Order for a person to make imputations here and sit down quietly afterwards.  These things should be prevented at their source and that is what I propose to the House.</P>

      <P>I still must express extreme dissatisfaction at the attitude of the Taoiseach.  He is evading the issue which is that a Minister of State has assaulted without any justification a private member of this House.  That is the incident that has to be dealt with irrespective of whether or not other incidents require to be investigated or require to be considered.  If the Taoiseach does not wish to take any other action except to consider the matter and to set up a <Col N="1763" /> committee such as he suggested, then we must take action on our own.  I want to make this further and final observation.  This Parliament has been in existence for nearly 30 years.  During a great part of that time there was great and serious strife amongst the Parties in the House and outside the House.  There was violent controversy in this House from time to time.  But until the last 12 months no such incidents as assaults by Deputies on other Deputies occurred.</P>

I admit that when provocation is given, one should not give way to it.  I want to see, however, before you take any action in a particular case, that there are sufficiently strong rules to prevent any possibility of provocation.  I feel that it would be unjust to deal with the results without dealing with the causes.</P>

Deputy Collins is reported as having stated: &ldquo;You shot off your toe on the eve of a pension&rdquo;.  This slander is published in a number of Irish and cross-Channel papers, leaving me in the unfortunate position of having no redress.  I ask, Sir, to be given this opportunity of putting it on record that I received this, which was only my first wound, while I was on active service against the Black-and-Tans with my active service unit of the South Mayo Brigade on the 5th May, 1921.  There was then no question of pensions.  I was called to St. Bricin's Hospital, where I was operated on, on the 6th October, 1924, and had further treatment there on the 6th February, 1925.  Official records can bear this out.  It is not, therefore, true, as <Col N="1766" /> stated by Deputy Collins, that I shot off my toe on the eve of a pension.  I would ask Deputy Collins to withdraw his statement, as that is the only redress&mdash;and little redress it is&mdash;that I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, there was a parallel in these two actions, the action of the Minister for Local Government in 1952 in insisting on our taking in Kilkenny an architect to lay out a very simple building scheme and in Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Local Government in 1947, insisting on our employing a landscape artist. The people of Kilkenny, as I said, lost £900 in that case which could well have been spent on these parks.  I suppose I can get no redress for Kilkenny by raising this matter here but I do hope that, in the rest of the country, the Local Government Department will not foist unnecessary architects on local authorities where they are not required. We hoped in recent years to complete these parks through unemployment relief grants but that has been turned down by the Local Government Department. I would ask the Minister to allow us use money made available through grants for the relief of unemployment which I am sure should be much greater this year than in the past owing to the large amount of unemployment in Kilkenny, for the very useful purpose of completing our playgrounds in Kilkenny and not to compel us to resort to other ways of <Col N="1767" /> getting the necessary funds.  These serve a very useful purpose and it is a matter of the Minister allowing us to use the money for the completion of the playgrounds.</P>
      <P>At our county council meetings, members frequently ask the county engineer: &ldquo;What is the idea of all the road widening that you are doing and why not spend the money where it is badly wanted, on the county roads?&rdquo; The county roads are in a desperate condition in parts of the county.  I admit that the main roads are in good condition and that anyone can travel on them.  But, as I say, members frequently ask the county engineer: &ldquo;Why not spend this money which you are devoting to the widening of corners on some of the county roads?&rdquo; The usual reply which we get from the county engineer is that the money is allocated for that purpose, that it is a free grant from the Government and that if we do not accept that free grant and spend it on the widening of these bends and other works we will not get it.  As a matter of fact, I do not know whether it is actually a free grant or not.  I believe it is to the extent of 80 per cent. or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country members, who come from areas where the roads are in a bad condition, cannot understand that. I do not say that the roads in all parts of the county are in a bad condition, and in that connection I would like to pay a tribute to the county engineer for the very good work that he is doing.  The members from the country, as I say, find it very hard to understand why thousands and thousands of pounds should be spent on the widening of bends on main roads while most of the roads in their own areas are in a bad condition.  Most farmers, if they can afford it at all, find it a necessity to have a motor car at the present time.  It is not a luxury for them, because the main roads in their present condition are not suitable for horse traffic.  When I say that I do not mean that they are in a bad condition.  The position is otherwise, but the fact is that they are dangerous, if you like, for horse traffic.  The farmers are not looking for any luxuries when they ask that the county roads should be kept <Col N="1768" /> in good condition.  Personally, I would be anxious myself to see that the main roads were not allowed to deteriorate. They are a valuable asset to the country and if they were neglected for a couple of years we know the job we would have in restoring them afterwards. I would again emphasise that, in my opinion, the money which is given by way of free grant by the Government could be spent to greater advantage on the county roads than on the widening and straightening of bends on main roads.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to bring to the Minister's attention is this.  At present, we have several regional water schemes before the Department.  Some of them have been with the Department for a number of years.  The people in the areas which these schemes are intended to serve feel that they are being shelved completely, shelved at one time by the county council and at another time by the Department of Local Government. Rumour has it that the Department is going to throw obstacle after obstacle in the way of the county council so that the Department itself will not have to contribute its share of the grant towards the provision of these regional water schemes.  I do not know whether that is a fact or not.  Will the Minister tell me why these schemes are being held up?  There are many people who possibly would have got in a water supply to their homes except for the fact that there was the prospect of these regional water schemes being provided in their areas.  Will the Minister tell me when these schemes are going to be sanctioned or whether it is a fact that they are being held up?</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities know well, of course, how a scheme can be held up.  The Department can write back to the local authority asking for particulars, and that kind of thing can go on month after month and indeed for years.  All members of local authorities are well aware of that.  In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister two questions: (1) will he allow us to use the unemployment relief grant this year for the completion of our playgrounds; and (2) will he tell me if the hold-up in regard to sanction for these <Col N="1769" /> regional water schemes is due to want of money, and if not, will he hurry up and get them going as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>During the past ten or 12 years a series of distressing tragedies have occurred as a result of unprotected harbours, jetties and canals.  Motor cars travelling on the roadways have gone over the edge into the water and quite a number of people have been drowned.  This is a problem which, I suggest, local authorities in the towns and cities should deal with immediately.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say, as has been said frequently, that these accidents are the result of careless driving.  The fact is that there is no protection whatever provided and no indication given, in many cases, that there is a waterway adjacent to the public road.  We know that if a local authority is engaged on road repair work, if it is merely engaged in taking up the surface of the road to a depth of three or four inches, it is obliged by law to put up barricades and to provide red lights at night so as to give warning to the public.  In that case, the only danger to a car is that if it goes through the barricade a few springs may get broken, but if a person drives a car over the edge of a pier there is, in many cases, loss of life, sometimes of one or more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been raised repeatedy over the years and public attention has been drawn to it, but so far nothing has been done.  We know that there are certain difficulties in protecting places where boats unload, but I think these difficulties could be overcome by providing some sort of a barrier&mdash;by doing something that, at least, would warn the public of the danger, and particularly a person driving a motor car along the road at night.  In the absence of any such warning, he is likely to feel that there is no danger whatever in front of him until he has actually driven over the edge.  That has happened far too often to be ignored.  I am afraid the position is that what is everybody's business is nobody's business.  I think, however, that the Minister for Local <Col N="1770" /> Government, who is the chief executive authority in this matter, might give it his attention by issuing a directive to local authorities that some action must be taken.  Even a warning notice would, in many cases, be sufficient to avoid some of the accidents that have occurred.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate on this Estimate, but I should like to express my agreement with the general principle that it is good to increase the grants for road construction even though that has to be at the expense of the grants made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There is a considerable amount of work to be done under that Act, but I think it is not as extensive as the amount of work that requires to be done in regard to the roads.  I think that the grants made available in the current year under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are sufficient, if continued year after year, to liquidate all the work that requires to be done under that particular Act.  All that a reduction of the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act would mean is that the number of years taken to complete a work might be somewhat extended. That would be compensated for by an increase in the grants for road construction. I think it is essential that these grants for road construction should, in the main, be provided for county roads. I think that our main roads have reached a fairly high standard though they are not, perhaps, perfect.  The removal or the banking of a particular corner on a road does not make the road safe to any great extent but it makes it possible for traffic to travel faster on it.  Speed does not always imply safety.  The more you make the roads suitable for high speeding the more accidents will occur.  Let us be satisfied with the tar-bound roads we have.  They may not be perfect but they are satisfactory.  We should put a tar-bound surface on many of our county roads so that they will be in a position to take the traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not hold the view that the tar-bound road benefits only the motorist. It benefits also the man who uses a push bike.  Experience has shown us that no other surface will stand up to <Col N="1771" /> modern traffic except the tar-bound road.  Our aim should be, with the cooperation of the local authorities and of the Department of Local Government, to ensure that the mileage of untarred roads will be reduced as quickly as possible.  While I accept the principle that grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act should be reduced, and that grants for roads should be increased, I think that, on the whole, the grants for roads should be directed towards those roads which have not a tar-bound surface.  The matter should be examined from the point of view of ensuring that no county suffers financial loss as a result of a change.  In other words, whatever the total grants for drainage work, road construction and maintenance were last year or the year before, or any year, they should be maintained in the future, and even increased.  I know it is a difficult matter, but the Minister should search out ways and means of finding additional money to help towards the reconstruction of our county roads.  This is an urgent problem, and it should be solved as quickly as possible by the provision of additional grants.</P>
    <P>In the main, we are making rapid progress towards the solution of the housing problem.  I agree with those Deputies who said that the credit should not go entirely to the Minister. I think a very substantial portion of the credit should go to the local authorities and their staffs, who are grappling with this problem to the best of their ability.  I do not think we should have wranglings by the different Parties as to what they did.  No matter what Government may be in office, the local authorities will grapple with this problem.  The sooner they can cope with it the sooner it will be solved.  In many counties the problem is approaching complete solution.  A very great deal of work has been done in County Wicklow.  I do not think any county can show a greater volume of work in the urban and rural areas than County Wicklow.  The Minister paid a recent visit to Arklow to open a housing scheme there.  If he wished to be critical, I think he could not find very much to complain about in respect of the standard of the houses provided in <Col N="1772" /> Arklow and in other urban areas in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The same is true to a greater extent in regard to the houses provided in County Wicklow for rural workers.  They are all very nice and very attractive.  I think that the people who live in them are very proud of them.  The majority of the working people appreciate what is being done for them by the local authorities and they try to keep the houses in the best possible condition.</P>
    <P>Now that we are nearing the solution of the housing problem, particularly in the rural areas, I appeal for a little more consideration for a person who applies to have a house built for him.  There is a sort of rule in the Department&mdash;I suppose it began at the time when the housing position was very bad&mdash;that the person in the greatest need should get the house.  In theory, that sounds all right but in practice it may work out very unfairly to the person concerned and also from a national point of view.  Take, for instance, a young worker in a rural area who decides to get married.  He probably approaches his employer or some other farmer for a site.  Having secured the site, he applies to the county council to have a house built on it.  When the house is completed somebody who perhaps has failed to pay rent in another county and happens to be living in some tumbledown shack or cowshed adjacent to the new house gets preference over the man who, in the first instance, applied to have the house built and who is deserving in every way.  That state of affairs should not be permitted to continue.  The farmer should have some way of ensuring that the person who has applied for the site gets the house which is built on it. The Minister should clarify this position immediately.  People who acquire the site in the first instance and who then apply to have a house built on it should have a definite assurance that the house will be given to them.</P>
    <P>There are other people whose applications should now be more carefully considered.  I refer to ageing single persons and ageing married <Col N="1773" /> persons without families.  The married persons may have had children who are now grown up and gone away and they may be badly in need of housing accommodation.  Some provision should be made for such people. In many cases a small two-roomed house would be quite sufficient for aged single people.  It is possible that local authorities have a terrace of houses or an odd house here and there too small for a young family but which would be quite suitable for ageing single or married persons.  It would be a good idea to give these houses to these people rather than demolish them, as frequently happens. I think such houses should be set aside for the use of ageing single and married persons who require accommodation.</P>
    <P>As regards this Estimate there is not very much room for contention or controversy.  In the main good work is being done.  Good work can never be done without money and the serious problem is to find the money in such a way that it will give least offence or injury to the persons from whom it is extracted.  As far as road making is concerned we ought to get somewhat larger grants for the county roads.  I believe that the burden of rates has reached the limit beyond which it cannot be further increased.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say I am not satisfied with the working out of the scheme for the superannuation of road workers.  It has created a tremendous number of difficult problems for the local authorities.  It would be far better if it had never been introduced because, after all, a road worker is no more entitled to receive superannuation than an agricultural worker.  They are doing much the same type of work and the attempt to provide superannuation for road workers has created a situation in which men have to be registered as permanent road workers and registered at a time when there is not a steady quantity of work available. The amount of work available to road workers fluctuates from time to time and fluctuates in the different areas. It is impossible to get a permanent staff of road workers working a certain <Col N="1774" /> number of days per year throughout the length and breadth of the county, but where the injustice arises is that you have single men on the permanent staff of the local county councils and when employment becomes available they get the preference for the work over married men with families.  That is wrong and undesirable and it is a matter which should be looked into. If a man is unmarried, has no dependents whatever and he is on the staff of a county council as a permanent worker he is not entitled to work which may be available in preference to a married man who may have nine or ten children depending upon him.  That is an injustice that ought not to exist.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look into the working of this superannuation Act to see whether the whole thing is worth while in view of the recent legislation particularly in regard to social welfare, which includes benefit of many kinds. I know that it is very difficult to put back the hands of the clock once you have taken a certain action.  In a matter of this kind it is very difficult to undo what has been done, particularly as vested interests arise.  If you deduct an allowance out of men's wages you must compensate them if you cannot carry out what is intended.  As I have said, it is a matter which has created difficult problems and complications for local authorities.  It also involves the keeping of an increased staff working overtime, perhaps, in the county council offices, keeping a check on every hour of work that is done by road workers throughout the length and breadth of the county.  The whole thing was an ill-considered piece of legislation, but I am in considerable sympathy with the Minister in that it is very difficult to rectify mistakes of this kind once they are made.</P>

      <P>I cannot find myself in agreement with the surprising statement made by the last speaker that he is quite satisfied, and he thinks it is a good thing that grants towards the Local Authorities (Works) Act should be reduced and the amount involved given to the roads.  But it is not given to the roads.  The first thing I want to point out to Deputy Cogan is that the amount of the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants was reduced from <Col N="1775" /> £1,220,000 to £650,000, and that the balance of £570,000, which the present Government has refused to give to drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, has not been given for road grants or for any other form of rural improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why Deputy Cogan makes the surprising statement that road works are more important than drainage, unless it is that he is prepared to support the present Government in a very servile manner in carrying out what he himself must know is altogether a wrong policy. Without going very deeply into the history of drainage in this country, we all know that it has been neglected for the last 40 or 50 years or so, with the result that the whole drainage network in this country, whether in regard to arterial drainage or in regard to the small drains, has gone into a very serious state of disrepair.  It is common knowledge to those in Government Departments, who have the means of ascertaining it, that an area approximating to 4,000,000 acres of the best land of this country is absolutely useless for want of drainage.  The amount of approximately £2,000,000 per year that was being provided towards the Local Authorities (Works) Act drainage during the period of the inter-Party Government was meagre by comparison with the actual requirements, that is if we are sincere in tackling the drainage problem of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what Deputy Cogan or anybody else may say in extenuation of the present position one thing Fianna Fáil stands condemned for is that, when they were canvassing for support to form a Government immediately after the election and before this Dáil sat for the first time, they stated in their 17-point programme that the Local Authorities (Works) Act drainage, <Col N="1776" /> among many other things, would be done better than the inter-Party Government had been doing.  I wonder how did those Deputies who were fooled in supporting the present Government feel when they opened the Book of Estimates and found that one of the most important items, drainage&mdash;sub-head K in this particular Vote&mdash;had been cut by half.</P>
    <P>That is the cheapest possible kind of political trickery for which my vocabulary cannot find a more suitable name. It is a very cheap kind of political trickery.  The proper attitude for those Deputies would be to admit that they had been fooled by the promises that were made in supporting the present Government, and instead of servilely supporting the Government, to break away from them.  I remember when Deputy Cogan was a member of our Party and when he was an independent. farmer Deputy, he supported strongly the kind of drainage which our Party supported then approximating to the Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they had.  It is the representatives on the local authority who select the works to be carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know if Deputy Cogan is a member of a local authority. If he is, he is displaying a serious lack of knowledge as to what his rights and duties are as a member of that body.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the work done under this Act in every county of the Twenty-Six Counties, particularly in the counties along the western seaboard where there is an abnormally heavy rainfall, was excellent and met with the approval of all concerned.  I want to see good roads in the country and it is within the competence of the Government to enable the country to have good roads by providing the necessary grants.  One finds, however, that the money provided for drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been slashed by half.  One finds that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the Board of Works has not in a full year opened any new arterial drainage scheme.  It is not difficult to infer what the Government's policy is in relation to drainage in general.  The Arterial Drainage Act was passed in 1945 and stuck away in a pigeon hole for three or four years.  Not one penny of the £7,000,000 provided under the Bill was spent on drainage during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government, in order to secure power, made certain promises to the electorate just as the Minister for Finance did in connection with the tax on beer and tobacco.  The moment they took office they went back on those promises.  It is not so much the fault of the Government as the fault of those who sit behind them that they have broken their promises.  If there were two or three in the Fianna Fáil Party, not to mention any others, who were prepared to call the bluff something might be done.  Apparently there are not even three prepared to tell the Taoiseach and his Ministers that they will not stand for double-crossing.  The Fianna Fáil Government promised that if returned to power they would carry <Col N="1778" /> on the work the inter-Party Government was doing and do it in a much better way.  Their method of carrying on the work in a much better way is to slash all the grants that were given.</P>
    <P>There is an alarming increase in rates and that increase is contributing in no small degree to the flight from the land.  Some solution must be found to the problem.  All over the world at the present time there is an inexplicable desire for people to congregate in villages, towns and cities and leave the countryside practically denuded of population.  We will hasten that process here if we do not do something to bring about a decrease in the rates. When the Fianna Fáil Government was in power from 1932 to 1948 they were perpetually passing Acts allegedly conferring benefits on the people, and the whole burden of the expense under those Acts was placed on the rate-payers. It is always very easy to give a man a present with some of his own money.  Apparently that was the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government up to 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was and Deputy Cogan knows that.  He knows that this time last year he waded in behind the boys on the Government Benches.  Even after 16 years he does not seem to realise exactly what the worth is of a Fianna Fáil promise. It has as much value as a puff of smoke.  Rates should be stabilised at a certain ceiling.  If that is not done smallholdings will be denuded and the flight from the land will be accentuated. If that is the policy of the Government, it should definitely be stated so that we know where we stand.</P>
      <P>Statements made by some of the Ministers would seem to indicate that that is the policy, and we want to have the air cleared once and for all.  If the small farmer is, according to Fianna Fáil, merely a nuisance they should say so.  I do not agree that he is a nuisance.  I do not come in here to whinge and cry for something for the small farmer to which he may not be entitled in justice, but it will be a serious loss to the country if the small farmer vanishes, and he is vanishing fast.  The Minister must know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies in his own Party must be well aware of all the houses throughout the country that are shuttered up and boarded up, and the lands lying derelict.  I think the small farmer is a most valuable man.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the unsatisfactory position in connection with rates <Col N="1780" /> on out-office buildings.  Losses in crops, farming tools, machinery and live stock because of insufficient housing are enormous.  The Minister may tell me that the office of the Commissioner for Valuation comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Finance.  That is so, but the Minister for Local Government should bring these facts to the notice of the Government and of his colleagues, and press for a complete change of policy in relation to rates on out-office buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that this system of putting an increased valuation on property whenever a farmer increases or improves his out-office accommodation is a relic of the landlord times, nothing more than a carry over from the times when, if a tenant put in new windows, whitewashed his house or kept it better than his neighbour's, the way the landlord showed his gratitude was by immediately increasing the rent.  It is a shameful thing that in this year we should still carry on one of the methods by which the landlord sought to oppress the farmers in years gone by.</P>
    <P>I should be quite satisfied if I saw the day when the rates as at present were made to stand and any other new out-office buildings put up by the farmer were left free of rates, as they ought to be.  In case the problem would present too many insuperable difficulties, I am quite prepared to agree to that.  If we stabilised the rates and if each farmer built a good deal of extra accommodation, what loss would it be to the State or anybody in the State?</P>
    <P>In this rainy climate, although this year is an exception, the loss of crops because they are not housed must run, at a mild guess, into the region of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 a year and the loss of farm tools, machinery and equipment, because they are not housed, because the farmer dare not increase his out-office accommodation in order to house them, must be very serious.  A good deal of our machinery comes from foreign parts, and we use the very best machinery, whether imported or made at home, and the fact that we are afraid to build out-office accommodation because the reviser will be immediately on our doorstep so that <Col N="1781" /> it cannot be housed and must be allowed to rust away in the open, is a scandalous state of affairs.  The Minister may give me as an explanation that it is a matter for the Commissioners of Valuation and the Minister for Finance, but he is a member of the Government and if the phrase that we have heard bandied about here so much, the collective responsibility of the Government, means anything, the Minister cannot shirk his responsibility so easily.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a purely local matter in the town of Westport.  I was in contact with the Minister's Department and with the Minister some time ago with regard to the matter.  When a local authority drainage scheme runs through an urban area, whose is the responsibility for carrying out the whole job?  Has the county surveyor the right to carry out the work, not alone in the rural area, but in the portion of the urban area through which it runs?  There seems to be a serious difference of opinion about the work in the Westport area in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Local Authorities (Works) Act to which I want to refer.  A good deal of land rehabilitation under the land rehabilitation scheme is held up for want of drainage which could usefully be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and I want to impress on the Minister that in the case of certain arterial drainage schemes the removal of obstructions is of vital importance. The removal of major obstructions in some of the larger rivers which are clearly on the arterial drainage priority list should be undertaken by his Department wherever the land rehabilitation section advise that their work is held up because of such obstructions in a particular locality.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that there would be overlapping, that two separate Government Departments would be messing on the one job, but I do not agree, because, when the inter-Party Government were in office, certain jobs were undertaken under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in order to facilitate land rehabilitation work, and were an outstanding success.  I have <Col N="1782" /> visited a few of them, and there is no reason why the removal of major obstructions should not be undertaken under that Act.  If there is one answer to the argument that there would be overlapping or duplication of the work, it is that if a ton of rock, a ton of silt or a ton weight of any obstruction is removed under that Act, it will not have to be removed by the arterial drainage people when they come along later.</P>
    <P>Every ton of stuff shifted in that way is so much work done and it does not matter two hoots which Government Department undertakes it so long as it is done, and farmers, who in many cases have been robbed year in and year out, from time immemorial, by flooding of these rivers, are protected against these losses.  The particular river I have in mind is the Moy and certain tributaries of the Moy. The argument that there would be overlapping will not hold because, like the job done in County Roscommon, which was an outstanding success, the rocks removed would be so much work done for the arterial drainage people, so that it is no answer to say that we cannot have two Departments working at it or cannot do the job piecemeal.  We should not forget that in the particular case I have in mind some 700 or 800 farmers, year after year, see their crops go out to sea and can do nothing to save them. They see cocks of hay being caught in sudden floods and swept out and their fields of potatoes, beet and corn destroyed. That has been happening year after year.</P>
    <P>The removal of certain obstructions which could be undertaken by the county engineer in Mayo, who long ago signified his willingness to do the work and who said it was easy to do, should be carried out.  While the Arterial Drainage Act is moving along towards the Moy and will, I suppose, overtake it in three, four or five years' time, if it does overtake it then, the removal of the three obstructions I speak of should be undertaken under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It would not cost a whole lot and would be of immense benefit to 700 or 800 farmers.  I am speaking of one river I know and the same conditions must <Col N="1783" /> obtain in practically every county where the Local Authorities (Works) Act writ runs.</P>
    <P>I particularly regret the slashing which has been done in this sub-head relating to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is a bad job of work; it is short-sighted; and it shows a complete disregard for one of the major problems of the country.  The work being done in every one of the Twenty-Six Counties was outstanding and the amount of flooded land which was drained and brought into fruitful cultivation almost impossible to calculate.  It is a job which would have succeeded, on the basis of the grants which the inter-Party Government allotted to the various counties, in clearing up what I would describe as a small drainage problem of the whole country and putting the network of small rivers and main drains in every county in a state of first-class repair in another four or five years.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that it should be a recurring charge, either.  Under the Local Authorities (Works) Act a local authority has power to compel the annual cleaning or scouring of drains once they are put in first-class shape. I do hold that it is not good enough to spend anything from £200 to £1,000 on a particular drain, to make a good job of it and then to leave it to fill up with silt, weed, rocks and every other obstruction so that it will become as bad as ever in 15 or 20 years' time. Drains are like roads; they need constant attention.  The drainage system is one of the most valuable systems we have.</P>
    <P>This Act which was initiated by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tim Murphy, was one of the best and most beneficial Acts to pass through this House in many a long day. From the point of view of the sum which appears on the cover of the Book of Estimates, almost £95,000,000, to slash this scheme and save a paltry £75,000 is a mean and cheap act particularly when 12 short months ago we were told that if the present Government attained office they would carry out the Local Authorities (Works) Act not merely as well as the previous Government but better.</P>

      <P>Much inconvenience has been caused throughout the country by delays in the payment of new house grants and reconstruction grants.  I want to make it clear that I am not attaching blame to anybody in the Custom House or indeed, to the outside inspectors either, but there is not a sufficient number of outdoor inspectors to cope with the work.  Down my way one housing inspector is supposed to look after new houses and reconstructions over four counties, Roscommon, Westmeath, Longford and Offaly.  Everyone must realise that with the present amount of work in housing and in reconstruction it would be utterly, physically impossible for any man to do that.  I know that he has been relieved periodically to cope with arrears, but with the amount of work to be done there are terrible delays in the furnishing of final reports and consequent delays in the payment of grants.  This inconveniences not only the people who are erecting the house but the contractors also because in many instances the contractors have to await the payment of the grant before they are paid.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and enlarge the outdoor inspectorate so that they may deal with the work more expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I, too, like many other Deputies, deplore the lack of rural housing.  A great deal has been done over a long period by local authorities with regard to urban housing; I think that no complaints could be made on that score, but rural housing has travelled at a very slow pace.  There are many houses throughout the country unfit, I submit, for human habitation.  Now that urban housing has been brought to a fairly successful level, it is time for local authorities to concentrate on rural housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department could relieve local authorities on the question of wages, road workers' wages in particular. Councils are faced every year and at different times throughout the year with demands for increased wages and, of course, this is not a demand which any councillor likes to oppose because there are always reasonably good grounds for it.  I need not go into the <Col N="1785" /> demands that will be made by organised labour for increased wages.  It would aid considerably the work of local authorities if wages could be fixed on a regional basis, if in each province or section of a province a standard wage could be fixed.  It would simplify matters for the local authorities as they would not be faced with the question: &ldquo;Why are they paid so much over the Border?  Why are we paid so much less?&rdquo; A regional standard would be a very proper idea, and the Department is the proper authority to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact, and everybody connected with the local authority knows, that the two heaviest items of expenditure, the items placing the heaviest burden on the ratepayer, are the upkeep of roads and the upkeep of mental hospitals.  I do not think that any amount of money spent on roads, either main or country, at the present time will keep them in the condition we would like to see unless they are graded and a certain limit is placed on the laden weight of vehicles passing over them.  It is well known that many of the roads in this country were never intended to bear the weight of the vehicles which now pass over them.  Many indeed, particularly in the West of Ireland, have bog foundations and you are absolutely throwing money away in putting a new surface on a bog foundation road if you allow a lorry laden with ten tons to pass over it with often a six-ton trailer behind it. It will never be possible for the rates to bear the burden until something is done to schedule the roads and limit the laden weight that will pass over them.</P>
    <P>I too, like many other speakers, deplore the reduction in the Vote for the Local Authorities (Works) Act. It was a very misguided thing to do. Anybody who has anything to do with the management of land&mdash;I do not say this in a political sense at all&mdash;knows that extraordinarily good work was done in the reclamation of land under the Works Act.  I would say this if a Fianna Fáil Government had introduced it instead of the inter-Party Government.  I am not creating <Col N="1786" /> a side issue.  In my view and in the view of the ordinary people, that Act was the greatest boon the people of the land had known for 35 years since the old Congested Districts Board carried out a certain amount of drainage.  It was money well spent. It put into production land which hitherto was wasted and unproductive. That is an established fact.  I do not want to exaggerate the position at all, but the reduction in expediture was a misguided action. Considering the amount of employment it provided in rural Ireland I think it was doubly short-sighted to slash that particular item.  However it is done.  What I say now I intend to be taken into consideration when this Estimate is discussed next year.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Blowick said about permitting local authorities to carry out works under the Works Act on rivers scheduled under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I am principally concerned with the River Suck because it has done considerable damage in Roscommon, particularly in South Roscommon, because fallen trees and sandhills have accumulated in the river.  If it were permitted that the county council should operate a small scheme to clear away those obstructions it would be of great benefit to the farming community in my county.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council has submitted a scheme under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for certain work at Ballinasloe.  If it is approved and carried out, it will confer a greater benefit on Roscommon than on Galway. I would ask the Minister and the officers of the Department to see that that scheme gets favourable consideration and a high priority amongst those schemes to be carried out this year.</P>
    <P>My local authority in particular is a bit disappointed at the manner in which this matter of sanction was handled.  Local authorities have been told about approval for £5,000 worth of drainage schemes, but have been given no indication as to which schemes have been approved.  They are aware they will have £5,000 to spend, but for the past six weeks they do not know what schemes the Department are prepared to allow them to carry out. <Col N="1787" /> The sooner that is dealt with the better.  Everyone knows that this is the proper time to carry out drainage schemes, and that you can get more useful work done for £10 now than for £40 in November.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the heavy burden which the maintenance of mental hospitals is imposing on the rates.  I submit to the Minister, as a sensible man, that it is time some consideration was given to that aspect of our expenditure. The capitation grant for mental hospitals has remained the same over the past 100 years.  In 1851 it was decided that 4/- per head was the proper capitation, and if I am rightly informed it was then suggested that that was supposed to represent approximately 50 per cent. of the maintenance.  If there was any such intention, it would be ridiculous to suggest that 4/- or even twice that would represent 50 per cent. of the maintenance cost to-day.</P>
    <P>If the rates were relieved in the matter of roads and mental hospitals, they would be a bearable burden. With the present upward trend in rates in every county every year, it is time some serious effort was made to examine the whole situation of local rates, which are becoming an impossible burden on many people not alone on the land but in towns and cities.  Some means should be found to transfer the burden from the ratepayers to the central authority, as the ratepayers will not be able to continue the payments and something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>I want to enlist the sympathy of the Minister on the question of the employment of architects by local authorities for certain minor jobs.  I have before my mind a matter we had in Roscommon and at Ballinasloe Hospital Committee, the question of the erection of a land steward's house at Castlerea Chest Hospital.  The employees there were quite prepared to erect a good house for the land steward at £2,000 but the Department and the architects suggest £3,200.  If the local authorities both in Galway and Roscommon are satisfied the house can be erected for £2,000 and if the potential tenant is quite satisfied also, <Col N="1788" /> is there any reasonable excuse for compelling us to spend £3,200?</P>
    <P>Taking this question in a general way, I personally and many members of my county council feel we would be able to carry out just as efficiently and far more economically much of the work done in our county if we were not compelled to have the advice of architects at all.  To begin with, they are a very expensive item.  The system of remuneration is a temptation in itself as it is on a percentage basis of the estimate and naturally the higher the estimate the higher the fee.  Every architect, being a human being, is naturally inclined to get the most he can out of any project that is drawn up.  There should be a certain reasonable standard of work&mdash;say, nothing over £10,000 should be carried out without consultation with an architect, but where an item under £10,000 is to be done it should be done by the local authority without the assistance of an architect at all.  Not alone are they expensive to employ and the system of their remuneration a temptation to a high estimate, but in many cases they cause considerable delay. At the present time this question of the land steward's house is being sent from Ballinasloe Joint Mental Hospital Committee to the county council and back again, while the house the man is occupying at present is not a suitable one at all.</P>
    <P>There is a good and efficient staff employed at the chest hospital in Castlerea and they are quite capable of erecting the house.  They have intimated that if the work is entrusted to them they will erect a house according to the plans approved by the Department for £2,000.  That is one instance. There are other instances where architects have insisted on certain expenditure which does not appear to the members of the county council or to me to be justified at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister can do anything about the point I am going to raise now, but I feel that it requires attention.  Owing to an alteration in the 1950 Housing Act, provision was made for the payment of reconstruction grants where a grant had been paid over 15 years before.  There were certain <Col N="1789" /> strings attached to that&mdash;a new roof must be provided or additional accommodation to relieve congestion. It is on the second point that I find myself in difficulty with the Department, in the interpretation.  It may so happen that at the time of reconstructing a house there may not be a sufficient number of occupants to justify the argument that it is to relieve congestion. Everyone knows, however, that in many houses throughout the country at this season of the year members of families return on holidays from England or America, and it is often to relieve the congestion that will occur then that the additional accommodation is provided.  I had one specific case in mind, which I mentioned to the Minister before.  There is an occasion where you must have a wider interpretation of the meaning of the Act, if a man were able to say: &ldquo;Well, I am only living here with my wife and my two children at present, but when the summer comes or Christmas comes there will be her brother or sister or her family coming here and we have no place to put them.&rdquo;  In such circumstances, is it not only reasonable to suggest that the reconstruction grant should be made available even though normally the number of occupants would not justify it?</P>
    <P>I submit that there are not many cases of that kind giving trouble and that the Minister would be doing a good day's work if he would have the few cases examined that are being contested, so that he may deal with them sympathetically and act generously to those people who have expended twice and three times the amount of money which they hope to regain by grant.  If he does that and if he attends to the other matters that I have raised I will not have any grouse with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to prolong the discussion unnecessarily.  A Deputy who is not a member of a local authority is probably at a disadvantage in discussing an Estimate of this kind but there is the other point that a Deputy like myself, who never has <Col N="1790" /> been a member of a local authority and never will be by his own free will, can take a more detached view of some of the aspects of this Vote.  I hope it is not too late to join the Deputies on this side of the House&mdash;I have not heard very many from the other side of the House; I do not know why&mdash;in encouraging the Minister to review his attitude towards the operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
      <P>During the three years of inter-Party Government they allocated to all the local authorities a total sum of £4,327,365.  The provisional allocation to the same local authorities, for the current year, amounts to the small sum of £128,000.  I am quoting from figures supplied to me on a recent occasion in the House by the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister admits it or not or whether he has been informed or not, but I have been informed by a highly qualified engineer in one of the counties in my constituency that 85 per cent. of the amount allocated to the county concerned found its way into the pockets of additional men employed in carrying out schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If that is so and if that was applicable throughout the country, the Minister and his advisers can find by arithmetic the average number of men that have been thrown out of work as a result of the drastic reduction in the allocations.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said by my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, but it is a fact, known personally to the Minister, that 310 men were struck off by a stroke of the pen in the two counties in my constituency as a result of the refusal of the Minister and his Department to grant more money to complete the works that had been previously approved by his Department under the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not matter to me personally which of the 14 Governments that I supported or opposed in this House was responsible for the passage of good legislation.  All of them, including the inter-Party Government, were responsible for the passage of legislation that I did not like.  I would like to encourage <Col N="1791" /> the Minister, as I would have encouraged his predecessor, to take advantage of this Act, and to carry out wherever necessary the works that can be carried out only under this scheme, and thereby provide employment and do useful and urgently necessary works which cannot be carried out under the terms of Road Fund grants, the Arterial Drainage Acts or any other legislation.  I leave it at that in the hope that the Minister&mdash;I will not blame him personally&mdash;may be able to persuade his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to loosen up more than he has expressed his willingness to do up to the present.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned, and alarmed in some cases, about the position in regard to housing, particularly the high cost of building as revealed in the towns in my constituency.  There is no worker that I know of, whether he is employed in an industrial concern, in agriculture or by a local trader in a town, who can afford to pay the high rates that must be charged under the financial machinery of existing Housing Acts.  I do not want to repeat what has been said here, but I do not mind repeating it because it is pertinent to the debate.</P>
    <P>I have been advised when discussing housing matters with people who know much more about the financing of Housing Acts than I do that in pre-1939 days the tenants who were lucky enough to get new houses built by the various local authorities paid on an average one-eighth or one-ninth of the income of the head of the particular family in rent.  It is alarming to find that to-day, with a higher cost of living, with inflation, with higher wages, the worker has to pay in rent roughly one-third to one-fourth of his weekly earnings.  If that is the deliberate policy of the Minister, does not he realise that the head of the family has less to give his wife for necessaries such as food and clothing than when the rent was only one-eighth or one-ninth of his income?  That is a serious state of affairs.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, Deputy Corry was very unfair in his criticism of some of my colleagues who are <Col N="1792" /> members of the Cork County Council. He referred to an organised campaign that was supposed to have been supported by Labour members of the Cork County Council.  I believe that charge is definitely untrue.  He said the &ldquo;no-rent campaign&rdquo; was supported by Labour members in the Cork County Council.  There is nobody associated with this group in this House or no Labour member of a local authority that I ever heard of&mdash;and there are about 20 or 30 of them on local authorities in this country&mdash;who ever advocated the &ldquo;no-rent campaign that Deputy Corry speaks about.  He also suggested that that was fomented by some unnamed outside organisation. That is the old story by the enemies of this Party&mdash;that our inspiration comes from some funny outside source.  I think that has been exploded.  In any case, it is untrue.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Minister when he opened a number of housing schemes that were completed in Laois and Offaly.  One of the schemes he officially opened was carried out through direct labour.  There was considerable trouble in the local authority there because of the opposition of officials, particularly engineering officials, to get sanction for the carrying out of that direct labour scheme as an experiment.</P>
    <P>The engineer, on the instructions of the county council, delayed for a long period, and during that period of inactivity prices and building costs were rising.  Eventually the estimate was produced for the carrying out of this particular scheme in Rathdowney by direct labour at a cost of £1,400 per house.  I do not want to blame the Department for the delay that occurred.  In fact, the Department were very helpful on this occasion, as on many previous occasions.  Before the engineer, who was carrying out the direct labour scheme, appeared on the site, and before the men were actually paid, the cost of labour for unskilled men who had been employed on the scheme over a long period had gone up by 3d. per hour.  Notwithstanding that heavy increase in labour costs, the houses were eventually completed, as <Col N="1793" /> the Minister will probably remember, at a figure of £110 per house cheaper than the engineer's estimate.  I understand that if tenders had been accepted for the carrying out of that scheme, as they were in comparable towns in some of the adjoining counties, the cost would have been about £1,600 per house.  Where would the money have gone?  It would have gone into the pockets of outside contractors.  On the other hand, by doing the scheme by direct labour every penny of the money was left locally except, of course, the profits that accrued to the suppliers of the materials.  In addition, the best possible type of house was built at the least possible cost.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would be very difficult to get the Minister to agree to this, but nevertheless I urge him to encourage county managers to provide the best possible type of house at the least possible cost.  If they cannot get contractors to do the work reasonably in any particular area, the alternative is obvious; they should get the work done by direct labour.  Of course, engineers are opposed to the direct labour system.  If an engineer is carrying out his duties under a contract system, he probably calls on the contractor once a month or once a week if he is the energetic and conscientious type.</P>
    <P>He has a look around the place and says: &ldquo;You are getting on fine.  You would be entitled to another £10,000 as a result of the work you have carried out since the last occasion I visited you.&rdquo;  He signs a paper recommending another £10,000 to the contractor, and off he goes.  He probably has other work to do, but he has more time for pleasure than if he had to supervise a direct labour scheme.  Most of his time would be spent supervising such a scheme.  Therefore, the engineers' opposition to the direct labour system is understandable from that point of view.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary is that a justifiable reason for forcing the ratepayers to finance dearer houses and forcing the tenants, eventually, to pay a much higher rent than would be the case if direct labour had been resorted to.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine has brought to my notice the results of a direct labour <Col N="1794" /> scheme carried out by Wexford Corporation. That corporation received contracts for a scheme of 88 houses. When they received the contracts they sought a number of tenders.  I am speaking now from memory, but I think I am not far out when I say that the lowest estimate received was £1,570 per house.  The members of the corporation decided unanimously&mdash;it was not a political matter&mdash;to experiment with the direct labour system and to take the consequences.  They employed an engineer, one or two foremen and a number of workers.  They then got the trades union council in Wexford to agree that if the workers were not pulling their weight they would interview them once or twice and give them the works on the next occasion if they were not satisfied that they were carrying out their work in a conscientious manner.  The scheme was carried out and it resulted in a saving of £43,000 so far as the ratepayers and tenants were concerned. The houses are now completed, they are much better than if they had been built under the contract system and the occupants are paying remarkably low rents.  Why should not that system be adopted in other areas?</P>
    <P>In my own area I notice that there is a delay in the carrying out of the scheme for a small number of houses &mdash;20 in all.  Tenders were received in the same way as they were received by Wexford Corporation.  The manager came to the conclusion, without submitting the figures to the local authority, that he would accept none of the tenders because they were too high. The scheme is now being readvertised instead of resorting to the direct labour system which has been shown to be successful in other places.  I assert that it is a complete waste of time to be readvertising for tenders from contractors who are in a ring and who show each other their prices.  If there are four or five contractors in a ring, Mr. A. gets a contract in one town, Mr. B. in another town, Mr. C. in the next town and Mr. D. in the next town and they all get a bit out of it.  They all charge in or about the same price for the same type of house.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary defending that <Col N="1795" /> system?  Is he defending delay for the purpose of allowing contractors to compose their differences and bring down their prices so as to give a county manager and his advisers the idea that they are tendering for a reasonable figure.  I protest against this carry on. It has been going on in certain towns in my area, and I want the Minister to encourage county managers to instruct county engineers, when the tenders received from contractors are unreasonable, to experiment, more than they have done up to the present, with the direct labour system.  That is the only way to bring the cost of building down to a reasonable figure.  Let it be quite clear that I am not advocating the abolition of contractors.  There are some very decent contractors in the country, but they are in an organisation so as to better their own position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you came into the House a little while ago I gave the Minister particulars of one.  However, I think he must have known those particulars already because he opened the scheme himself.  It was carried out in Rathdowney under the direct labour system and the tenants there are now living in beautiful houses, some of them paying only 6/- per week rent.  In fact, tenants in other towns in Laois are very jealous of the people living in Rathdowney.  Rathdowney is situated in the southern end of Laois on the borders of Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 32 new beautiful cottages in the area built at a figure that enables them to be let at a very low rent.  Of course, some of the tenants of these cottages, for instance, Gardaí, teachers and other professional or semi-professional people with incomes of over £10 and, in some cases, up to £15 per week, have been obliged to pay the economic rent.  I do not believe in asking the ratepayers to subsidise the provision of houses for such people.  By paying the economic rent they are helping to subsidise the <Col N="1796" /> rent of the fellow on the lower rung of the ladder.  In fact, a couple of the tenants who got some of these houses at the lower rent were in receipt of home assistance at the time.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong these remarks.  I am sure I am talking to the converted in addressing some of the members of this Assembly, because they know more about this business than I do, being members of local authorities. I have never been a member of a local authority or I never will.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise another matter arising out of the figures supplied to me to-day by the Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question.  As I already said, I am not a member of any local authority and, therefore, I do not interfere in the administration or in the work of the local authority in my own area unless I am pressed to do so. In most of these cases I only do so after members of my Party on the local authority have failed to get any satisfaction in regard to these matters from the county manager or from officials of the county council. Considerable annoyance is being caused to hundreds of tenants of local authority houses in the rural areas of the County Leix and to some extent in Offaly in regard to the delays in carrying out repairs to labourers' cottages.  As the Minister and his advisers know, this is also causing delays in the coming into operation of the cottage purchase scheme.  Cottage purchase scheme preliminaries cannot be completed until the cottages are put in a proper, habitable condition.  I do not want to blame the Minister or the officers of his Department for this but I want the Minister and his advisers to ensure that the tenants of labourers' cottages, who have been making repeated complaints for the past two years, have their cottages repaired before the coming winter.</P>
    <P>In his reply to-day to a parliamentary question, the Minister said that 207 cottages had been repaired in the County Leix at a cost of £9,895.  That is a fairly hefty figure but I am not the person to challenge the accuracy or fairness of that figure.  The Minister admitted in his reply that the number of cottages awaiting repairs was 289. That is an unreasonably high figure, <Col N="1797" /> especially when you consider that there are skilled tradesmen and other workers looking for work in the area where these cottages are awaiting repair.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that the real reason for the delays in some of these cases is that the contractors will not tender for the carrying out of the work because in their opinion&mdash;it is not my opinion&mdash;it would not pay them to do the work at the maximum figure laid down by the county engineer.  I do not know whether or not that is justifiable.  I hope the Minister and his advisers will not leave these cottages unrepaired for a second winter while this dispute drags on.  It would be very unfair to do so.  I do not think there is any justifiable reason for delaying repairs.</P>
    <P>If the county manager, the county engineer or whoever is responsible cannot get contractors to carry out the repairs to such a large number of labourers' cottages, the job should be done through the direct labour system. By accident, I happened to be in one of the worst portions of my constituency in Leix on last Saturday week, the Luggacurran area.  Some of the cottages awaiting repair there would not be seen in North Korea under existing war conditions.  It is the desire of all Deputies from the constituency and of all the members of the Leix County Council that something effective should be done to have these repairs carried out before the coming winter, especially in the case of cottages in respect of which complaints have been lodged as long ago as 12 months and two years.  That is not an unreasonable request to make to the Minister.  I do not think it is right to press the Minister in regard to this matter as there may be another opportunity, under the cover of another discussion that may take place before 12 o'clock to-night, to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact, as the Minister for Finance says, that interest charges on loans from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities will be increased still further as a result of the recent increase in interest charges under the terms of the Budget, it is going to pile <Col N="1798" /> on the agony in the case of building costs, especially when we realise that half the amount of money that has to be repaid under the terms of existing loans at 3¼ per cent. for 50 years represents interest on money.</P>
    <P>If a local authority borrows £1,000 under the existing regulations in regard to the Local Loans Fund, at 3¼ per cent., to be repaid on a 50-year loan basis, at the end of 50 years, £2,030 will have to be repaid to the Local Loans Fund.  For the services of the land that is required, for the services of purchasing the material with which to build the houses and to pay the wages to those who build the houses and for legal and architects' fees, £1,000 is borrowed.  But £1,030 has to be paid to the lads in College Green for printing the £1,000 notes advanced to the local authority for house-building purposes.  It is criminal folly and is part of the rottenness of the present capitalist system.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Captain Peadar Cowan is not here to support me in making the protest because I know, from previous statements made by Deputy Captain Cowan, that he would even go further than I am going and even use stronger language in regard to this particular aspect of our financial machine.  I want to give the Minister reasonable time to reply but I hope he and his principal advisers will use their influence and good offices with the county manager, especially in regard to the urgency of having the repairs carried out before winter to the 289 cottages I mentioned.</P>

The Department over which I preside is one that concerns a great many people all over the country, and it affects the lives of many people.  That being so, it is only natural that members of this House, who are in many cases also members of local bodies for many years, should use the occasion to refer to a great many matters, however small, in which they are closely interested.</P>

It is the duty of the officials of my Department to have regard to these reports and if there is any criticism of the Department's activities or of my own, it is their duty to have regard to these matters and see if there is any justification for the complaints made. If justification is established, it is their duty to try and remedy any defects in the system of organisation which may exist.</P>
    <P>There were a few general points made by Deputies in the course of the whole discussion.  These points dealt with such matters as the success of the policy of the Department and the Government in regard to housing, housing by local authorities, the progress that was being made, the progress that was likely to be made in future, the employment that was given and the employment that is likely to be given, and a number of other questions affecting housing activities by persons in every walk of life.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening statement, I think I was able to convince those who have any kind of an open mind that we are pursuing the matter of housing strenuously and steadfastly and giving to local bodies, who are also facing up to their responsibilities in this regard, all the encouragement and assistance and guidance that we can possibly give them.  While the number of houses completed in 1952 was some few hundreds fewer as far as local bodies are concerned than in the previous year, that can be accounted for.  There might be a falling-off in Dublin because of a cement strike or the failure of a contractor to proceed with his contract or something like that.  Therefore, when there is only a slight movement one way or the other in the output of houses, although Deputies opposite may draw attention to it, it does not prove that there is any change in regard to policy or the vigour with which it is being pursued. There is no reason to think that in the years ahead, so long as the problem of <Col N="1800" /> housing by local bodies remains with us, we will be less successful or less energetic in that regard.</P>
    <P>So far as the housing activities of private persons are concerned, many complaints have been made during this debate and on other occasions, of factors which are held to hinder private persons in providing themselves with houses.  I am speaking of people who are building new houses or reconstructing houses in rural parts of the country.  Complaints have been made of the delays experienced by such persons.  No matter what you do to reach perfection, there will always be some cause or other to bring about an accumulation of applications for payment of grants or for initial inspection and it might take a month or two months to clear this up.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the figures for 1951 and for 1952 and I find that the total sum paid in April, May and June of 1952 was £466,844, and in the same three months of 1951, £333,265.  That shows that the amount of money paid out to these persons was considerably larger this year than it was last year.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I am prepared to admit that in a few counties, or in some counties which are grouped for the purpose of inspection, the number of outstanding claims was very high, and we are endeavouring to take steps to ensure that it will be reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies have not only spoken of these matters in the House but they have come to me privately about them. I have figures here showing what the position is.  We have divided the country into 13 areas.  We have 16 inspectors, 13 of whom are permanent. The other three are moved about from place to place where arrears are accumulating in order to have them wiped out.  There is also some illness amongst the staff at the moment and that has been responsible for a fairly large accumulation of applications in many counties in regard to which inspections have not been made or reports sent to the Department.  Unless you employ such a staff of inspectors that some of them will be idle for half the time you will always have this accumulation from time to time from one or other of the causes I have mentioned or from some other cause.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> In regard to the activities of local bodies and the efforts of private persons to provide themselves with houses, if any difficulties should arise between local bodies and my Department&mdash;difficulties do arise and questions crop up and sometimes cause delay and criticism by local bodies&mdash;I want to assure the House that when these matters are reported to me and I am made aware of them I will take every action that is necessary to ensure that the attitude of the Department in regard to such questions will be reasonable as far as my judgment will permit it and that help will be given in every respect.  When, however, a very big scheme which is likely to affect housing activities, such as the proposed Howth outfall works scheme which, when completed, will enable an enormous development to take place in the matter of housing, is sent to us for approval we must, naturally, be critical when it comes before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, Deputy Belton, Deputy Gallagher and other Deputies who are members of the Dublin Corporation are aware of the facts in this case.  While these facts were recited here, and I would say not unfairly recited, it might seem, because this scheme has been in the offing for the last three years or so, as if the action of the Department would hold up the sanctioning of this scheme and thereby deprive the corporation of planning wisely and in a long-distance way so far as housing is concerned.  I have gone into the whole correspondence that has passed between us.  I do not want to give the impression that I am placing blame on anybody, because I do not think that there is anybody blameworthy in this regard.  The corporation have their own technical experts and they employed consultants. They did all they could do to put their house in order, as it were.  They submitted certain proposals to us.  When these reached us, it was the duty of our engineering staff to be critical and to examine them carefully, not because we felt that the permanent officials of the corporation or the consultants were flippant as to the proper discharge of their responsibility, but because we know that when major technical problems arise the only way in which you <Col N="1802" /> are likely to get a proper solution is that one should examine and pick as many holes as it is possible to see in any proposed scheme so as to give those on the other side a chance of showing the reasons for this, that or the other proposition.</P>
    <P>Ultimately&mdash;I do admit that a time is reached when you must have finality&mdash; when you think the technical people have examined and approved of the proposed scheme in every respect, then of course somebody will say: &ldquo;Well if we are not entirely satisfied that the scheme is 100 per cent watertight, a chance must be taken some time&rdquo; and will be afforded.</P>
    <P>The corporation seem to think that because we have referred the most recent documents back to them, we have indicated our intention to refuse to sanction what their engineers and consultants have proposed.  All, in fact, that we have done, in the most recent letter which we have sent to the corporation, is to reiterate certain doubts we have.  We are entitled to do that.  While these doubts had been mentioned before, we are entitled to do that so as to enable the technical people and the corporation to say if they so desire: &ldquo;Well, yes they may be there; we admit that there is the immediate or remote possibility that there may be justification for these doubts but that is the best we can do and we are recommending that scheme.&rdquo;  If we can get these technical people to come along and to support their point of view firmly, I can assure Deputies who are members of the corporation that we shall not stand in the way very long.  When some officials or consultants employed by local bodies come up against a difficulty like this, they invariably seem to me to act in such a way as to place the onus upon us and our technical people to sanction the scheme.  If we should do so, even when we are in doubt, and anything goes wrong later, these are the very people who in all probability will say: &ldquo;Well, was the proposed scheme not submitted to and discussed by the technicians of the Local Government Department?&rdquo; I am, therefore, saying to Deputies, who seem to be justifiably concerned about this question of the Howth drainage, that they <Col N="1803" /> should take it up again with their own people and, while I admit that there is still some doubt in our mind, I shall give them the assurance that if their technicians come back and firmly say that that is the best that in their view is possible, while not committing myself definitely at this stage, they can feel satisfied that they will not find any unreasonableness, so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies complained that there was a falling off in the employment on housing.  I am not going to weary the House by giving figures in that regard but the figures I have in my possession go to show that is not so.  In the discussion of this matter here, there has been a lack of recognition of the fact that the employment afforded to skilled and unskilled persons on housing by local bodies and private persons, amounts to only about 50 per cent. of the employment given in building activities generally.  Employment is also afforded in the building of schools and institutions and in all kinds of repairs to business houses carried out by private persons.  While local bodies cannot be held responsible for the tendencies from one year to another that may exist in that outside world, I can only say to Deputies that so far as the figures of employment given by local authorities and by persons engaged in the building of private houses are concerned, these figures seem to be as good, if not a little better, than in the previous year. That does not mean that the over-all position of employment in the building industry, including the activities to which I referred, was satisfactory to the same extent.</P>
    <P>One other matter raised by Deputies in the Labour Party and other Opposition Deputies was the provision made in the Estimate this year for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The amount this year has been reduced by one-half.  The amount last year was reduced by my predecessor by £530,000.  Let me comment on some of the statements made in regard to works carried out under the Act since it was passed in 1949.  I travel the <Col N="1804" /> country a fair share and, as I travel through the country, I usually have a look at what is to be seen.  I have seen what has been done in my own county under this Act.  I represent a county in which drainage is as vital a question as in any of the other 26 or indeed in the whole 32.  I am a farmer, a non-technical person in this matter, but I know as much about the drainage problem as any other Deputy here, and I say without the slightest hesitation that a considerable amount of the money expended on work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was money ill-spent.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy wants proof of that fact I can take him to several places in which the proof will be staring him in the face.  Naturally, where such a volume of money has been spent as was expended under this Act, some good work was also done.  It is only reasonable, I suppose, that Deputies opposite would make the case they have made.  A 100 per cent.  State grant to cover all costs is not an easy thing to resist.</P>
    <P>You, naturally, find councillors very pleased when the State comes along and says: &ldquo;We will give you 100 per cent.  of the cost of this work and there is going to be no maintenance and no responsibility in the future.&rdquo;  When the 1949 Act was passed, and when the people responsible for its administration were in a hurry to get applications in from local bodies, the applications actually poured in from every county council.  I know myself, and Deputies on the opposite benches who have spoken on this matter must know it also, that there was very little care and very little attention given to the selection of these works.  All of us who want to admit it know that the county engineers who felt that they had enough work on their hands, and their assistants who were not getting a reward of any kind for the selection or supervision of works when approved, and when money was provided for them, behaved as human beings do everywhere.</P>
    <P>When the matter was mentioned by certain Deputies on these benches, some other Deputies tried to give the <Col N="1805" /> impression that the charge was being made that these officials were not carrying out their responsibilities in a satisfactory fashion.  I am saying it now, as Minister.  I say that, to my own knowledge, county engineers and their assistants did not give the care and attention in regard to works that were proposed under the 1949 Local Authorities (Works) Act that they would give in regard to matters for which they are normally and legally responsible.  There is no member of the House who would be more enthusiastic in regard to the execution of drainage work than I would.  Surely to goodness, however, no matter what Party we belong to, we should be serious with regard to the expenditure of public money and should say to ourselves: &ldquo;Let us endeavour to get some reasonable results from such expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy from Roscommon talk about the valuable work that was being done in the County Roscommon. Some time ago I passed through the County Roscommon.  I saw there a fairly substantial job of work that had been done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I also saw the bullocks grazing alongside it and tramping in the earth that had been removed from the river only a few months earlier. Do we not all know that when money is spent on works of this nature and, especially, when works are selected in that casual way, things of that kind can happen?  It was even known that engineers who were sent out to inspect some of these works actually went along the county road, stood on the fence and had a look up the river, the stream or whatever it might be, and just made some kind of a rough estimate as to what it would take to clean it in order to relieve flooding either on the road or on the land adjoining.  I am not saying that I myself did not see that some useful work was done in relieving flooding, where roads were being flooded or where land adjoining these roads were being flooded.  I do say in the most deliberate fashion that while I did see some works that were useful I saw others that were of no value whatever, works that in the course of a year or two will be in just as bad a condition <Col N="1806" /> as they were in before money was spent on them.  Some Deputies may think that it is a wonderful business to spend public money in that way. Deputies may be able to make speeches as to the amount of employment and so on that was given, but such employment could not be regarded as steady or permanent employment.  If this was merely for the purpose of giving employment, then I would say that there are far more suitable works on which that employment should be given.</P>
    <P>I know, as I said at the outset, that it is the practice in this House when an Estimate is reduced in this fashion &mdash;and why should it not?&mdash;to seize on that fact so as to try and give the impression that the Government is deliberately setting out to destroy something that was created by their predecessors.  I can only give the assurance that I have no such intention whatever.  In fact, I would be encouraged to continue something that had been started by my predecessor. I would believe that it should be continued in order not to give the House or the country the impression that I was just destroying it, and for that purpose alone.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter referred to, a certain decision which I made recently in regard to the administration of reconstruction grant work. When I came into office I did not believe at all in what my predecessor had done, that is, in segregating the administration of this work throughout the country and making each county council responsible for it.  I deliberately refrained from giving effect to what I thought was the right policy, fearing that someone would say: &ldquo;You are doing that in order to give the impression that your predecessor was wrong in the decision he gave.&rdquo;  My approach in regard to this work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is entirely the same.  I believe that we must be very careful as to the way in which we spend money on work of this nature, of the things on which we spend it, and in regard to the results which we are likely to get from such expenditure.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when, on this <Col N="1807" /> Vote, we used to have many complaints from people representing the rural areas to the effect that the new modern method of making roads was such that farmers could not bring out their horses on them to go to a fair or a market.  For years, as a member of a county council and as a member of this House, I listened here to those who claimed to be farmers' representatives making that case.  You do not hear that case made now.</P>
    <P>They all want the tar now, and are pleading for the tar.  The number of mechanically propelled vehicles is increasing daily, and the weight they are carrying is increasing.  It is the farmers and the rural communities whom you now hear clamouring to have the condition of the roads improved. I do not mind saying that the employment which is given on that kind of operation is far better than what is held up to us here as a source of employment for rural workers under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, because you cannot properly undertake much of this drainage work at a time of the year when you could carry it out to the greatest advantage.  The reason is that sometimes there is a shortage of labour in certain parts of the country, and it is necessary to ensure that, for the usual operations in agriculture, production of turf, and so on, men will be available.  The result is that, in many cases, drainage operations have to be postponed until the winter, when the very worst results will be obtained for any money spent on them.</P>
    <P>I say then that we need an improvement in our roads.  It was because of the fact that I was convinced that we must set out in a determined way to improve the standard of our roads that I struggled as best I could&mdash;and fairly successfully, I think&mdash;with the Government to induce them to leave the Road Fund, as some Deputies have stated, for our roads, and to take the necessary steps to increase the amount that would be available in the Road Fund in the future, so that we could, in a period of five or six years, in a planned way, hope to secure a much higher standard in our county and main road <Col N="1808" /> system.  As a countryman myself, I say that I prefer to stand over that as a policy of wise spending and a policy that will give employment at all times of the year, and that will give results to the community.  I will stand over that.</P>

While we are on the Government Benches we shall not complain if any Opposition Party divides this House on a measure which we introduce, for the purpose of improving that measure.  We do not object to honest criticism.  Only by honest and helpful criticism can we get the best which this House can give to the country.  The record will show that that Bill was hurried.  It was brought in here as a three-line Bill.  Then the Minister who was responsible for the Department at that time, the late Deputy Murphy, changed his mind and it became a Bill of many sections.  By the time it left this House it was amended beyond recognition.  It will be seen from the record also that if the late Deputy Murphy had had his way the money spent under the provisions of that Act would not have been spent in that fashion.  We now hear all the Opposition Deputies lauding the measure but there is nothing on the records, so far as I can discover, which indicates that anybody was very much in favour of spending the money that way.  They just had to do it.</P>

    <P>On this Supplementary Estimate I would like to make a short explanatory statement.  I think it is desirable that I should explain briefly the purposes of this Supplementary Estimate, which is intended to provide some additional funds for Mianraí Teoranta to carry on the coal mining undertaking at Slievardagh. When the undertaking there was reorganised in 1947 the legislation passed fixed a limit of £50,000 to the amount that could be advanced to Mianraí Teoranta for the purposes of that undertaking.  I said then that the company was only remaining in the coal-mining business because of accidental circumstances and that it would get for the development of the Ballingarry coal deposits a capital sum of £50,000 and no more.  I endeavoured to make clear what was our then intention, that if within a reasonable time and within the limit of that sum the company could not get that undertaking on to a paying basis, the workings there would be abandoned.  In fact, as Deputies opposite will recollect, the company was unable to get the undertaking on to a paying basis within the limit of that sum and in October, 1949, the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the previous Government asked the House to vote a supplementtary sum of £38,000 to maintain the undertaking until it reached a profitearning stage.</P>
    <P>When I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I met the board of the undertaking in August of last year.  They told me they hoped to achieve production of 500 tons per week by the end of last year, and stated that, with production running at that level, they would be making a profit.  Subsequently, the company ran into some difficulty in the working of the seam, and in March of this year they told me they had made a loss on the first quarter of the year, but that they had reason to believe that their production would increase and that they would be making a profit of about £200 a week later in the year.  Later in the year they asked for legislation to increase the limit of advances to <Col N="1820" /> them, but I told them that, in view of the Exchequer difficulties and their expectation, that they would be making a profit later in the year, I could not agree to give them any additional money, urging that the additional capital expenditure which they believed to be justifiable should be met at a later stage out of the profits when earned.  On the 9th of this month, however, the company reported that their production had averaged less than the 500 tons per week which would have put them in a line ball position and that, of the production realised, a higher proportion than anticipated had been in the form of duff which earns a lower price than the ordinary size coal.  They pointed out to me that they would require money between this and the end of the year if production was to be maintained, that they had reached the limit of accommodation which their bankers were prepared to give them, and, with their present production running at a loss and some difficulty in disposing of the coal, they were in need of additional cash.</P>
    <P>In view of the pending adjournment of the Dáil it was decided, therefore, to ask the House for a supplementary sum.  That supplementary sum will have to be, as the Estimate indicates, confirmed by legislation later in the year.  The sum which it is proposed to vote, £21,000, is required to meet certain outstanding debts of the company, to meet some essential capital expenditure and possibly losses on working between this and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Supplementary Estimate, I think I should make it clear that the Government has not come to any decision regarding the future of this undertaking.  We realise, in the rather exceptional conditions prevailing, that it would be unwise to take a hasty decision, but whether, in fact, the Government would be prepared to ask the Dáil to vote still more money after the conclusion of the year if the undertaking should still be losing money at that stage, is a matter upon which I do not want to make comment now.  I may say that during the course of the year every effort was made to dispose of this property, but because I was not <Col N="1821" /> satisfied as to the form the advertisement took, which produced certain offers that were not attractive or at least offers that involved certain difficulties, I directed that the whole property should be readvertised and offered for sale rather than that portions of it should be offered separately. Whether that second advertisement will produce a satisfactory offer for the undertaking I cannot say.  The effect of this Supplementary Estimate is really to postpone a decision on the future of the undertaking.</P>

      <P>Is the drop in the demand for coal due to a seasonal slackness or to increased imports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The seasonal slackness is admittedly more acute than usual. There is no reason to anticipate that there will not be a demand for all the anthracite coal produced in the country. I am quite certain that coal will, in fact, move but it may be slower in moving this summer than it has been in other summers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The increased imports are rather difficult to understand because the information I have is that the demand for British anthracite on the Continent is not satisfied and why they should be shipping coal here that we do not want is rather difficult to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so in regard to all classes of coal but there is still an unsatisfied demand for British anthracite on the Continent of Europe.  Irish anthracite is of equal quality and value and should be readily saleable but I imagine that the mild winter and the exceptional stocks carried last winter, together with other factors, have produced a temporary slackness in demand.  I am, however, quite confident that that will rectify itself in time.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1947, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life-Saving Service.</P>

    <P>I want to make a brief statement on this Estimate also.  The Sligo-Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway has been operating at a loss since 1933 except during the war years.  Last year the position deteriorated to such an extent that its management came to me and said they were proposing to cease operations.  I met the representatives of the various interests <Col N="1823" /> involved, the representatives of the workers employed by the undertaking numbering about 100 in our territory, the representatives of the live-stock interests who spoke about the importance of the line to them and the management itself in order to consider what could be done to meet the position. The company, as the House should be aware, is a cross-Border company.  The line runs from Sligo to Enniskillen.  It joins the main Córas Iompair Éireann system about five miles from Sligo.  I offered the undertaking to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann considered the possibility and, having done so, they decided they had no interest in the continuance of the railway. In fact, it exists to divert to Belfast and the other Six-County ports traffic that would otherwise come to the Twenty-Six County ports.  They said that if they were compelled to take over the line they would immediately go to the Transport Tribunal for an order to close it down.  I found no solution to the problem of this undertaking through that suggestion.  We considered what would happen if the line did, in fact, close down and in considering that we got a report from the local government engineers as to the state of the roads in the area.  That report indicated that these roads were not in a condition to carry the traffic that would be diverted on to them if this line ceased operations and that it would take five or six years, plus a fairly considerable expenditure, to put them into a condition to take that traffic.  In the circumstances, and as a temporary arrangement, it was decided to make a grant from State funds of £3,500 to enable the undertaking to carry on.  The Six County Government has been giving a grant to this undertaking since 1934.</P>

      <P>They have given £3,000 in the present year.  The amount given is just enough to keep the undertaking going.  The House is aware that I am <Col N="1824" /> opposed to the whole principle of transport subsidies and I am very conscious of the fact that I persisted in refusing a subsidy to another railway undertaking that recently closed down.  The justification for the treatment given to this undertaking must rest upon the practical difficulty of putting road services into the area to take the traffic that would have to be carried by them should the railway cease operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposing the provision of this subsidy but I would like to see it given under specific conditions. The Minister has hinted at something that is much more serious than one might imagine at first sight. This company for a number of years has allowed itself to be used by methods such as secret agreements with northern shipping companies operating from the port of Belfast to take traffic out of its normal or natural route and have it diverted and sent to Great Britain &mdash; I am speaking in particular now of live stock &mdash; through the ports of Belfast and Derry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the taxpayers in the ordinary way should provide a subsidy to enable a company to divert from its natural route live-stock traffic that should go through the port of Dublin or, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, through the port of Sligo if the proper facilities exist there.  I have had innumerable complaints over a period of years which I have conveyed in succession, and so have the dockers and the unions catering <Col N="1825" /> for them, to the Minister for Agriculture. This is a more serious matter than some Deputies might imagine.  I am not opposing the provision of the subsidy to which the Minister has committed himself but I would like the senior officials of the Minister's Department to inquire, in conjunction with the officials of the Department of Agriculture, into the allegations as to the use that has been made in the past of this company's route to the detriment of ports in the Republic and workers who might otherwise be employed in the ports of the Republic.</P>

      <P>I find myself in very considerable agreement with the Deputy and in deciding on my future attitude towards this undertaking I will be greatly strengthened by the knowledge that Deputy Davin has spoken as he did.  There is no doubt that the economic interests of the Twenty-Six Counties are not being catered for by the retention of this line at all.  The provision of the subsidy is justifiable because of the fact that a considerable expenditure will be necessary on the roads in the area before the termination of the railway can be regarded with equanimity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the Minister. I am merely expressing my own point of view and indicating my intention of postponing the very numerous matters which I otherwise would have dealt with on this Bill until the autumn.</P>
      <P>There is one point of importance to which I want to refer.  It is merely a matter of detail but it is a matter of some little importance and justice to a group of Civil Service pensioners.  I merely wish to take this opportunity of referring to the injustice which is being suffered by certain retired civil servants who were superannuated before 15th January, 1951, and whose pensions are still drastically reduced by the operation of what is known as the super-cut.  The Minister is fully aware, and Deputies may have had their attention drawn to the fact, that this super-cut, which, I think, was imposed by the British Government originally in 1921, remained in operation in reference to the salaries of higher civil servants for a considerable number of years.  One-third of the cut was restored in 1948.</P>
      <P>The super-cut has been entirely eliminated from all salaries of civil servants to whose salaries it was applicable as from 15th January of this year. The net result is that these civil servants who have been in the service of the State since 15th January this year, and on whose salaries the super-cut operated, have had that benefit restored to them but unfortunately these people whose salaries were subject to the super-cut from 1922 until they retired have not had their pensions adjusted as I respectfully suggest to the Minister they ought to have been and should now be, in accordance with the decision made by both the previous and the present Government in reference to the super-cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are only about 240 persons who will be affected by what I am advocating to the Minister.  These civil servants <Col N="1828" /> who are suffering most severely are those who elected to serve this country in 1922 and who did not take the compensation they could have taken under Article X of the Treaty.  I think I will find general agreement amongst all Parties and all Ministers who have had to come in contact with them when I say that they gave invaluable service to this State and community.  They gave very devoted service, without bothering about overtime or whether or not they had to work by day or by night, to build up here for this State and the service of the people an efficient Civil Service.  I should like to pay a tribute here &mdash; and I am sure the Minister for Finance will be in complete agreement with me &mdash; to the invaluable service given to the Irish community and to successive Irish Governments by the experienced higher civil servants who have served various Governments since 1922.  They were paid salaries which to some people may seem big, but, to my mind, they were grossly underpaid all the time.  No money would really repay the services they gave to this State, or the expert advice which they put at the disposal of various Ministers of successive Governments. About 240 of those people are now on pension and during the period of their active lives, when they gave such invaluable service, they were subject to this injustice of the super-cut.</P>
    <P>The present Government, by adopting the decision of the previous Government to do away entirely with it, have recognised the injustice being done to these men.  The super-cut was originally imposed as a piece of political expediency by the British Government in the face of a storm about economies in the Civil Service.  Of these 240 people, the youngest of them is in his 67th year and the majority are probably well advanced in their 70's.  The cost to the Exchequer of remedying this injustice in the very first and heaviest year would not exceed £11,000, and when income-tax deductions are taken into account, the cost of remedying it would not exceed an annual sum of £9,000, a sum which would diminish year by year and eventually disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to occupy the attention of the House any longer in discussing <Col N="1829" /> this matter or matters of this kind. I have been asked to raise the matter in the Dáil and I do so with a sincere conviction that the injustice ought to be remedied, and, at this final stage of the financial proceedings for this session, I ask the Minister sympathetically to consider the injustice being suffered by these men, to remember the services they gave in critical periods and the expert advice so willingly given by them to the members of every Government here since 1922.  The cost is very small but the injustice is very great.  The demand, I think, is reasonable and I would ask the Minister to accede to it if at all possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would seriously suggest to my half-political brother, Deputy Davern, that this Parliament is supposed to be the free and unfettered Parliament of the Twenty-Six Counties. There is a common belief among the ordinary people, who do not know everything, that we, or the Government at any rate, are free to do anything they want to do for the improvement of the country and the advantage of individual citizens.  It is to be regretted that that is not so.  We have failed in the past to solve problems which are awaiting solution, many of them since the State was established and this Parliament first met.  Like, I suppose, other Deputies and the Minister himself, I received some time ago an extraordinary document from a member of this House dealing with the position as he saw it and giving his proposals for the solution of these many and pressing problems.  The document states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Marriages and births are dangerously low and the flower of our manhood and womanhood has <Col N="1830" /> been forced to emigrate to a foreign land to find the work and wages denied to them at home.</P>
    <P>In contrast to this deplorable state of affairs we have a small minority living in luxury, controlling the whole financial and industrial mechanism of the State and enslaving the great majority of decent, honest, hardworking men and women by virtue of their financial power and the despotic economic domination they are permitted to exercise over their fellow citizens.  The State is being run by and in the interests of this small privileged and unprincipled minority whilst the common people are forcibly kept on and below the level of starvation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He elaborates but I will not quote further because Deputies who have read this extraordinary document and have good memories do not require to have it repeated.  Some of it, however, is so revolutionary that it is no harm to place it on the records of the House. For the benefit of the House and particularly for this Deputy's colleagues who would like their memories refreshed, I will tell you some of his proposals.  The document states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With a deep sense of responsibility, a clear vision of the future and taking inspiration and guidance from the teachings of our patriot leaders&mdash; Tone, Emmet, Lalor, Davitt, Connolly, Pearse and Mellowes&mdash;we have decided&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is from an individual Deputy of this House&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to form an organisation which we name the `Vanguard' for the express purpose of creating the situation that will end capitalism in Ireland, establish a socialist republic for all Ireland and undo the British conquest in all its phases, political, cultural and economic.&rdquo;</P>

That is true of the Government of to-day and if this situation is allowed to continue it will be true of the Government of to-morrow.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that my Party, the small group with which I am associated, has power to make the necessary change.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see this matter discussed in a free and unfettered way, even if it is necessary to have a secret session.  One can say here under cover, advocating that kind of policy, something that might be harmful to the country, apart from being harmful to the Government.  Neither I nor my colleagues want to go on that line.  This <Col N="1833" /> is one of the most urgent matters &mdash; in view of the financial position &mdash; that members could be called on to discuss and decide if necessary by a free vote. The position we are in to-day, as a result of the budgetary policy of the Government&mdash;which is contained in this Appropriation Bill in its final form&mdash; cannot be repaired in full by any action this House may take, unless we get the co-operation of the people who control our monetary machine.  Does the Minister not admit that, as a result of the increased loan charges brought about as a result of the Budget, there will be an increase in the number of unemployed persons?  Does he not admit, or does he continue to deny, that the same applies to the restriction of credit? Does he deny that the restriction of credit and the increase in loan charges contained in the Budget are brought about as a result of the influence and power of people not responsible to this House?</P>

      <P>I am referring to the present Budget, for the information of the Deputy, though I do not think that is necessary, as it is a provocative question. I believe he knows as well as I do that the increase in interest rates, to be paid in future by farmers in his constituency who must seek loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, is influenced by outside bodies.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up as a State-established, non-profit-making institution and there is no ground on which that institution &mdash; and I do not believe it would have happened but for the influence of outside bodies &mdash;should, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, increase the interest rates as from the date they came into operation in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every member of this group, and everybody on every side of the House, agrees with the Minister for Agriculture in calling for an increase in agricultural production.  Does everyone not know, however, that as a result of the restriction of credit, the farmers who badly need loans will get nothing from the joint stock banks in future &mdash; or, if they do, it will be on foot of gilt-edged <Col N="1834" /> securities and at the increased rates of interest?  Those rates cannot be justified and certainly should not be put into operation at a time when we are asking the farmers to increase agricultural production as a national necessity. Does anyone think that the Minister for Finance of this Fianna Fáil-Cowan Government would have increased the interest charges on agricultural loans&mdash; or local loans, if they are to be increased &mdash; were it not for the influence and operations of this outside body&mdash; which is not responsible to this House? Is there any other country in the world, operating a democratic system of government, where that kind of thing would be tolerated?  I may be wrong and the Minister may say I am foolish, but while God and the people allow us to come here to do what the people desire to have done, we cannot do it until we get a monetary machine under the control of this Parliament and of the Government elected here.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Cowan, my colleague of past years, has now come into the House and I am certain he will support me in making this demand. I am asking the Government to give grave consideration to this proposal, in view of the gravity of the international financial position.  I understood that Deputy Cogan advocated this policy in a much stronger way than I have been doing in the past.  If it is the same Deputy Cogan that was a member of Carlow County Council, he supported Séamus Lennon, an old friend of mine and of many Deputies, on this matter, from the floor of the chamber at a meeting of Carlow County Council.</P>

      <P>Is it not quite clear to Deputy Davern &mdash; though he dare not admit it, or he would be fired from the seat he occupies &mdash; that this whole Budget make-up follows British financial policy?  The Minister for Finance does not mind repudiating the speeches he made a year ago; he does not see any necessity to explain them or apologise for them.  During the last <Col N="1835" /> election, he spoke in Rathmines on a certain date in May and gave a positive assurance that if a Fianna Fáil Government were returned to office they would not interfere with or reduce the subsidies.  Was he not responsible himself for the advertisement in the daily papers on the 29th May, the day previous to polling day, when that assurance was given in print, at considerable cost to the Fianna Fáil organisation?  Can he explain those things now?  If it is not because Mr. Butler has carried out the same policy in Great Britain, will be explain the reason for following British policy and reducing the small subsidies previously paid by his own Government?  They were introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in the past.  What is the explanation for the interference with them and the drastic reduction in them, with the consequences of that reduction to the homes of the poor people in this land since they came into operation at the beginning of July?  Is there any explanation, even now, from the Minister for Finance?  I do not ask him to apologise, but I ask if he can give any explanation.</P>
      <P>Speaking from public platforms in the country the Minister, I believe, made some outrageous statements and that he gave some queer explanations when he was speaking with his back to the O'Connell Monument in Limerick; but he cannot deny that these statements have been repudiated, without any reasonable or sensible explanation up to the present.</P>

I know perfectly well that Deputy Davern finds it extremely difficult to explain the Minister's attitude and the reversal of the Minister's policy in his own constituency and that is why he has been addressing so few meetings since the Budget was introduced.  This Budget also contains many other breaches of promise.  If any Government in the world could be found guilty of breaking promises, this Government could be found guilty of that by any jury of decent Irish men and women on seven or eight occasions.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ryan, Minister for Social Welfare, when the Norton social security scheme was going through this House in March last year, on the day after it was passed in spite of his opposition, went into print and told the people, especially the wage-earners and employers who would be concerned, that he would provide a better and cheaper social security scheme for the wage-earners.  He went on the public platforms with Deputy McGrath and Deputy Davern and all the other innocent Deputies who sit behind the present Minister and repeated those pledges.  This Budget makes provision for another broken promise because he said they would provide a better and cheaper social security scheme than what he called the Norton scheme and that there would be no increased contributions demanded from the workers who would get the benefit of his so-called better social security scheme. He dropped the death benefits provided in the Norton scheme; he dropped the retirement benefits and modified the maternity benefits provided for in the Norton scheme.  Notwithstanding that, he comes along and, through the agency of this Appropriation Bill, is going to take from the pockets of the wage-earners and employers another £750,000 by way of increased contributions and he is going to pay for the remainder of his modified social security scheme by increased taxes on tobacco, beer, cigarettes and every other essential commodity, whether you call it luxury or necessity.</P>

You made that public promise, you gave that public pledge in Rathmines in your own constituency and Deputy Seán Lemass, the eloquent and able Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, was sent to Cork City to repeat that pledge and promise.  Not alone have you, through the agency of this Appropriation Bill, reimposed the taxes that were taken off by the inter-Party Government but you have doubled the tax that we took off in the early part of 1948.</P>

      <P>This Appropriation Bill, through this broken promise of the Minister for Finance or, if you like to put it the other and more charitable way, through his failure to carry out promises, proposes to penalise the poorest of the poor by a drastic reduction in the subsidies, which increases the cost of every one of the necessaries of life and, at the very same time as they are doing that, they are remitting taxation to some of the wealthiest shareholders of tobacco factories, including, of course, some of the Irish tobacco manufacturing concerns.  That is something that many supporters of <Col N="1838" /> the Government cannot understand or explain.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister, even at this stage of his career, explain why he has done that?  He goes down the country and tries to fool the innocent people into the belief that this remission in taxation, so far as it is given to the tobacco manufacturers, is due to the recommendation that was submitted to the Minister's predecessor by the Prices Advisory Body.  The Prices Advisory Body is by virtue of its title an advisory body, and it submitted many recommendations to the Minister's predecessor which were rejected for policy and other good reasons.  The Minister should not get away in that way.  He will not be allowed to get away with it.</P>

In fairness to the people, first of all in fairness to every Deputy, he should give us a little more information about that famous interview he had with Mr. Butler when he went to Downing Street in mid-March of last year.  He was accompanied by Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the expert advisers of the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Finance.  At the end of what was supposed to be a very friendly talk lasting three or four hours, with a luncheon thrown in at the end, and there is nothing wrong with that, he came back and issued a statement which no one can understand. Are we to accept it that this Appropriation Bill contains some of the agreements or understandings that were arrived at when he had that famous interview with Mr. Butler and other British Ministers in March last year?  Otherwise, I cannot understand why this Budget in so many respects follows the Budget that was introduced by Mr. Butler in the middle of March of this year.

An inspired paragraph appeared in the financial section of a British daily paper &mdash; it is all the information I have on the subject, but I am entitled to more &mdash; which says that <Col N="1841" /> seven big men were appointed by O.E.E.C. to inquire into the grave financial position and to give their opinions and decisions.

Following the publication of the inspired statement to which I referred in a reputable British daily paper, a statement was made in the House of Commons a few days ago to the effect that during the months of May and June this year there was a restriction of credit of £92,000,000 more than in the months of May and June of last year, and that there is also to be a further and more drastic restriction of credit.

I do not know why the Minister should be wailing, even when he speaks at social functions, about the financial position of this country.  He has been going off that rail to a certain extent recently, and I hope Deputy Captain Cowan can take credit for that change of front. He has been saying in cities, towns and rural areas that the country is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Did any Minister ever suggest anything more silly? I never heard of a business man or of anybody else being declared bankrupt according to the law of this country if he could prove, to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court, or to the satisfaction of whoever happened to be trying his case, that his assets were greater than his liabilities?

He encourages them to save more, to eat less, to spend less on clothing, on luxuries and on amusements, and to allow the banks, over whom this House has no control, to invest their savings in the Bank of England.  In other words, if there are savings as the result of this Budget, they are to be used for the purpose of building up bigger deposits in the Bank of England.  This would enable the British Government, which is on the verge of bankruptey, according to its own leaders, to use our people's savings to carry out a policy of rearmament.  Is that an unfair representation of the policy enshrined in this Appropriation Bill?  I do not want to be unfair to the Minister, but I think he should be a little bit more explanatory now that he is getting the last word on the last day of this session.</P>

I do not pay serious attention, at this time of the year, to the figures supplied weekly to Deputies recording the number of persons employed and unemployed on, for instance, the week ending the 10th of July as compared with the number employed or unemployed during the corresponding week of last year.  We <Col N="1844" /> are all aware that a big section of the workers are affected by the operation of the Employment Period Order.  The figures given to Deputies, therefore, at this time of the year are not a fair representation of the employment position. However, other figures are available, such as emigration figures, shipping figures and figures published by the Central Statistics Office, and these prove that emigration and unemployment are increasing either as a direct or as an indirect result of the Budget.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I am now going to mention, but I am not going to delay the House unnecessarily with regard to it, because I feel that my remarks or suggestions will fall on deaf ears.  Last year, as an ordinary elector in my own area, I received a request from the Fianna Fáil candidates there who were seeking election, including my colleague and friend, Deputy Seán Brady, to give them three first preference votes.</P>
    <P>Many reasons were given as to why I should do so.  Deputy Brady, who was elected, and the other candidates who were going forward with him at the time, promised, among a number of other things, &ldquo;energetically to deal with the cost of living and make price control effective.&rdquo;  That is another broken promise on the admission of the Tánaiste in this House the other day.  The Tánaiste, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was introducing his departmental Vote and he amazed me when he suggested that there was a good case for the removal of price control.  There was no further need for price control.  That is a public pledge given to the electors of the area where I reside by Deputy Brady and those other candidates who sought election with him about 13 months ago. Is not that another brazen breach of a promise publicly given to the electors of this country?  They would make price control effective.  How was it made effective?  It was made effective, for somebody other than the ordinary consumer, by reducing by 75 per cent. the subsidies provided to stabilise the cost of essential commodities.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is an honest and honourable man he will have to give <Col N="1845" /> some explanation of this particular pledge associated and coupled with the other pledges that were so solemnly&mdash; and as I thought sincerely&mdash;given yet brazenly broken without any explanation up to the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a motion down in connection with Vote 1, President's Establishment.  I want to take this opportunity of explaining, if I am in order&mdash;the President's Establishment is mentioned in the Appropriation Bill &mdash;the reason I put down that motion. I certainly did not want to pass any reflection on the present holder of the office.  On the contrary, I think that President O'Kelly deserves the thanks and the congratulation of the House and of the people for agreeing to continue to hold the office of President for another term.</P>

      <P>My object in putting down the motion to refer back the Estimate was to direct the attention of the House, the Government and the Opposition to the squandermania which affects both the Government and the Opposition.  I thought it would be a very useful thing to indicate to the country, if we are inclined towards economies, that we would start with the Head of the State.  I suppose that is as far as I may go on that point at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Vote 2, Houses of the Oireachtas are mentioned in the Appropriation Bill, I think it is about time that the House did something to prevent these scenes.  The House should do something to deal with accusations taking away the character of Deputies.  If a person is elected to Dáil Éireann, he is elected to do a certain business in respect of the people who sent him here.  Their private lives should not be investigated in this House and lies or libels should not be used by Deputies in this House against their opponents.  It is quite easy to take away a person's character but it is very difficult for that person to get rid of the tar or the tarnish imposed on him by a statement made in this House under the privilege of this House.  In my opinion, both sides of <Col N="1846" /> the House are equally guilty.  I think that if we are voting money for the Houses of the Oireachtas and Appropriations-in-Aid we should establish some machinery whereby, when a person comes into the House and takes away the character of another Deputy or if he says something that has nothing to do with the Deputy's business as a representative of the people in this House, he should be called on at least to give some reason, statement or excuse as to why he took away that particular Deputy's character.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is anybody in the country or in this House against whom some little thing may not be thrown some time.  If the privilege of this House is given to Deputies it should be used with respect.  If it is not used with respect, then that privilege should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an Appropriation-in-Aid in respect of agriculture. I do not believe that the Minister for Agriculture has dealt definitely with the situation that has occurred in regard to the pig trade.  I do not want to go into details in this respect since I do not know how far I am entitled to go into detail on the Appropriation Bill.  I again want to appeal to the Minister to open the Border for the export of store pigs or otherwise there will be no pigs and bacon in this country.  I want to appeal to the Minister to do something in regard to next season's market for oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Vote 52, the Minister for Finance is putting down Appropriations-in-Aid which, to my mind, are quite unsatisfactory.  Aer Lingus has made a certain profit but it has not offered service in the interests of the welfare of this country.  Aer Lingus has been a per baby and has sucked money from the Exchequer.  Aer Rianta has got over £3,000,000 in capital expenditure.  The annual expenditure in the Vote is over £500,000. The people are asked to pay that £500,000.  At the same time, the insular Dublin-minded mentality&mdash;even if it is Dublin-minded and not influenced from <Col N="1847" /> other sources&mdash;is preventing the recognition of an established airport in Cork.</P>
    <P>With regard to Vote 58, we are floating round the world and looking here, there and everywhere.  We are dealing with things miles away from us but if we looked at the difficulties within our own shores, I think we would be much better employed.  These are a few matters I wanted to refer to on this Appropriation Bill, and I would ask the Minister to take these points into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief, but I have felt that as this was the last occasion which the House would have to consider the economic position of the country before the Recess until October it was necessary to draw attention of the House to a certain number of factors that affect the present situation.  I may say that I was very surprised to find that on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, coming as it does more or less in the form of an Adjournment debate, neither the Minister for Finance nor any member of the Government made any declaration of policy, made any review of the economic position as it now is.  We heard a great many speeches since last October concerning the serious economic position of the country.  The Minister for Finance denied a few minutes ago that he had stated that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy.  He may be technically right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Has not the Minister already denied that he used the expression?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not say that the Minister actually said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>He may be technically right and he may not have used these actual words, but I think nobody in this House nor in the country would for one moment accept that the Minister had not hinted at an economic and financial position which was akin to bankruptcy.  He started off by making a speech, if I am not mistaken, at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last August <Col N="1848" /> in which he said that the safety of the currency was in danger.  I am not purporting to quote his exact words, but that was the effect of the speech made by the Minister for Finance and the speeches made by some of his less responsible colleagues in the course of the last few months.</P>
      <P>In view of that, it does seem rather surprising that we have had no indication from the Minister for Finance to-day or from any other member of the Government as to the present economic position of the country.</P>
      <P>Personally, I have taken the view that the economic position of the country was as strong as that of any other country in Europe and, possibly, considerably stronger, that we were wealthier than most other countries in Europe and were less endangered by the international economic trends that prevail at the moment than any other country in Europe, provided we had sufficient courage to meet the situation, provided we desisted from the pursuit of the disastrous policy of exporting our money and our people out of the country, provided we were permitted to utilise our money in the country to develop our resources. That, I think, is a view shared possibly by at least one member of the Government, but it certainly is not the view of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As a result of the deflationary policy which is being pursued we now have 10,000 more people unemployed that at this time last year.  We have an ever-increasing flow of emigration, and in many businesses there is complete chaos as a result of the deflationary policy which is being pursued.  These are grave matters and I think the House is entitled to a clear-cut statement of policy from the Government before the House adjourns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October or November, the leader of the Labour Party introduced a motion dealing with unemployment, dealing with the economic position as he then saw it.  That motion was debated for a day or two and then, to everybody's astonishment, the Tánaiste came in and accepted the motion and undertook that steps would be taken to minimise the then rising unemployment. What steps have been taken <Col N="1849" /> to minimise unemployment in the country?  Has there been one single step taken by the Government to minimise unemployment, to minimise emigration?  The unemployment figures show that no effective steps have been taken.  On the contrary, we are now facing a more serious unemployment position than we were even last autumn.</P>
    <P>Not only have no steps been taken to minimise unemployment but, by their own deliberate acts, the Government are creating more unemployment. The cut in the Vote for Forestry, the reduction in the area to be planted this year, will create more unemployment. The cut in the Vote for Gaeltacht Services, to which so much lipservice is given, will also create more unemployment.  It is common knowledge that wholesale dismissals are about to be put into force in Córas Iompair Éireann.  The country will find it very difficult to believe that this is being done without the approval of the Government.  If there is redundancy in Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy knows the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it can be dealt with over a period of years without at this particular moment adding to the already vast unemployment in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be more patience with and more tolerance of the policy which is being pursued by the Government and the Minister in particular if it could be said that they were pursuing this policy without appreciation of the consequences.  But that cannot be said because the object of the policy which is being implemented was fully set out for them in the report of the Central Bank, which was discussed at length in this House. In that report&mdash;I think these are words which should never be forgotten in this House and should never be forgotten to the Central Bank&mdash;it was pointed out that public works could be reduced in order to remedy the unusually <Col N="1850" /> favourable condition of employment. In other words, the purpose of this policy is to create unemployment and the purpose of creating unemployment is to reduce consumption so that we may conserve and build up vast reserves of wasting sterling assets, vast masses of paper notes that will probably in a few years' time purchase nothing.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies on the Government side of the House to read coldly and objectively the report of the Central Bank, and to examine it, first of all, from the point of view of determining whether they agree with the objectives set out in that report.  Do they agree that there is an unusually favourable condition of employment in this country? Do they agree that the economic policy of this State should be subordinated to the amassing or safekeeping of vast sums of money to be invested in England, vast sums of money that should be utilised for the development of this country?  Do they agree with that policy?</P>
      <P>Having done that, I would ask Deputies to examine the advice tendered by the Central Bank and to compare it with the policy pursued by the present Minister for Finance.  Step by step, every proposal in that report has been implemented.  The Central Bank advised the curtailment of credit.  That has been done.  The Central Bank advised the removal of subsidies so that consumption would be reduced. That has been done.  The Central Bank advised the imposition of additional taxes, preferably of an indirect nature. That has been done.  Now we are beginning to feel the results.  By the time this House meets in October the country will be fully alive to the results of the implementation of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputies who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party should really pull themselves up and examine this question away from Party prejudices and away from the heat of debate.  If they would only, during the next couple of months, take stock of the position, they would realise that the policy which they are supporting at the moment is a policy which is diametrically <Col N="1851" /> opposed to the policy for which Fianna Fáil originally stood.  I do not think that Deputies who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party should allow themselves to be cajoled, or may I say &ldquo;codded,&rdquo; by arguments that that policy was a necessary policy. It was not a necessary policy.  No policy which produces unemployment, no policy which is intended to preserve the pattern whereby we export capital out of the country, is a necessary policy.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which is somewhat related to this question, to which I should like to refer is the question of the increase in the bank rate.  We have a Price Control Tribunal and we have a general outcry when the price of any commodity goes up.  That is natural. Probably the greater the degree of control, the more any manufacturer or any trader is subjected to a careful inquisition before he is entitled to raise the price of his goods, the more likelihood there is that he will be kept in check.  Has it ever occurred to Deputies that it is very extraordinary that the banks should be allowed to increase the amount they charge for lending money without being subjected to any form of investigation or inquiry?  The bank rate has been increased substantially.  We are inclined to think of the bank rate as if it were some mysterious phenomenon, not realising what it means.  The increase in the bank rate means an increase in the charges to local authorities for a loan.  It means an increase in the amount of money which the Government has to pay for loans.  It means an increase in charges to every firm, to every manufacturer, to every farmer and every businessman in the country.</P>
    <P>Was there any good reason why these charges should be suddenly increased? Did the cost of running the banks go up?  Were the bank clerks given added pay suddenly?  Had the profits of the banks fallen to such an extent that it was necessary that they should have a higher rate of interest?  Did the banks find themselves unable to pay the director's fees?  Why has the bank rate <Col N="1852" /> been increased?  Why should a small group of people, most of whom have little or no interest in this country, be entitled to determine that they are entitled to a higher rate of profits than before.  I know that you can put up a good many arguments why an increase in the bank rate in England should be automatically followed by an increase in the bank rate here, but surely some steps should be taken to prevent that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason why it could not be done is to prevent the flow of capital from here to England but in many countries the flow of capital has been checked.  There is no particular reason that makes it more difficult for us to keep control of our monetary system than for any other country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be good enough to say it in plain words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to prevent the outflow of capital that the bank rate here is kept at the same rate as prevails in most countries.  That is the policy of a country whose economy is completely subservient to that of another country.  This country cannot, so long as economic and financial policy is determined, not by the needs of the country, not by the needs of our own economy but by the needs of the economy of another country, adequately control its financial system.  This is not a question of being anti-British or proIrish. It is a question of bad business. Obviously the needs of a big industrial country are entirely different from the economic requirements of small, undeveloped agricultural countries such as ours.  It is lunacy for us automatically to pursue the same economic and financial policy as Britain and until we have the courage to stand on our own legs and to pursue our own policy, we shall have to face economic crises whenever Britain has one.  We shall have unemployment and emigration. As I have said, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party should be the first people to understand that.  If they <Col N="1853" /> just think of what happened before, if they do not allow themselves to be led by Central Bank officials and by the officials of the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You could take no steps to counteract the devaluation of the £.  My only regret is that so much of our money is invested in England that we can do nothing in that regard.  While that money is invested in England, there is no step we can take to counteract devaluation.  That is why, when the Minister talks about &ldquo;saving the £&rdquo;, he is talking utter nonsense and he should know it.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to float a loan some time in the near future.  I hope that he will have support for that loan but I think that he really did not go the right way about it by the tone he adopted in his speeches in the course of the past few months.  I cannot conceive any worse way to secure the confidence of investors than to decry the solvency of your own security.  However, let me say this, that I think the Minister was completely wrong and that this is one of the most solvent countries in Europe.  I hope that the Minister will not hesitate to admit his mistake by defending the solvency and the credit-worthiness of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many things are said at election times, and I do not want to rehash many of the speeches that were made in the course of the recent by-elections.  There was one statement made by the Taoiseach which, I think, should be contradicted.  He may have been wrongly reported, but the statement is one which, I think, is damaging to the credit of the country and would be damaging to the Minister for Finance in floating his loan.  The Taoiseach, speaking in Limerick, said that our sterling assets had dwindled to £125,000,000.  That figure, of course, is completely wrong.  The Minister for Finance had to issue a paper subsequently trying to cover up that, but he did not deal with this particular point.  The total holdings of the sterling assets of this country amount to <Col N="1854" /> between £400,000,000 and £500,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the answers I gave him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered many questions in regard to sterling assets.  The one question which the Minister has not answered is the total estimate of gross sterling assets.  The Minister plays around with what he calls net figures.  The net figures, in all cases, are arrived at by a deduction of the normal holdings of every firm not registered in the country.  I gather that sums amounting to between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000 are deducted for the firm of Messrs.  Guinness, for instance, because it happens to be registered in England and, therefore, the firm of Messrs.  Guinness, instead of being looked upon as an asset is looked upon as being a liability in the Minister's financial list.  In the same way, the liquid assets of a number of our banks are treated as a liability instead of being treated as an asset.  If I am not correct in that statement it should be very easy for the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance to publish the gross figures and the net figures side by side and to explain how they reached the net figures.  That they have steadfastly refused to do.  I think it would be desirable, if the Minister wishes his loan to succeed, to make it quite clear that the figure of £125,000,000 given by the Taoiseach is not a correct figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, too, as this is an adjournment debate, that some indication <Col N="1855" /> should be given, in the course of what is an economic review, of the progress that is being made in the discussions with the trade union movement concerning an increase in wages.  We have had a number of strikes which have been damaging to the country.  Some effort should be made to avoid conflicts, concerning wages, reaching strike point.  I think that possibly a more energetic approach to that question could have been taken.  One strike, in particular, has been dragging on for over a year.  I think it now involves a very small number of men and a very small amount of money, but it is costing the State and the people concerned considerable sums of money.  That is the strike of electricians in Córas Iompair Éireann.  I understand that a lot of Córas Iompair Éireann material has been severely damaged, that a lot of it has been left lying up, with the result that Córas Iompair Éireann has not been earning what it could be earning by reason of the strike.  I think that more active steps should be taken to try and bring it to an end.  I think this is an appropriate time to raise that, and that it is a matter which the Government should take in hands.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to re-echo portion of some of the remarks that were made by Deputy Lehane who rather adroitly brought in incidents that have occurred in this House recently.  I think the time has come when members of this House should realise that incidents such as we have had in recent months are damaging not merely to themselves and not merely to the House, but to the country as well, and that they do not serve any useful purpose.  I know it is very hard to resist the temptation of joining in cross fire and in interruptions in the House.  I know that very often people's tempers get up, and that they say things that they probably should not say.  I think we should take steps to remedy that position.  I think that the only way we can remedy it properly is by investing the Ceann Comhairle, the Chair, with much wider powers than he has at the moment.</P>

I think that if a Deputy found that, when he transgressed the rules of order and of good conduct, he would be deprived of a week's or a month's allowance, he would be much more careful before transgressing the rules of the House again.

I hope that to-day, before the Dáil rises, the Minister will deal with the economic position&mdash; particularly with the unemployment situation and the steps which the Government propose to take to deal with the increased unemployment which is taking place and which is bound to continue if the present policy continues.</P>

      <P>We are about to adjourn for the Summer Recess, and I think it is right that we should take serious note of the country's position.  I feel very strongly that the time has come when an end should be put for ever to what is known as character assassination in this House.  I have no doubt whatever that the greatest offenders in this respect are the members of the legal profession&mdash;men who, in the courts, have acquired the art of efficiently and effectively smearing the character of a witness even before the vigilant attention of the judge can be drawn to the attack.  That technique has been exercised in this House by some members of the legal profession over a considerable period but particularly in the past few years.  Many Deputies have been the victims of that smear campaign.  It is absolutely essential that effective measures be adopted to prevent that vile and malicious practice from continuing in this House.  I am quite sure that there is a strong public opinion now not only in this House but outside this House in favour of such corrective measures. A Deputy may strike as hard as he can at the political record or the political outlook of another Deputy. When he goes further than that and makes an attack on the character of a Deputy in relation to his own private life or in relation to his business or profession it is altogether a different matter.  I think a number of Deputies on both sides of the House feel very strongly about this matter.  If we deal with it in the proper way we can remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Deputy MacBride has joined the Labour Party.  His new <Col N="1858" /> political leader, Deputy Davin, advances in age but not in wisdom or in a sense of responsibility.  His speech to-night in this debate was typical of his utterly and completely irresponsible attitude towards national, economic and financial matters.  If he does not advance in responsibility he does not decline to any extent in political cunning. He dwelt at considerable length to-night on monetary reform.  He is aware that there is a monetary reform organisation in his constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be admitted that the present economic position of all European countries is very serious. Most of us have been forced to read British newspapers for the past few days as a result of the printers' strike in this city.  In these British newspapers we read of the grave economic position of Great Britain.  We read of the deep alarm which is felt in regard to the unfavourable state of that nation's balance of payments.  We read the same comments and statements in regard to most of the European nations.  Therefore, if any responsible person in this House says that this country is in a grave economic position I think he is saying only what everybody in this country knows to be true.  It is a fact that must be faced and overcome by practical measures because it is a danger to our progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride has challenged Deputies on the Government side of the House as to the measures being taken to improve this country's economic position.  He does not seem to realise that practically all legislation since the 13th June, 1951, has been directed towards the development of industry, agriculture, tourism and other activities with the object of improving our economic position, of keeping <Col N="1859" /> as much capital as we can in this country and of bringing back as much as we can of our investments abroad and using them for the development of this country.  Surely the Deputies on the Opposition side of the House have not failed to notice the development that has been taking place in the past year.</P>
    <P>The most important task of the Government and of everybody who wants this nation to progress is to expand the agricultural industry.  Nobody can deny that there is ample room for expansion. As a result of the deliberate policy of the inter-Party Government, 500,000 acres of land went out of tillage on the pretext that we could import from the ends of the earth unlimited supplies of foodstuffs for our live stock.  If these 500,000 acres were put under tillage they would yield us additional food for our population and feeding-stuffs for our live stock as well as providing considerable additional employment.  I appeal to the Government to keep this matter in mind during the next three months.  One of the reasons why Deputy MacEntee is now Minister for Finance is that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is 2d. a lb. on the butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the inter-Party Government trampled upon a progressive agricultural policy and upon agricultural effort.  Within the next two months oats will be offered for sale on the market.  We must remember that the action of the inter-Party Government in regard to oats contributed in a large measure to their subsequent removal from office.  I trust that the present Government will take serious note of the position of those farmers who have increased the acreage under tillage and sought to produce a foodstuff for our live stock in the form of roots.  I would like to say in reply to Deputy MacBride that there is no use in talking about capital investment. There is no use in talking about the Central Bank Report.  There is no use in bandying these phrases about.  The only way to keep our money in this country and to make it productive in this country, the only way to give <Col N="1860" /> employment in this country, to give a decent reward to those who are engaged in production is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to assist them in every way to earn a livelihood.  The man who ploughs a field and grows a crop is entitled to a decent reward for his work.  It is not by means of empty phrases such as Deputy MacBride and other Opposition Deputies are in the habit of using that you can improve the economic condition of the country. The man who ploughs his land and grows a crop is doing something practical to provide employment here, to provide home-produced wealth here. The same is true of an organisation like Bord na Móna which is engaged in producing fuel.  The same is true of the production of native coal and all other commodities.  It was in regard to that particular matter that I felt a little anxious when the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out that imports of anthracite coal, which is produced here, are considerable while we are finding it difficult at the moment to obtain a market for our home produced anthracite.  There again is a matter which needs the vigilant attention of the Government.  Whatever we engage in producing whether it be food or fuel, or whether it be manufactured goods, that production ought to be sustained by ensuring, as far as it is possible for the Government to ensure, a market within this State.</P>
      <P>There was a good deal said here to-night about rates of interest.  We all know that as a small nation with limited resources, with some of our banks owned and controlled outside our country, with all of them to a certain extent under external control or pressure of some sort or another, it is extremely difficult to strike a rate of interest for our nation independent of that prevailing in those countries with which we have such a close financial and commercial contact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Government, the previous Government or any Government since the establishment of this State cannot be held responsible for the fact that this nation is closely interlocked commercially and financially with Great Britain and with other nations.  We export a very large amount of our total produce to Great Britain, and we import a very considerable quantity of our requirements from Great Britain and from those other nations which control the financial system of the world.  It is not possible in a world such as we live in to adopt the ideals of monetary reform which Deputy Davin has so enthusiastically expounded.  If the whole world were under one political system there would, of course, be no difficulty in the political authority of that federation, if you like, having complete control of the issue of credit and currency, but in the world in which we live we have to accept facts as they are.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, accepting all those facts, I have often wondered is there not something we could do to provide loans for specific purposes at a cheaper rate than the ordinary rates of interest. I have read and heard a good deal about loans in other nations, loans in which the advancing of a certain amount of money is linked up with the provision of technical and other assistance. I have often wondered if that matter could not be considered here particularly in regard to certain aspects of agriculture.  If there is some particular branch that requires development I think that money should be advanced at a very nominal rate of interest and with the advance of money technical and other assistance should be provided.  Thus you would have the provision of financial assistance linked up with the provision of technical advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might be particularly true with regard to the short-term loan, and I have often wondered whether it might be possible to finance such a scheme not by borrowing but out of ordinary revenue.  We hear a good deal of discussion on the fact that a Government <Col N="1862" /> cannot lend money at less than they have to borrow at.  If they have to borrow money at a high rate of interest, they have to charge a high rate for it, but in the case certainly of short-term loans money can be advanced out of ordinary revenue, and that of course does not carry any interest.  That may sound a revolutionary proposal.  It may sound like taxation in excess of what is required for current expenditure in order to provide money for short-term loans for the country.</P>

      <P>If they could do that they could borrow all the money they could and they would then be in a position to lend it at a lower rate of interest. We are, however, living in a realistic world and not in a cloudcuckoo-land. The only way to make progress in this world is by facing realities resolutely, as resolutely as did the people in Mayo recently when they discarded Deputy Blowick's airy fantasies, accepted plain, blunt facts and acted accordingly.  Deputy Blowick must realise the kind of propaganda he is trying to disseminate by way of interruption. It is the kind of propaganda that was proclaimed from the house-tops by him and his colleagues in the constituency of North Mayo within the past few weeks, and it was completely repudiated there by the hard-headed people of that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies would have us believe that the Minister for Finance is not painting a sufficiently rosy picture of the nation's economic position.  I would ask those Deputies to read the speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan recently.  He did not paint a very rosy picture of our present economic position.  In the course of the last month he proclaimed that our country was sinking down into virtual bankruptcy, that unemployment would increase, that trade would continue to decline and that the country was, in fact, going to the dogs.  That was his contribution.  He was not very helpful but I do not think anybody now places any reliance in Deputy McGilligan's pronouncements.  While approving of strict control to prevent anything in the way of profiteering in either the manufacture or distribution of goods and while supporting the idea of a prices advisory tribunal I think that body should be made more representative of the farming community and more sympathetic to that section of our people.  Deputy Lehane very <Col N="1864" /> properly voiced his opinion that the present Prices Advisory Body is somewhat hostile to the farming community particularly when an application comes before them for an increase in the price of agricultural commodities.  I think the Minister should take steps to ensure that agriculture is represented on that body.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a close association with the Office of the Commissioner for Valuation.  That is the office that deals with the valuation of property. I urge upon him the necessity for restricting and controlling to some extent the activities of that body. When farm buildings are improved in an effort to expand agricultural production there should be no increase in valuation as a result of that improvement. We should make every effort now to ensure that our agricultural industry is well equipped and that any attempt at improvement is not restricted or hampered by governmental action.</P>
      <P>There is no truth in the suggestion made by Deputy MacBride that there has been a serious cut in forestry activity in relation to the provision of employment.  I represent a county where forestry is perhaps more extensive than it is elsewhere in the country. There are more workers employed this year in that county than were employed last year, and there is a better prospect of work in the county than there ever was in the past.  The forestry branch is acquiring more land, and from every point of view an effort is being made to provide additional employment for our people on the land, on afforestation and in every other activity where the opportunity offers. We want to see that policy continued. We want to see it expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recess I would advise the Opposition Deputies to sit down and think over the best way of improving the position of the country, and not just the best weapon with which to hit the Government.  I hope when they come back in the autumn they will come back with minds cleared of the old narrow prejudice and bitterness.  I hope they will not come back still obsessed with the idea that they have <Col N="1865" /> been unjustly pushed out of office, and that they ought to be put back into office immediately.</P>

      <P>The people have shown that they do not want them in office. Realising that, they should sit down and examine their consciences, and they should endeavour to work out a constructive policy.  Only in that way can they hope to gain increased support. A policy of empty, barren criticism appeals only to those who have not got the brains to think for themselves, and who are prepared to listen to the type of appeal made by Deputy Davin this evening.  That type of appeal will not get support from those who can think.  Even if it did, it would not be good for the nation.</P>
      <P>The present Government is in office because it is composed of men who have the courage to think out what is best for the nation economically and financially.  Having decided what is best, they have the courage to implement their policy.  The steps taken to rectify the financial and economic position of the country during the past few months were not steps calculated to win popular support from those people who act according as Government regulations affect them personally.  I think it is now admitted that by being sufficiently courageous in their approach to the nation's problems and by thinking not merely of the immediate present for their political Party but of the future of the nation they have immeasurably strengthened their position in the House and throughout the country.  That is an example which ought to be taken to heart by the younger members of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They ought to make up their minds that if they want to survive as a political Party, their only hope of survival lies in thinking of this nation's future, not in thinking immediately of how they will grab a few votes, of how they will discredit the Government or those who have supported the Government, or how to pick out and smear particular individuals on the Government side.  Their only hope lies in thinking out ways and means by which they can <Col N="1866" /> increase this nation's productive capacity and its capacity to employ our own people here.  That is the advice I want to give the Opposition now, and I tender it particularly to the younger members, because it is upon them that the future of the Opposition Party will depend.  They have to remember that they are going to be an Opposition Party for quite a long time, and they have plenty of time to think out a constructive national policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the position of certain civil servants who are adversely affected by the fact that their pensions have not been increased and I want to draw attention to another small group who are similarly affected and who may or may not have been included in Deputy Costello's appeal.  I refer to members of the Garda Síochána who resigned before the recent increase in salaries and who are drawing pensions which compare very unfavourably with those enjoyed by members of the force now resigning. It is not right that, in the case of men who served together, there should be a disparity in their conditions once they have gone out of the service of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion gives me an opportunity of fulfilling a promise I made to very many Dublin unemployed workers.  The position at the North Wall at the moment is very serious. There are about a dozen men for every <Col N="1867" /> job that becomes vacant and some hundreds of men are idle at the North and South Walls.  There does not appear to be any chance of early employment for them and they have to meet the heavily increased cost of living brought about recently by the Budget, a Budget which raised the price of the loaf of bread from 6d. to 9d. or 9½d. That appears to be causing a good deal of worry in the City of Dublin and I promised these unemployed men that I would raise their case here, and see if the Government could suggest any schemes of work that would absorb their energies.</P>
      <P>There are a few public boards here in Dublin which could give good paying employment if they speeded up matters.  We have been promised two or three new bridges to ease the traffic situation for the past few years and if this work were undertaken early it would give reasonably good employment to a very large number. That, however, will not absorb the unemployed dockers.  There do not appear to be very many goods going out from the North or South Walls, nor does there appear to be very much coming in, and these men are waiting outside the offices for a call to some temporary or, if possible, permanent work.  They want to know from the Government before they adjourn for nearly three months what they are going to do for them.  This House is to go on holidays for three months with Dublin in its present condition and the plight of the Dublin unemployed so serious and I suggest that the Government ought to make arrangements for the appointment of an emergency committee to deal with unemployment problems during the absence of Dáil members for the next three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building of these bridges I referred to would give employment to a certain number.  That means the release of money and the Government could probably encourage other local authorities to go ahead with relief schemes.  Unfortunately, we are back to where we were 15 or 20 years ago when it was necessary to have relief schemes frequently in the City of <Col N="1868" /> Dublin.  If the Government would encourage local authorities to go ahead with relief schemes and promised substantial grants, it would ease the situation to a certain degree.</P>
    <P>Within the last month or two, we have had many questions asking for the Emigration Commission report and asking also if the Government proposed to give us any satisfaction regarding the continued emigration from this country of young men and women who are leaving our shores, where their energies might be absorbed in building up their own country at decent wages, not only in dozens but hundreds every week.  Some of these are married men who are going away to take up employment&mdash;they do not have to go to America now&mdash;in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>This means keeping two homes, and keeping two homes on the wages these men earn, with the 6d. loaf gone up to 9d. and every other commodity they buy so far as foodstuffs are concerned, from the smallest to the largest article, increased in price by at least 20 per cent. in the past couple of years. These are the facts as I know them in the city, and we ask the Government to tell us what proposals they have for that type of person who is left without work, and without sufficient money to provide the necessary food for his large family.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton had a question down with regard to the much boasted about increased national health benefits for the sick and those unable to earn their living for the time being.  They got a slight increase.  We have a scheme of benefits for tuberculosis sufferers which enables them to stay in sanatoria and hospitals for much longer periods, with the result that they improve in health.  We are all glad to know that tuberculosis in this country is rapidly declining, according to reports from all our public health authorities.  These national health benefits are increased, and these people get 7/- or 8/- and the authorities &mdash;the Government pays 50 per cent.&mdash; reduce the tuberculosis allowance by 9/- or 10/-.  As a result of the so-called increase under the Social Services Act, they are left with a couple of shillings <Col N="1869" /> less at the end of the week, although their bread has gone up from 6d. to 9d. and their butter from 3/- to 3/10. We know that, in the case of a tubercular family, butter is a most essential food.</P>
    <P>All these things are happening just as this House is about to adjourn and we will have no opportunity of raising matters by way of question.  I am a great believer in questions.  I have very little influence in the House in the way of getting anything remedied, but for a Private Deputy the parliamentary question is the best method. It gives them an opportunity of exposing grievances and making those at the head of affairs remedy them when they are sufficiently exposed.  For the next three months we will be deprived of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has been asked questions by his own colleagues who took an active interest in an increased pension for the Old I.R.A. There are not many of the old hands left and now that they are getting old something additional should be given to them to meet the cost of living. Any time that the question was raised from any side of the House, however, we were told that he could not give a decision on whether legislation would be introduced or not.  We are now adjourning without knowing whether he will introduce legislation or give increased pensions.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked from three different parts of the House whether school teachers who retired prior to January, 1951, would get the benefit of the lump sum which was promised.  Every time we raised that question we were told that the matter was being considered and that no decision had been reached.  That means that there will be no decision for three months because we will not be here to question the Minister.  These retired teachers, the unfortunate Civic Guards, the Dublin Metropolitan Policemen, the ex-National Army men who retired on a small pension some years ago, have no way of adding to their pension to meet the increase in the cost of living imposed by the Budget some months ago.</P>

      <Col N="1870" /> I wish to refer to a very unfortunate type of person, with a little benefit&mdash; if you can call it &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;&mdash;a few miserable shillings.  Take an old man of 65&mdash;I hope that he is not old at 65. Nobody wants to give him employment. Take an elderly woman of 65 who is given a few miserable shillings from the poor law board.  She may have a widow's contributory or non-contributory pension and is getting a few shillings for the payment of her rent, but the board of assistance has availed of the opportunity of the means test to reduce her allowance.  The Minister in a reply, however, very kindly stated that he did not issue a circular to any local authorities urging them to reduce the tuberculosis allowance.  I was glad to hear him say that because I am informed that he did issue a circular and that they were acting on that circular. Some confusion arises.</P>

      <P>I am talking about a later circular of the last week or two. I accepted the Minister's statement that he did not issue the new circular which reduced the tuberculosis allowances under the Act which, I think, the Minister himself had something to do with.  I remember the occasion four or five years ago when he was asked for consent by the corporation for the tuberculosis scheme, and he sanctioned it.  I am not quite sure that it was the present Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister says that he did not issue the circular reducing the tuberculosis allowance and that no circular was issued to local authorities and public health authorities directing them because of the means test to reduce people in respect of outdoor assistance, I hope that he will make more inquiries and see that the outdoor assistance is restored, and that the tuberculosis allowance together with the small increase given by the National Health Board will be paid.  I hope that one will not be put against <Col N="1871" /> the other for the purpose of reducing the allowance.</P>
      <P>At the present moment there is a set-back in the building industry.  I do not know what the reason is.  It is not that the materials are tied up and we have got the workers home from England with a guarantee of 20 years' work.  They came home but for some unknown reason there appears to be a decline&mdash;not very much&mdash;in the building industry which has increased unemployment. These men may wait for a week or two, a month or two or maybe three, to see if they can get employment in their own country but if they go away again you will not get them back in a hurry when you want them to build.</P>
      <P>There is a matter in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce should take a special interest.  We read in the newspapers during the last five or six months that our shipping company is to build or buy certain ships. I would ask the Minister to see that those ships are built at home.  If our shipyards, through lack of graving docks, are not capable of going ahead with more than one or two at a time the Minister might seek expert advice to see if it would be possible to build, in Dublin, dockyards equal to those in various parts of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, so that we might build up a big shipbuilding industry. We have splendid repair shops throughout the country.  I do not know if any of them are slack at the present time because the size of the ships puts them beyond the capabilities of the various shipyards.</P>

      <P>How these men fall for it.  It is just like to-day when I asked the Minister to give me the number of evictions which took place, and he <Col N="1872" /> said that 2,000 decrees were obtained by the Dublin Corporation.  That is exactly what I wanted the Minister to say so that I could raise it in Dublin Corporation, draw attention to it, and see that they did not continue it.  Now the Deputy has drawn attention to the shipyard at Rushbrooke, and said that it was capable of doing the work.  Two ships, however, were advertised for tender within the last month, and Rushbrooke did not get them.  Rushbrooke did not tender.  Rushbrooke is capable of doing good and valuable repairs, but I was on the board and they did not tender for either of the ships.  One was to cost £270,000.  I am glad that the Lord Mayor of Cork has given me an opportunity of drawing attention to the matter.  I hope that he will get busy and ask the people in Rushbrooke to develop their yards, to bring in more men and tender for ships for which advertisements appear in the newspapers.  Thanks Mr. Lord Mayor for giving me the opportunity, because I am very keenly interested in shipbuilding.  It may sound peculiar, but I have been an honorary member of the Boilermakers' and Shipbuilders' Trade Union for many years.  I am glad that Deputy McGrath is taking an interest, and will see that Rushbrooke will employ more men and build more ships.  I would be delighted to go down and join him, if he would give me the invitation, for the opening of the new shipyard, when we will build the ships required in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would again ask the Minister to do something quickly for the unemployed of this city.  Other members of the Dáil representing the farming community can put forward their own case.  Dublin, on this glorious day full of sunshine, is looking well.  When you go down O'Connell Street to the Gresham Hotel and look back to Nelson Pillar, you are glad that Dublin is looking so well; but when you take the first turn to the right and look around you, you ask immediately: &ldquo;Where is the much boasted prosperity?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if it is possible to make head or tail of this debate.  Every Deputy who spoke on <Col N="1873" /> the Estimates would seem to have seized this opportunity to serve up his speeches as a sort of hotch-potch reheated for the last day of the session. I should, perhaps, make some exceptions to that rather comprehensive statement.  Deputy Costello was commendably brief and raised a matter to which I have given a great deal of consideration and which has given me a great deal of worry.  I share the views he expressed as to the services which the pensioners to whom he referred have given to this nation, particularly in the days which followed 1922 when we were endeavouring to set up our own administration and our own Departments of State.  Unfortunately, however, we cannot consider their claims without having full regard to all the financial repercussions which the granting of them would undoubtedly have.  There are many other persons who retired on pension prior to last year who could, at least in their own minds, make as strong a case for reconsideration of their position as those for whom Deputy Costello spoke. Deputy Cogan referred, for instance, to the Gardaí who resigned prior to the introduction of the new scales in 1951. There are national teachers who retired prior to December 31st, 1950, and there are many other classes of pensioner who would put themselves on all fours, in their own minds at least, with those for whom Deputy Costello spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though it would cost a comparatively small sum&mdash;an almost insignificant sum, having regard to the size of the State Budget&mdash;to grant their claims, nevertheless once they were granted we would have to consider all these other classes.  The amount involved then would not be £10,000 or £11,000, but I can say almost for certain that it would run into more than £1,000,000.  When we talk of increasing a pension we must not forget that such an increase represents an annual charge on the State for a number of years.  If we were to assume an additional obligation in respect of pensions of former public servants, which would run perhaps into a sum considerably in excess of £1,000,000, it means inevitably that we have to find that sum or more out of taxation.  It means something <Col N="1874" /> more on whiskey, or something more on beer or tobacco, or something more on petrol.  That is really what is involved in these demands.  That is the only way I can look at this question. We cannot get this money anywhere except out of the taxpayers' pocket. Therefore, we cannot look merely to what one might describe as the human side of the case.  We cannot take only the compassionate view of it: we have to take a realistic view.  In these matters of public expenditure, the person who is ultimately involved is the taxpayer.  I have seen no enthusiasm on the part of those who have advocated expenditure in this House to justify the fiscal measures necessary in order to enable us to incur that expenditure and meet it when it arises.  That lack of enthusiasm was particularly manifest in the three last weeks of last month.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to deal with Deputy Davin.  We have heard him so often here, always so prolix and always so inaccurate, and so careless about the allegations which he makes.  For instance, he alleged that I had committed myself to an absurd statement down in Limerick.  I stated I had not been guilty of the irresponsible utterance which he ascribed to me, and I asked him to quote my words.  Then he calmly told the House&mdash;having previously informed us that the Minister for Finance, speaking in Limerick, had said such and such&mdash;that he had not heard it, but that a colleague of his had.  That is typical of the sort of allegation which we hear day in and day out from Deputy Davin.  I wish he would learn a new speech or buy a new record.  He might speak more briefly, but certainly more effectively, if he did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane referred to the motion which he had on the Order Paper to refer back Vote 1, which is for the President's Establishment. He said he put it down in order to draw attention to the squandermania which, he stated, existed in the minds not only of the Government but of the Opposition.  He thought that the best way of drawing public attention to that <Col N="1875" /> was to move to refer back that Vote. I should have thought that, if the Deputy wished to impress the House with his zeal for economy, he might have found a better medium for conveying what he had in mind if he had moved to refer back Vote 2&mdash;on which in fact he did have something to say&mdash;since it is under Vote 2 that the allowances to Deputies and Senators are provided.  If we are going to talk about economy on that particular plane, surely it would be better for us to begin the economies here at home?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate which the Deputy did wish to move to refer back, I think he is under a misapprehension as to its purpose.  Vote 1 deals with the President's Establishment. It amounts to £6,440.  That is for what might be described as the Civil Service Establishment, the administrative secretariat which is necessary in order to enable the President to discharge his functions under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As you know, apart altogether from the many demands which are made upon the President's time socially and in respect of public functions of one sort and another, the President has a very onerous and responsible part to play in the making of our laws.  The President's Establishment, which exists to assist him in this sphere, in fact might be said to be on all fours with the secretariat of any Department of State.  It fulfils in relation to the presidential functions exactly the same purpose as the secretariat of the Department of Finance or the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce plays in respect to the Ministers who are responsible to Parliament for the administration of those branches of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to deal with the points which were raised by Deputy MacBride.  Deputy MacBride, of course, came in and asked us why was it necessary that the bank rate should be raised.  It would be quite futile to try to inculcate any sort of financial understanding in Deputy MacBride.  I only want to say that <Col N="1876" /> when Deputy MacBride was speaking some Deputy put the question to him: &ldquo;If you feel that we should have a completely independent currency system in this country such as you have advocated, why did not you, in September, 1949, when the £ was devalued, persuade your colleagues not to follow suit?  Why did not you persuade them to maintain the Irish £ at the previous four dollar parity?&rdquo; Of course, Deputy MacBride did not answer that question, but it would be very interesting if he or some member of the previous Administration would disclose why they took the course they did in regard to sterling.</P>
    <P>I assume that Deputy MacBride, when this matter was discussed by the Government in September, 1949, did endeavour to ensure that this link, as we call it, with sterling would be broken and that the Irish £ would be maintained at its previous four dollar parity.  Who was it overbore Deputy MacBride on that occasion when this very serious matter was being considered and when he had an excellent opportunity of giving effect to those theories which he propounds so often in the House and elsewhere in the country?  Was it, for instance, his colleague who on one occasion in this House said this&mdash;I am quoting, Sir, from Volume 76 of the Dáil Debates, columns 1817 and 1818:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is plain to the observant that unless we correct the adverse trade balance and correct it soon we are going to have a crash.  All the indications are there.  We have never retained any gold in our central banks.  But the same barometer is available because our joint stock banks have held external assets and by a process of calculation we can determine the net external assets. They were £72,000,000 in 1934, after American money had gone back to America, in 1935 they were £71,000,000; in 1936, £72,000,000, and remained fairly stable over that period.  In 1937, they were £67,000,000 having fallen by £5,000,000, and in 1938 they were £61,000,000, a catastrophic fall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They fell by £6,000,000 in 1938 as compared <Col N="1877" /> with 1937 and it was described by one of Deputy MacBride's latterday colleagues as being a catastrophic fall.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be borne in mind that part of that catastrophic fall was due to the determined policy of the Oireachtas&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the determined policy of the Government</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;to settle the difference with England by the transfer of a capital sum of £10,000,000 to Great Britain, and that must be reflected in the external assets of the banks.  But they have been steadily dwindling, and they are steadily dwindling, and they show no signs of coming back.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the conclusion which Deputy Dillon drew on the 5th July, 1939, from that argument:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With the disappearance of every £1,000,000, our problem with regard to the balance of trade becomes more complicated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder was it Deputy Dillon who succeeded in defeating Deputy MacBride's endeavour in September, 1949, to break, as he calls it, the link with sterling.  Was it these arguments of his which prevailed ultimately with Deputy MacBride and, of course, with Deputy Dillon's other colleagues that, if we were to try to maintain this preSeptember parity of the £ to four dollars, we should inevitably have had to dissipate our external assets in endeavouring to support the Irish £ at that false parity and that, as Deputy Dillon said, with the disappearance of every £1,000,000, our problem with regard to the balance of payments becomes more complicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know Deputies opposite in latter days have been trying to have it both ways.  Prior to 1938, during all that period of the economic war, they were telling the country that we were heading for bankruptcy because we were <Col N="1878" /> keeping our money here at home.  We were not shipping it off to Great Britain, we were not paying out £5,000,000 every year under an agreement that had been made by our predecessors. We were keeping that money here and using it for the benefit of the Irish State.</P>

      <P>During that period we had all these banshee wails from Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and all the others, who are now telling us that the one thing that we ought to do is to get rid of these sterling assets. Too far right is left; too far east is west and the thing for us to do, while building up our capital resources here at home and while realising and repatriating these sterling assets, is to make sure that, when we are realising them and are repatriating them, we are putting them into truly remunerative and reproductive projects in Ireland. That is the difference between this Government and its predecessor, that we are behaving with judgment and with prudence and, as a result of the policy which has been adopted, the economic position of this country is already beginning to recover.  I do not want to raise any &ldquo;hellos&rdquo;.  I do not want to throw my hat in the air and start shouting &ldquo;hurrah&rdquo;.  There are signs already visible that the economic position of this country is improving.</P>

      <P>It is the people who have to be thanked for the fact that it looks as though we will weather the storm and get back on an even keel. Already, the position in regard to the <Col N="1879" /> balance of trade has begun to show a considerable improvement.  We have only passed through the first six months, so I do not propose to start prophesying but at least two months of the first half of the present year have been satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Some reference has been made to the unemployment position.  That, too, has improved.  I have here the returns for the 14th June.  I will take all that category of industries which are comprised under the heading of food.  I find that between the 7th May and the 14th June this year there has been a decrease of 315 in the live register&mdash;a decrease of almost 20 per cent. in this particular category.  There has been a world-wide slump in the textile industry&mdash;a slump which has hit many towns in Great Britain very severely.  However, in this country an improvement is beginning to show itself.  I find there has been a reduction of 365, or of 10 per cent. in the live register with regard to this industry&mdash;a reduction not proportionately so great as in the case of the industries connected with food.  In the clothing industry the reduction in the number of unemployed last month as compared with the preceding month was 496.  In the skins, leather, rubber and waterproof industries the reduction in the number of unemployed was 99.  All the industries on this list, with scarcely an exception, show an improvement in their employment position for mid-June as compared with mid-May.</P>
      <P>I have reason to believe that, as the year goes on, the position will improve, because, as Deputy Cogan said, there is a Government in office who can form an opinion as to what should be done in the national interest.  Though they knew that the measures they had to take would not be immediately popular, nevertheless, they took them and the people, realising that there was courage and sincerity behind these measures, supported them.  I believe they will continue to support the Government during their full term of office.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I very much regret that I have once more to draw your attention to another very deplorable occurrence involving a Senator and an ex-Minister and, consequently, a breach of the privileges of this House and of its members.</P>
      <P>At about 7.30 p.m. Deputy Dillon was subjected to an entirely unprovoked assault by Senator Quirke, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad.  Deputy Dillon was walking along the corridor outside the precincts of this Chamber going up the stairs adjacent to the main stairway leading to this Chamber, when he was accosted by Senator Quirke who obstructed his further passage in the direction in which he was intending to go.  Deputy Dillon, in his endeavour to move past Senator Quirke, was pressed against the wall of the stairway.  Subsequently, Senator Quirke assaulted the Deputy by knocking the cigarette which he was smoking out of his mouth, kept up the abusive stream of language which he had been uttering previously thereto and continued to obstruct Deputy Dillon's further passage.  The Captain of the Guard endeavoured to restrain Senator Quirke.  Another Senator was present on the occasion and admitted that Deputy Dillon had been assaulted.</P>
      <P>It is very deplorable that, within such a short period of time, another incident of this character should have occurred.  Senator Quirke was present in this Chamber yesterday, in the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, when I was directing your attention to the incident connected with the assault by the Minister for Education on Deputy Seán Collins.  He must have realised the gravity of the allegation that I put forward for your investigation at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This assault on Deputy Dillon took place after you had announced to the Dáil the result of your investigation and had declared here that the Minister for Education was guilty of contempt <Col N="1881" /> of Parliament.  The fact that the Leader of the Seanad&mdash;a member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;was guilty of this conduct within such a short period of time after your judgment had been pronounced upon my allegation here in the Dáil yesterday makes still more serious the conduct of that Senator.  I ask you, Sir, to investigate the matter and to report it to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>On a point of order, on general information, I want to ask you, Sir, to consider, when there is some complaint in regard to the conduct of a member of the Dáil or in relation to a member of the Dáil, whether it is proper that that matter should be brought up by an <i>ex parte</i> statement in the Dáil or whether, in the interests of the House and the nation, it would be proper to have the facts, as they are known, reported to you privately in the first instance.  I would submit, on a matter of order, that it is most improper to have this succession of <i>ex parte</i> statements made without our knowing whether or not they are true.</P>

      <P>I cannot, of course, decline to hear any complaint which a member of the Dáil proposes to make to me in respect of any interference with a member of this House. It may be a matter as to what would be the better form of procedure.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges could possibly discuss what is the best method of bringing the matter to the notice of the authorities in respect of the interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> The particular instance which has been brought to the notice of the House is somewhat more complex than the other incident which we unfortunately had to investigate for the past few days.  Deputy Dillon informed me privately of the incident in practically the same terms as those used by Deputy J.A. Costello.  The words may have been different, but the statement was practically the same.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of this House to protect the members of this House.  If a member of this House is interfered with in the discharge of his duty it is incumbent on the House to see that he has full liberty to discharge the duties put upon him.  As the Chairman of this House, it is my duty to see that a member of this House is protected to that extent.  I will go as far as I can to see that Deputies of this House are protected to that extent.</P>
    <P>This case is rendered complex by reason of the fact that a member of the other House is concerned and, of course, I have no means of dealing with that situation.  It may be a subject upon which this House may choose liaison of some kind with the Seanad to investigate the matter conjointly.</P>
    <P>Since this matter was reported to me, I have endeavoured to make as much investigation as I could. Obviously I could not have had sufficient information to reach any decision at the present time.  It would seem a cliché to say that it is regrettable but it is and more regrettable now inasmuch as the Second House of the Oireachtas is involved.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I should say anything at this stage in connection with this matter. I can only say, as I have already indicated to-day, that as far back as March 11th, 1947, being satisfied that we were starting on a course which would lead to incidents of the kind we have been investigating if not, perhaps, to something worse, I put down a motion, carefully designed, to try and make provision for the protection of members of this House as a whole against action outside and to protect them in the House and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> I was informed at an early stage, when coming into office in 1932, that there had been an attempt to do this earlier but that nothing had been done about it.  After very careful consideration and preparation, I put down a motion which, had it been passed by the House and which had it been considered and received the co-operation which I had hoped it would get would have provided for procedure by which any incidents of this kind could be properly dealt with.  By setting down the procedure and the privileges I believe we would have made incidents like this practically impossible.</P>
    <P>Since I heard of this other incident, I have ventured to put down for circulation a notice of motion to be considered apart from or together with any of these incidents the moment the Dáil meets again.  I think that is the only proper way to do it, to make the law envisage what might occur and not to make the law <i>ad hoc</i> for particular cases which, I think, is not the best way of doing it.  We ought to make the law as we make any other law, to cover the set of circumstances which we envisage might occur.</P>
    <P>I want to associate myself with the expressions of regret that things like this should happen.  I do hope that we will see the end of them in this House, and that fairly quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The veterinary profession and veterinary education in this country are regulated by the Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1931, which was brought in to ratify an agreement made between the two Governments, our own Government and the Government of Great Britain, in 1930.  That Act provided, among other things, for the holding of examinations by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; the registering of veterinary students who were successful on completion of their course; the establishment of an Irish <Col N="1884" /> Veterinary Council; the representation of the Irish veterinary profession on the general council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; arrangements in regard to such matters as fees bayable by veterinary practitioners; the procedure in regard to disciplinary action in regard to the members of the profession in Ireland, and the superintendence of examinations by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
      <P>Since 1900, the only place where students could be trained for the diploma in veterinary medicine is at the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge, which is under the control and management of the Department of Agriculture. It has been affiliated to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in London.  By reason of that affiliation, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in London holds the examinations for which students are trained at the Dublin Veterinary College.  These examinations lead to the award of a diploma called the M.R.C.V.S., which is the professional qualification necessary in this country at the moment for the practice of veterinary surgery.</P>
      <P>One result of the 1931 Act was that the person receiving that diploma in Dublin was eligible for entry on the general register kept in England.  Those who were on the general register in England were eligible for entrance to the Irish register.  In that way, a student, qualifying at the Veterinary College in Dublin, was eligible to practise in Great Britain or in any country of the British Commonweatlh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, there has been a further development in Great Britain, where an Act was passed and became law in July, 1948.  Certain changes were made which have an important bearing on the training qualifications of veterinary surgeons.  Up to that time in Great Britain, just as here, the only portal of entry to the veterinary profession was through the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons but, as a result of the Act passed in 1948, certain universities in Great Britain have now the power of granting degrees in veterinary surgery and, without registration by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, these <Col N="1885" /> degrees are sufficient to enable those candidates to have their names entered on the veterinary register.  This, of course, naturally necessitates a change here because if the change were not made here we would remain as the only part of these islands, let us say, where the portal of entry is still from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in the 1948 Act in Great Britain a provision was inserted which gave the Government of Great Britain power to negotiate with the Government of Ireland in regard to such matters as recognition for the purpose of registration with the general council in Great Britain of veterinary surgeons here in Ireland if we should change our system of registration from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to the universities. From 1946, in anticipation of this legislation, negotiations had been going on between the two Governments, and the two Governments appeared to agree that it would be a good thing to have these degrees conferred by the universities in both countries and to have these degrees recognised as sufficient to have the candidates' names placed on the register.</P>
    <P>Since 1946 I should mention that an arrangement had been entered into under which the universities here, the National University and Trinity College, were awarding veterinary degrees.  In the case of the National University, where students are trained in University College, Dublin, they awarded the degree of M.V.B., Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine, and in Trinity College, B.Sc.(Vet.).  In the case of the National University, professors of the Veterinary College were employed to give the necessary instruction preparatory to the awarding of this degree.  These arrangements were made voluntarily by the universities and they had no force under Statute.  It was necessary, even where a student got a degree in the National University or in Trinity College, that he should get a diploma from the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons before he could have his name entered on the register.  This Bill is to alter that to the extent that a degree conferred <Col N="1886" /> by a recognised university would be accepted as a registrable professional qualification.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, recognised both by the British Government and the Irish Government that a new agreement would be necessary as a result of the Act in England and as a result of the new development here as to students being trained in the universities.  That agreement will provide for reciprocity in regard to registration in the Irish register and in the general register in Great Britain of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the continuance for some time of the conferring of the diploma by the Veterinary College in Ballsbridge, and a new basis of representation on the reconstituted Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons so as to include university representatives as well as representatives of the veterinary profession in this country.  It will also deal with such matters as the superintendence of examinations, disciplinary investigations and the payment of fees by persons registered in both registers. There was a temporary agreement made between the two Governments pending this legislation and that will be carried on until this Bill gets the force of law.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been held up.  Deputies may wonder why the same thing was not done here as in Great Britain.  The Bill was ready for introduction in July, 1950, but the then Minister for Agriculture found it impracticable at the time to proceed with the further stages of the Bill and the Bill therefore lapsed with the ending of that particular Parliament and it is now coming up for your consideration.  It is necessary to give recognition to the university degree and, speaking on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, I feel that this matter should not be delayed any longer and I ask the Dáil to accept the Bill on principle on Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are substantially as outlined by the Minister. This Bill is the result of an agreement between our Government and the veterinary profession here and in Great Britain to bring our system of veterinary education into line with the alterations in the system of veterinary <Col N="1887" /> education which have taken place in Great Britain so that reciprocity between the two professions can be maintained in future as in the past.  I cannot complain that the Minister for Health, in the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Agriculture, did not avail of this occasion to mention that this Bill is regarded as an interim measure pending the establishment of a more satisfactory permanent arrangement whereby the universities will grant veterinary degrees in this country and veterinary education will be reorganised with a view to putting an end to the chronic shortage of accommodation for veterinary students which at present obtains.</P>
      <P>The reputation of our veterinary college is world-wide.  It caters for students, not only from this part of the country, but from Northern Ireland as well, and, of course, should be in a position to receive foreign students who would wish to avail of the courses provided in it.  Unfortunately, the accommodation is never adequate to accommodate our own students not to speak of admitting foreign students who would wish to study here.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Agriculture will take an opportunity in the Seanad when dealing with this Bill of dwelling on this aspect of the situation in greater detail but, <i>ad interim</i>, I strongly advise the House to pass it through all its stages so that there may be the necessary reciprocity between the Government here and the Government in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil approves of the statement of the Ceann Comhairle reporting to Dáil Éireann the result of his investigation into the complaint of privilege made that an assault had been committed on a Deputy by the Minister for Education, Mr. Seán Moylan, in the precincts of the House on the evening <Col N="1888" /> of the 23rd July, 1952, and in view of the finding by the Ceann Comhairle that this assault constituted an action in contempt of Parliament, the Dáil directs that the Minister be suspended from the service of the House for such period as the Ceann Comhairle in his discretion considers proper.</P>
    <P>We deem it a matter of urgent public interest that a motion of this kind dealing with the incident on which you reported your judgment to the House to-day, Sir, should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment by this Assembly.  Shortly after you had announced the result of your investigation into the allegation that I made yesterday of an abuse of privilege in the assault that had been committed by the Minister for Education on Deputy Collins, the Taoiseach explained his attitude to the matter.  I immediately expressed dissatisfaction with that attitude.  He repeated a few moments ago his views on the subject of the proper method of dealing with the regrettable incidents which have been of such frequent occurrence in the last six months.</P>
    <P>I move this motion in no sense of vindictiveness against the Minister for Education.  That that is so I think can be seen from the terms of this motion.</P>
    <P>The terms were carefully framed for the purpose of implementing the decision that had been come to and the judgment given by the Ceann Comhairle on what eventually came to be admitted as the facts of yesterday's occurrence.  We feel that this incident is an incident on which, judgment having been given by the Ceann Comhairle, this Dáil should take action immediately.  This is an incident on its own, with its own consequences and its own implications.  It may be, as the Taoiseach has said twice to-day, that these incidents give rise to the necessity for a general consideration of the whole problem of the privilege of Deputies, the manner in which these privileges shall be safeguarded and the steps which must be taken to secure the maintenance of freedom of debate, free speech and the rights of Deputies to <Col N="1889" /> carry on their business inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>Article 15, paragraph 10 of the Constitution empowers this House to take its own steps to ensure the freedom of speech that is so essential for Deputies and the public interest, if they are to carry out their functions.  The paragraph of that Article of the Constitution provides &mdash; I am quoting only the relevant parts&mdash;that each House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;shall have power to ensure freedom of debate... and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons, interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Article of the Constitution confers upon this House, without any further legislation or any further steps taken in the way of Standing Orders or rules, ample power to deal with persons who molest Deputies or who attempt to interfere with the institutions of Parliament in its proper functioning as a democratic institution. There is no necessity to wait further to discuss the general matters that arise out of these unfortunate incidents which have occurred in the last six months.  We have a particular incident here to deal with.  Action in my submission to you, Sir, and through you, Sir, to the Deputies of all Parties, must be taken in reference to that matter.  Action is all the more desirable and essential in view of the terms in which you reported your judgment on the incident to the House to-day.</P>
    <P>Let me recall to Deputies the relevant portions of that judgment so that they may see the importance of this motion and appreciate the fact that each Deputy of this House, to whatsoever Party he belongs or if he belongs to no Party, must vote for the motion if he has any sincerity in connection with the maintenance of order and the dignity of this Assembly.  You, Sir, have investigated the charge I made yesterday in this House and I want to say in reference to Deputy Cowan's interpolation a few short moments ago that, so far as we are concerned, we shall stand for nothing in the nature of cloaking of any effort that may be <Col N="1890" /> made by any private Deputy, no matter to what Party he belongs or whether he belongs to no Party at all, to ventilate a grievance where he alleges that his privileges as member of this House have been violated by anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has questioned the propriety of bringing this allegation before the Dáil by way of an <i>ex parte</i> statement as the Deputy, in his legal jargon, terms it.  Those of us who are accustomed to making <i>ex parte</i> statements in court know that a fundamental principle behind the making of such statements is that the utmost good faith must be exercised by the person making the statement and punishment follows very swiftly if he is found to have made an error, deliberately or otherwise, in the making of that <i>ex parte</i> statement.  Every statement I made was carefully weighed, carefully framed and was in no way tendentious.  My statements conveyed a sufficient indication of the facts to enable a <i>prima facie</i> case to be established that a breach of the privileges of the House had occurred. One of the most precious rights of a private Deputy in this House is to be able to stand up in this Assembly and to make known in public any abuses to which he may have been subjected, to be assured through the force of public opinion, that he will get a proper hearing and a proper appreciation by this House of the matters of which he complains.  It should not be the practice, as Deputy Cowan suggests, that he should be forced to make his complaint behind closed doors where perhaps his allegations could be stifled by virtue of the power exercised by a tyrannical majority in the House.</P>
    <P>I want to recall the relevant portion of your judgment, Sir, in view of the red herring which Deputy Cowan now seeks to introduce to this motion.  The allegation which I made was brought before the House yesterday.  It was investigated by the person whose authority it is to investigate, on behalf of this House, any complaint made by a Deputy whoever that Deputy may be, or whether he belongs to any Party or no Party.  The charge, as I say, was investigated by the Ceann Comhairle, <Col N="1891" /> the sole person whose duty it is to carry out that investigation, and whose responsibility it is to see that private Deputies' rights are safeguarded and that the rights and institutions of this Assembly as a parliamentary democracy are maintained and preserved. That matter was investigated yesterday and it is no longer in the region of allegation.  It has been investigated and judgment has been delivered upon it by the person competent to investigate it and competent to deliver judgment upon it.  This is a case where judgment was given on undisputed facts, removed from all contentious or controversial matters. Judgment has been given upon facts which have been admitted and corroborated.</P>
    <P>In that state of facts, the Ceann Comhairle delivered his judgment this afternoon and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no practical difference between the parties concerned as to the actual events.  I am satisfied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the Ceann Comhairle said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that the facts are substantially as stated by Deputy Costello, the Minister for Education being admittedly the aggressor and having assaulted Deputy Collins.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I find that this assault constituted an action in contempt of Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to consider the matters which the Minister had put in extenuation of his action, having admitted the charge.  The Minister says that it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....was in retaliation of a charge against the personal honour of a fellow-member of his Party made by Deputy Collins the night before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle says, and I think every decent Deputy in the House will agree with him, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....this cannot be considered in any sense as justifying or mitigating the offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, this afternoon, when Deputy Killilea had made his statement in reference to the matters which <Col N="1892" /> gave rise to the unfortunate occurrence of the night before, stood up and apologised for the statement he had made and withdrew it unreservedly.  I may say this, that it seems to me that Deputy Killilea accepted that apology and that withdrawal in as generous a fashion as it was made by Deputy Collins.  So far as that is concerned that matter is at an end.</P>
    <P>There remains this now, and, notwithstanding the extenuation, or attempted extenuation, by the Minister, the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that it &ldquo;cannot be considered in any sense as justifying or mitigating the offence&rdquo;.  The charge and the judgment remain, that a Minister of the present Government has been guilty of an act in contempt of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Towards the close of his statement to-day, the Ceann Comhairle stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The incident, however, constituting an act in contempt of Parliament, falls to be dealt with by Dáil Éireann in such manner as the members may in their wisdom decide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that &ldquo;such action must be taken in accordance with the rules governing procedure&rdquo; in this House.</P>
    <P>This motion is taken, we believe, in strict accordance with that ruling of the Chair and in complete compliance with the rules of this House, and I believe in entire accord with the letter and spirit of Article 15, paragraph 10 of the Constitution.  We cannot leave that incident alone.  We do not wish to be in any way vindictive in this matter against the Minister for Education, but we feel that where the simple, plain fact is that, on an admitted statement of facts, the Ceann Comhairle has adjudged a Minister of this Government guilty of contempt of Parliament, it cannot be shelved or postponed in the manner the Taoiseach wishes it to be.</P>
    <P>I do issue this warning, that if the Taoiseach, the members of his Party, Deputy Cowan and the rest of them who are supporting him, defeat this motion through their majority, then they will be judged by public opinion <Col N="1893" /> as merely endeavouring to evade their responsibilities by starting an inquiry which will take, possibly, months and maybe years, an inquiry which will give rise to very considerable discussion and controversy and which may never result or eventuate in such a large measure of agreement, or in such unanimity, as ought to exist in a democratic institution of this kind so as to ensure freedom of debate and the freedom of individual Deputies from assault by any member of the House or by any person outside the House.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the intention of the Taoiseach is to endeavour to postpone this matter which is an entirely different issue from the general question of whether or not we should lay down rules dealing with the manner in which the privileges of Parliament shall be maintained and the rights of private Deputies safeguarded.  This is an incident in respect of which the Chairman of this Assembly has adjudicated on admitted facts, that a Minister of the Government has been guilty of contempt of this Parliament.  This Parliament must here and now adjudicate upon that determination and that judgment without waiting to see whether or not certain steps are to be taken to set up a new procedure or new methods of dealing with matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>These incidents have occurred all too frequently.  It is significant that in the case of every incident that has occurred since last February the assault has been by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party on a member of the Fine Gael Party. I made no <i>ex parte</i> statements to-night. I assert that the assault committed on Deputy Dillon to-night had no justification or extenuation by reason of any aggravating circumstances such, perhaps, as may have operated with the Minister for Education, and in respect of which the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that they did not mitigate the offence.  Deputy Dillon in no way gave provocation to Senator Quirke.</P>
    <P>I want to know what provocation was given to Deputy Flynn when he made an unprovoked attempted assault in the Dáil Library a few months ago on Deputy Palmer.  Deputy Cowan <Col N="1894" /> would have this matter shelved, if you please, because of so-called allegations and slanderous statements made under the privilege of the House.  We have here a separate problem, an individual item, and we suggest dealing with that item while in no way prejudging what may take place hereafter.  We do not even suggest what the penalty may be for the Minister for Education in this matter.  We say that he should get such penalty as is accorded to a Deputy in this House who contravenes the rules of order, when, for example, a Deputy, having been called upon by the Chair to withdraw a statement he has made &mdash; even a minor statement of no great import which was alleged, say, by a Minister not to be accurate&mdash; and he refuses to do so.  Then, in accordance with procedure, that Deputy is named and is suspended by the Ceann Comhairle from the service of the House.</P>
    <P>To mark our disfavour of the action of the Minister for Education in being, as he has been on the admitted facts, adjudged guilty of contempt, some action must be taken by this Dáil unless we are to render ourselves entirely futile.  The least we suggest here is that precedent be followed &mdash; that the Minister be suspended from the service of the House.  We do not suggest in this motion any particular period, whether it be for an hour, a day, a week or anything else, but we empower, by this motion, the Ceann Comhairle, who is impartial in this matter, to deal with the period of suspension in such a way as he, in his absolute discretion, may think fit.</P>
    <P>We give him no directions, but we do this: we mark the sense of our displeasure of the gravity of the fact that a Minister of the Government, on his own admission, was guilty of an assault on a Deputy in this House. The question of mitigating circumstances, or otherwise, in reference to this matter, and the penalties to be imposed, we leave entirely in the hands of the Ceann Comhairle.  What we do if we pass this motion is to assert our right to deal with order and decorum in this House and the dignity of its procedure and not to evade the issue, <Col N="1895" /> as the Taoiseach wants to do, not to put it on the long finger by this lengthy motion which he has put down for the next session of this Dáil, not to sidetrack this matter by putting down a highly controversial motion dealing with matters entirely outside the scope of this particular incident but dealing with the particular isolated incident now and asserting our right as members of a sovereign Parliament and democratic institution to see that every Deputy of this House, no matter what Party he may belong to or if he belongs to no Party, has the right of free speech and that he will not be intimidated by any assault from expressing properly his views in this House, from criticising the Fianna Fáil Government or any Government that may succeed that Government.  The whole basis of democracy is that every Deputy should have the right freely to criticise the Government.  If there is anything in the nature of curbing his power to do that then there is the beginning of the end of democracy and the right to free speech.  Deputy Cowan does not, apparently, understand why members of this House are allowed an absolute privilege in regard to speech in this House subject to the control of the Parliament itself to prevent them.</P>
    <P>It is in order that people may be free to discharge their duty and that they will not be subjected to actions for slander and libel by people outside. But slanderous or libellous statements by Deputies about another Deputy are a matter that can be dealt with by the Parliament itself in the Parliament itself by the exercise of its own powers under the Constitution to secure freedom of debate, decorum and dignity in its proceedings.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong democratic principle underlying the right of any Deputy to speak under absolute privilege in respect of slander.  That is a right that was gained through the democratic growth of Parliament in the country from which we have adopted our institutions, namely, Great Britain.  It was a long period and a hard period and a long struggle to secure the right of members of a <Col N="1896" /> democratic Parliament freely to express their opinions.  We put down that motion to assert that right and not in any spirit of vindictiveness towards the person of the Minister for Education.  We repudiate the suggestion of the Taoiseach that the issue should be evaded and postponed <i>ad infinitum</i> and the whole matter gone into again.  This matter has been adjudicated upon by the Ceann Comhairle.  On admitted facts &mdash; again I repeat not on controverted facts &mdash; a Minister of the Government has been guilty of contempt of this Parliament. We would stultify ourselves as members of a democratic institution if we were to do what the Taoiseach wants us to do &mdash; to put it on the long finger, to postpone it, to talk about it, to do anything you like except to take action such as is urgently required this evening in the public interest in order to assert the rights of private Deputies to freedom of speech and debate in a democratic Irish Parliament.</P>

      <P>In moving my amendment to Deputy Costello's motion I wish to say that, by arrangement with the Assistant Clerk, a small alteration has been made in my amendment to comply with the decision of the Ceann Comhairle to-day.  It was impossible to circulate that amendment to my amendment in the short time at our disposal.  I shall read it now in the new form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after `That' in line I and substitute `in view of the inflammatory language affecting the personal honour of Deputy Killilea used in this House on 22nd July, 1952, by Deputy Seán Collins, and in view of the fact that no proper machinery exists for dealing with such slanderous statements made under the privileges of this House, Dáil Éireann hereby decides to take no action in regard to the assault by the Minister for Education on Deputy Seán Collins in the precincts of the House on the 23rd July, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing that amendment to Deputy Costello's motion I have no intention of following on the lines of Deputy Costello.  I have no intention <Col N="1897" /> of endeavouring by any language I may use to browbeat any Deputy of this House.  I am quite sure that every Deputy here is concerned with the very grave seriousness of the matter which we are discussing.  I am perfectly certain that every Deputy here will assert and defend at all times the rights guaranteed to Deputies by the Constitution of this country &mdash; the rights that have been mentioned by Deputy Costello, the rights of free speech, the right of freedom of debate and the rights and privileges of Deputies to do their duty in spite of dictation or, in fact, in spite of force.  It is, perhaps, as well that the House has an opportunity of giving some consideration to these matters now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has asserted, and I agree with him and everyone in this House will agree with him, that any Deputy who expresses properly his views in this House must be protected. Any Deputy who wants to criticise the Government or any Minister of the Government must have the right to do that and must be protected in doing it.  If there were any interference with the rights of a Deputy to debate a motion the House should be quick to protect that Deputy against that interference. But these are not the matters we are concerned with this evening.  There is no assertion by Deputy Costello that Deputy Collins was assaulted because he expressed properly his views.  There is no assertion by Deputy Costello that Deputy Collins was assaulted because he criticised the Government.  Deputy Collins was assaulted because he made a vicious, inflammatory, scandalous, and slanderous statement in regard to a Deputy of this House.  Deputy Costello or any other Deputy will not assert that it is an interference with the rights of Deputies in the proper order of debate that slander of that kind should be stopped some way or another. Unfortunately, since I came into this House the most vile slanders have been used in this House on many occasions under the privilege of this House in regard to individual Deputies.  Is it any protection for the Deputy who is slandered, whose personal honour has been attacked, that the Deputy by <Col N="1898" /> whom he is attacked is ordered to withdraw the expression by the Chair or that he is ordered to leave the House?  The fact that the slander is used in this House under the privileges of this House means that that slander can be published in the newspapers&mdash; not only in the newspapers of this country but in every newspaper that circulates in this country.  Vile slanders against a person's personal honour may in that way be circulated in his constituency and in the country because the privileges of this House have been used for that slander.  Deputies have become perhaps somewhat impatient in regard to some of these matters.  There have been regrettable incidents &mdash; incidents that have from time to time been described by the Chair and described by Deputies as regrettable.  One of the greatest honours that any Irishman can have is the honour of serving his country in arms against a foreign enemy.  When a person has been wounded in that service and the privileges of this House are used to say that the wound received by that Deputy in that noble service was a wound self-inflicted for the purpose of obtaining a pension, it is the greatest slander that could be used against that Deputy.</P>
    <P>Any Deputy worth his salt would deal with that matter on the spot and any Deputy who was interested in that particular Deputy might take steps to deal with the person outside the precincts of this House.  What did we have yesterday?  We had Deputy Killilea, although he was grossly slandered in the fashion described, coming into this House and apologising for his breach of the rules of order.  One would have expected that the other Deputy concerned, the Deputy who had used this gross slander which has been circulated all over the country on the radio and in the newspapers that are circulating, would have availed of the first opportunity of making an apology to this House.  If he had done that yesterday the incident we are discussing to-night would not be before us.</P>
    <P>In case anybody might make any type of allegation in regard to my amendment, might I say that when I saw this motion I immediately, sitting in this House, wrote out the amendment <Col N="1899" /> which I propose now?  It was done without consultation with anybody.  It was done in a matter of minutes.  It has been subjected to some criticism which suggests that it is a method of avoiding a decision in regard to this matter.  It is no such thing.  It is an endeavour, at least as far as I am concerned, to establish, as I am sure the people outside will understand, that the real wrongdoer is the slanderer under the privileges of this House and not the manly person who may lift his fists outside.</P>
    <P>I simply ask nothing more in this amendment than for this Dáil to say that, in view of the gross slander used by Deputy Collins under privileges of this House and in view of the fact, as the Taoiseach has said and as, I think, is generally admitted, we have not proper machinery to deal with incidents of this kind, in view of the overall facts, we take no further action in regard to it.  Not so long ago a Deputy who had used very slanderous language in regard to another Deputy was assaulted.  The House has heard no slanders from that Deputy since.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this House, in its own way, will put an end to slander, at the same time retaining the rights of Deputies, the right of free speech, the right of freedom of debate and those rights that are guaranteed to Deputies under the Constitution. Deputy Costello, as he said, in consultation with his chief advisers, has put down this motion in regard to the matter.  As he says, it is a carefully worded and a carefully thought-out motion.  What does it suggest?  It suggests that the powers of this House would be handed over to the Ceann Comhairle.  This House has the right to deal with incidents that occur in the House or in the precincts of the House. It has the right of the protection of <Col N="1900" /> Deputies and this House has the right, if it so wishes, to punish any person who is a member of this House or who is not a member of this House who interferes with a member or obstructs him in carrying out his duties.  I will never agree to the suggestion that we should hand over an unlimited power of punishment to a person whom we elected as Ceann Comhairle to preside over the deliberations and the debates in this House.</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Costello, after all his careful consultation with his principal leaders, has to offer this House, that it should hand over its power to the Ceann Comhairle to impose on a member of this House, on a Minister of the Government, suspension from the service of the House for such a period as the Ceann Comhairle in his discretion considers proper.  That is a most audacious motion to put before a democratic Parliament, that unlimited powers of suspension would be given by this House to the Ceann Comhairle.  No Deputy could stand for such a motion as that.  No Deputy in his senses could agree to such a surrender of powers to an official of this House.  If Deputy Costello wanted to suspend the Minister for a period of a week or a month he might have put that in his motion but instead of that he wants to surrender to the Ceann Comhairle, whose duties are very rigidly defined, powers to which he is not entitled and which, please God, as long as I am a member of this House, he will never have.  Then there is talk about democracy.  It would be dictatorship, if we were to say to the Ceann Comhairle: &ldquo;We appoint you a judge, not limited as any judge is outside by penalties prescribed by law but to do with the individual concerned `whatever thou wilt'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No matter how Deputy Costello may shout or may scream in this House the people outside will not be misled, the people outside will always ask the question: &ldquo;Who is responsible?  Who started this?&rdquo; Who started this in this instance but the foul slanderer, Deputy Collins?  It would be a wrong thing if by any decision of this House we were to uphold slander of that type. I have great pleasure, therefore, in moving my amendment.</P>

      <P>My reason for seconding this motion is that the case upon which this amendment rests can hardly be questioned.  The case upon which it rests is that provocation of a violent nature was given in the foul slander that was made against Deputy Killilea. The case rests also on the fact that there is not at the present time, as the Taoiseach and other members have pointed out, adequate machinery to deal with slanderous statements in this House.  I can prove that there is not such machinery from my own experience as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that Deputy Dillon flies from the House when I raise this matter because two years ago a Deputy of this House was foully slandered in regard to his personal character in connection with a matter which had nothing to do with his political life.  He was foully slandered in relation to his dealings in the purchase and sale of lime.  That slander was flung across the floor of this House by a Minister. It was very properly refuted and the Minister who made that slanderous statement was called upon to withdraw. He refused to withdraw his statement and the matter was brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling.  I think every Deputy knows how justifiable is the case I have made and how strongly it supports the need for this amendment.  It is clear beyond all question.  The incident to which I have referred emphasises, if emphasis is needed, the necessity for adequate machinery to cope with the unscrupulous and foul slanderer who carefully formulates his malicious falsehoods, hurls them across the House and refuses to withdraw them.  There is no adequate penalty provided under the rules of this House for dealing with such an offender and it is possible for such an offender to flout the rules of the House and get away with it if he has sufficient audacity, as was proved on the occasion of the incident to which I have referred.  I do not want to copy the violent language used by the Leader of the Opposition.  I do not think it set a very good headline for this debate.  He worked himself into a sort of fury at a time when we would all like to deal with a matter of this kind in a purely objective way. The case he made was that he would uphold, and this House must uphold, the right of members to slander others.</P>

He claimed proudly that we had inherited that right from the great nation that conferred so many benefits upon us, the <Col N="1903" /> great British nation.  I think we can establish our own standards of decency and morals here.  We do not have to go to the British Parliament or to any other Parliament for our standards. Our standards will be based on Christian charity and Christian charity demands that a man's character shall not be taken away, that a man's reputation shall not be befouled under the privileges of this House.  I, therefore, support this amendment.  I feel this House would stultify itself if it adopted the course that has been so arrogantly dictated to it by Deputy Costello.</P>

      <P>May I, as the person most concerned, say a few words?  I accept Deputy Costello's statement that there is no personal vindictiveness in the motion. There shall be none in my words.  I will speak at less length and I hope with less heat.  Neither now nor at any time have I ever had any wish or desire to cloak anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the facts relating to to-night's trouble.  Deputy Killilea yesterday made an apology for whatever action he took on the previous evening.  In my view that apology should have been accepted without comment and when the Leader of the <Col N="1904" /> Opposition was permitted to comment on Deputy Killilea's apology and on the whole matter behind it, then, at least, one of Deputy Killilea's friends and colleagues should have been entitled to put the other point of view. I was not permitted to speak yesterday. We had a homily from Deputy Mulcahy.  I wanted to say that I agree entirely with Deputy Mulcahy when he said that the matter was a very serious one.</P>
    <P>I think it was a very serious matter, the causes of which are a long way behind the actual action and the apology of Deputy Killilea.  If, instead of being met by comment from Deputy Mulcahy, which did not help us in any way, it had been met by an apology from Deputy S. Collins for what he had said, we would have made a good deal more progress in this House towards the decorum of which Deputy Costello speaks.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in apologising to the House for my part in the incident of yesterday evening.  I now do so.  I believe the vast majority of the members desire, as I do, that this Assembly should be an orderly and a dignified one.  I put it to the members of every Party in the House that not one of them can say that I at any time was offensive in this House to any single man of any Party.  I put it to the members of this House that in their associations with me I have always shown them courtesy no matter to what Party they belonged.  I have always tried to be helpful to them irrespective of Party.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I left behind me the desire and the capacity for violence.  I have never indulged in violence without due and urgent cause.  My action last evening was prompted by the deep resentment I felt at a reflection cast upon the character of a comrade who had been associated with me and was wounded in the struggle for our nation's independence.  Men of a new generation probably cannot realise the close ties that bind together the men of my generation who have been associated in an adventure of high honour.  I will never stand for an aspersion on the character of a comrade with whom I have been associated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> I regret that my action was hasty. Nevertheless, I feel that, away from this House and not affected by the responsibilities which I have to this House, if the words were used elsewhere, I would take the same action again.</P>
    <P>Unfortunate as my action was, I hope it will bring home to the House the gravity of the continuing indulgence in an attitude which will, I believe, result in grave national danger.  I refer to the constant use of vituperation and slander in this House, the abuse of a special privilege which Deputies have which should be jealously guarded by them, an abuse that can have no outcome but that of an evil moral effect throughout the whole country.  If the Dáil, if members of the Dáil, do not conduct themselves and speak in the fashion in which they ought to speak, what can we expect from other and lesser bodies and what example are we giving to the general public in the matter?</P>
    <P>Any further development of the abuse I mention can be curbed by the Ceann Comhairle, with the co-operation of the members of the Dáil, and the majority of us here are wholly conscious of our deep responsibility to the people, conscious of the fact that national problems cannot be effectively dealt with except in an atmosphere of calm and reason.  If that is absent from this House, the House will be brought into disrepute.  I am certain that all members of the House desire an avoidance of such an undesirable situation.  I regret what happened.  It has been my care since 1923, I who suffered much at the hands of my opponents, to try to bury deep any of the animosities of that period.  I have been most careful in this House to avoid any abuse of or antagonism towards my opponents.  The apology <Col N="1906" /> by Deputy Collins to-day was a full, a free and a manly one.  Perhaps it was the shock occasioned by the fact that it was a Deputy who bears the name of another comrade of old days who made the allegation against a man who was wounded in 1921, as much as any other fact that gave rise to the action I took.  I deeply regret it and I apologise to the House.</P>
