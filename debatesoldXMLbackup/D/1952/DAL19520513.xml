    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the recent report of the Cork <Col N="1398" /> County Manager to the county council that the prices of coal delivered to the different institutions had fallen from £10 and £9 per ton to from £5 17s. 6d. to £6 10s. per ton delivered, he has satisfied himself that the present price in Cork City of £8 5s. per ton is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Aiken) Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present retail price of £8 5s. 0d. per ton for coal in Cork was fixed on the recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body after full investigation of import and distribution costs.  I am informed that the coal referred to by the Cork County Manager is a grade unsuitable for household use and that delivery would be effected in bulk from ship's side with a resulting substantial saving in handling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that best quality English coal is being delivered 30 and 50 miles from Cork City at £6 2s. 0d. per ton; that second quality coal is being offered at £5 15s. 0d. a ton, and that, in the case of North Cork, samples are being offered before tenders are accepted? In view of that, will the Minister further investigate the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given very much more information in his supplementary question than he did in his original question.  I will have the figures which he has given examined. I want, however, to repeat what is in the answer to his question, that the present retail price of £8 5s. 0d. per ton for coal in Cork was fixed after examination by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the case I mentioned of the £6 2s. 0d. per ton, tenders were also offered to the same institution at £8 5s. 0d. per ton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has already been investigated by the Prices Advisory Body and the price fixed.  I will, however, have the further information <Col N="1399" /> which has been given by Deputy McGrath examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that all efforts to dispose of the surplus hand-won turf of the 1951 crop in County Kerry have failed and that there is now no prospect whatever of its being sold commercially, he will reconsider his attitude in the matter and have investigated the possibility of this turf being used by State or semi-State organisations, or, alternatively, indicate what additional measures he now proposes to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made into the situation regarding the 1951 crop of hand-won turf.  The facts are that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  according to the best estimates possible, about 46,000 tons of turf were produced for sale in County Kerry, and, with the exception of 4,000 tons, all this turf had been sold at the end of April;</P>
      <P>(b)  no problems have arisen regarding the disposal of turf produced for sale in North or East Kerry;</P>
      <P>(c)  of the 4,000 tons still unsold about 2,500 tons are located in the Cahirciveen peninsula and, of the latter quantity, it is understood that about one-third is either unfit for immediate sale or inaccessible; and</P>
      <P>(d)  sales are still taking place and will so continue until about the end of June, the normal close of the sales season.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the necessity has not yet arisen for taking any additional steps to implement the guarantee given to producers by the Government in regard to the disposal of last year's hand-won turf.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1400" /> Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the quantity of turf supplied by Bord na Móna from their bog at Clonsast to the Electricity Supply Board power station at Portarlington in the year ended 31st March, 1952; (b) the average price per ton received by Bord na Móna for turf supplied from the Clonsast bog to the Portarlington power station in the year ending 31st March, 1952; (c) the estimated quantity of turf remaining on Clonsast bog awaiting delivery to the power station on 31st March, 1952; (d) the quantity of turf in the Electricity Supply Board stockpile on 31st March, 1952; (e) the number of units per annum which it was originally anticipated would be produced by the Portarlington power station, and (f) the actual number of units produced in the year ended 31st March, 1952.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the quantity of turf supplied by Bord na Móna from the Clonsast bog to the generating station at Portarlington in the year ended 31st March, 1952, was 119,752 tons, that the average price paid to Bord na Móna for this turf was 42/7 per ton and that the quantity of turf in the Electricity Supply Board's stockpile on the 31st March, 1952, was 25,664 tons.  Bord na Móna inform me that the estimated quantity of turf remaining on Clonsast bog for delivery to the Portarlington station at the 31st March, 1952, was 76,000 tons.  I am further informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the number of units per annum which it was originally anticipated would be produced at the Portarlington station was 90,000,000 and that the actual number of units produced in the year ended 31st March, 1952, was 129,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maher</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of (d) of the question, why is not some of this turf sold to local people who may require it, seeing that the Electricity Supply Board do not seem to need it or, alternatively, could steps be taken to sell some of it in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only something over 100,000 tons in hands and, if the Electricity Supply Board had to substitute that turf by buying American coal, it would cost the consumers of electricity or somebody else a lot more money&mdash;some hundreds of thousands of pounds.  It would take 50,000 or 60,000 tons of coal to substitute for that turf. On the whole, I think the Electricity Supply Board are wise in stocking up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that (a) the Cork County Manager deducted 10/-national health disablement benefit from the tuberculosis allowance payable to a person in Cobh; (b) up to recently he deducted the full 15/- from this man, and (c) that the man, his wife and three children were existing on 39/- weekly for a long period and that for a short time they enjoyed 44/-weekly; and, if so, if he has satisfied himself that the Cork County Manager is carrying out his intention concerning the assessment of means for small wage earners and, further, if he will allow this person, who rendered service to the Republic of Ireland during the emergency, the 10/- at present deducted and if he will state whether at any time this man appealed to him to have the full amount of national health disablement benefit allowed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Regarding (c), I have ascertained from the health authority that the person referred to was in receipt of an allowance of £1 19s. per week under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948 and 1949, from the 1st May, 1951, which represented an abatement of the maximum allowance by 15/- per week national health disablement benefit.  The abatement was later reduced to 10/- per week, i.e. the allowance was increased to £2 4s. per week, which was paid as from 2nd February, 1952, to 19th March, 1952, when it was further increased to £3 4s. per week, consequent on the transfer of the recipient from the sanatorium to his home for domiciliary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned appealed on the 26th February, 1951, to have the maximum allowance paid to him in addition to national health insurance benefit.  The health authority's report on the matter showed that, subsequent to the date of the appeal, he had <Col N="1403" /> entered a sanatorium, where he had free treatment, and was in receipt of the maximum allowance, less national health insurance benefit.  As the patient has now been discharged from the sanatorium and in view of the other circumstances of the case, I propose to ask the local authority to reconsider the amount of the allowance to be paid to him.</P>
    <P>The maintenance allowances scheme is administered by the health authority as part of its infectious diseases service, and it is primarily a matter for that authority to determine whether or not the allowance payable in any case is adequate.  I am satisfied that the regulations governing the allowances scheme are, in general, being properly administered in County Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it difficult to hear part of the reply.  The Minister is admitting that the person concerned was in receipt of 39/- per week for a time.  I ask him: does he think that is a fair allowance to give to a man who has a wife and three children living at home whilst he is in a sanatorium&mdash;a man who rendered service during the emergency as a petty officer in our Navy?  Would the Minister get in touch with the county manager for Cork, who seems to be very solicitous about charges on the central fund, as well as local funds, and see that justice, not charity&mdash;we do not ask for that&mdash;will be given to the person concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, must not ignore that, while he was in receipt of 39/- per week, he was also in receipt of national health insurance benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that the next-of-kin of deceased persons who accumulated post-war credits while in employment in Britain are not permitted to translate such credits into cash unless they have reached the age of 60 years in the case of a woman and 65 years in the case of a man; and, further, that this is unfair to relatives of deceased persons who lodged their earnings in this fashion; and, if so, whether he will make representations to the British Government to permit Irish people who have not yet reached the required age to translate such post-war credits into cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Section 26 of the British Finance Act of 1946 provides that payment of British post-war credits shall only be authorised in the cases of men and women who have attained the ages of 65 and 60 years respectively.</P>
      <P>In the event of the death of a person entitled to post-war credits, his right to the credit passes to his personal representative who may deal with it as part of the deceased's estate.  The deceased's personal representative may then apply to have the certificate made out in the names of the beneficiaries and, in that case, the age limits mentioned apply to the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations under which these credits are repaid are applicable to British subjects resident in Great Britain as well as to Irish citizens who worked in Great Britain during and <Col N="1405" /> since the war and who may now be back in this country or whose next-of-kin, in the case of deceased Irish citizens, are resident here.  A request to the British Government to allow immediate repayment to Irish citizens would amount to asking them to treat our citizens more favourably than their own and representations of the nature contemplated in the Deputy's question, would have no prospect of success.</P>

In explanation of the cases where single holdings were rearranged, perhaps I should mention that holdings held in scattered portions are often converted into compact holdings by the provision of untenanted land adjacent to the main portions in exchange for the outlying portions.  It is not possible to state how many, if any, of the rearranged holdings have not been brought up to the economic standard of valuation as the poor law valuations have not yet been apportioned.  However, the Deputy can rest assured that all cases were brought up to or as near economic standard as possible, having regard to the amount of land available for the purpose;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will have the principles and practice of immunisation of bovine species or other animals susceptible to foot and mouth disease with biological products and in particular with polyvalent foot and mouth disease serum investigated and an inquiry made into the methods in practice in other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what is being done in this field and there is, therefore, no necessity for a special investigation <Col N="1414" /> into the methods in practice in other countries.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the slaughter policy is the only one to adopt in the circumstances of this country.  This is the policy followed by the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, South Africa and any other country which is free from the disease or which has succeeded in eradicating it, and it has the support of the leading international veterinary authorities.</P>
      <P>The adoption of a policy of immunisation would be tantamount to an admission of inability to prevent the disease becoming established throughout a country.  It would involve this country in crushing losses, in comparison with which the loss arising from slaughter is trifling.</P>
      <P>Immunity following inoculation is relatively short-lived and immunity against one type or strain has not proved effective against another.  Some vaccinated animals become carriers and these constitute a continuing source of infection.  The establishment of immunity by vaccination does not develop inside 15 days and meantime there is no protection whatsoever against infection. In the case of the recent outbreaks on the Continent of Europe modified strains of virus made their appearance and up to the present, even though the latest vaccines have been in use, the spread of the disease has continued.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a great deal of work done in regard to control of foot and mouth disease and of investigational activities related to this disease in various countries.  The technical officers of my Department are constantly studying developments elsewhere, both in regard to control measures and experimental work. Furthermore, I know that the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations is at present actively developing on an international basis the investigation and control of foot and mouth disease.  We are participating in this work and I have already assigned some of my technical officers to take active part in the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As worthwhile investigation and <Col N="1415" /> study of foot and mouth disease necessitates the use of living virus, I would not permit any work of the kind to be conducted in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the possible methods of mass disinfection at the ports of entry to prevent the introduction into this country of the foot and mouth disease; and, if so, if an investigation will be undertaken to detect special risk personnel on landing and in travel, and, further, whether he will have a special inquiry made into all the possible methods of prevention of the spread of the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has satisfied himself that the precautions taken at points of entry into the country to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease by travellers are being carried out so as to be effective; and, if not, if he will have the precautions necessary taken forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The question of what precautions should be taken has been continuously under review, particularly since last November, when outbreaks of foot and mouth disease occured in Great Britain on a serious scale.  Since that time special measures have been in operation for the disinfection of incoming sea and air passengers who may have been in contact with live stock or on farms in affected countries. A substantial number of passengers have been disinfected under these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, however, that, no matter what precautions are taken, they cannot be made effective unless stock owners and others behave with a proper sense of their obligations.  We had an example last week of un-co-operative and irresponsible conduct on the part of an exhibitor at the spring show which could have led to the gravest consequences.  This exhibitor cannot evade the fact that, in bringing in from outside the country to prepare his stock for the show a <Col N="1416" /> man who had come from a place only a few miles from a farm where an outbreak had been confirmed a short time previously, he displayed a serious degree of negligence and irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>To make any precautions fully effective, the co-operation of all concerned is a first essential.  I am satisfied that this co-operation is being given by the vast majority of persons concerned.  The precise official precautions in operation at any particular time are related to the degree of danger from abroad, which fluctuates from time to time.  My Department has constantly under examination the precautionary measures which are necessary and practicable.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, this is one of the very few countries where the disinfection of incoming passengers is attempted and, indeed, was the first country to adopt this precaution.  The question of mass disinfection of all passengers has already been examined, and I am advised that this would, in practice, be less effective than individual disinfection on a selective basis. I am concentrating on increasing the efficacy of selective disinfection to the maximum.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to appreciate that the introduction of the disease by persons is only one of the many ways in which the disease could be introduced. The elimination as far as possible of all sources of infection has been a constant preoccupation of my Department for years past and the precautionary measures have been intensified during the past six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  A Cheann Comhairle, Dáil Eireann in Committee by its vote on the General Financial Resolution having approved of the general structure of the Budget for the current year and having so reported to the House, it is now possible to proceed to give legislative effect to that decision.  Since there can be no doubt left in any responsible quarter that additional revenue must be secured if the current Budget is to be balanced, and since the Opposition Parties agree with the Government that a balance must be secured, it would appear that the only question <Col N="1419" /> which might profitably be discussed at this stage is whether the additional revenue can be raised more equitably, more certainly, more conveniently and more economically by other means than those provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In concluding the debate on the General Resolution I assured the Dáil that full consideration had been given to every practicable alternative to the measures proposed in the Bill, and I said that every one of them had been rejected for sound, practical reasons.</P>
      <P>I think that should go without saying; for naturally no Minister for Finance&mdash;at least none who knows his business&mdash;would seek to get money in the harder way if he could get it in an easier one.</P>
      <P>Now, there is no system of taxation which will leave in the taxpayer's pocket what the Government takes out of it to pay for the public services. There are, of course, certain financial anaesthetics&mdash;and they were liberally availed of by our predecessors&mdash;which will facilitate a dishonestly-minded Administration in taxing the citizen unawares or which will delude him with the belief that nothing is being taken from him while all the time his future, his future earnings, his toil and his labour are being mortgaged to sustain a factitious prosperity engendered by uninhibited spending.</P>
      <P>It is because such measures were resorted to cover the three years 1949-51 that we are taxing the people to-day to pay for Deputy Dillon's day-old chicks.</P>
      <P>But using such anaesthetics does not change the final result except to render the service more costly to the taxpayer, who pays not only the original cost of it, but in interest on the borrowed money pays for the anaesthetic as well. And the anaesthetic often costs as much and sometimes even more than the actual service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore if a Government is concerned with the interest of the taxpayer, and places this interest above considerations of Party, it will meet the cost of the public services as they arise; it will not put off until next year <Col N="1420" /> or many subsequent years the payments which should be made in this.</P>
    <P>That is why the suggestion that the Government this year should deliberately budget for a deficit which was made by the Irish Trade Union Congress in its statement of the 22nd April, is to be deplored.  It is truly regrettable that a body professing to speak for trade unionists should seek to condone a practice which, while it would enable us in this Government to follow the practice of our predecessors and evade our immediate responsibilities to the nation, would impose much heavier burdens on the workers and wage earners in the end.</P>
    <P>It would be well for the politicians who seek to use these trade union organisations for their own ends to realise that the workers are not so simple as to be taken in by such proposals.</P>
    <P>They know, and none know better, that borrowing money is a costly proceeding which should be avoided if possible; they know it is a bad thing for the State, just as it is for the individual to have resort to borrowing to meet current expenses and they know too that it is always the borrower who pays heavily in the end.</P>
    <P>However, there is this to be said for the authors of the statement: They, like Deputy Larkin and other members of the Labour Party, recognised that a substantial increase in tax-revenue must be secured if the public services are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Even Deputy McGilligan, the Fine Gael ex-Minister for Finance, has been driven at last to admit that a greatly increased tax revenue must be secured by increases in the rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>He knows, has known in fact since 1948, that the pace could not last, that borrowing to meet current expenditure could not continue and that eventually the financial problem would have to be faced up to, as we are facing up to it to-day.</P>
    <P>His own speeches when he was Minister, and the departmental records prove that he had run down departmental stocks, he had appropriated the surplus account of the <Col N="1421" /> Post Office Savings Bank, he had raided the Widows and Orphans' Pensions Fund, but he knew on May 2nd, 1951, that he and his colleagues of the late Coalition were at the end of their tether.</P>
    <P>That is why they requested the President to dissolve Dáil Eireann on May 7th, 1951, rather than face a debate on the Budget which they had introduced only five days previously on May 2nd.</P>
    <P>They ran away from the crisis then. If instead of that they had faced up to it and brought in an honestly balanced Budget&mdash;a Budget in which due provision was made for the expenditure which they knew would arise during the year&mdash;it would have cost the taxpayer less and our task this year would be much easier.</P>
    <P>If this Budget is more onerous in fresh impositions than otherwise it might have been, it is the Opposition and not the Government which must carry responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, be that as it may, the fact remains that when the Budget for the current year was being prepared, it must have been clear to all sections of the Dáil that, as the Irish Trades Union Congress has admitted: &ldquo;Certainly a most difficult problem existed in relation to the prospective gap between estimated expenditure and revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not, therefore, the need for increased taxation to close the gap which the Irish Trade Union Congress questions, but the form the taxation takes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in discussing that issue we should remind ourselves that the primary purpose for which taxation is imposed is to raise revenue.</P>
    <P>It is not imposed, as Deputy Corish seemed to suggest in his speech on the General Resolution, to prevent people from wearing mink coats or to put Chrysler cars off the road.</P>
    <P>We may not like mink coats or their wearers, nor Chrysler cars and their owners, but it would be unjust to tax them merely to gratify a social spleen.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that an alteration in an existing tax or the imposition of a new tax does induce social <Col N="1422" /> reactions, but these are not always what may have been anticipated.</P>

      <P>Take for instance Deputy McGilligan's dance tax. Dances were first taxed in the Budget of 1932, in which the entertainments duty was extended to cover all forms of entertainments including dances for which an admission fee was charged.</P>
      <P>When it was proposed to extend duty to dances, Deputy McGilligan's gorge rose like a fiery balloon and like red lava from his mouth there came a frothy torrent of invective against those who dared to tax the sacred rhythm of the dance.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's dislike of the tax on dancing was shared in all quarters of the House, so that when the present Minister for External Affairs in his then capacity as Minister for Finance repealed it in 1946, its repeal was generally welcomed except by two peculiar people; Deputies Dillon and Cafferky opposed it: the first because in the words of a once popular dance tune he was &ldquo;in the mood&rdquo;; and the second because he believed that any person who paid more than 2/- for admission should be described by an unmentionable name. The reference, Sir, is column 1694, Volume 101 of the Official Debates of the 12th June, 1946.</P>
      <P>However, the important point in this connection is that when one of them had the hardihood to challenge a division on the section repealing the tax the two Deputies could not get even three others to support them, and the repeal was carried with the virtually unanimous approval of the House; and I may say that, in the face of the facts, it could scarcely have been otherwise, for as the then Minister for Finance stated at column 2355, Volume 100 of the Official Debates of 8th May, 1946, in regard to this tax and on his reasons for repealing it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one duty which has been operative for some years which, as well as being difficult to collect and costly to administer, is a cause of irritation and a source of dishonest practices&mdash;the entertainments duty <Col N="1423" /> on ceilithe and dances.  Charitable and educational organisations are entitled to a rebate of the duty provided they keep their expenses within 30 per cent. of their takings, which, judging from the correspondence regarding the matter, they find difficult.  The incentive to evasion of this tax by organisations who want to raise funds, often for desirable local objects, causes bad feeling between the revenue officials, who are only carrying out their duty conscientiously, and the public generally, particularly the younger people.  I feel that the duty tends to promote dishonest practices and impedes local initiative, and I propose to abolish it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish is also reported on this matter at column 102, Volume 101, of the Official Debates of 15th May, 1946. He had his own somewhat peculiar approach to the problem and that approach he partly described as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another concession which should appeal to the younger folk in the country is the abolition of the dance tax in its entirety.  I am for and against&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Facing-both-ways&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the abolition of this tax and I think my argument is very reasonable. There are in this country, more so than in any other country in Europe a number of societies, religious, semi-religious, and charitable, who run dances frequently for no purpose except to raise funds for the benefit of the community and for such things as Catholic action, boy scouts, etc.  Dances are also frequently promoted by sports clubs and football clubs.  I am in thorough agreement with the abolition of the tax so far as these people are concerned because if the Minister and his officials knew what it cost to run a dance at the present day they would certainly realise that a whole lot of money cannot be made for these societies if a tax is levied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that, of course, every one of us will agree.  They were very sound reasons and it was a very good speech. <Col N="1424" /> So, with the general acquiescence of the Dáil, this tax. so difficult to collect, so inequitable in its incidence, so anti-social in many of its consequences, was repealed in 1946.</P>
    <P>Then in 1949 came Deputy McGilligan to reimpose it.  In that year, in which he claimed to have a substantial surplus, in which he not only reduced the standard rate of income-tax but the rate of corporation profits tax on foreign companies&mdash;he did not do anything so far as that particular tax was concerned for native undertakings&mdash; granted a reduction, which was not passed on to the consumers, in the customs duty on Commonwealth tobaccos; reduced the customs duty on foreign wines, on foreign newsreels, and on diesel oil for steamrollers, Deputy McGilligan reimposed the entertainments duty on dances.  We may very well ask ourselves why, and marvel, too, at Deputy McGilligan's explanation.  The reference is column 477, Volume 115, of the Official Debates of 4th May, 1949:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I see no reason why this form of entertainment should escape its contribution to the public revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in 1949, saw no reason why dancing should not be taxed but, in fact, the boot was on the other foot.  The onus surely lay on the Minister for Finance of the day to show why it should be taxed.  Is there anything immoral in dancing?  Is there anything more immoral in dancing than in, say, playing cards?  Yet a person may pay 10/- to go to a bridge drive. He can play contract for any stakes he likes, even for £1 a point if his friends agree, and the bridge drive at which this can take place can be held for any cause whatsoever, even, say, to advance Shintoism in Scotland or the Isle of Man.  Yet, under Deputy McGilligan's dispensation as it stands to-day, this entertainment will not be taxed.  But let him try, under the Coalition code, to run a dance for a local football club or hurling club, a Labour club, or a Fianna Fáil cumann or a Fine Gael branch, and at once he is in trouble.</P>
    <P>Dancing, as I pointed out in the Budget speech, is the only form of <Col N="1425" /> entertainment in respect of which duty is levied on payments by those taking part in the entertainment as distinct from mere spectators.  The whole business is riddled with absurd anomalies. For instance, if a person goes to a ballroom not to dance but to watch the dancing, he is taxed.  On the other hand, if he goes to a theatre to watch dancing on the stage he is not taxed. He cannot watch his neighbours, he cannot watch even his own children dancing on a ballroom floor without being taxed, but he can watch foreigners dancing all night in a theatre and not be taxed.  He cannot dance with his wife or his fiancée in a public hall unless he pays entertainments duty; but he can, if he likes, enter for an all-in wrestling competition and in this, if he is able, he can gouge his opponent's eyes out, break his jaw, knock him unconscious and invite every sadist in the city to gloat over the spectacle&mdash;all this he can do free of tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance in 1949, deliberately induced the Oireachtas to legislate to create that absurd position.  He even carried the absurdity further, because in Section 13 of his Act of 1949 he provided that if you attended a public dance in a place not situated in, or within three miles of, a town with a population of 500 you could, if the good Lord spared you, dance till Doomsday free of tax.  Thus, if you built a hall in an appropriate position three miles and one yard from the boundary of the City of Dublin your dances would be free of tax, even if your admission fee were £5 a head; while if your dance hall happened to be in a working-class district in Dublin and you were charging even 1/- for admission, your patrons would be taxed.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that Deputy McGilligan's legislation in 1949 was class legislation with a vengeance. Under it, provided the necessary conditions and formalities were complied with, dances could be run in country mansions and would be free of tax no matter how high the price of the ticket, but a struggling football club or literary society could not run a dance <Col N="1426" /> free of tax in a parish hall in the village, if the population of the village at the last census were returned at 501 persons, or more.  Is there really any justification for singling out this form of entertainment in the way it has been singled out, and was singled out by Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues in the Coalition Government?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as was to be expected, experience has proved that this provision for which Deputy McGilligan was responsible cannot be equitably or even uniformally administered as between one centre of population or another. The exemption from the dance tax, as this tax is popularly named, is related to a town with a population not exceeding 500 persons.  But in the whole country there is not a village or town with a fixed statutory boundary that has so small a population.  In these circumstances, therefore, the officers of the Revenue Commissioners who have to administer the law are at the mercy of the census-taker.  So are those who run dances and who are responsible, under heavy penalties, for the due collection of the tax.  Thus we may have the experience&mdash;in fact we have had the experience&mdash;of the returned populations in those small towns moving up and down, according as their boundaries change one way or the other or become delimited one way or the other at the taking of the census in the <i>bona fide</i> judgment of the person who is responsible for the taking of a census in a particular area. Could there be anything more inconvenient for the taxpayer than that?</P>
    <P>He is quite uncertain at certain periods whether or not he is responsible for paying tax.  How could he ever know, therefore, how he stood in regard to his liability under Deputy McGilligan's code unless, of course, and this is what has been happening, he built his dance hall in a remote and lonely place which was more than three miles from anywhere.  In fact, that is what has been occurring under the law as it stood since 1949.  Large public dance halls are being erected in these lonely places.  The public who like dancing, the adolescent as well as the adult, are being attracted to these dance halls from the cities and towns because, <Col N="1427" /> being free of tax, the proprietors of these halls can give their patrons better value in the matter of popular bands and longer hours of dancing. Therefore, these halls are increasing their business.  Frankly, I do not think, speaking from a sociological point of view, that that is a desirable development.</P>
    <P>I do not take an unduly narrow or puritanical view in this matter, nor would I suggest for a moment that the great majority of people who attend dances whether they are held in the town or the country are not sober or well-behaved.</P>
    <P>However, we all know that there are some who are not and that the toughs and the drunks are more likely to be difficult to deal with and to control when the dances which they afflict are run outside the urban limits.  We know too that this type of person is a menace to himself and to others when he is on the road behind a steering wheel of a car in the early hours of the morning. If anything happened to him some people might say: &ldquo;The devil mend him,&rdquo; but what about the innocent users of the road to whom he is a menace, and a menace which is growing under Section 13 of Deputy McGilligan's Finance Act, 1949.</P>

      <P>The encouragement which Deputy McGilligan gave to this sort of thing in 1949 has proven to be anti-social in its consequences and should be discontinued.  Section 13 of Deputy McGilligan's Finance Act of that year is a striking example of what I had in mind when I said at the beginning of my speech that, while a tax might induce social reactions, these are not always what may have been anticipated. This ill-considered tax, we all know, was drafted as a sop to those who would have opposed the reimposition of the dance tax on the grounds that it was a tax on rural amenities. I suppose that those who were placated by it felt that it would brighten the life in the country.  Instead, as I have already shown, it has been fostering a social evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for one tax which the Opposition have advocated with a sow-faced disapproval for a harmless and innocent pastime&mdash;a disapproval which ill-accords with the idolatry with which some of their members have worshipped the porter-barrel&mdash;throughout this debate.  Apparently some members of the Opposition would <Col N="1429" /> prefer that the young should drink rather than dance.  That, however, is not our view.</P>
    <P>In replying on the General Resolution I took occasion to deal with the tax to which a somewhat extended reference has been made by the Trades Union Congress.  I refer to the excess profits tax.  This tax is an excellent example of the propaganda value of a name.  It exemplifies how a questionable proposition can be put over provided it is called something which is likely to have a popular appeal.  On first thoughts nothing would seem to be fairer in its incidence and easier in its application than a tax on excess profits.  Yet experience has shown that this is not, in fact, the case.  Excess profits tax has been shown to be so arbitrary in its application, so uncertain, so unfair as between one taxpayer and another, so easily and readily evaded that it is universally admitted to be a bad tax.</P>
    <P>In this connection, might I repeat again what Dr. Dalton said about it when, as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Socialist Government, he asked the Labour majority in the British Parliament to abolish it altogether in April, 1946?  Stating in the House of Commons, early in October, 1945&mdash;the reference is to column 1897, Volume 414 of <i>Hansard</i>&mdash;his reasons for first reducing and ultimately abolishing the then existing excess profits tax, Deputy Dalton said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dr. Dalton, M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer, said in October, 1945:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Moreover, once the standard profit has been earned, this tax encourages extravagant and wasteful outlay, and even downright dishonesty, since if this expenditure were not incurred it would be the Treasury and not the owners of the business who would take the money. Under those conditions this tax works against incentive and against efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But Dr. Dalton said something even more significant when he finally abolished the tax in April, 1946, for then he expressed the hope:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that it will stimulate private enterprise to put its best foot forward and to go flat out on an expansionist course.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now what does this expression of hope imply except that an excess profits tax discourages industrial development and therefore prevents the increase of opportunities for employment?  These were the views expressed by Dr. Dalton in 1946.  Since then the Labour Government of that day have become the British Opposition to-day, but their views on the character of this tax have not changed.  Indeed, I think it may be said, they have become more emphatic.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the British Finance Bill as recently as the 7th of last month, Mr. Callaghan, who was a member of the last British Labour Administration, said this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I now come to the excess profits levy and the profits tax.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot be <Col N="1431" /> feeling too happy on this subject. He has been shot at from behind and we shall note with considerable amusement how he deals with the situation.  Let our position be quite clear.  The Trades Union Congress told the Chancellor of the Exchequer before he prepared his Budget that the proposed excess profits tax was a wasteful tax.  They had derived that knowledge from their experience of the six years during which the tax had operated.  My right hon. friend, the member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton), very soon educated the country on the shortcomings of any excess profits tax over a long period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reference again is to <i>Hansard,</i> Volume 498, column 2330.  Mr. Callaghan went on to say this and I hope it will be noted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is no doubt why the Chancellor of the Exchequer is most anxious to disclaim any responsibility for a tax which is wasteful in its incidence, has bad effects upon industry and particularly on the younger industries, and which, in short, does nothing except multiply the number of bureaucrats&mdash;I think that is the right term&mdash;and puts all the accountants in the country on overtime.  It achieves, at the expense of a great many man hours and by using a very blunt instrument, the result that can be achieved by increasing the profits tax or the income-tax.  Why this tax should have been thrust upon us at the present time is beyond my comprehension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark those words: &ldquo;It achieves, at the expense of a great many man hours and by using a very blunt instrument, the result that can be achieved by increasing the profits or the income-tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have chosen in this Budget the latter of the alternatives suggested by this former Labour Minister and we have chosen it for good reasons.  But in the light of this strong condemnation of the excess profits tax both in its earlier form as in 1946, and as it has been reintroduced in Great <Col N="1432" /> Britain, is it not, to say the least of it, very strange that the Trades Union Congress should now have come out in advocacy of it?  The truth, of course, is that in this instance the political propagandist overbore the economist who prepared the original draft of the statement.  There is, however, a certain irony in the Trades Union Congress references to profits tax and one may wonder if these references were not intended to sting those members of the Labour Party who were Ministers in the Coalition.  There were three of them in Deputy Costello's Government and, according to themselves, they dominated the Cabinet.  Yet while they were in this position of great power they allowed Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance in 1949, as I have already stated to the House, to reduce the corporation profits tax on foreign-owned companies carrying on business in this country even though they did not maintain a register of their shareholders here.  These companies had their rate of corporation profits tax reduced, while Deputy McGilligan and his Labour colleagues were taxing the innocent pastimes of our young people in every city, town and village with a population of more than 500.</P>
    <P>If a Fianna Fáil Government were to do such a thing as that the ex-Tánaiste would blow himself up like a gasometer and the Labour Party would have the crowds out in O'Connell Street screaming to them that Fianna Fáil were taxing the poor and relieving the rich, were taxing the Irish and relieving the foreigner.  But let us not forget that is what Deputy Norton did when he was Tánaiste in 1949 and Deputy Dunne and Deputy Corish supported him.  There was no talk then on the part of Deputy Dunne of carrying the battle into the streets, no rabble-rousing rhetoric from platforms in O'Connell Street, no window smashed in the principal thorough are of our city when this was being done by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;by Fine Gael&mdash; with the help and co-operation of the Labour Party.  Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan.  When that was being done, Deputy Corish, like Deputy Norton, was, as Deputy Dillon jeered: &ldquo;as mute as mice.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But let me revert now to this question of profits tax and in that connection let me repeat what has already been stated on more than one occasion as to the effect which the changes in the income-tax, as proposed in the Finance Bill, will have on the general body of the taxpapers.</P>
      <P>Here are the truly significant facts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Of the 188,500 individuals liable to income-tax for 1952-53, 170,500 will pay less tax than formerly.  Only 18,000 will pay more.  In other words, more than 90 per cent. of them will benefit from the 1952 Budget proposals.</P>
      <P>Of the 151,500 Schedule E taxpayers &mdash;and as everybody knows, that is the Schedule under which remuneration in respect of employments is taxed&mdash; 145,000 will pay less than formerly. Only 6,500 will pay more.  Over 95 per cent. of Schedule E taxpayers will be better off under the 1952 Budget than they were under any Coalition Budget.</P>
      <P>Of the 135,000 unmarried taxpayers, over 123,000 will benefit.  Less than 7,500 will pay more.</P>
      <P>Of the 27,500 married taxpayers without children, over 22,500 will benefit. Less than 5,000 will pay more.</P>
      <P>Of the 25,500 married taxpayers with children, almost 20,000 will benefit. About 5,500 will pay more.</P>
      <P>Yet, notwithstanding the widespread reduction in the actual imposition on the taxpayer, we shall get this year an additional £910,000 from income-tax, mainly, as I said in my Budget speech, out of company profits.</P>
      <P>We have in short done what the Labour Party in Great Britain are suggesting the British Chancellor should have done and imply would have done if it were not for other influences, taxed profits through the income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doing this we have avoided the use of the excess profits tax or levy, as it is now called in Great Britain and have not been so foolish as to resort to a tax which even convinced and <Col N="1434" /> thorough going Socialists admit &ldquo;is wasteful in its incidence, has bad effects upon industry and particularly on the younger industries and which, in short, does nothing except multiply the number of bureaucrats&mdash;I think that is the right term&mdash;and puts all the accountants in the country on overtime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested by these Labour critics of the Budget that we should have secured more from surtax payers.</P>
    <P>Well, with some slight mitigation due to the increase in earned income relief and in the reduced rate relief&mdash; which together, have resulted in reducing the income-tax burden upon over 90 per cent. of the income-tax payers&mdash; the surtax payer will pay his income-tax at the full standard increased rate.</P>
    <P>But I wish to say a word on this question of surtax which may not be out of place.</P>
    <P>Surtax as it is paid in this country is a tax where an increase in rate might quite easily result, not only in a reduction in tax yield, but a reduction in employment and in a reduction in investable resources.</P>
    <P>A glance at the section in the report of the Revenue Commissioners will show that the number of really substantial surtax payers in this country is very small&mdash;is, in fact, I should say, judged by even the most modest standards, less than 700.</P>
    <P>Most of these probably derive their income from business, investments or other property outside this country and beyond our control.</P>
    <P>Many of them are not anchored here like a man who is in a job here or whose business and activities are confined to this country.</P>
    <P>Some of them have come to live here, to spend their money here, to give employment here, to pay their tax here, because they like this country and like to be among our people.</P>
    <P>For that pleasure, they pay not only their income-tax at the standard rate, but on top of that they pay also their surtax at the rates appropriate to their income, and these additional rates <Col N="1435" /> range from 5/- in the £ to 8/6 in the £, according to the sector of the income on which it falls.</P>
    <P>Many of these people could quite readily decide to live elsewhere, could give employment, spend their income there, invest their savings there and pay their tax there.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, there is a limit beyond which it would be not only inequitable but positively imprudent to increase the surtax rate in order to get additional revenue.</P>
    <P>Of course, if the purpose was to drive them out, then an excessive increase in surtax would be as good a weapon as any, by it they could be made to go and take their possessions and their incomes with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give them a bounty for living in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of giving anybody a bounty.  They come here to live without any bounty. The question is whether, like the man in the fable, you will do as Deputy Corish wants to do and then find yourself without anything in the end. As I was saying, it is quite easy to drive them out if you want to do so and the surtax weapon would be as good as any, and by it they could be made to go and take their possessions and their incomes with them.  But I do not think that is quite the purpose the Trades Union Congress had in mind when they advocated an increase in the already very steep surtax rates. At least, if it were, they did not have the courage to say so.  Let us now come to the question of estate duties in regard to which the Trades Union Congress say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At present the maximum rate of estate duties, etc., is 53 per cent.; in Britain it is 80 per cent.  The rates for the middle and higher ranges could well be raised considerably to provide more revenue for the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In that connection the following points have not been brought out by our critics and they are very significant and ought to be adverted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> (i)  the 80 per cent. mark in Great Britain to which the Trades Union Congress refer, is reached only when the estate is of the value of £1,000,000;</P>
    <P>(ii)  for estates up to £20,000, the rates in this country and in Great Britain are the same;</P>
    <P>(iii)  while the rates diverge from this point onwards, the divergence is gradual, being only 5 per cent. at the £50,000 mark and 9 per cent. at £100,000;</P>
    <P>(iv)  much of the difference in estate duty rates as between the two countries is offset by the fact that legacy duty and succession duty continue to be chargeable here, although these duties were terminated in Great Britain as from the 31st July, 1949.</P>
    <P>But, as in the case of surtax, so too in the case of estate duties.  We have to keep in mind that though large fortunes are extremely rare in this country, as compared with others, these fortunes are highly mobile.</P>
    <P>So long as their owners are domiciled here, we can collect estate duty on them in due course.  If their owners divest themselves of that domicile and assume another, we cannot.  So common sense dictates that, taking the long financial view, our estate duty code should induce the owners of large estates to make their domicile here, rather than drive them elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that Deputy Hickey is not as good a citizen as the rest, but as Minister for Finance, I would prefer, from the point of view of the general public, to have the income-tax which is paid to the Exchequer on an income of £100,000 than any income-tax which Deputy Hickey pays.  I think it would go a long way further to maintain and meet the cost of the social services and the public services than the tax which Deputy Hickey pays.  I know Deputy Hickey wants to dwell on the fairy gold about which he dreams so much <Col N="1437" /> but we have to deal with hard cash and to deal with men who have hard cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, you are. That is precisely what I am saying.</P>
      <P>Then I come to the last suggestion which the Trades Union Congress has made&mdash;a suggestion which it frankly recognises is absurd from a financial point of view, whatever demagogic appeal it may have.  The Trades Union Congress want a purchase tax on luxuries, but then go on to admit that &ldquo;the revenue from it might not be very substantial.&rdquo;  Let us look at that suggestion as practical men who last year had to face an increase in the cost of administering this country of £3,600,000, of which almost £2,000,000 was in respect of the Civil Service. Let us examine the suggestion that I should bring in this tax, the advocates of which admit that the revenue from it might not be very substantial.  Will somebody tell me why a Minister for Finance should introduce a new tax requiring new machinery to collect it, a tax which is readily subject to abuse and evasion, as a purchase tax is, unless he were reasonably certain to get a substantial revenue from it?</P>
      <P>The job of a Minister for Finance, of the person who holds my office, when he imposes taxes, is to get money readily and with certainty.  Experience has shown that a purchase tax cannot be readily and certainly collected but, on the other hand, can readily be, and certainly is, evaded.  This applies even when it is imposed on the buying and selling of a widespread range of articles in general use.  This is very much more the position when the tax is to be confined to some articles which are deemed by someone to be luxuries.  How am I to define what is a luxury?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, if I were to accept this proposal of the Trades Union Congress, how am I going to frame a definition of a luxury which would not be as full of loopholes as a sieve is?  Is the make-up, for instance, of an actor or actress a luxury?  If it is not a luxury, how are you going to distinguish between it and the make-up sold, say, <Col N="1438" /> to a lady on which, at any rate, luxury or no luxury, a tax of 100 per cent. is already levied?  Is the motor-car which a commercial traveller uses for his business journey a luxury?  If it is not, does it become a luxury when he takes his family out in it for a drive on Sunday?  If it becomes a luxury on Sunday, and is not a luxury during the remainder of the week but is a necessary part of his commercial and business equipment, must we legislate to make him pay a luxury tax every Sunday?  A luxury tax in our circumstances, apart altogether from the difficulty of definition, if one could devise a system under which it could be imposed and collected and would not be evaded, would have to fall mainly on imports, few of which can be described as luxuries and many of which are already subjected, as I have pointed out, to high rates of custom duties to afford protection to native manufacturers.  So far as the luxury tax fell on home produced goods, it would be a direct threat to trade and industry.  Whatever its incidence, it would raise the price level, curtail demand and inevitably react on profits and, therefore, on employment.</P>
    <P>These are the proposals which have been put forward by a body which has had the courage and the candour to admit that there is a substantial gap between revenue and expenditure to be bridged this year, and that our task is a difficult one.  I have examined each and every one of them and not one of them, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and the taxpayer, offers any advantage whatever over the measures which are proposed in the Finance Bill.  These measures are those which are best suited to our needs and to our circumstances. Nobody will deny that they are going to be difficult to accept but there is no way out.  We have been borrowing and borrowing for the last three years.  We have doubled the national debt.  We have more than doubled the amount which we must provide in this Budget for sinking fund and interest, the amount which we must raise under various heads for sinking fund and interest charged to the Supply Services and sinking fund and interest charged <Col N="1439" /> to the Central Fund.  It has risen from £4,000,000 to £9,000,000 over the last three years.  It is quite clear that we could not go on evading our responsibilities in this way and failing to meet our obligations honestly as they arise, continuing always to resort to borrowing.  It has got to come to an end some time.  Were this the last thing that Fianna Fáil ever did, it is going to come to an end this year.</P>

      <P>In the rather heated atmosphere which accompanied the speech of the Minister for Finance and the turmoil which surrounded him, I found it difficult to hear occasionally what he was saying.  I am speaking subject to correction but I understand, a Leas-Cheann Chomhairle, that he stated that if I were over there in charge of an Administration faced with the problems that he alleges he has to face, I would have brought in the very self-same Budget and the same provisions as there are here.</P>

I would be no party to any provision in this Budget.  I think these taxes are cruel and unjust and that they will prove so.  I believe that I have proved it and that I will do so again to-day.  I want to emphasise that I would not be a party to any single one of the provisions brought in here by the Minister which would have the effect of increasing the cost of living on the people, increasing the cost of bread, butter, tea and sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has further interrupted the course of this discussion, wholly unnecessarily, I am anxious to repeat, in spite of his alleged point of order, that I would not be a party in any Administration&mdash;either as head of it or as a member of it&mdash;to the unjust, cruel and entirely unnecessary provisions of the Budget which he has brought in and which are to be given legal effect to in this Finance Bill.  I would not stay one second in office, nor would I be associated with anybody in office who would be responsible for a Budget or a Finance Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I levied the charge here, in the speech I made the day after the Budget was introduced, that the taxes being imposed by the Minister were cruel and unjust because they were unnecessary.  I gave reasoned arguments, facts and figures in support of the charge I then made.  I alleged, <Col N="1444" /> and I proved the truth of my allegation, that it was the aim of the Budget proposals to create a surplus and to conceal that surplus from the people. In doing that the Government created wholly unnecessary hardship and suffering.  To-day I repeat that allegation but before I proceed to give further arguments and replies to the various points that were made by the Ministers in the course of the Budget debate in refutation of the points made by me I want to make this comment: the tone of the Minister's utterances right throughout the length and breadth of his speech to-day give added proof, if proof were needed, of the charge that we made and that we now repeat.  The Minister's utterances give ground for the conviction that we hold that the dominant purpose of the provisions of his Budget and of this financial Bill is an endeavour to discredit his predecessors in the last Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister made use of certain phrases: &ldquo;dishonest administration;&rdquo;&ldquo;a false Budget&rdquo; and in particular the phrase to which I have already referred, &ldquo;a factitious prosperity engendered by uninhibited spending&rdquo; and still other phrases suggestive of fraudulent and dishonest conduct on my part and on the part of my colleagues, particularly Deputy McGilligan. Out of his foetid imagination he drew the allegation that I went to the Park and asked the Uachtaráin for a dissolution of the Dáil because I was afraid to face the criticism of the Budget proposals introduced by my colleague the Minister for Finance in my Administration, Deputy McGilligan. Nobody will believe these charges, coming from the foul imagination of the present Minister for Finance against my colleague, Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will tell us why he did ask for a dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not afraid to face criticism.  What had we to fear?  We introduced a Budget which was passed by the representatives of the people here.  We then went to the people and submitted our <Col N="1445" /> proposals to them but not because we were afraid of any criticism, any investigation or anything of that kind. The Budget had nothing to do with the dissolution.  It is a well-known fact that we went to the people last year because we refused to increase the price of essential commodities to the people.  We were pressed by certain sections to increase the price of milk which would in effect increase the price of butter.  We refused to do that and, rather than accept dictation from a certain section of the people and from certain Deputies here, I went to the park and asked the Uachtaráin for a dissolution of the Dáil.  What happened then?</P>
      <P>In order to try to secure the votes of some of the farming community the Minister and his colleagues offered a bribe at the expense of the taxpayers. They carried out that promise last year when they increased the subsidy by £600,000 at a time when they were openly stating we were on the verge of ruin.  The Minister increased the subsidy and at the same time the price of butter in repayment for the votes he and his colleagues had sought in the general election, and he paid that bribe at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Having put that additional burden of £600,000 on the people and having gone round the country shouting that there was a crisis and nothing but financial ruin facing the country, he now has the hardihood to come in here and advance arguments for the removal of the subsidies on bread and butter and all the other essential commodities to which he referred.  I want clearly now and specifically to repeat the charges that I made on the Budget proposals.  The Budget had for its aim the creation of a surplus.  That aim is now further implemented in the Minister's proposals enshrined in the Finance Bill before us to-day.  Corroborative proof of our complaint that that is the real aim of the Budget and of this Finance Bill is to be found in the items I enumerated in the course of my speech on the Budget on 3rd April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes in here to-day and tries to have it both ways.  He works himself up into his old fury <Col N="1446" /> about this so-called factitious prosperity engendered by uninhibited spending and the frightful consequences of borrowing.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  From late summer of last year until the early autumn we were warned of an impending crisis.  Then in the autumn we had the discussion on this famous or, shall I say, infamous White Paper which emanated from the Minister's own Department. In the inter-Party Government we had the dual Budget system.  We initiated that system and the result of it was that the people reaped greater benefits and enjoyed a better standard of living generally, a standard that is now being threatened by the Minister's present proposals.  That dual budgetary system was attacked in every place in which it could be attacked and in every speech made by the Minister and his colleagues.  Last July we were told by the Minister that we as a Government had an unwieldy capital programme. We were told not so very long ago by the Minister himself when he announced his intention of floating a loan that we had been putting the country into pawn.</P>
    <P>Having been told that our capital programme was too big, that it was improper for us to borrow and that we had borrowed both improperly and improvidently, that the country was on a spending spree, that there was a rake's progress which was continuing, and other eloquent phrases of that kind, what do we now find?  The Minister has a capital programme of £35,000,000, a programme as great if not greater than the capital programme we had.  How will it be financed?  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He knows very well he cannot finance that capital programme of £35,000,000 by borrowing and that is why he waxes so eloquently in his invective against borrowing.  He knows he cannot get the money necessary by borrowing and so an endeavour is now being made to create a surplus, a concealed surplus, in order to finance that capital expenditure of £35,000,000.</P>
    <P>But the Minister cannot have it both ways.  The Minister said that the inter-Party Government had an unwieldy capital programme.  The <Col N="1447" /> Minister's programme is as big if not bigger than ours.  He said in the course of his speech that he would finance that programme in the same way as we financed our programme. He cannot do it by borrowing because, if he borrows, he will have to eat his own words and all the fine principles he enunciated in proof of his financial rectitude over the last 12 months.  If he continues our system, then he is putting the country further into pawn and the rake's progress will continue; the spending spree will continue.  He has inveighed against borrowing in eloquent terms.  If he does now what he alleged was the proper thing to do when he was in opposition, and which he has expressly or implicitly repeated to-day, he will have to finance his capital programme by means of taxation and by doing what we allege he is doing through the medium of his Budget&mdash;creating a surplus and concealing it from the people.  He has not the courage to say to the people: &ldquo;We believe that is the proper method and financial rectitude requires such a method of financing the capital programme out of revenue and not carrying out any more capital projects than the amount of revenue produced each year from taxation warrants or permits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, and I proceed now to prove again, that the Minister's aim is to create a surplus on current account this year.  On the night before I made my speech, following on the all-day discussion on the Budget proposals, I took six items which had then appeared as justifying the charge I made that the Minister was budgeting for a surplus.  I gave particulars of these six items, and not merely did these items disclose that that charge was valid, but they disclosed that the charge was implicit in the charge that taxation was being imposed in circumstances of extreme cruelty, and that it was wholly unnecessary in this Budget. The Minister and his colleagues endeavoured in the course of the Budget debate to deal with the various arguments which I put forward. I will have occasion, in the course of <Col N="1448" /> the remarks I have to make, to deal with most of those purported answers, and with the allegation I made and the particulars that I gave.  In particular, I will have to deal with the Minister's own attempt to answer some of the charges.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;some&rdquo; because it is of great significance that the Minister did not attempt even to answer the arguments and the facts that I had put forward. In the course of his speech, in replying on the Budget debate, he contented himself merely, by verbal gymnastics, to endeavour to get round or circumvent the rules of parliamentary propriety and by suggestions that there was trickery involved in my charges, that there was dishonesty in those charges, concealment, misrepresentation and failure to disclose matters of that kind.  That is what passed for argument, but invective and personal abuse are no answer to reasoned argument or to a case based upon reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister ended his speech on the Budget debate by amusing himself with these verbal gymnastics, but I am convinced that he left the people of the country perfectly satisfied, or at any rate the vast majority of the people perfectly satisfied, that I had established the case which I made on the morning of the 3rd of April this year.  Neither the Taoiseach, nor any of the Ministers, nor the Minister for Finance has, in trying to refute the charges I made, shown that any of the particulars I gave were in any way without foundation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his reply on that date, made great play with the Trades Union Congress document.  At columns 940-1 he savours his words and his invective as if he were savouring some old wine. He repeated the words in the Trades Union Congress document as if there was some allegation against me or some disproof of what I had said.  He utilises a phrase in the Trades Union Congress document to pour scorn on me.  I listened with some amusement to-day to the Minister pouring invective and scorn on every single item in that document issued by the Trades Union Congress on which he was forced to rely when replying to some of the <Col N="1449" /> arguments I had put forward.  Every one of the suggestions put forward in that document was refuted to-day by the Minister with scorn and invective. The only thing that was left to him was the phrase that he used at such great length at the close of the debate on the Budget proposals on the 1st May last.  The quotation that he relied on is to be found at column 941 of the debate of the 1st May, 1952.  I will re-quote it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Firstly, it is necessary to discover whether or not the figure of £15,000,000 constitutes the gap in the current Budget.  We do not doubt for a moment, despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various Estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement which the Minister relied on to refute the suggestions which I made and now remake, that there are embodied in this Bill proposals which are going to extract from the people's pockets, at great expense to their lives, their fortunes and in unemployment and in their future, a sum of between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 at a very conservative estimate.  It is very wholesome that bodies, like the Trades Union Congress, should issue documents of the kind to which I have referred.  We appreciate the quality of the contributions which they make from time to time.  We regard that as a very sane and a very healthy manifestation of public life in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he has refuted all the suggestions made.  I am going to show, first of all, that the statement that was made by the Minister, and that was relied on by him, does not mean what he said it meant, and, secondly, that, even if it did, it is of little validity.  Nobody doubts what the Trades Union Congress said&mdash;the author of that document did not doubt it&mdash;that the estimating of both revenue and expenditure is made &ldquo;as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;  Everybody knows that the estimating and forecasting of expenditure is made as accurately as forecasting of that kind will allow.  It was on that basis, and on that estimation, <Col N="1450" /> that every figure that is given was put forward in this House. Every official advising the Minister, and every Department that lent its aid to the formulation of the Budget or to the Estimates on which the Budget is based, were doing their best honestly and competently, but were doing it &ldquo;as honestly and as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;  But forecasting of this nature does not possess the accuracy which the Minister and his colleagues claim for it.</P>
    <P>I gave the experience of Deputy McGilligan and of my colleagues in our time in Government, that forecasting of this nature always showed that it was conservative&mdash;an overestimate.  In any event, even if the Minister could read into that phrase in that document that it meant what he said it meant; and that it was a repudiation of the arguments which I had put forward, my answer is that just as in the case of an opinion given by counsel, however eminent as a member of the Bar, it is worthless unless it gives the reasons on which it is based.  It is on the reasons on which the opinion is based that weight is to be attached to it and on which the validity of the opinion is to be judged.  No reasons are given that this statement means what the Minister alleges it means, and since no reasons are given I am entitled to say, without in any way endeavouring to flatter either Deputy McGilligan or myself, that both of us have far more experience than the author or authors of that document as to what goes on in connection with the preparation of Estimates and the formulation of a Budget such as we have here before us.  I think there is nobody in this House at present who has had more experience than Deputy McGilligan has on matters of that kind.  I, personally, had, as Head of the Government for three years, the closest possible contact with him as regards the formulation of financial policy and the examination of the Estimates.  Even before those three years, in various and different capacities, I had considerable experience in the last 30 years in connection with matters of that kind.  I think we are entitled to say, therefore, that Deputy <Col N="1451" /> McGilligan and I, at least, have intimate and personal knowledge of what goes on and, to that extent, our views are worth rather more than those of a person who has no experience or intimate knowledge of the kind that we have.  But we all know what happens in a general sort of way and those who have had experience of administration in government or of being connected with Governments know what actually happens in the preparation of these Estimates.</P>
    <P>Although the endeavour was made to get an alibi for the Minister and his colleagues by saying that in making the charges we made and in putting forward the particulars we gave, we were in some way making reflections on the competence of the Revenue Commissioners or the officials of the Department of Finance or any other Department of State, I want to repeat that there is no intention whatever of doing anything of the sort.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan in his speech on the Budget proposals on 29th April, 1952, Volume 131, No. 4, columns 551-552, gave first of all his appreciation of the competence, honesty and integrity of the Revenue Commissioners and of their experience and of the value of the advice that they gave to him.  At the end of his remarks, at column 552, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On many occasions I have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners on these matters.  It was explained to me that the statistical information did not allow any better or closer estimate than was given to me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He had already shown that in the course of a number of years the Revenue Commissioners' estimate in connection with the buoyancy of the revenue or the amount that would be received from taxation had been very much out.  They were very conservative in the estimate and a very good thing it was.  Nevertheless, they explained to Deputy McGilligan, as he stated in the passage I have read, that the statistical information did not allow any better or closer estimate than was given to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> Each year that I had any responsibility for the finances of this country, every single item of every Estimate came before me as the Head of the Government and as a member of the Estimates Sub-Committee and was examined in my room with a fine comb. Everybody was put through his paces. Every Minister, not merely his officials, had to come before us and justify his figures.  Notwithstanding that, notwithstanding every effort we made to keep down the Estimates, to get them to give closer approximations, in every single year that we were there there was at least £2,000,000 saved on either economies or overestimation.</P>

      <P>I will proceed to show it and I will proceed to show that there was £2,000,000 saved in the course of the year 1951, in the course of the remarks I will make.  The Minister will hear what I have to say later on and I will give figures.  He may adopt personal invective and abuse in his effort to try to answer the arguments that I have made&mdash;thereby showing the poverty of the material that he has to hand&mdash;and to answer the allegations on which we found the case that we make that this is a false Budget unnecessarily imposing unjust taxation on the people.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the fact that every year, so far as my recollection serves, towards the close of the financial year, there goes forth from the Department of Finance under the hand and seal&mdash; certainly under the hand or with the authority&mdash;of the Minister for Finance, an appeal, if not a direction and order, to every Minister to save during the course of the then ensuing few months every single penny that can be saved.  Accordingly, economies are effected in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me deal very quickly with the statement made by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Speaking on the 3rd April, after I had spoken, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <Col N="1453" /> purported to deal with my allegations and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Costello's calculations were based upon such obvious fallacies that, I am sure, most Deputies saw them at once, and that it is not necessary to expose them further.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was his contribution at the beginning of his speech.  If it was not necessary to deal with them any further than that and if they could be just tossed aside in that way, the Taoiseach himself had to be brought in and practically every single other Minister in the Government had to be brought in and finally the Minister himself had to try to answer them and each and every one of them and all of them together failed to answer the allegations and the proofs that I put forward in establishing them.</P>
    <P>Further on, at column 1290, the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will admit that there is a possibility that the Estimate may be slightly wrong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The £10,000,000 that I have stated here, which is an overestimate for which unnecessary taxation is being imposed, is only 2 per cent. of the entire Estimate.  I think that could be well held to be within the definition or description of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as an Estimate being slightly wrong.  Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate, when one of the speakers on this side of the House, I believe, was speaking, the Minister interrupted, as he has tried to interrupt me here just now, to suggest that that phrase of the Tánaiste meant that it was over all the Estimates.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is one of the most astute debaters in this House, one of the most experienced.  Why did not he say so?  Let it be so.  I will give the Minister a present of it.  Let <Col N="1454" /> it be 5 per cent. over all, leaving aside &ldquo;one way or the other.&rdquo;  A 5 per cent. error on £94,871,623 would be about £5,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister says it must be one way or the other. Let us go back to our experience of what happens.  In some respects, in some Estimates over the years, there was overspending; in others there was considerable underspending.  As Deputy McGilligan said&mdash;certainly I know that that is the position&mdash;in certain Departments, although they had money to spend and wanted to spend it, they were not able to spend it, and there was that saving on overestimation and there were economies that would be effected during the course of the year because moneys could not be spent and were not spent for reasons over which perhaps the Minister in charge of the Department had no control or because of circumstances unexpectedly arising or other matters of that kind.  That was the general principle.  Let us come down and have a look at particular instances and see how those principles have worked out in the years with which we are dealing.  The case is conclusively proved.</P>
      <P>We gathered from the speech of the Minister for Finance when introducing the Budget that the Minister had intended to introduce an autumn Budget last year, but was frustrated in his endeavour to place that particular imposition upon the people by the exposures made by people from this side of the House, speakers who exposed the fallacies that underlay the scaremongering of the speeches of the Minister and his colleagues.  At column 1134 of Volume 130 of the Official Debates of the 2nd April, 1952, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the attention of the Dáil was directed to the seriousness of the situation, the existence of the problem was denied and Ministers were accused of scaremongering and of panic.  These circumstances alone made it quite impossible either to float a loan ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1455" /> I want to emphasise this because this is where the autumn Budget which we frustrated was to come.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... or to raise the necessary finance by imposing taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first statement in that quotation is inaccurate, in any event&mdash;&ldquo;the existence of the problem was denied.&rdquo;  We forced the Minister's colleague in public here in this Dáil on the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill to accept the description I had given in Cork a few days previously that there was no crisis but that there was a problem.  The Minister, in indulging in what he has accused us of, trickery and misrepresentation, must needs allege that we denied the existence of the problem, when we denied the existence of a crisis and taught him and his colleagues that there was no crisis but that there was a problem.  As a result of our teachings, this country was saved by us from the impositions of an autumn Budget last year, in circumstances in which they would be entirely unjustified and in which any argument that would have been put forward would have been based upon an utterly false case.</P>
    <P>To prepare the way for that, however, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not let his colleagues down at that time.  He had not made the great recantation which he made here in the House of agreeing that there was no crisis but that there was a problem.  A White Paper was issued from the Department of Finance under the auspices of the Minister for Finance as a prelude to the autumn Budget that was to affict this country and Deputies are well aware&mdash;they have often been repeated&mdash;of the figures given at that time to justify the case being made that the country was facing a serious crisis by reason of the gap in our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to remember that that document was prepared for the same Minister, under the auspices of the same Minister and by the same Department as prepared the proposals in his present Budget and the arguments by which he has sought to justify the cruel impositions he has <Col N="1456" /> placed on the people by the Budget. We were told at that time that there was a deficit and a gap in the balance of payments of something of the order of £70,000,000.  In the course of speeches which I made here and elsewhere, I exposed the fallacy of that statement and the falsity of that figure, but it was not necessary for me to do because it was done by the Central Statistics Office.  The latest figure produced&mdash;and I say the latest figure because a variety of figures have been produced, from £70,000,000 down to £62,000,000 and finally to £61.9 million; what the ultimate figure will be will be a matter of interest&mdash;up to to-day is the figure of £61.9 million&mdash;a difference of £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to appreciate that, when that White Paper was being published, the Minister and his advisers had, or ought to have had, accurately before them every single detail for a period of nine months of the year.  There were only three months of the year to go at the time when that false figure&mdash;I apologise for the word &ldquo;false&rdquo;; I should say &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo;&mdash; of £70,000,000 was given, a figure which was subsequently shown to be inaccurate by £8,000,000. In that document, which was prepared for an autumn Budget, there was an error of £8,000,000, or 13 per cent., an error of 13 per cent. in a calculation in a White Paper supposed to have the authority and <i>cachet</i> of the Minister for Finance and to bring conviction to the minds of the people that there was a crisis and something calling for very drastic action last October and November.  There was an error of 13 per cent. and that&mdash;if I may use the expression used by the Trades Union Congress&mdash;is a measure of the accuracy with which forecasting of this nature can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>And that calculation was made on the most favourable assumptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As my colleague says, they made that error on the most favourable assumptions.  They told the House that they had the full details to ensure accuracy as to nine months and they had only to estimate <Col N="1457" /> for three.  Last February or early in March when the Book of Estimates was introduced purporting to estimate for the Public Services for the forthcoming financial year, they had perhaps 12 months to forecast.  Is it to be assumed that they are to be better in their forecasting when they have 12 months to forecast, having made an error of 13 per cent. in a vital calculation at a time when an effort was being made to panic the people of this country, to show that there was a financial crisis?</P>
      <P>Every time that Ministers, and particularly the Minister for Finance himself, have made prognostications with regard to matters of this kind, whether the balance of payments or the financial situation or any part of the financial situation, all these prognostications have been in the one direction.  They have all been pessimistic and calculated to represent, or, as I say, to misrepresent, the situation as being worse than it subsequently proves to be.  I give that as pretty cogent proof, as pretty sound support for the argument I have made for a saving of £2,000,000 on overestimation, because that is a conservative figure I have put forward.  I believe it is too conservative but I am standing on it for safety because I should prefer to understate rather than overstate the case.  £2,000,000 is only 2 per cent. The Revenue Commissioners told my colleague when he was Minister for Finance, as he quoted here, that they could not do any more accurate forecasting than they did and everybody accepted that as being honest and perfectly genuine from people who occupy a position of complete integrity and objectivity in connection with the duties they have to fulfil.  A 2 per cent. allowance for overestimation and economies, because they bulk the two together, is a very small estimate indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what they did with the Book of Estimates this year.  When Deputies are considering and when the public are considering the truth of the allegations I make and which I repeat, that this Budget&mdash;whether it will achieve it or not, I do not know&mdash;aims at the creation of a surplus by imposing entirely unjust and unnecessary <Col N="1458" /> taxation, I want them to consider these matters in connection with this book. The Book of Estimates presented to the House by the Minister for Finance bears on its face the sum of £94,871,623 as being the estimated sum required for the services of the State during the financial year 1952-53.  That figure of £94.8 million does not contain any provision for social security.  It does not contain any provision for old age pensions nor does it contain any provision for extra children's allowances. It is a figure voted for capital services and Supply Services and has nothing to do with nor does it contain a single figure in reference to social security, children's allowances or old age pensions. That figure of £94.8 million contains the figure for capital services. If Deputies will look at the third page of that book they will find that the Estimate for capital services, &ldquo;calculated on the same basis as in the 1951-52 Volume of Estimates&rdquo;, is £9,276,516.  In order, therefore, to find out what are the real Supply Services for the forthcoming financial year you have got to deduct that figure for capital services, £9,276,516 from the £94,871,623 and you will get £85,595,107 or £85.59 million.  That is the figure that is required for next year according to the Estimate in February last. £85.59 million is what the Minister and his advisers estimated would be required for Supply Services but into the Supply Services there was pushed this King Charles's head of the Minister's, our old friend, the fuel subsidy, £2.4 million of that fuel subsidy, I think, had to go in when we come to consider the amount of real capital services with which it has to be compared for the previous year.  For 1952-53 the amount is £85.59 million.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the figures for the previous year, the last year in which Deputy McGilligan was in office as Minister for Finance.  If Deputies will look at Table I of the White Paper called &ldquo;Tables in connection with the Financial Statement, 1952,&rdquo; it will be found that there were issued for the service of the previous year sums amounting to £90.4 million in all.  That figure is the second figure on the last column, looking at Table I from the <Col N="1459" /> right.  There is a significant footnote to it, footnote A, which says: &ldquo;This includes £2,727,323 for arrears of fuel subsidy to the 31st March, 1951.&rdquo;  I think I did in error state that the £85.59 million included the fuel subsidy. It does not because it was paid the previous year.  That £90.4 million was spent in the last year of Deputy McGilligan's administration.  It will be found at item 4 on the expenditure side of Table I that capital services were included in those issues of £90.4 million, capital services to the extent of £9.7 million, actually £9,753,499.  You must deduct the capital services for the full amount of the issues to get the Supply Services, including the fuel subsidy.  £9.7 million deducted from £90.4 million gives you £80.7 million.  The fuel subsidies were paid in that year.  They were obviously not ordinary Supply Services.  You deduct £2.7 million from that last figure and arrive at a figure of £78.0 million, actually £78,000,000.  That was the amount of money that was actually spent, according to these tables which I have in my hand, in respect of the last year of Deputy McGilligan's administration as against £85.59 million to be spent on the same services&mdash;precisely and concisely the same services comparable in every way. Deduct £78,000,000 from £85.59 and you get a figure of £7.59 million.</P>
    <P>Where did that figure come from? Can the Minister or any of his officials justify such an enormous increase as that in the Supply Services from last year to this year&mdash;an increase of £7.59 million, a 10 per cent. rise?  Comparing figures comparable with figures in the last year of Deputy McGilligan's régime, these figures are £7.5 million over the same or corresponding items for the last year of Deputy McGilligan's régime.</P>
    <P>It is also significant to remember that last year every possible debt that could be thrown up was paid for by the present Minister in an effort to widen the gap or allege to widen the gap in the deficit he alleged to be in Deputy McGilligan's Budget.  During the year just ended, the increase in the Civil Service remuneration was paid <Col N="1460" /> and the fuel subsidies were paid and a certain amount of capital expenditure disguised as current debts was also paid and the arrears were paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will listen.  Merely rising up to interrupt or using personal invective does not make any difference to me, I can assure him.  The majority of the people are convinced of the truth of the allegations I made and they will be still more convinced at the end of my remarks.  I will not permit the Minister to interrupt with these irrelevancies because irrelevancies they are.  A rise of £7.59 million was a remarkable rise&mdash;a remarkable increase in the Book of Estimates for the year 1952-53 which I have in my hand.  It was £7.59 million in excess of the corresponding expenditure in the previous Book of Estimates.  What do we find in this Book of Estimates?  The Minister spoke of trickery and misrepresentation with regard to the figures I gave but what do we find in this book?</P>
      <P>If Deputies will look at the beginning of the book they will find a table headed &ldquo;Statement showing the Net Audited Expenditure on Public Services for each year from 1943-44 to 1950-51, and the Estimated Net Expenditure in 1951-52 and 1952-53&rdquo;. I regret I have given the wrong reference. It is to the abstract I wish to refer.  It is at page 11 of the book and not at the table I refer to.  The net increase for this year's Supply Services over last year's Supply Services is alleged to be, misrepresented to be, £615,970 instead of £7.59 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that invective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proceeding to show and have shown that it is misrepresentation and, of course, the reason for it is obvious.  In that abstract the Minister purported to tell the people of the country that he was increasing the Supply Services for this year only by £615,970.  I have demonstrated that he has increased them by £7.59 million.  Of course the Minister <Col N="1461" /> was at extraordinary pains to conceal that remarkable rise.  He introduced Supplementary Estimates instead of deducting them and he made a mistake again by overestimating.  I want to emphasise this as a proof of what I am saying.  He introduced Supplementary Estimates to the amount of £11.4 million.  What did he spend?  He spent only £7.59 million, yet we are told that the forecasting, the estimating by the officials of the Minister's Department is so accurate that I cannot criticise it or if I do that I am reflecting upon the competence of the officials.  In a few months, at the end of the financial year, Supplementary Estimates were brought in to the extent of £11.4 million.  Although they wanted to show that we were profligate and left debts behind us and spent money on everything whether it was proper or improper all they spent was £7.59 million&mdash; an error of 15 per cent. in the estimation. That is a high percentage at a time when one would think that the Minister for Finance would be able to assess very accurately what was wanted.  That error was made at the close of the financial year when all the information was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make another somewhat startling point: with six weeks only of the financial year to come, this Book of Estimates is £4,000,000 inaccurate. The estimate made for expenditure for 1950-51 was £94,255,653.  That does not include certain Supplementary Estimates brought in after this book was published.  It includes some of them but there were still some to come. £90.4 million was the actual expenditure, as appears in the table in connection with the Financial Statement of 1952, leaving a difference of £3.8 million.  That is practically £4,000,000 and it comes to over £4,000,000 if one takes into account the Supplementary Estimates brought in subsequently.  Of course the whole purpose of that proceeding was obvious.  It was an attempt again to suggest that Deputy McGilligan was dishonest, that his colleagues were dishonest, that they were attempting to defraud the public and ran for cover to a general election.  It was also an attempt to make the case that there was that big gap between expenditure and revenue which required <Col N="1462" /> and called for the cruellest possible imposition of taxes as a necessity. I referred to this matter also. Everybody knows in connection even with trading accounts that at the end of the financial year when the business accounts are being made up there is room and proper room for discretion as to what will be brought into course of payment during the year, what debts will be paid, what debts will be left over, what debts will be collected and what debts will be left for collection during the year.  In the same way exactly or almost exactly with public finance, it is well known that the Minister for Finance can either anticipate or postpone expenditure and also determine the degree of receipts. I would like the Minister for Finance to tell the House how much money was held on the closing day of the financial year in this year in the various departments of the revenue which was not paid into the Exchequer. We have referred to £1.9 million or £2,000,000 which was to carry over.  What became of that? What carry-over was allowed this year?</P>

      <P>I have dealt in fair detail with the provision for overestimation. I think that the particulars I have already given justify the charge that there is at least £2,000,000 which should not be imposed this year. I have given more details now than I gave on the last occasion.  I suggest that not merely will these charges be unanswered but that they are unanswerable. The people will resent <Col N="1463" /> that, those people who have to pay more for their bread, more for every essential commodity they consume, and even those people who have to pay taxes on what might be termed luxuries, although the Minister does not know what a luxury is&mdash;beer, tobacco, and all those things.  They will resent having to pay an additional burden.  That sum of £2,000,000 is there which should not be there and they will resent being asked to pay additional taxation to meet it.</P>
      <P>Also in the course of the remarks I made during the discussion on the General Resolution of the Budget I referred to reserve stocks, and I want to deal with this matter very shortly. In the tables issued in connection with the Financial Statement, 1952, it is clearly set forth in item 3 of Table 1 that the provision for reserve stocks is £1.8 million.  That figure is deducted in the expenditure item but there is also a separate figure in that column of expenditure, voted capital services, item 4.  The Minister, in his speech introducing the Budget at column 1131, gave figures for reserve stocks £1.1 million, the figure I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He admitted by the manner in which it was set out in his speech that it was an item appropriate to capital services.  I presumed, when I was making my speech on the occasion of the discussion on the General Resolution, that it was proper policy to make the provision for reserve stocks in the circumstances that existed last year.  I presumed that that policy would be continued.  I know it has been continued. It is true that provision is made throughout the Estimates for the various Departments for those reserve stocks.  Scattered throughout the Book of Estimates and included in the £94.8 million for public services for the financial year 1952-53 is some sum of money for reserve stocks.  I presumed, as £1.8 million was a proper figure for reserve stocks last year and, in particular, as £1,000,000 was not capable of being spent because goods could not be got, that that proper and prudent policy would be continued and that the same figure would appear somewhere for reserve stocks in the Estimates for the various Departments this year. <Col N="1464" /> What was the ministerial reaction to that suggestion?  Did we get any reasoned argument to refute my suggestion or to show that the reasoning behind it was unsound?  We did not. With the table of the Financial Statement, 1952, in front of him, the Tánaiste said, according to Volume 130, column 1293 of the Official Reports of the 3rd April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I could not follow Deputy Costello in his reference to deductions from the cost of supply services in respect of reserve stocks. May I say that the cost of each of the supply services has been accurately calculated and there has been deducted from that cost every item of expenditure which Deputy McGilligan last year chose to describe as capital investment? There is, therefore, no element in that sum which could be so described and, in so far as any expenditure is contemplated upon reserve stocks in this year and that expenditure could legitimately be described as an investment, then the amount has been deducted in calculating the bill which the taxpayer has to meet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was confused.  He tried to make the case that the reserve stocks were in the Vote for capital services, although he had in front of him the table of the financial statement, showing that the item for reserve stocks was in a separate number in the expenditure side of the table from voted capital services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Ryan, speaking on this matter in Volume 130, column 1527 of the Official Reports of the 4th April, 1952, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Costello went on then to talk of £1.9 million and he spoke of reserve stocks.  I cannot quite make out what he had in mind....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he proceeded to show that he had not the remotest idea what the point was, and was merely confused. He gave the whole show away when he very suitably remarked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At any rate, I will leave the matter at that because I do not know <Col N="1465" /> enough about it to deal with it further.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said that he would leave the matter at that because he did not know enough about it.  That was his contribution to the debate.</P>
    <P>The next contribution we had was from the Taoiseach.  Speaking at Volume 130, column 218, of the Official Reports of the 23rd April, 1952, the Taoiseach dealt with this matter in a very unilluminated fashion.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The next point Deputy Costello dealt with was that there should be £1.8 million for reserve stocks as there was in the previous Budget. He did not condescend to tell us why the provision this year for stocks should be precisely the same as last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach showed by that statement that he had not the remotest idea what the point was.  My point was not that the provision for reserve stocks should be the same this year, but that this year there was no provision for reserve stocks.  Nobody else dealt with the matter, as far as I can find out, and it was left at that. Though the Minister for Finance dealt with some of my allegations at very great length, he never said a single word about this point.  We heard the Tánaiste saying that he did not understand it; we heard the Minister for Social Welfare saying: &ldquo;I will leave the matter at that because I do not know enough about it to deal with it further&rdquo;; we heard the Taoiseach making the wrong point, and the Minister for Finance, in his two and a half hours' speech, completely ignoring this point.  At that time there must have been some notion about what it was all about.  We are entitled to say and the people will assume that the facts I have referred to clearly demonstrate that there is an admission of the validity of the argument I made that £1,000,000 should be allocated for reserve stocks.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his final oration on the Budget, made great play with what, I think, he called my fraudulent misuse <Col N="1466" /> of the table explanatory of the current Budget.  The point I am dealing with is a reference to the item £1,000,000 which we say is unexplained and overestimated for in connection with social services and other current services. The Minister said that if I wished to be honest and truthful, thereby implying that I was neither honest nor truthful, I would have read out this phrase, &ldquo;other current services&rdquo;, which was before every Deputy's eyes and which was in every Deputy's hands in connection with the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said in the debate this year and in past years on the subject of dialects.  Dialects vary as much in England as they do in Ireland.  The dialects in the English language in England vary just as much, possibly more, than do the dialects in Irish here. They vary, I think, much more in pronunciation and even in the particular words used. But there is this difference, that speakers of the various dialects in Britain will understand a speaker of standard English in England.  It was a little bit disturbing to me to hear a native-speaking Deputy confess that he did not understand some of the matter from the Minister's opening speech.  It all points to the necessity for establishing a literary standard in Irish that would be applicable to the whole country.</P>
      <P>Again, I do not think we will make very great progress until we have uniform spelling throughout the country in Irish.  I know it is a thorny question, and it would be very hard to find agreement on that spelling, but until it is done and until our textbooks have standard spelling in them and are circulated through the whole country, we will not have that progress in Irish which we all hope for.  After all, if an Englishman can read at all, no matter what his dialect may be, he will understand the ordinary journals, newspapers, racing news, athletic news and so on, published in various journals and newspapers.  That cannot be said for those who leave our schools at the end of their course. Very often in the same school you have in one class teaching Irish a native speaker, we will say, from Donegal; in another class a native speaker from the West; in another class a native speaker from Cork or Kerry; and I assure you it is a great mix-up for the poor children who pass through such a school.  I believe it is absolutely necessary to set a literary standard and, above all, to have a standard spelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> If such standards were established it would be much easier for children in the various districts.  If children in a particular Gaeltacht did not understand certain words it would become necessary to explain what they meant and they would gain in that way a good standard vocabulary.</P>
    <P>A good deal of what I say with regard to Irish applies to English.  We should have a standard set of textbooks in our schools.  There should not be that constant chopping and changing that we are having in the schools.  When boys finish school and go out into life they should be able to look back and visualise the set of books.  That was possible in the old days when the old Board of Education was in command.  There is no doubt that the children who had attended throughout the various standards and left after completing the full primary course were able to enjoy an ordinary story, read an ordinary novel, read the newspapers, and so on.  That is scarcely the case to-day, and I think that the want of a standard set of texts and, above all, standard spelling in Irish, is largely responsible for that.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years I feel the Department made a mistake in trying to teach the Irish language outside the Gaeltacht as if it were a living language.  In 99 per cent. of the Dublin households and of the households throughout the country outside the Gaeltacht areas, Irish is not the language of the home.  It would not be quite true but it would be nearly true to say that it is as dead a language in this country as French or German.  Still, for a number of years we had the teachers encouraged to speak Irish all the time, if possible, to teach as many subjects as possible in Irish, and I am afraid the result was very bad.</P>
    <P>We have got away from that policy now but when it was in operation a great deal of harm was done.  In those years the emphasis was put too much on the oral side and the result was that the children left school unable to handle an ordinary school textbook, to enjoy a novel, to read the Irish news written in Irish or any other news written in Irish.  If we had standard <Col N="1469" /> textbooks, if outside the Gaeltacht Irish were more canalised for the matter contained in those textbooks, and if you had a set of books dealing with the main aspects of town and country life and had a vocabulary built up, by the time a boy would have finished his primary course he would be able to face an ordinary story-book or novel, read ordinary news provided, of course, it was written in the spelling that he had learnt in school.  That is not the case.  I do not believe it ever will be the case until we have a uniform set of textbooks.</P>
    <P>I believe that for English also we should have uniform textbooks so as not be chopping and changing year after year.  It very often happens that a boy has to spend two years in the one class.  Would it not be much better for him to have the same textbook for the second year?  If he is kept back for a second year, he must be either dull or have a bad attendance record. He would profit far more by going over the same textbook a second time.</P>
    <P>If we had a uniform set of textbooks for Irish, a boy who would finish the whole primary course would be very well equipped with a good and useful Irish vocabulary for dealing with ordinary matters.  When a boy leaves a primary school outside the Gaeltacht he goes to a family where Irish is not spoken.  His friends and his fellow workers do not speak Irish.  Is it any wonder that that boy or young man loses his Irish?  I hold that he could keep that knowledge alive if he had gone through a course covering the various aspects of city and town life in standard Irish.  I know it is a difficult thing to solve because it is extraordinary how bigoted, if you like to use the word, the speakers in the various Gaeltacht areas are with regard to the Irish in other places.</P>
    <P>Tributes have been paid to the officials in the Education Department and I should like to add my tribute.  I suppose that during my time I have dealt with dozens and dozens of inspectors. I found nearly all of them excellent.  I had the feeling that they were working for the betterment of education.  There were possibly two exceptions out of a great number, but it is true that the exception proves the <Col N="1470" /> rule.  Apart from the inspectorial staff, we invariably were treated with courtesy and consideration in the Department itself, and I am very glad to pay my tribute to the courtesy and consideration we always received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary reason for my intervention in this debate is that I feel the time has come for a rather comprehensive analysis of our general approach to education.  I have heard contributions from teachers and from people with a deep-seated interest in education all varying in their approach to the multiple problems, whether the problem of the Irish language or what the school curriculum should be.  I want to put the question fairly to the House for consideration whether we are not building a completely unwieldy educational system in the country.  In the main, it is a distinct carry-over.  We must ask ourselves the question whether in a very small country such as ours, particularly when we are facing dwindling rural populations and falling school averages, we are not a little bit overambitious in having a system that allows for at least three, possibly more, hierarchies of teachers.  We have as separate entities the national teachers, the secondary teachers, about whom I shall have a lot to say later on in regard to question of salary, and the vocational teachers.  Is it not time we asked ourselves the rational question whether it is not possible to integrate the three, particularly when dealing with the problem of rural education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pleas are being made for technical schools of various types.  It is true that an extended type of vocational education is necessary for the big centres of population.  But has anybody asked himself the fundamental question: what is the basic amount of vocational training required by the average rural student, whether male or female, to give him or her a substantial preparation for an avocation within a rural existence?  We hear of the tremendous work that is being done by technical schools with their varied and enlarged curricula, but to my mind the problem that the Minister or some of his successors will have to face is the finding of a solution whereby he can get a reasonable vocational education <Col N="1471" /> system integrated with the national school system.</P>
    <P>If we are practical, we must face the fact that the vast majority of the people of this country do not go beyond the national school and get no higher educational certificate than the primary school-leaving certificate.  The opportunities afforded to people to continue their education, even by way of technical training, are very limited.</P>
    <P>We must admit that boys attending the national school in a rural district would benefit greatly from a rudimentary knowledge of rural science and husbandry.  The ordinary young girl attending a national school in a rural district is a potential farmer's wife and a potential housekeeper, and for her a knowledge of the rudiments of cooking and of the dietetic value of various types of vegetables would be a great help.  To my mind, it should not be an insurmountable difficulty to corelate the teaching of these subjects with the national school curriculum and it would give a reasonably useful education to the student attending a rural national school.  It would go a long way towards arresting, at one of its sources, the flight from rural Ireland. Much of the labour and drudgery incidental to Irish farming to-day can, I believe, be removed entirely or ameliorated by a knowledge of better and improved methods of farming.  I do not think that the place to impart that knowledge initially is in the agricultural colleges or the universities.  I believe that we must find a system at the national school level to enable that education to be given.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that this country is big enough for the division of our education into groups&mdash;the national school, the secondary school, the vocational school and, subsequently, the university.  I believe the time has come for exploration on the basis of conceiving a system of education that would be of benefit to our own peculiar requirements and that the time has well passed for imitation of any other system.  I heard Deputy Giles talk of building an extra room to our national schools for the purpose of certain technical and vocational training.  I believe <Col N="1472" /> we must start by equipping the trained teacher to impart the rudiments of those subjects which, in our judgment, we consider to be of value in our own circumstances.  When we have achieved as competent a system as possible for the training of the young minds in our country, we might find the wherewithal to give the teacher a salary worthy of his occupation. I am not one of those who begrudge the teacher a decent salary or a decent standard of life.  With the parents, teachers are responsible for training the minds of the young of this country and I believe that teachers should be treated on a par with that responsibility.  The more a teacher is respected the more he will respect himself and, as a deliberate consequence, the more respect he will merit in a community which, only now, is beginning to accord a reasonable amount of the respect which the teaching profession deserves.</P>
    <P>Tremendous work is being done by national teachers throughout the country. In view of the fact that the vast majority of the people of this country have not an opportunity of going beyond the national school, I feel that the Department of Education should turn its mind to the matter of domestic economy training for girls and a rudimentary training in rural science for boys who attend national schools in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of secondary teachers.  Is it possible to expedite whatever award these teachers are entitled to, or can the Minister devise some system of giving an interim grant or a rise to these people who are suffering from a considerable amount of financial strain, and who are awaiting with impatience the award which will ultimately be given to them?  Part of the pay problem of the teachers has been solved: the remaining part is not very considerable.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Seán Flanagan on the question of pensioned teachers.  He approached the matter in a very frank way, though I do not agree with the argument which he adduced.  For the small amount of money which is involved, and in view of the fact that it is a diminishing <Col N="1473" /> charge on the Exchequer, I urge the Minister to endeavour to meet the demands of these people, and to be as elastic as he possibly can in respect of the fixing of the date.  The Minister knows as well as I do, and as well as any teacher listening to me now knows, that the burden of the complaint of the pensioned teacher rests fundamentally on the gratuity problem.  It would be only one real payment, and it would mean the removal of a constant source of irritation, not only to himself but to all the Deputies of this House who feel that in many cases the pensions on which these teachers are now trying to exist are not a dole, as Deputy Butler said, but merely an existence pittance. I realise that it is easy for us who are in opposition to make that claim.  However, I make that claim now as I made it when I supported the inter-Party Government in the honest belief that these people's grievance should be satisfied.  I have made that appeal in other circumstances in relation to other sections of the community.  Where it is a non-recurring charge, and where it is a tribute that this House might pay to people who have given immense service to this country, I feel we should strain ourselves a little in order to ensure that our appreciation of their effort will be translated into concrete reality.  We should not fail to appreciate the contribution which many of our retired teachers made to the development of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be a very positive, a very forthright and a very assertive type of man when he gets the bit between his teeth.  I ask him to take it between his teeth now and to make a fight for the £80,000 or £90,000 that will be involved to settle that problem once and for all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Duighneáin might serve his purpose infinitely better if he refrained from futile interjections which are not conducive to elevation of the standard of thought or debate or, indeed, conducive to improved decorum in the House.  Not even Deputy Ó Duighneáin is going to stop me from advancing an argument in which I have a personal and sincere belief.  I have made this claim fearlessly and asserted it from both sides of the House.  I hope that when Deputy Ó Duighneáin finds himself on this side of the House he will have the courage to be as assertive as he is over there.</P>
      <P>I want to say that tributes to ex-teachers by members of the House are completely idle unless they are accompanied by a sincere effort, on the part of the individuals paying them, to advance the cause of these ex-teachers in some way.  It may well be that I shall never see their claims satisfied, but one thing certain is that, as long as I am a member of this House, I shall never do anything to prevent their satisfaction.  I hope, when the hour of reckoning comes, that that can be said of all of us who are interested in the problem.  I do not think that, in a situation where millions of pounds are being raised for this, that and the other thing, and where a Minister can nonchalantly cast aside a revenue of £140,000, which was being received from the dancing tax, we are entitled to deny the claims of the unfortunate pensioned ex-teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I believe the whole range of education is being dealt with on this Estimate, I want to diverge slightly from the national schools and secondary schools to the vocational schools and, possibly, subsequently to <Col N="1475" /> phases of university education.  I think that the technical school has filled a tremendous want.  In highly populated areas it is of immense benefit to the type of boy who, anxious to further himself in life, does his day's work and then tries to improve the quality of his work and the knowledge that is the basis of his work by presenting himself for instruction at the technical school in the evening.  I think I am justified in saying to the Minister that there is not, at the moment, particularly in the City of Dublin, adequate facilities for that type of boy.  The classes, through no fault of the teachers, are becoming too big, and the accommodation in many schools is becoming inadequate.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to that because I feel that he, as one appreciative of the efforts of the boy who wants to improve not only his own standard of life and his own capacity but also to play his part in uplifting his family generally, will see that every opportunity is given to that type of boy.  I would ask him to have investigations made with a view to supplying the wants that have arisen, particularly in the Dublin area.  To attain that high standard of development to which an ambitious boy of character who believes in himself can rise is a wonderful achievement for both student and teacher.  I think that any demands made on the Minister's Department for improved equipment or for extra or special instructors should be met immediately because I have the honest belief that the type of boy who is prepared to work during the day, and to work hard and patiently at night, to ameliorate his own lot deserves the best that any Minister or any Department can give him.</P>
    <P>It is true that for a time this growth in technical education had been viewed with a typical Irish conservatism.  For a time the technical schools were looked at a bit askance, but that period of growing pains is over and now, in ever increasing numbers, more boys and girls are seeking all the advantages the technical education can offer to them.  I have already said that <Col N="1476" /> technical education in its broadest and widest sense will necessarily be concentrated in the large centres of population.  I would ask the Minister, where complaints arise, to ensure as quickly as possible the supply of absolutely adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>I wondered and I still wonder, in relation to the Young Farmers' Clubs throughout the country, whether there is not something of educational potential there.  I wonder if the Minister could find any use in his Department for the number of young men who have spent many months of investigation into various types of exploratory work in America.  It seems rather queer to me that since these boys were selected out of a tremendous number of contestants by Macra na Feirme to provide an exchange of views, ideas and experience and to enter in a deliberate way into another system of agriculture, whatever experience and knowledge they have acquired cannot be in some way used for the benefit of rural communities. I think they might present a pool of instructors of a certain type that might appeal to the Minister for use in some scheme of a lecture a week or a lecture a fortnight for farmers around the country.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are inclined to build our educational system not on the needs of our people but rather on systems that we have known or a system that we have adopted and carried on and gradually made our own. We have had 30 years of self-government. A tremendous amount of work has been done by the Department of Education and we have had very many brilliant men holding the seat the Minister now occupies.  I think I can say in fairness to the Minister that as sane a man as ever took the seat we have in the Minister himself.  I must comment favourably on the forthright manner in which he came to grips with one of the worst problems we have in rural Ireland to-day and in the national schools system, the constantly occurring eyesores of semi-decadent national schools.  I admire&mdash;and I say so freely &mdash;the assertive and aggressive type of attack on that problem that the Minister has launched.  I have always admired the Minister's forthrightness. <Col N="1477" /> I think he is, in this particular problem, taking the line that I would like him to take with regard to some other problems in education.  It is a serious problem.  It is one that is militating against the best interests of everybody. The parents are not happy to send children to bad schools; the teachers are terribly unhappy teaching in them; and the atmosphere is certainly, in those circumstances, not the best possible one for educational purposes. I wish him luck in that problem.  If he can put a bit of speed into the Board of Works he is one of the best men that I know of.  In the main, our problems with regard to schools in the country have been met reasonably by the Department of Education and they have had to wander through the devious ways that finance can make in the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, in reply, to deal with the general problem as to when we are likely to have this new university that we envisage in Dublin, and when we are likely to put university education on a different basis.  I am not going to weary the House on that subject.  I spoke at length and gave my considered point of view when we were dealing with the Supplementary Estimates for the universities.  I would like to know if progress is being made towards the drawing up at least of the sketch plan of the new residential university we have in mind.</P>
    <P>Taking the broad field of education generally, I think we in this House can accord tremendous credit to the Department of Education.  There are many facets of education that need more close analysis.  I wonder whether the time has not arrived for a comprehensive investigation into our fundamental educational needs.  I wonder whether the time has not come to stop the growth of what I describe as the cram system.  We have too many schools too interested in results to be good educators, and we have too many children, boys and girls, concentrating with all their energy on success in examination B or C to have any real education at the end of it.  I wonder whether the time has not come for a revision of the system with regard to the various types of grants.  We know that there are large schools&mdash;I have <Col N="1478" /> had experience of a number of very large Christian Brothers' schools and colleges&mdash;where you have segregation of selected pupils, where you have tremendous attention and extra time devoted to the potential scholarship winner, to the potential good result getter, whereas the students not so fortunate find that, while there is no neglect, at least there is little enthusiasm.  I think that is a problem that must be faced.  We are getting too many people turned out, educated maybe to the extent of passing certain types of examinations, be they clerkships for this or that, or be they for the minor grades of the Civil Service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The substitute that will have to be offered is that some means other than purely examinations will have to be found for selecting the candidates.  We know that by examinations alone you will not get the best type of person.  What the alternative effectively could be I frankly do not know, but I think that the Department of Education, with its particular background and its knowledge, having been postulated the question, might be able to find an infinitely better solution than I can.  I am directing, as I feel it is my duty to direct, the attention of the Minister and his Department to a weakness in the present system.  I do so, not in any spirit of criticism but in a spirit of inquiry in the hope that we may be able to find some effective solution to the problem.  I have had experience of the system.  I got the tar knocked <Col N="1479" /> out of me by the Christian Brothers when working for examinations.  There must be a solution to the problem somewhere.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister luck in his job. On any occasion when I have made reasonable representations to him in relation to the problems of my constituents, such as the transport of school children, school attendance and matters relating to the Gaeltacht district of my constituency he has always met me in a very reasonable way.</P>
      <P>I believe that something has gone radically wrong in recent times in connection with the revival of Irish.  I do not know whether or not the present situation is due to an absence of that voluntary effort and spirit of enthusiasm that once existed.  Indeed, I have a word of condemnation for myself in this respect.  I often wonder why it is that an individual like myself, who was once able to think and speak fluently in the Irish language, now finds himself rather hesitant and busy trying to translate through thinking solely in English.</P>

      <P>I shall not be uncharitable to the Deputy.  Where does the solution of our present difficulty lie?  The blame cannot be laid upon the teachers.  Indeed, I am sure that the blame is our own.  There are too many of us&mdash;and again I go back to the cramming system&mdash;who learned a bit too much too quickly and forgot it far too easily.  I feel that the solution to aithbheochaint na Ghaeilge lies in the reawakening of the people's enthusiasm. We must have voluntary co-operation together with a regeneration of the fierce pride that once existed in reviving our language coupled with the fierce urge for freedom.  I think that is the only hope of providing a lead towards a revival of the language.  I feel we do not use the language often enough here.  Even if we falter or become stuck for a word, we should nevertheless make the effort.</P>

      <P>On previous occasions here I have tried to convince the Minister of the absolute necessity for appointing a caretaker to look after the heating and cleaning of our primary schools in the rural areas.  In the Book of Estimates this year a sum of £63,000 is provided for that purpose. The amount provided last year was also £63,000.  Those who are connected with the schools say that this sum is totally inadequate.  The Minister believes that the care of the schools should rest in the hands of the people themselves.  He is reluctant to have complete State control of the schools and believes that such a control should be left to the managers and the people concerned.  Perhaps the Minister is right in that attitude.  Perhaps too much State control is a bad thing. Since he is determined to continue on the present course and since there is as yet no other alternative, what will be done?</P>
      <P>Seemingly it is now up to the people themselves to find some method of supplementing this Estimate of £63,000 in order to provide a caretaker, or some person other than children, to look after the heating and the cleaning of the schools.  It is very unhealthy to have the youngsters cleaning the school premises after school hours. We all know the quantity of dust that accumulates in these establishments and how injurious that is to the health of the children who are required to spend a couple of extra hours cleaning up the premises.</P>
      <P>Since the Government and the Minister will not increase the amount of money, it is now up to the people in charge of the schools and those concerned with them to come to the rescue.  I would suggest a local committee of the parents working in conjunction with the manager which would raise the sum necessary to appoint a caretaker and thereby end this shocking system of expecting the children to clean the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the numbers of young nuns and priests who leave this country and found schools successfully <Col N="1481" /> in pagan lands without any State assistance, one wonders whether those of us who remain at home have any courage left at all to face up to our responsibilities.  I am afraid we are losing some of our pride in our country.  Now that the Minister is determined not to take over complete control of the schools, the people will have to do something about the present situation.  I do not believe an appeal was ever made to the Irish people to which there was not a ready response, and if such an appeal is made now in this connection, I am sure they will respond in the same way as they do to appeals for our churches. Some appeal will have to be made to them to induce them to supplement the amount allocated by the Minister in order to pay for a caretaker in schools in rural areas.  I do not think the services of such a person would be very costly.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the revival of Irish.  When we were young we were all very enthusiastic about the language, and I sometimes wonder why it is that, nowadays, with all the facilities that have been made available by successive Governments, everybody is not an Irish speaker.  I believe the parents are to blame for the present situation.  There are parents who seem to think that the learning of Irish is a punishment inflicted on their children, and one will even hear people saying that Irish is being forced down the throats of the children.</P>
    <P>I think the teachers will agree that the children have no difficulty in learning the language.  It is about the easiest subject on the school programme which they can take up.  In my opinion, if the children were encouraged in their own homes by their fathers, and especially by their mothers, to love the language and to respect it they would do so.  They should not be discouraged by their parents, even though they are not Irish speakers themselves.  They should give every encouragement to the children to love the language, to respect it and to be proud of it, and to be proud, too, of the reputation of our country for culture and for learning generally.  If <Col N="1482" /> that is not the present position, then I think it is the fault of the home.  From time to time we read letters from parents to the effect that their children are being harassed because they have to learn Irish.  To me that is ridiculous, and until we get away from that type of shoneenism which, I am sorry to say, is as prevalent in Ireland to-day as it was in the days when the British were here, we will never make this an Irishspeaking country, nor can we say that we are proud of our country</P>
    <P>I am sure there is no member of the House who would like it to be said of him that he was not courageous or proud of the native language.  Yet, there are so many here who are ashamed to speak the Irish language although they know it.  It is no credit to any young man or woman who has Irish to come to this House and say that they cannot speak Irish, think in Irish or say what they want to say in Irish, despite the fact that they were taught Irish in school.  I think they should be ashamed to confess that.</P>
    <P>We must look, therefore, to the young people who are now acquiring a knowledge of Irish at school to transmit a knowledge of it to their children when they become fathers and mothers.  If they fail to do so they will be lacking in their duty to themselves, to their God and to their country.  I trust that all this talk to the effect that the fault is due to the teachers for forcing the language on the children will cease. I firmly believe that the fault is due to the parents of the children. If they cannot encourage their children to speak Irish, well at least they should not discourage them from speaking it. That, I am afraid, is what many people are doing.  Of course, we know some people say that if their children were to speak Irish it would spoil their accents.  That is more of the shoneenism that we have to-day.  I am afraid that I am repeating myself, so I shall pass on to another matter.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the Minister in regard to women teachers who have to resign on marriage.  I think that is a very bad rule and that it was a very unjust one to make in the case of the girls who were in training colleges at the time it was introduced. It certainly should not <Col N="1483" /> apply to them and they should be allowed to hold their schools on marriage.  When they entered the training colleges in 1933 or 1934 they were not aware that this rule was about to be brought in.  Therefore I do not think it is fair to penalise them and in all fairness it should be removed in their cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted in his introductory speech that there was a shortage of women teachers.  In my opinion the operation of this rule is undoubtedly the cause of that.  Who could better understand children than a married woman teacher who is rearing a family of her own?  Before this rule was introduced we had many married teachers in this country, and it is universally agreed that they not only reared excellent families themselves but that they did the two jobs equally well.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the operation of that rule and cancel it if at all possible.</P>
    <P>My attention has been called to some subjects which many people believe ought to be taught in the rural schools. There is, for instance, nature study, a knowledge of plants and trees and an appreciation of the beauties of the countryside.  To-day, the position is that many children in the rural areas do not know one tree from another. In the old days that was not so at all. The children in those days knew every tree that grew along the boreens, the lanes and the highways in their parish. Perhaps even one hour a week could be given for instruction to the children in such subjects as horticulture and vegetable growing.  I do not mean instruction on agriculture on a big scale because that would not be possible in the time at the teacher's disposal. But at least one hour a week might be allotted for instruction such as I suggest. It would help to arouse their interest in the countryside and would be an encouragement to them to do something themselves in a small way as regards the growing of vegetables and flowers, thus helping to beautify their own homes.  With these few remarks I hope that the Minister, with his big heart, will reconsider the Department's attitude towards the women <Col N="1484" /> teachers by allowing them to marry, if they get the chance, and of holding their schools at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this Estimate relates almost entirely to the subject of vocational education in rural areas or, perhaps, I should say to the lack of facilities for vocational education in the remote rural areas.  I thoroughly agree with what Deputy Palmer said that, in those parts of the country, the children have no opportunity of availing of the vocational or technical training that is at the disposal of children in the urban areas.  I appreciate the reason for that.  I am sure it would mean a big financial undertaking to provide technical or vocational schools all over the country.  I think that an opportunity presents itself now of overcoming that difficulty.  It is a regrettable fact that in many of the rural national schools the attendance has fallen as compared with former years.  As a result of that diminishing attendance, we have a vacant room at the present time in a great number of our national schools. I think there is hardly a county or a parish in which that is not the position. My suggestion is that the Department should avail of that accommodation to provide technical training in the rural areas, and see to it that itinerant teachers would utilise these rooms for that purpose.  I think it was hardly fair that, from the beginning, all these vocational schools should have been erected in the towns.  It would have been fairer, in my opinion, if they had been erected at the crossroads rather than in the main street of a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been lamented by many persons over a long number of years that our people are turning against life on the land, that they are leaving the land and going into the towns.  I wonder if that could be traced to the fact that a number of these country boys and girls go into the vocational schools in the towns, witness there all the amenities of town life which are so sorely lacking in their home areas, and then become so discontented with their homes that they determine that at whatever cost they are not going to <Col N="1485" /> live their lives on the land.  I think that explains, in some way or other, their present attitude to life in the country. That is an attitude which, I think, could be overcome in the manner that I have suggested.  Furthermore, as a school building scheme is now being embarked upon, I suggest that accommodation should be provided in each new primary school for vocational education. In my own county, where it is contemplated to erect two or three new schools in areas where there are no facilities for vocational education, I think that the opportunity of doing what I suggest should not be missed. Such accommodation could be provided at a fairly inconsiderable cost.</P>
    <P>I also think that vocational education could be extended by making use of the accommodation that is available in halls.  In Roscommon, one enterprising parish priest, in the parish of Moore, erected a very fine hall.  He made provision in it for an extra large room which he then offered at a nominal rent as accommodation for instruction in vocational education.  The result has been that the people in that area who hitherto lived at a considerable distance from vocational schools are now getting a vocational training as good as that provided in any vocational school in the country.  I know that at the present time there is a tendency to erect more and more halls throughout the country.  The people erecting them should be approached, I suggest, to make accommodation available for the giving of vocational education.  If that were done it would help to remove the disability which so many people in the country labour under at present in the way of being denied the opportunity of getting any vocational training whatever.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if we are getting mixed up in our terms with regard to vocational education.  In my opinion, we would be more precise if we used the term technical education. If we really had vocational schools, as I understand the term, it would be the duty of the teachers to observe the natural bent of the pupils and to develop it.  As it is, there is nothing of that type.  There is merely a certain specified curriculum.  Therefore, it is <Col N="1486" /> more precise to describe it as technical education.</P>
    <P>Whether it is called technical education or vocational education, it is a form of education which has been sadly neglected in the past.  Steps are being taken now to remedy the situation.  No opportunity should be lost to expand this type of education to the utmost.  In this country&mdash;indeed we are not alone in this respect&mdash; there is a terrible lack of ability on the part of boys and girls to use their hands.  There has been a growing inclination to pursue occupations in which only the fountain pen need be used.  Clerical jobs make a special appeal.  That is not good.  It should not be the object of vocational schools to prepare pupils for any particular career.  Their object should be to impart a wide knowledge in the use of the hands to the best possible advantage. Manual instruction is bound to result in good citizenship and would help to make citizens worthy of the State, who would be of benefit to the State in some way.  When I think along these lines I am always reminded of the German people.  No matter what career a German boy may follow, no matter how he may be tossed about on the tide of life, he is always able to make a livelihood by his hands.  If we could get our boys and girls instructed in that way we would ensure that none of them would be hewers of wood and drawers of water in a foreign land.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in regard to vocational education on which the Department must come to a decision, as it is creating a certain amount of trouble and will create more trouble. I refer to schools on the borders of counties, schools erected in one county at which pupils from another county attend.  There seems to be a development of a parochial mentality in regard to this important question.  My view is that education is not parochial or national, but that it is international. There should be no limits to the provision of education in whatever way possible.  We are in a dilemma in Roscommon at the present time. We have a big number of pupils attending Athlone school, and it has now been suggested that the Roscommon <Col N="1487" /> Vocational Education Committee should make a payment to the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee in respect of those pupils, while, on the other hand, we have in Ballaghaderreen and in Boyle schools to which many pupils come from Sligo and Leitrim, and we are not making any such demand.  I want the Minister to know that his Department has shirked responsibility in this matter and has repeatedly referred this question back to the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee and to the Roscommon Vocational Education Committee.  The Department should take a firm stand on that matter and give their decision. Representatives from Roscommon and Westmeath have met on former occasions, and we have even referred the matter to the congress, and no decision has yet been reached.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter and to try to have a definite ruling made in regard to it. It is not unique.  It is a matter that is bound to crop up in every other area.  A clear indication should be given that, whether pupils come from one county to another or not, it is the duty of the vocational education committee in the area to provide instruction for them in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I want to make one remark about the question of the language revival.  I am afraid that a colleague of mine, Deputy Cafferky, was misunderstood by certain Deputies.  If I were a Gaelic enthusiast I would be very disappointed at the progress that has been made with regard to the revival of Irish.  It is not fair to suggest, if a man complains that progress is not being made, that he is indifferent or antagonistic to the language. The contrary might be the case. If a man were not interested at all in the language he would probably ignore the question.  Whether one is an enthusiast or an antagonist in the matter of the revival of Irish, one must admit that the progress that ought to be expected over a period of 30 years has not been achieved.  If a Deputy gets up in this House and points to that fact, I do not think he should be accused of being opposed to the <Col N="1488" /> revival of the language or antagonistic to it in any way.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mrs. Rice on the question of parents.  She made a reference to shoneenism.  As a parent, I want to say that perhaps she is judging the whole question from a wrong standpoint.  Perhaps it is that parents feel embarrassed when their children come from school and want them to instruct them, and the parents are not able to do so.</P>

      <P>I have passed on from Deputy Cafferky now.  I honestly believe that parents are not opposed to the revival of the language at all, but the children, when they come from school, expect the parents to teach them the language, and the parents do not know the language.  It is definitely causing quite a lot of trouble, to put it mildly, at home.  Children wish to know their lessons when they go to school.  They do not want to be worse than their schoolfellows.  Perhaps some parents can help their child at home while other parents cannot do so. If there is opposition in the Irish homes to the revival of the Irish language, it is not because of any dislike of the language as such, but for the reasons I have given.  In the year 1952 I do not think we should use the word &ldquo;shoneenism&rdquo; in this country. Shoneenism is dead, and it will never live again.</P>

      <P>My purpose in intervening in this debate at all is to mention a matter in connection with vocational education to the Minister but I find myself somewhat stimulated by some remarks that have been made, particularly by Deputy Collins, to wander rather farther afield.  Before I do so I want to make the point which was in my mind when I came in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the case, some time <Col N="1489" /> in July, 1948, the Vocational Education Teachers Organisation made some approach to the then Minister. There have been negotiations practically ever since then.  The Minister's predecessor was approached and I understand there has been some approach to the present Minister.  In the meantime the Civil Service arbitration awards applied equally to vocational education teachers but notwithstanding that fact these teachers find themselves at a certain disadvantage.  According to the information available to me, with the exception of exceptional cases the maximum for male vocational teachers would be in the region of £615 per annum, from which 5 per cent. is deducted for pension, and their scales do not compare satisfactorily now with the scales for the teaching profession in its upper branches.  I understand that the Minister's predecessor&mdash;this is my information and I must confess that it is hearsay, but the Minister can easily correct me if I am not accurate&mdash;took the view that the secondary teachers' problem would first have to be solved.  I understand that some agreement was reached on the question of secondary teachers towards the end of last year under the present Minister, and, therefore, there seems to be a reasonable case <i>prima facie</i> for considering the position of these vocational teachers.  Whether the Minister would consider it on the basis of something similar to what was done in the case of secondary teachers or not is a matter which would need to be looked into, but in any event the matter seems to have been rolling for a considerable time and it might, perhaps, be desirable to come to a determination with some speed now. Where it is possible to avoid it it is objectionable to have matters like this outstanding in an uncertain state.</P>
    <P>Following on from that another question arises which, I understand, is of some practical importance in connection with vocational education.  Instructors in certain categories are able to earn considerably more in the practice of the particular trade or subject which they are teaching than they can earn as teachers.  It does not require a second thought to see where that leads us.  If there is a big disparity <Col N="1490" /> between the salary one pays to an instructor or teacher in any particular subject and the amount he can earn otherwise, needless to say these people will move in the direction of higher remuneration.  That means that the pool of really high quality instructors becomes contracted.  That is what one might call an argument from an argument rather than a statement of fact but, on top of that, my information is that that is happening to some extent and, if it is, it is something which would have to be looked into.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made to me &mdash;I accepted it with a certain amount of caution and I offer it here with an equal amount of caution; nevertheless if it is true, it is a serious matter&mdash; that it has been necessary to revise standards in looking for instructors. That, in itself, is an urgent reason why the question of remuneration should be reconsidered.  The question we have to face is: what service can we give; what service can we pay for?  There is always that financial problem in the background but, accepting that financial problem and having to face it, having to trim, as no doubt we will have to trim, our garment to the cloth available, it still should be done in such a way that it will ensure that such service as we can give will be of first-class quality rather than that an attempt should be made to provide something which will tend to give an indifferent service in greater quantity. I ask the Minister to expedite, if he can, a determination of this question.</P>
    <P>Another point is that teachers in other categories can avail themselves of part-time facilities in vocational schools, thereby earning additional remuneration.  There is nothing objectionable in that at all&mdash;at least I do not see it at the moment&mdash;but the point is that the whole-time vocational teacher has no such opportunities.  If he is at a disadvantage in regard to comparative scales, he is at a further disadvantage in this matter also.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but I ask the Minister to expedite the determination of the matter.  There have been, and there will be, more detailed representations made to him, but a number of people interested have asked a number of Deputies not so <Col N="1491" /> much to do something as to find out what is happening, what the position is.</P>
    <P>That, as I said earlier, was the main purpose for which I intervened, but Deputy Collins in his speech referred to education generally and one wonders, listening to the speeches one hears year after year, whether there is not a certain amount of escapism in them.  First, we should realise that nothing is going to be perfect in life, that we are never going to hit the ideal system and that it is an easy way to escape from problems to concentrate exclusively on hypothetical situations. What we have to face is that we have an existing situation and we must ask ourselves what is the situation we think would be the best to have in the circumstances. If that is different from the existing situation, we have further to plan the transition stage, if we decide to go to the better situation.</P>
    <P>That remark is pertinent with regard to the talk of Deputy Collins about examinations.  I do not want to defend examinations as they are, and I do not want to be blinded by any means to the defects that are in a system which selects by means of examination. The examination order will not completely and truly represent the order of merit, but, on the other hand, can anybody suggest, having regard to the needs of the community and the nature of the animal concerned, if you like to put it that way, any rational workable alternative which will be fair, just, give equal opportunities and eliminate as far as possible personal preferences or influences?  Can anyone suggest any other method for testing candidates as to their knowledge and suitability than some system of examination? Admittedly, it is a big improvement that we have had an oral examination or an interview, its equivalent, superimposed on the written examination.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>When I moved <Col N="1492" /> to report progress we were dealing with item No. 4 on the expenditure side of the table explanatory of the current Budget, 1952.  The Minister described my approach towards that item as something savouring of misrepresentation if not of fraud.  Anyone who had read item No. 4 would have come to the same conclusion as I did.  Anyone who is accustomed to considering how financial matters are dealt with in documents knows how necessary it is to indicate the purpose for which a sum is required and for which taxation will become necessary.  I have been accused of leaving out the words &ldquo;and for other current services&rdquo; which follow after the words: &ldquo;Provision for proposals in Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I said, those words were there for anybody to read and everybody had those documents before him.  I assumed that the words &ldquo;and for other current services&rdquo; had some reference to the words that were given before them &ldquo;provision for proposals in Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951,&rdquo; and that the entire item No. 4 had reference to proposals for social welfare and matters in connection with social welfare that might occur during the year. I suppose it is not right in a document of this kind to approach this interpretation in too technical or legalistic a sense, but there is a principle of interpretation of documents which is summarised in the Latin phrase <i>noscitur a sooiis.</i>  In other words, you construe words from the company in which they are found.  The words &ldquo;other current services&rdquo; are found in the context and the company of &ldquo;Provision for proposals in Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951,&rdquo; and I think it would be reasonable to assume that the whole of that item had something to do with social welfare.</P>

    <P>Leaving that aside, I pointed out, in the course of my remarks on the discussion on the General Resolution, that Deputy Dr. Ryan, Minister for Social Welfare, in his speech on the Social Welfare Bill, had shown that the amount that would be required for social welfare under that Bill would be something less than £2,000,000.  The Minister for Finance, in his closing <Col N="1493" /> speech at column 943 of the debate of the 1st May, 1952, says that there would be something less than £2,000,000, namely, about £1,900,000, leaving £1,100,000 of this £3,000,000 in item No. 4.</P>
    <P>What is it for if it is not for social services?  What is that £1,100,000 put in for?  Nobody would know what it meant if it were not for the casual reference of the Minister for Social Welfare in his speech on the Bill dealing with social security measures.  This £2,000,000 is now stated by the Minister for Finance to be £1,900,000.  The position, therefore, appears to be that on that item there is £1,100,000 unaccounted for.  It appears to be the case now, according to the Minister for Finance, that £1,100,000 is unaccounted for and was unaccounted for until we raised the point of what it was for.</P>
    <P>The unfailing practice in connection with Budget proposals and expenditure of money is that where these proposals appear in a document the purpose for which the money is required has to be indicated.  To the present moment nobody knows what that £1,100,000 is required for.  The Budget debate went on for weeks and the Minister concluded the debate without giving the slightest indication of what that money was required for.  That £1,100,000 is, in my submission to the Dáil, a surplus&mdash;part of the surplus I have referred to as being created by these proposals.  Nobody knows what it is for.  The debate that has gone on here is an admission that the £1,100,000 is on the loose.  Nobody knows what it is for.  Nobody has said what it is for.  We are entitled to ask for an explanation of why the traditional practice in connection with items of this character involving the expenditure of public money and the requisition of that money from the taxpayers has been abandoned.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House and demonstrated that the Estimates, as compiled in the Volume of Estimates for the public services for the financial year 1952-53, have been inflated to the amount of £7,500,000.  Here there is a sum of £1,100,000 added to that inflated amount for unspecified services. <Col N="1494" /> Nobody knows what it is for and this Dáil would not have known anything about that £1,100,000 if the point had not been raised.  What is that but a surplus?  In the course of the debate the only indication that was given by any Minister as to what that £1,100,000 was for was by Deputy Dr. Ryan who, I think, said it had something to do with the Housing Bill.  The amount that he put in in connection with housing was only £100,000 to £150,000 to cover an item of £1,100,000 for unspecified purposes.  The very fact that the only item that could be given was for housing is in itself very revealing. It reveals the entire attitude that is behind this Budget.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is correct and if his colleagues are correct in stating that they are taking over our capital programme&mdash;housing forms part of our capital programme&mdash;that £100,000 to £150,000 which the Minister for Social Welfare thought of to cover at least part of the nakedness of the £1,100,000 that was never explained is not payable out of revenue at all.  It is payable out of capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, at columns 1529-30 of the Official Debates of the 4th April, 1952, made some very interesting suggestions.  He says: &ldquo;We speak in millions of £s.&rdquo;  We speak in millions of £s.  We do not bother with merely £100,000 or £150,000. Millions are what we speak in. Millions are what is being asked from the taxpayers.  They speak in millions of £s, but they have got more millions from the taxpayers, and the proof of that is revealed by the fact that the sum of £1,100,000 is unexplained. Through the whole course of this debate nobody has given any precise indication of what that is for except by speaking of millions of £s&mdash; extracted unnecessarily from the taxpayer. He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have £3,000,000 as a cover against Deputy McGilligan's £1,500,000.  There are other contingencies to be provided for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He puts in another suggestion out of the blue, a ridiculous suggestion.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;such as stores.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Stores, of course, are part of the <Col N="1495" /> reserve stocks to which I was referring earlier.  He could not think of anything else, and said &ldquo;such as stores&rdquo;. They should have been provided for in this Book of Estimates or by a separate item, specifically stating what the money was for instead of by this slipshod remark of the Minister's.  He winds up by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am quite sure that the Minister for Finance could give the House a long list of contingencies that are covered by that £1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, however, did not give a list long or short.</P>
    <P>If that £1,100,000 was&mdash;as it was&mdash;an afterthought intended to provide for contingencies that should have been specifically stated in this table explanatory of the current Budget, at least the contingencies should have been indicated either in specific terms or even in a general way.  In the context of this Budget, containing such harsh impositions even on the Minister's own admissions&mdash;indeed even if the Budget were justifiable&mdash;the Minister should have been in a position to say: &ldquo;We have cut down every bit of unnecessary expenditure and we will not raise taxation except for what is necessary.&rdquo;  That £1,100,000 which now appears as an afterthought for contingencies has not been justified, because the Minister and the Government do not know for what it is wanted, and cannot tell us.  Under that head alone £1,100,000 too much taxation is imposed upon the people.  The Minister for Finance is not able to tell us what it is for.  The Minister for Social Welfare took a stab at it and all he could say was &ldquo;such as stores&rdquo; as well as something about houses which are financed more appropriately as capital items than in any other way.  There you have £1,100,000 which should be taken out of this Budget.  In a Budget of this kind which imposes so many hardships it is a big sum.  It could go a long way towards relieving those impositions. If you added the £140,000 which might be taken from the dance hall proprietors you would have a big whack of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent a long while to-day denouncing the tax on dance <Col N="1496" /> halls showing, or purporting to show, that it was an unjustifiable imposition. The fact that the Minister for Finance who, as one of his colleagues in the Government said, speaks in millions, spent a long while speaking of £140,000, reveals how keenly he and his colleagues feel the criticism directed against the relief of the dance hall proprietors.</P>
    <P>It may be that a case could be put forward against the tax on dances; it may be that arguments could be put forward&mdash;as they were, in fact, put forward to Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance by the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;to continue that imposition as it was a source of growing revenue; but in this Budget, where terrible taxes are being imposed, every penny should be saved, and it would be better to save that £140,000 than to increase the price of bread or of other essential commodities.  When you add £140,000 to £1,100,000 you get almost £1,250,000, which should have been used to relieve these unjust taxes. The Minister dealing or purporting to deal with this matter referred in the course of his remarks, in columns 493 and 494 on the 1st May, 1952, to other sums that had been put in by previous Minister for Finance to deal with increases in the supply services, unforeseen increases in supply expenditure or contingencies.  My first comment on those arguments is that they are entirely unrelated to the present item. In the Budget provisions for 1949-50 £670,000 was provided to cover &ldquo;unforeseen increases in supply expenditure&rdquo;, and in the Budget of 1950-51 £600,000 was provided to cover &ldquo;increases in the supply services&rdquo;.  Each of those items was specifically stated and described.  Everybody knew what it was for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are the contingencies stated in item No. 4?  In each of these years they were placed in their context, not under the head of social services, as they were here. Each was stated frankly; the House was told what it was for and I have no <Col N="1497" /> doubt that each was explained in the course of the Budget speech.</P>
      <P>My second comment is that those provisions in those years must be taken in the context of their Budgets just as this figure of £1,100,000, part of the £3,000,000, must be taken in the context of this Budget.  £600,000 is a small amount of money compared with £1,100,000&mdash;only about half.  In the present circumstances there is no question but that the Government should have budgeted only for purposes which could be explained, not for unspecified schemes of expenditure which have not yet occurred to the mind of any single Minister.  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance himself took refuge in the alleged analogy of the £1,500,000 provided last year by Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, as if that were the same type of provision.  In the Budget statement, Deputy McGilligan, on the 2nd May, 1951 (Volume 125, No. 13, column 1887), referred to that £1,500,000 and gave details of why it was to be provided and what it was to be spent upon. Then he wound up as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The £1,500,000 must be regarded as already fully committed and any additional expenditure must entail corresponding increases in taxes or other charges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way in which Deputy McGilligan, this &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; Minister for Finance, as the present Minister for Finance so nicely describes him, approached this problem.  He told the people what he wanted the money for. They knew what they were going to be taxed for, to provide this £1,500,000. But here, at the tail end, there is an item appearing to relate to social services, but whether or not it relates to them, there is a disguised figure of £1,100,000 and, even up to the present, even at the end of the debate when this matter had been raised by me, the Minister spent himself in verbal gymnastics, suggesting fraud against me, instead of giving arguments to answer a charge I had made on reason and on figures.  He can do the same again if he likes, but I have no doubt that the people will realise that it is they who have been tricked by this <Col N="1498" /> £1,100,000, that burden of £1.1 million for unspecified contingencies which the Minister, with the advice of his officials, after weeks of consideration of this matter, is not able to suggest, even in a general way, what they may be.  A sum of £140,000 has been taken off the dance hall proprietors, and so there is £1,250,000 that would be available to relieve taxation.</P>
    <P>Now let me deal with another way in which the Minister tried to confuse this matter.  He had charged his predecessor with dishonesty and fraud.  I will content myself with an understatement of the Minister's speech at the conclusion of the Budget debate, that his statements were confusing and misleading, intended to confuse and designed to cover up the facts. Had I not raised this point, he had not the slightest intention of telling the people what this money was for or even revealing that it was there. Even then, when this was revealed to the public by us, he was not able to deliver a convincing explanation, but he added a horse, a donkey and a dog, and he got a white elephant.  This is the way he did it.</P>
    <P>He commenced by saying that Deputy McGilligan provided last year under this head £1,500,000 and then stated that &ldquo;the actual current expenditure unprovided for in the Budget came to over four times that figure at £6.8 million.&rdquo;  Of course, there is no relation between those two figures and the Minister tried to delude and confuse the public by trying to relate two incomparable figures, two figures that bear no comparison.  £1,500,000 was for specified services which were earmarked, and as Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That £1,500,000 must be regarded as fully committed and any additional expenditure must entail corresponding increases in taxes or other charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The alleged deficit of £6.8 million&mdash;the existence of that, and I say it advisedly, &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; deficit &mdash; was blown sky-high in this House half a dozen times.  But even if it were there it includes our old friend the £2.7 million for fuel subsidies which must <Col N="1499" /> have been a tremendous boon to the Minister for Finance who has used it for all sorts of purposes.  It bobs up all around the place, the £2.7 million for the fuel subsidies for the coal and turf in the Phoenix Park that we got as a <i>damnosa hereditas</i> when we came into office in the year 1948.  It also includes moneys for expenditure that we opposed and would have nothing to do with.  It also includes moneys in the hands of the Revenue Department at the 31st March which we did not know about at the time.  At all events, the &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; deficit is a figure which is not in any way comparable with the figure of £1.5 million which is effected by receipts as well as expenditure.  That is the first series of figures by which he tried to confuse this issue.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that in 1950-51 the sum of £600,000 provided for increases in the Supply Services was insufficient, but that £1.44 million represented the actual excess of expenditure over the original estimate. He refers also to the sum of £676,000 for the other year.  Again he ignores the facts or conceals the facts that any of that increased expenditure in those two years that did come about was all discharged either by savings or economies on the existing public services or by the increased revenue that came in from existing rates of taxes by way of increased revenue.  There was no deficit in any of these years.  All that expenditure was paid off.  You might imagine it was there all the time and never paid, the way the Minister tries to relate those unrelatable figures.  He then adds those three together, and he says at column 944:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we take the last three Budgets of our predecessors, on the average the amount overspent annually on current services was £4,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems that Minister exercised great restraint because instead of budgeting for £1,100,000 he should have budgeted for £3,000,000 more.  Of course, these figures are entirely unrelated and cannot be related to each other; three different things are added up to try to confuse the issue and they have nothing whatever to do with the point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> The inescapable conclusion is that that £1,100,000 is there available supposed to be as we are now told&mdash;by way of afterthought&mdash;for contingencies; yet not one single Minister of the whole Government from the Taoiseach down to the Minister for Finance, who made the last speech, was able to give the slightest indication of what it was for, what the people had been taxed for.</P>
    <P>The next item I referred to was the overcharge for interest.  The only Minister to deal with that item was the Minister for Finance himself and he says in the same Budget speech at column 946, Volume 131 of 1st May, 1952, when he speaks about my use of the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and substitutes the word &ldquo;need&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the new loan is not the only item in respect of which we shall have obligations.  Last year, as I pointed out in the Budget statement &mdash;the reference will be found in column 1131&mdash;the State had to borrow over £35,000,000 exclusive of the Budget deficit of £6.8 million.  Of this sum £9.7 million was for what Deputy Costello and his Coalition colleagues voted as &ldquo;capital services&rdquo;...  It is necessary, accordingly, to set up a corresponding annuity of £501,922, and this amount is, of course, included in the increased provision which we have to make in the current Budget for the service of public debt.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to direct attention to the Minister's statement to the effect that last year over £35,000,000 had to be borrowed.  Of the £35,000,000 which the Minister stated he had to borrow, £9,750,000 consisted of moneys to be voted for capital services.  Provision is made in the Finance Act to amortise that money, and accordingly this year the only provision that need be made is for interest on the difference between that £9,750,000 and the £35,000,000, namely, £25,250,000.  It is significant that the figure of £25,250,000 is the amount borrowed during the year from the Marshall Aid funds.  If there is any interest paid or payable under that borrowing it is paid to the <Col N="1501" /> fund, and it is a book-keeping transaction.</P>
    <P>There is no net charge on the Exchequer in respect of it.  This year we have to pay £600,000 to the United States by way of annuity on the borrowing. The Minister will certainly have to give much more information as regards the explanation for the overcharge in interest than he has already given if he is to refute the charge I made that the modest sum of £500,000 is overcharged by way of interest in respect of that item.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks on the Budget the Minister referred to the tax on wines which we took off and which has been put on again by the present Government.  That surely was a brilliant piece of finance by the then Minister for Finance in 1947.  Perhaps that is what has been repeated this year.  That brilliant piece of finance of putting a tax on wines resulted in the fact that, although there was a greater increase in tax, the revenue was very much less than was achieved from the smaller rate of tax.  That is why the tax had to be taken off.</P>
    <P>In my speech on the General Resolution I dealt with the question of the buoyancy of revenue.  One of my colleagues interrupted me with a derisive observation when I mentioned that there might be a buoyancy of revenue next year.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan has already stated and as I stated myself, we anticipated last year that the buoyancy in the revenue would be £2.8 million. Actually, the buoyancy was £5.6 million&mdash;double the amount we expected &mdash;showing that we were considerably out in our calculations.  Maybe the buoyancy this year will be £5.6 million or maybe the brilliant piece of finance on the part of the Minister's predecessor will be repeated, and these crushing taxes will not even bring in the revenue which the Minister anticipates. In connection with these Budget proposals we are entitled to point to what was achieved during the three years of the inter-Party Government's régime.  During that period the national income increased every year and the revenue showed itself to be more buoyant each year.  We are entitled to say that if that economic <Col N="1502" /> policy was carried out&mdash;a policy which brought into employment an additional 1,000 every month, 12,000 people in a year&mdash;there would be a buoyancy of revenue far more than we even anticipated or suggested.  However, instead of 12,000 people being brought into employment in 12 months, 12,000 people have been put out of employment during the 12 months that the Minister for Finance has held office.</P>
    <P>Such is the contrast between the two policies&mdash;between the policy of the present Government and our policy to which the Minister made scornful references to-day and in the course of his speeches over the last 12 months. The Minister said to-day that our policy resulted in false prosperity.  It did not seem very false to the people who got employment.  The prosperity which the Minister has brought about now is very real to these people who are put out of employment as a result of the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The last item to which I referred was the overcharge in connection with food subsidies.  I said that the saving on those subsidies was underestimated. In the course of his observations on the Budget General Resolution, the Taoiseach gave us a solemn lecture and dealt with what he called: &ldquo;The rate of flow and danger of averages&rdquo;.  That lecture was rather discountenanced when his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, stated that he knew all about butter and butter subsidies, and that the Department of Agriculture will accept the very sensible practice of levying back any subsidy paid either in the form of arrears on butter in stock or on the flow of butter into the creameries before the 1st July.  Therefore, the rate of flow will, in practice, be made not to matter.  In the dissertation which the Minister for Social Welfare gave out of the depths of his knowledge on butter subsidies, one fact clearly emerged: That the calculations that were being made dealing with the results of the butter subsidy depend upon one factor in particular&mdash;the factor that the Government anticipate that there will be a loss on imported butter.  They are making their arrangements here on the basis that they are going to lose on importing New Zealand butter or on any imported butter.  The <Col N="1503" /> taxpayer is going to be taxed for that. Was there ever such nonsense heard in this House that this could be said at a time when the declared policy of this Government is so to arrange their economic affairs and financial impositions as to cause a drying up in consumption and an increase in the price of butter to the consumer so as to decrease consumption of butter?</P>
    <P>It is to be understood from that set of facts that the Government are going to lose money by importing butter from New Zealand and elsewhere.  The fact is that they will make money on imported butter, because they are going to sell it at an economic price and the Government are going to get a profit on top of that.  It is their policy to make the people pay for butter, of which they are consuming too much.  In the course of his speech, Deputy McGilligan dealt with the very point with which I am now dealing, and said that, far from there being a loss on imported butter, there would, in fact, be a profit of somewhere in the order of £400,000.  We are entitled to say, therefore, that there is an overcharge of £400,000 instead of a so-called anticipated loss on imported butter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the flour and bread subsidy, granting the Minister and his colleagues the benefit of every doubt and checking and counterchecking the calculations which I made and gave to the Dáil, and accepting that very absurd assumption which was made by the Tánaiste in the course of his speech at Volume 9, column 1301, on the 3rd April, 1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have assumed that there will be some increase in consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;accepting that extraordinary assumption and giving the Minister the benefit of all the doubts, I will proceed now to demonstrate, having checked my calculations, that almost £1,000,000 more than has been estimated should be saved.</P>

      <P>Obviously Deputy Allen does not understand what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not dealing with the question of subsidies.  I am dealing with the allegation I made that in connection with the provision of taxation more taxation is being got from the people than is necessary, and I am taking up this question of the amount supposed to be saved on the subsidies and showing that there is more to be saved than the Minister says.  Have I satisfied the Deputy's intelligence and shown that I am in order?  I want to show how I arrived at that sum of £1,000,000.  One figure is clear from the course of this debate&mdash;that the total cost of all subsidies prior to this Budget was £15.2 million.  That is the Minister's own figure.  Of course in carrying out the policy which the inter-Party Government carried out of making the rich pay for the poor in connection with these matters of essential foodstuffs we set on foot a scheme for the sale of white bread and, from the proceeds of the sale of white bread, went a certain sum of money in ease of the taxpayer and in ease of the consumer. That in itself was a subsidy, a subsidy paid by the consumers of white flour for the benefit of those people who had to buy rationed flour.  Therefore, the real cost of all subsidies including flour and bread, prior to the Budget, was £15.2 million, plus the amount that came in ease to the Exchequer and the consumer by way of the consumption of white flour.  At <Col N="1505" /> column 212 of the debate of 23rd April, 1952, the Taoiseach gave the amount that was secured as a result of the scheme for the sale of white flour in ease to the consumer and the taxpayer. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The subsidy on white flour in three-quarters of the year is more than £1,000,000.  That is the overcharge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given the figure of £1,000,000 for three-quarters of the year.  Therefore, for the full year it would amount to £1? million.  If you add to the £15.2 million, the cost of all subsidies, £1.3 million you get £16.5 million as the measure of the existing subsidisation.</P>
    <P>We will now come back to the figure on which the Minister for Finance started this debate.  The Minister for Finance values those subsidies at 2/-per head.  That would be reduced by 6d., or one-fourth, on the 1st July. £16.5 million is the total cost of all the subsidies, including what was provided by the consumers of white flour.  Four into £16.5 million gives you £4.1 million, which gives you the cost of the subsidies in a year other than this year.</P>
    <P>The bread and flour subsidies at the most will cost a quarter of £9.28 million, which is the total net Exchequer cost of the bread and flour subsidies for the year.  That figure is taken from the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, as reported in column 1523.  The cost of the bread and flour subsidies for the first quarter of this year is arrived at by dividing £9.28 million by four, which gives you £2.32 million.  That figure is almost certainly excessive, because again the Tanáiste gave us some additional valuable information.  As reported in column 1292 of the debate of 3rd April, he pointed out that the sum of £9.28 million allows for the effect of higher prices for wheat which will only affect subsidies next September because, as he said, we are now eating last year's wheat bought at a lower price.  From 1st July the cost will be at the rate of £4.1 million for a full year.  But we must add the cost of the lower extraction of flour by that scheme introduced <Col N="1506" /> for what reason we do not know except to put an additional burden on the poor.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as reported in column 213 of 23rd April, gave the cost of that lower extraction at £0.3 million, i.e., one-third of £1,000,000, so that the annual cost of the subsidies which will in future be devoted exclusively to bread and flour is £4.4 million for a full year, or £3.3 million for three-quarters of the year.  At the most, therefore, the subsidies will cost for the first quarter of this year £2.3 million and for the remaining three-quarters it will be £3.3 million, a total of £5.6 million.  Deducting that £5.6 million, which is the cost for the whole of this year, from £9.28 million, the figure I have already given, the saving is £3.68 million.</P>
    <P>But, if Deputies will refer again to the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, they will see that it is a mine of information. At column 1526, they will find that the estimated saving on this head is only £2.71 million or a difference of £1,000,000.  There is the £1,000,000 that we found.</P>
    <P>In connection with the matter of £1,000,000 too much being put upon the people and disguised under this subsidy, it must be remembered that the Tánaiste said in the quotation which I have already given that the calculations are made on the assumption of increased consumption of bread.  Is it not absurd to think that, with the tremendously increased cost of bread, there will be an increase in the consumption of bread, particularly when one remembers that the whole justification offered for the change that is being effected by this Budget on the cost of bread and flour is the prevention of waste by raising the price of bread to its economic level and preventing its being fed to animals.</P>
    <P>If instead of an increase in consumption&mdash;which, for the reasons I have given, is exceedingly doubtful&mdash;there is a decrease in consumption because of the increased price of bread and flour and because people will not be able to pay for the same amount of these commodities as hitherto, there will then be <Col N="1507" /> greater saving to the Exchequer.  More than £1,000,000 will, in that event, be saved.  The less that is eaten, from July onwards, the more the Exchequer will save.  That apparently is why the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to rely on the absurd suggestion that the whole of the calculation in respect of the flour and bread subsidy was based on the assumption that there would be increased consumption when there would be an increase in price. The whole desire behind the Budget is to ease down on consumption.  Therefore, between butter, flour and bread, there is, in fact, a demonstrable overestimate and over-taxation to the extent of at least £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the matters I have referred to in the course of my original speech.  I have shown that the effort to answer my arguments failed entirely and that the charge of overestimation which I have made is justifiable. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that all the figures given by the Minister in his Budget are correct. Let us assume that the Minister's aim is just barely to balance his Budget and that the position is such that he has to have all this additional taxation in order barely to balance his Budget. Assuming for the moment that that is the position, what follows from it is that if&mdash;which the Lord forbid&mdash;the present Government is in office in this country this time 12 months, and the present Minister for Finance has again to stand up in this House and present a Budget&mdash;which God forfend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he will then be in the position of having at least £3? million available for largesse or distribution and he will be able to point out what a great fellow he is.  I have already shown, according to the Government's own Estimates, that the total cost of subsidies in a full year is £4.4 million.  That applies to a year other than the present year, which is complicated by the fact that for the first quarter of the year the new policy will not take effect and the subsidies <Col N="1508" /> will not be removed until the 1st July. This year, according to those Estimates, the cost amounts to £8.6 million.  Take the figure of £15.25 million, which was the cost of all the subsidies&mdash;leaving aside the subsidy due to the sale of white flour before this Budget came in&mdash;and deduct from it the figure of £6.67 million, which is the figure given by the Minister for the savings: that gives a figure of £8.6 million.  Now you have £4.4 million, which is the figure for the ordinary year, and £8.6 million, which is the figure for this peculiar year: the difference is £4.2 million.  It would seem, on those figures, that next year the Minister will have £4.2 million at his disposal to hand out in largesse for reduction of taxes with a view to saying what a great fellow he is.  Against £4.2 million you must set off the figure for social service benefits which amounts, I think, to £900,000.  Deducting the £900,000 from the £4.2 million you arrive at £3.3 million.  There, demonstrably&mdash;accepting every single item of the Minister's own Budget&mdash; is the whole scope revealed.</P>
      <P>We believe that there is a surplus of at least £10,000,000.  It may not be achieved because of effects unforeseen by the Minister and the economic situation which will be created by this Budget.  We believe that if the economic policy pursued by the inter-Party Government had been fulfilled, there would be no necessity for any of these impositions.  I would never, under any circumstances, be a party to this Budget or to any provision of this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I pause, for a moment, to inquire who is going to benefit by the Budget?  First on the list are our old friends, the dance hall proprietors. Next come the tea merchants.  The Minister says that he is going to keep on Tea Importers, Limited, and bulk purchasing in case he should offend the Indian Government.  He says that at a time when, I am informed, the price of tea in the open market is very considerably less than the price at which Tea Importers, Limited, are importing it.  Tea Importers, Limited, are going to make money on this Budget.  The biscuit manufacturers and confectioners will benefit under this <Col N="1509" /> Budget.  We made those people who bought white flour pay for the cheap bread.  We made them pay in order to ease the taxpayer and the consumer. An end is being put to that now, and the confectioners as well as the biscuit manufacturers will benefit.  The jam manufacturers will benefit under this Budget.  They will get a reduction in the price which they will have to pay for their sugar.  Even for their expensive jams they will have to pay less than we made them pay.  We made them pay for the sugar in order that the people might get cheap sugar. Under this Budget, this Government is allowing the jam manufacturers to get cheaper sugar and the ordinary people have to pay a higher price for the sugar.  Who is going to benefit in that context?  There are the sellers of white flour.  Our old friends, R.G.D.A.T.A., will benefit&mdash;that public-spirited body which refused to sell white flour at the price which the inter-Party Government fixed because they were not getting enough profit on it They refused to sell white flour or push its sale.</P>
    <P>They are being let rip now and they will benefit by this policy.  Then there are our old friends the millers.  I referred here a few moments ago, and proved by figures, that £1,000,000, too much was being imposed in taxation on the people by this Budget in reference to the subsidy on bread and flour. Perhaps I was wrong.  Would it be that that £1,000,000 will go to the millers in reduction of their charges in order that their situation may be eased&mdash;just as the situation of the biscuit manufacturers, confectioners and jam manufacturers is being eased? Would it be unduly suspicious to inquire if that £1,000,000 is being given to the millers?  At all events, the millers will gain out of this.  These are the people who are going to benefit by this Budget.  Everybody else will suffer.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his colleagues made great play of the fact that they were doing something which they knew was unpopular and they asked why they should do something which was unpopular.  I shall give a few reasons.  First and perhaps foremost, as I said at the beginning, the motive behind the Budget, as revealed by the Minister again to-day in his speech, is his desire to discredit his predecessors, to brand them, as he tried to do to-day, as fraudulent and dishonest in connection with their financial transactions.  The second reason is that they would be showing their inconsistency if they did not introduce this Budget.  In the period when they were over here on these benches in opposition, every criticism they made of our financial and economic policy was directed towards bringing them into the position in which they now find themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has already told the House that the inter-Party Government were advised to budget for a surplus of £7,000,000 last year, and Deputy McGilligan refused to do so because the conditions of the country were not such as to require the imposition of taxes for the purpose of preventing inflation or mopping up the excess purchasing power in the hands of the people.  The advisers of the Minister this year, however, found the Minister as wax in their hands.  Their traditional policy is: &ldquo;Get in all the taxes you can and if you get too much it can go in reduction of debt.&rdquo;  That is their honest view, their out-of-date view.  The Minister, as I have said, was wax in their hands, and anyhow that advice fitted in with his desire to show that we were wrong and dishonest in our financial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads to the next explanation for the introduction of this Budget&mdash; the desire to prove that they were <Col N="1511" /> right in 1947, when they imposed additional taxes on the people which we later removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On tobacco and beer.  They are back again now in the effort to provide a justification for their past.  I have already stated that, on any view of this Budget, they have provided themselves with a nest egg which will enable them to shower benefits on the people and to pretend that they had done a really useful public service in cleaning up the so-called dishonesty and the fraudulent financial operations of their predecessors. But perhaps the most significant fact of all is that they have indicated their intention of carrying out a programme of capital works involving an expenditure of £35,000,000. They do not know how it is going to be financed, according to the Minister's own statement.  That statement showed that the total amount that appeared to be available to him either from borrowings or savings, from loans or elsewhere, is £18,000,000.  How is he going to carry out the capital programme of £35,000,000?  Where is the remaining £17,000,000 to come from?</P>
      <P>Over-taxation in the Budget is the complete answer to that.  They want to raise more taxes than they need in order to try to finance the entire of the £35,000,000 capital programme, which they will not bring themselves to finance by the methods which we adopted and which we carried through so successfully.  That was also revealed to-day in the Minister's vicious state ment at the end of his speech.  It was revealed in the manner in which he shouted and roared across the House: &ldquo;There is going to be an end to borrowing.&rdquo; I was really surprised and asked what was there going to be an end of.</P>

      <P>There is going to be an end of borrowing!  Now we know why the Dáil is faced with this Budget. The programme of capital expenditure which we initiated and carried out, was based on a scheme of borrowing under which repayments were made by means of an annuity provided for in the Central Fund Act and which amortised the whole thing at the end of the 30 years, leaving not one single penny piece to be paid at the end of the 30 years. That is the revealing picture of the Minister's statement to-day: there is going to be an end to borrowing.  If there is going to be an end to the prudent borrowing that we initiated and carried through, then there is going to be an end, a speedy end, to the present Government and all its perfidious acts.</P>

      <P>We shall come to that later&mdash;capital investment in day-old chicks.  I wonder how many eggs they would have laid or what age they will be in 30 years' time whoever will be paying for them.  In 1950-51 they borrowed £21,686,000.  What did they do with the money?  In 1951-52 it was £38,938,000.  That is a formidable bill &mdash;£95,000,000 odd for the luxury of having a mixum-gatherum Government here for three and a half years.</P>
      <P>The same day I asked another question of the Minister for Finance, if he would state the total amount payable and paid in interest and sinking fund in the financial year 1947-48 and the total amount payable in interest and sinking fund for the financial year 1952-53.  My reason in asking those questions was so that the ordinary man in the street may know exactly where he stands and what burden has been thrown on his shoulders.  I do not want four and a half hours of smoke-screen figures to pour out to-morrow and after, that would make the man, when finished reading, a lot more smoked up than when he started.</P>
      <P>Here they are.  Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, said that the amount paid in 1947-48 for the service of the public debt&mdash;for interest and sinking fund&mdash;was £4,224,334; and that for the year 1952-53 the estimated figure was £10,080,400.  That is the amount which has to be found each year by the people of this country before they get a penny for themselves. We see there an increase of very close on £6,000,000 a year, to be found and paid every year by the people of this country for the next 30 years, for the luxury of having a mixum-gatherum team in charge of this country for three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is any Deputy over there prepared to stand up and deny that those figures <Col N="1514" /> are correct?  Is any Deputy over there prepared to stand up now and say that for the luxury of having a mixum-gatherum Government for three and a half years the people should pay £6,000,000 a year for the next 30 years? It is a rather expensive luxury, and a rather big amount to pay for the pleasure of having this team across on this side of the House for a couple of years.  I have waited for the last three weeks hoping that some Deputy would make a denial of those facts.  They dare not deny them.  Those are the items that this country must find the money for now.  We have heard all the talk about their achievements.  There is no doubt that was a great achievement. I wish I were able to achieve as much with that bank manager of mine down the country.  It was a great achievement to succeed in securing out of the people £95,000,000 in three and a half years.</P>

However, those are only the starting off points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the Minister was providing too much money, that he was taxing to the extent of £10,000,000 too much.  Would it not be a grand thing for this nation if Deputy McGilligan, when he was sitting here on the 2nd May, just 12 months ago, had only estimated for what he knew he would have to pay, if he had only estimated for the £855,000 that they issued two days afterwards to the local authorities in the letters they sent out the day after the Dáil was dissolved, letters that put £2,000,000 on the ratepayers and £855,000 on taxation?  &ldquo;Deputy John A. Costello&rdquo; was a lovely name to sign to the tail end of the bill that put £15,800 on the ratepayers of Cork and £2,000,000 on the ratepayers of this country and £1,000,000 on this Budget &mdash;and that at a period when they were no longer here as Ministers, but were <Col N="1515" /> only caretakers waiting for their successors to come in and take over. Who got that money?  The men in charge of the giving out of every labourer's cottage in every county&mdash; £125 a man, a week before they went to the poll.

Deputy McGilligan came along here coolly and told us that Córas Iompair Éireann would have to provide their own finances and balance their own budget&mdash;a month after the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, had announced solemnly that he wanted £980,000 to pay their losses for the previous year.  We did not hear any howl then from Labour about the number of men going to be put out of employment in Córas Iompair Éireann if Deputy McGilligan's order, that Córas Iompair Éireann square up their finances and bring in revenue sufficient to meet their needs, were put into <Col N="1516" /> force.

We could provide permanent employment for the whole of the unemployed here on that basis if we had £95,000,000.  We could dish it out at the rate of £3,500,000 per county.  That is the £95,000,000 that the inter-Party Government squandered in three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 23 years' existence of this State before the inter-Party Government took office the total amount necessary to cover debt for that period was £4,200,000.  In the three and a half years of inter-Party Government it jumped from £4,200,000 to £10,080,000, and in three and a half years the inter-Party Government increased the State debt by 150 per cent.  Now they moan and they groan and they want to know why we should try to find the necessary money in this way.  They want to know why we would not try to find it <Col N="1517" /> some other way.  I have heard of &ldquo;neck&rdquo; but this is cast-iron &ldquo;neck&rdquo;&mdash;it will not bend either way.</P>
    <P>Here now we have a new board of directors, as it were, who have had to take over the debt left by the inter-Party Government.  The Opposition have spent a considerable time telling us that we are looking for too much. It was that Opposition that reduced the price of the pint and the price of cigarettes and have now put the people in the position of having to pay for the cigarettes they smoked and the beer they drank in the last three and a half years.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i></P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Davin groaning and complaining recently because of the increased tax on petrol and bewailing the effect that increase would have on employment in Córas Iompair Éireann and on bus fares.  I like a man to be consistent.  I carefully searched through Deputy McGilligan's speech here on the Budget last year.  At column 1903 of Volume 125 Deputy McGilligan said speaking in connection with Córas Iompair Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board has a statutory duty &lsquo;so to conduct its undertaking as to secure as soon as may be, that, taking one year with another, the revenue shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to it&rsquo;.  This duty will, I hope, be discharged with the utmost expedition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He provided nothing in last year's Budget to cover Córas Iompair Éireann losses and we heard no outcry then from Deputy Davin.  Neither Deputy Davin nor Deputy Byrne was bothering then about bus fares in connection with the poor children in Dublin. They were not worrying then about any increase of 2d. or 3d. Deputy Davin did not mind whether 10 or 20 per cent. of the workers in Córas Iompair Éireann had to be sacked in order that the company could pay its way.  That did not worry him one bit.  Now the bill has to be <Col N="1518" /> paid.  I am always prepared to listen to reason.  Can any Deputy on the Opposition Benches tell me where the £11,000,000 that should have been provided for in last year's Budget and the £6,000,000 increased interest as a result of the spending spree can be found instead of raising it in the manner, suggested by the Minister here?</P>

He says that the increase in the consumption of beer in 1951, as compared with 1950, was 34,000 barrels; that the people drank 69,000 more gallons of whiskey in that year than they did in the year before, and 54,000 more gallons of wine.</P>

      <P>This Bill asks us to provide money for the Budget that was introduced here by the Minister for Finance some weeks ago.  First of all, it is only right to recall that the existing Government owes its origin to the dishonest campaign carried out last year, regarding the cost of living particularly. The cost of living is what will be affected most as a result of this Budget.  It is estimated that the cost of living will be increased by 17 per <Col N="1522" /> cent. as a result of the Budget.  While the cost of living in the three years when the inter-Party Government were in control went up by 3 per cent., an average of 1 per cent. per annum, in less than 12 months these proposals will increase the cost of living by 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>I saw the Cork Deputy, Deputy MacCarthy, was very restless when mention was made of the dishonesty and deception of the Fianna Fáil Party last year, which caused the present Government to be in office.  I have here the Cork election address of May, 1951, which was responsible in fact for bringing into this House Deputy MacCarthy, if it did not bring another Deputy to the House.  This election address complains that in the three years the loaf of bread increased from 6d. to 6½d.  It also complained that the price of butter was increased from 2/8 to 2/10.  That was the burden of the complaint in the Cork election address last year.  We had the Fianna Fáil Party cooing to the housewife, asking for her support and complaining that the inter-Party Government did not do well for her.  In the course of their appeal they asked the people to vote for a new deal and a straight deal. We know now the new deal.  It is a raw deal for the householders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every housewife knows that the cost of clothes, coal, soap and most other household commodities has risen to a dangerous level.  No amount of statistical juggling can prove otherwise.  A pound note goes nowhere in household shopping <Col N="1523" /> to-day, and every housewife knows it.  Yet, the Coalition is attempting to prove by statistics and false arguments that the cost of living has not risen.  What do you think?  Is this honest?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Above all things, the present Government has proved itself to be dishonest to the electors, dishonest in its pledges.  Last year, when it was seeking the support of a few very important Independents, it included in its 17-point programme, point 15&mdash;I am quoting now from the programme published on the 4th June, 1951&mdash;which guaranteed.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To maintain subsidies, to control the prices of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is the point in the Fianna Fáil programme which deceived the country and certainly secured the support of certain Independents who believed that the Fianna Fáil Party would implement that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly, I want to refer to the portion of that statement saying &ldquo;to control the prices of essential foodstuffs&rdquo;. Many of us know that the retail prices of many commodities were decontrolled in the month of <Col N="1524" /> June when the present Government were only a few weeks in office.  The retail prices of certain articles of food were decontrolled, which had an immediate effect on the cost of living. Yet they had this statement here guaranteeing to control prices of essential foodstuffs.  Month after month during the period before Christmas we had one announcement after another indicating that decontrol was being applied to the retail prices of articles normally used in the household. If the inter-Party Government did anything, they certainly tried to hold the retail price of goods at a reasonable level, a level which would be related in some way to the incomes of householders.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister for Finance of his own statement in relation to the prices of beer and tobacco.  On the 15th May, 1951, speaking at Rathmines Town Hall, Mr. MacEntee, now Minister for Finance, made the following statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 15th May, 1951, the Minister for Finance spoke as follows in Rathmines Town Hall:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading the rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power the taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed. There is no truth in any such rumour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is the statement of the present Minister for Finance when seeking the support of the electorate during the general election campaign.  It is typical of the type of promise and propaganda put before the electorate last year in order to secure a change of Government.  That was not the only thing.  We had the example of the circular sent out by the secretary of the Ballroom Proprietors' Association asking for subscriptions for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I propose to quote one sentence to illustrate that there must have existed some kind of understanding or collusion between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Ballroom Proprietors' Association.  Portion of this letter, signed by the secretary of the association, Kathleen Morris, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... It will be appreciated that in order to have the desired effect ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that, of course, was a change of Government&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... our financial aid must of necessity be generous.  I may mention that one leading commercial ballroom in Dublin has headed the list of subscribers to this fund with the generous sum of £250 and other members of the executive have also indicated their willingness to subscribe very generously&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> No wonder the Minister to-day spent so much time explaining his action in abolishing that dance tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I know that the dancers do not get the benefit of that remission.  He knows that a few days after he announced the abolition of that tax the ballroom owners received a letter from the Dance Band Association indicating that the dance bands intended to press for increased charges in respect of their bands.  At the same time, the ballroom owners issued a statement indicating that they proposed to increase their charges for the renting of their ballrooms. Therefore, they are going to divide amongst them this sum of £140,000 which was being subscribed by the people attending dances.  The Minister need not try to tell anybody that it was difficult for his Department to collect the dance tax.  Everybody knows that a dance committee, before running a dance, must pay the tax&mdash; the tax is collected before the dance starts&mdash;and, therefore, there is no trouble, so far as the collection of the dance tax is concerned.  At the same time as the Minister announced this remission, he announced that the loaf of bread was to be advanced by 2½d., from 6½d. to 9d.</P>
    <P>This Budget, clearly, is one which has been dictated not alone by the Victorian mind which may exist within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, but must have been dictated to them by Mr. Butler, who was visited very shortly before the Budget by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They went over to London on the invitation of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  They came back, but they did not tell the House or the country what took place at the conversations, except that there was a friendly chat. The country is entitled to know what the nature of the discussion was.  They left this country as Ministers of State and they spoke to a Minister of State in London.  They came back here and gave no account of their conversation there.  They did not even tell the House or the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that we should be told what took place at these London talks.  It has been alleged that this is a Butler Budget, that it was dictated from London. If that is the case, the Minister ought to put that to us as an excuse or as an argument.  He should at least tell us whether this Budget was dictated to him in London.  If that is the case, it was dictated to him by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer who must take into account a heavy programme of rearmament and must also take into account the heavy costs arising out of the war.  This country has no commitments in the matter of either the last war or rearmament.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Government which undoubtedly has its basis in collusion have hung on to office since the election last year, although a majority of the people voted against them and they are still hanging on. Last year, this country imported more goods of a non-essential type than in any previous year.  We have the Minister for Finance speaking about our adverse trade balance, but what is he doing about our adverse trade balance? Does he think for a moment that, by increasing the price of the loaf, of butter, of sugar and of tea on the poor, he is going to reduce our adverse trade balance?  He knows that last year this country imported £204,000,000 worth of goods and that the bulk of these imports took place during the last six months of the year. In his statements so far, he has not indicated to the House any method which he proposes to adopt which will adjust our adverse trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to assume that during the present year the total amount of goods imported will reach the colossal sum of £204,000,000, which will be very much in excess of the value of goods to be exported, either in the form of agricultural or manufactured goods or in the form of income from tourism.  We should know from the Minister what he proposes to do regarding the country's finances in the matter of this adverse trade balance.  The panic speeches which the Minister and his colleagues began to make last year when they came into Government in order to blackguard their predecessors and to make little of their achievements and try to make people forget what had been achieved during those years have brought about a lack of confidence in trade and an industrial slump.  There is unemployment in particular in the industrial group.  That is the consequence of the industrial slump brought about by the scaremongering and panic speeches of the present Ministers.  All those speeches were designed to belittle the achievements of the inter-Party Government during its 38 months of office, but in those 38 months the inter-Party Government succeeded in putting <Col N="1529" /> an extra 38,000 persons into insurable employment.</P>
    <P>The figures show that in 1947 the number of persons in insurable employment was 186,000 and that in 1951, when we were leaving office, the number was 286,000, the difference being 38,000 persons in new jobs.  It took less than 12 months for 12,000 people to lose jobs.  Unemployment amongst the workers is accelerating.  It has accelerated particularly since the introduction of the Budget proposals because there is an inclination amongst employers to cut down on staff.</P>
    <P>Remember that these Budget proposals will affect the wage earners and their families more drastically than employers and their families, because if an employer has four or five wage earners and is finding it difficult to face the impositions of the Budget he can immediately dispense with one or two of the employees and reduce his expenditure.  The employee is thrown out into the ranks of the unemployed and to the labour exchange.  He has not the protection that the employer has.  The employer can cushion the effect of these Budget proposals by reducing staff but the wage earner must take the blow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Cowan, I would like to say that if he examines the statistics he will see that the figures for unemployment are always the highest between the months of November and 1st March.  When the 1st March comes, the number of unemployed gradually comes downwards until the <Col N="1530" /> months of September or the middle of October.  That is because there is a certain amount of activity on the land. There is a type of agricultural employment and there is always employment in connection with tourism. People are engaged in different ways in connection with the ordinary summer holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, what is his aim in this Budget.  Is it towards devaluation or is it to counteract deflation?  Perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Butler, has warned him that at some future date it is proposed to carry out further devaluation. Whether it is deflation or devaluation, the Minister should tell the House and the country what is the aim behind this Budget.  The nation is being asked to pay more than is required and more than it should.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that he is budgeting for millions of pounds&mdash;actually £10,000,000 more than he will need for the management of the services set out in the Book of Estimates.  In the course of his Budget speech, the Minister referred to agricultural production and he complained that the level of production had not reached the 1938 level, but the Minister knows the measure of poverty that existed amongst the farmers during the years from 1932 to 1938.  The first relief they got was as a result of the financial agreement of 1938 concluded by the British Government and this country after six years of economic war.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that in order to make ends meet the farmers and farm workers of the country had to work night and day producing goods which would enable them to scrape together sufficient money to pay the grocer and to pay for his other liabilities.  That is the explanation for the measure of agricultural production which existed in 1938 compared with the level of production which exists at the present time.</P>

      <P>Questions were asked in the House, and he was bound to give an answer which showed that the inter-Party Government, during three and a half years, spent £15,000,000 of the American money.  That is the money which we were told was spent by the inter-Party Government.  It was spent at an average rate of £4,000,000 a year.  On that basis the inter-Party Government could have carried on with the American money for another seven years, and that was the programme.  It was a ten-year programme designed to feed into the general capital investment programme a sum of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance was opposed to our system of borrowing for capital development but we now have the situation where he actually put before the House his intention of going ahead with a capital development and investment programme of £35,000,000.  We did not attempt in any one year a programme so big.  He is putting that programme before the House and he has not got the money to do it.  He is pretending that he will do it.  He can only pretend because he has not got the money to finance it and he is not prepared to borrow money.  He has indicated that he proposes to go to the country for a national loan, and I hope that he will succeed.  He indicated, I think, that <Col N="1536" /> he proposes to seek a loan of about £10,000,000, but £10,000,000 will fall very far short of the proposal to invest £35,000,000 in a capital development programme.</P>
      <P>Coming to the domestic side of affairs we have the proposal to withdraw the subsidies on butter, tea, sugar and bread.  Last year when the butter price went up from 2/8 to 2/10 per lb. there was an outcry all over the country and, of course, the leaders of that outcry were the Fianna Fáil Party.  They pretended to the people at that time that if they were in office no such increase in the cost of living would take place, but they were only a fortnight in power when they put another 2d. per lb. on butter and brought it up to 3/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, it was done to get more butter.  If that were the purpose, it was not achieved because there was more butter imported since the present Government came into office than, I suppose, since we became responsible for the administration of our own affairs in this country.  In 1950 this country produced 750,000 cwt. of butter&mdash;more butter than our people could eat.  The average consumption per head per week in 1950 was 13 oz.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1950, the last full year during which the inter-Party Government had control of the affairs of this country, our farmers produced more butter than we could eat.  Actually, we had a surplus of butter.  When the present Minister for Agriculture came into office, he declared that not one ounce of butter would be imported into this country after February or March, but we are still importing as much butter as ever from New Zealand at something like 3/1 per lb.  The proposed price of 3/10 per lb. is obviously designed to reap a profit from imported butter.  Of course, the extra charge for butter will reduce consumption. People with large families will stop consuming 13 oz. per head per <Col N="1538" /> week, which they were doing in 1950. They will cut down their consumption to a half pound per week or even less when the price of 3/10 per lb. comes into operation.</P>
      <P>It was an insult to the old age pensioners to offer them 1/6 extra per week.  Any old age pensioner, in his health, can sit down to 21 meals per week.  It is proposed to give him 18d. &mdash;less than 1d. per meal&mdash;to enable him to meet the increased cost of essential commodities.  The price of a 2lb. loaf of bread will go from 6½d. to 9d., an increase of 45 per cent.; butter will be 3/10 per lb.; there will be no such thing as being able to get tea at 2/8 per lb.; it will probably be in the region of 5/- or 5/6 per lb.  The subsidised price for sugar is to be abolished and, of course, the old age pensioner is not supposed to enjoy the ordinary luxury of a pint, a nip of whiskey, or even a few cigarettes. All the relief given to him to cope with these new prices is 1/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy boycott the Social Welfare Bill last week when old age pensions were being discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I felt that I was well represented; the Deputy was here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You wanted the Labour Party to quarrel with Fianna Fáil while you kept outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare was giving some figures he said that the 1/6 per week extra to the old age pensioner was based on an allowance of 8 oz. of butter per head per week.  In other words, he said that 13 oz. per head per week, which the old age pensioner was consuming in 1950, was far too much&mdash; that he was living beyond his means and that 8 oz. ought to be sufficient for him.  However, the dance tax has been removed and the old age pensioner can dance with delight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that these increased prices are going to place an extra charge of 10/- per week on the average family.  One will find a few people saying that this Budget is going to mean a saving for them of 7d. or <Col N="1539" /> 1/7 per week.  That is on the food end of things alone.  They do not take into consideration the tax on tobacco, on spirits and on beer, but taking food alone they are going to save a matter of a shilling or two and pence.  However, for the average family this Budget is going to mean an extra expenditure of about 10/- per week.  I heard Deputy Corish giving figures in this House which could not be contradicted in relation to the increased burden that would be put on many households having two or three children.  The new price of flour will be 4/9 per stone.  The previous figure was 2/8 per stone.  That is a colossal increase and it will prove to be a heavy burden for the housewife who normally went to the shop and brought home a copule of stone of flour and baked healthy bread.</P>
    <P>We are told now that the loaf will be whiter and that the extra charge will be justified, even on the grounds that the bread will be whiter.  However, when it suited the Fianna Fáil Government during the emergency years, they quoted medical opinion as saying that the black bread was healthy bread and good for the nation. Now they are putting forward arguments that the nation is going to get whiter bread. They cannot have it both ways.  Either the bread is better blacker, or it is better whiter, but it cannot be better both ways.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch will give you a copy.  It is proposed to put an extra 4d. a gallon on petrol.  That is going to be a heavy burden, particularly on agriculture.  We remember some years ago when the inter-Party Government increased the tax on petrol there was an uproar in this House about the increased cost of petrol for agricultural tractors.  The result of that agitation was that the Minister for Finance decided that in the interests of agriculture, agricultural production and production of food, he would allow a rebate of 6d. a gallon for petrol used in agricultural tractors.  This extra 4d. a gallon must be paid by the farmers who are using <Col N="1542" /> agricultural tractors in connection with food production.  The result is that the petrol tax will amount to something like £1 a week, £52 a year, on the farmer engaged in the growing of wheat and the production of food generally.</P>
      <P>Then we have here the allowance of £1? million to the manufacturers of tobacco.  This tax has been gathered from the people's pockets and handed over to the tobacco manufacturers, for what it is hard to understand. Certainly, an excuse for it has been put up, but this tobacco was bought years ago, and it is proposed now to collect £1? million from the pockets of the taxpayers and hand it over to the manufacturers of tobacco.  Sixpence on the packet of cigarettes, plus 1d., makes it 7d., and the 1d. is for the tobacco manufacturers.</P>

      <P>On the 1st July the cost of living is going to go up 17 per cent. It is going to be a great hardship on many people who must bear these increased prices for essential food. Unemployment continues to increase and emigration has accelerated particularly during the last 12 months. Many times in this House the question of emigration was brought up, and emigration was used as an issue.  It was criticised, and it was even the subject of a Birmingham speech which proved to be a boomerang.  The Army, of course, has been enlarged, and it has absorbed an extra 2,000 persons.</P>
      <P>The question is if they had not gone into the Army would they have any employment, would they have work either in the factory or in the field? Considering that so many people are losing employment and that the unemployment figure has gone up so much, it is only right to assume that this extra 2,000 people would be unemployed if they had not joined the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make a statement which will restore confidence in the country.  Business is at its lowest ebb, and the only activity that is likely to improve business during the coming months is the expected increase in the number of tourists who will come to this country.  Owing to the restricted allowance available to them for foreign travel, they are almost forced to come to this country.  It is probable that the tourists will be the means of creating a measure of prosperity, and of providing more employment during the coming summer months, but they will be with us only a few months, and when the tourist trade declines the position will be just as it is to-day.  I hope that the Minister will do something to improve the position of the country and make things easier, particularly for the weaker sections of the community, the <Col N="1545" /> wage earners, who are being asked to bear the heaviest burden.  I will conclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>The Government are responsible for the Finance Bill and I am questioning the manner in which they came into office.  They are imposing upon the people something for which the people did not vote.  If the people were presented last year with a 17-point programme which did not include item 15&mdash;to maintain the subsidies, to control the prices of essential <Col N="1546" /> foodstuffs and to operate an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary scarce commodities&mdash;the Government would not be in office.</P>
      <P>They secured support by undertaking to control the prices of essential commodities and to maintain subsidies. Instead of that, day after day they began decontrolling the retail prices of essential commodities, particularly foodstuffs, and on top of that they have now introduced a Budget proposing to withdraw the subsidies.  The whole basis of their existence is one of dishonesty and deception and it is only fair to demand from the Minister the real explanation as to why he withdrew the subsidies and decontrolled prices when in fact the Government gave an undertaking that they would control prices and maintain the subsidies. These are the questions which are in the public mind.  The public feel that they have been deceived and the Minister should give them an opportunity of expressing their disapproval of his action and the action of his Government at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the introduction of this year's Budget many Opposition Deputies have allowed themselves the luxury of identifying themselves with the suffering people.  They have had a field day up and down the country worrying about the poor man's pint and the pensioner's smoke.  In fact their sympathy extended to every section of the community.  Having listened to their wails, I am filled with admiration of their fortitude on the day of the Budget statement.  On that day, as increase after increase in taxation was announced every Opposition Deputy, with great fortitude, smiled until towards the end there was a broad smile on the face of every Opposition Deputy.  It is hard, therefore, to regard seriously their various speeches about the hardships of the Budget.  That is not saying that I do not agree that this is a hard and harsh Budget because it is that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sympathy, as my colleagues do, with the people of the country at having to bear such heavy taxation which could easily have been spread over the last few years.  We regret having to impose such heavy taxation <Col N="1547" /> on the people, but the regret is something like the regret which you feel when a person has to go to work on a Monday morning.  No matter how much we regret it, it has to be done because it is absolutely essential for us to put our financial affairs in order.</P>
    <P>Listening to the speakers from the Opposition Front Bench I was disappointed, but not surprised, to find that after this continued debate, and when the smoke has cleared, we are left with no constructive suggestions for an alternative method of getting money for our Exchequer other than the suggestion of having a general election and the almost schizoid vagueness of a ten-minute speech that can produce money at the rate of £1,000,000 a minute.  I am not surprised that it is now necessary for one of the leaders of the Fine Gael Party to produce money at that rate since the Party has joined Deputy Dillon, because on his own confession he was capable of spending $5,000,000 in one afternoon.  I presume it is no more than the shock of this prospective spending that has caused the wild talk that money can be taken out of the air at the rate of £1,000,000 a minute. It is not indicated whether the shadow Minister would equip himself with all the impedimenta of the magician during this process, but if he believes that what he says is possible perhaps he would be a little more constructive and say how it can be done.</P>
    <P>So short a time after a general election, nobody in the country can have much sympathy with a man who will make a statement like that, but stand shyly back and withhold the useful information, stipulating that there be a general election and that he be again returned to office.  It is unreasonable to expect the people to accept his word for his ability in this respect, without any indication as to how he proposes to put it into effect. It is particularly difficult for them to accept it when they reflect on the Budget which Deputy McGilligan brought in last year and remember that there was a deficit of £6.7 million in respect of which this year we are paying a sum of £330,000 in interest. They must, of course, suspect that a <Col N="1548" /> ten-minute speech by the originator of last year's Budget will involve the borrowing of money.</P>
    <P>Since the present Budget, I have moved a good deal amongst the people, and although I have heard many suggestions, I do not believe anybody believes in borrowing.  In fact, I am convinced that nobody wants to borrow.  I have heard many criticisms of the Budget and many alternative suggestions, but the alternatives were for alternative taxation.  You had the example of the married man suggesting that the bachelor should be taxed: the publican suggesting that the bicycle should be taxed, and the teetotaller suggesting that further taxation should be put on drink.  In fact, the attitude can be summed up to the effect that the people believe that taxation is essential, that somebody should be taxed, but they themselves do not want to be taxed.  I think that is a very natural reaction.  However, nobody with whom I spoke suggested that we should borrow.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of alternative taxation, it might, perhaps, be well to point out to the people that the Minister had at his disposal a team of experts to advise him and to examine the revenue possibilities of any particular form of taxation.  We must accept it that these people would not neglect to tax something which would yield a reasonable revenue without imposing undue hardship on the people. To explain fully their examination of all the possible sources of revenue would be too expansive.  The people must accept it that each article was examined from the point of view of the amount of revenue it would yield and also of the cost of collecting the revenue.  We can be assured that our officers, as well as those in every other country, seek to tax only those articles which would impose the least hardship on the people while at the same time yielding sufficient revenue.</P>
    <P>Sufficient revenue is the important point when dealing with the illusive luxury tax.  Everybody believes that there is some luxury but nobody seems to think there is any luxury in his own life.  People believe that there is some nebulous group somewhere who enjoy luxuries and that we should tax that <Col N="1549" /> group of people.  We have heard officially that what can be described as &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo; are enjoyed by very few people and that to attempt to get much revenue from them would probably prevent their purchase or use at all. Therefore, it is very unfair of representatives of the people to keep whipping up the idea that some group of people who are supposed to be living in luxury should be taxed.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney said that the large family will suffer because of the increase in the price of flour.  My information, from where I come, is that the large family has suffered hitherto because of the rationing and because of having to buy flour and other essential commodities off the ration at enormous prices.  In fact, large families will benefit very much by this Budget. The same Deputy mentioned emigration as if this problem were solely the result of the election of a Fianna Fáil Government.  It depends how far back one looks, I suppose, but over the last 100 years County Clare has lost 200,000 people&mdash;and most of those were lost before Fianna Fáil ever got into office.  The continued emigration of our people is a social disease which we all wish could be cured but it will <Col N="1550" /> never be cured by bouncing the baby from one Government to another and saying: &ldquo;Emigration is your fault&rdquo;, and retorting: &ldquo;No, it is your fault.&rdquo; It requires study to discover what can stem the tide of emigration of an essentially useful part of our population.</P>
    <P>The increased price of butter is related to a number of factors, one of which is the increase in the price of milk.  While the increase in the price of butter is to the detriment of a certain section of our community it is essential for another section that the price of milk be kept up.  The small farmer, in particular, depends on a very limited income from the sale of milk.  If the price of milk is not maintained he will have to turn to other means of earning and so may do away with milk production in this country.  If the price of milk is not maintained, we shall be forced to look for butter from other sources.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
