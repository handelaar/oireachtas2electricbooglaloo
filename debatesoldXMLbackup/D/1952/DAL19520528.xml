      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the arbitration proceedings on the claim for a general revision of Civil Service pay, the staff side claimed retrospective payment to the 1st November, 1950.  They contended that this date was justified by reference, amongst other considerations, to the effective dates from which increases in outside employment were granted.  They referred, in particular, <Col N="166" /> to the increases for local authority employees which the Ministers for Health, Local Government and Social Welfare had currently announced they would be prepared to sanction with effect as from the 1st November, 1950.  The official advocates argued that no claim for a general revision of Civil Service pay was sustainable at all and that, even if such a claim could be admitted, retrospective effect should not be given to the findings of the board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will collate and circulate with the Official Report the following information: (a) What were <Col N="175" /> the terms of the Lime Subsidy (Reclamation and Drainage) Scheme which operated in conjunction with the Farm Improvements Scheme; (b) what was its scope and (c) what grants were paid under it in each year of its operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply of 21st instant, the information sought is contained in the Annual Reports of the Minister for Agriculture from 1941/42 to 1949/50, inclusive.  I had hoped that the Deputy would not experience any undue difficulty in obtaining his requirements from that source, but this does not appear to have been the case and I propose, therefore, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to have the required information circulated in the form of a statement in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The statement referred to is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The Lime Subsidy (Reclamation and Drainage) Scheme provided for the payment of a subsidy towards the cost of lime or sea-sand applied to land newly reclaimed or intensively drained under the terms of the Farm Improvements Scheme.  Up to the 1948/49 season, the benefits of the Scheme were confined to applicants the poor law valuation of whose agricultural land did not exceed £20.  This limitation was removed in the 1948-49 season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidies, which varied from year to year, were payable in respect of purchased lime, home-burnt lime, dredged sea-sand and strand surface sea-sand.  In the final season of the Scheme (1948/49) the average rates of subsidy were £1 19s. 5d. per ton of lime <Col N="176" /> and 6/1 per ton of sea-sand.  The maximum dressings per statute acre on which subsidies were allowed were two tons of lime, or five tons of dredged sea-sand or ten tons of strand-surface sea-sand.</P>
    <P>(b)  The scheme was confined to the congested districts and analogous areas in County Clare and North West Cavan.</P>

      <P>When the debate on this Estimate was adjourned the last day we were dealing with a point raised by Deputy Collins and the simple comment I should like to make is this: what substitute can you reasonably substitute for an examination system when you have regard to the practical purposes for which examinations are needed in contradistinction to what I might call the general educative aims of the teaching which the child is getting?  As I said, I do not want to make a wholehearted or, shall I say, a completely biased defence of the examination system.  There are difficulties and objections.  It is not by any means an ideal method of testing when you regard education from the point of view of the general personal equipment of the child or the young person who is being taught.  On the other hand, when you look at it from the practical aspect, that is, from the point of view of ensuring that the person at the end of a course has a certain minimum amount of knowledge in definite form, when it is a question of selecting either for appointment or for some advantage, it is very hard to see what you can substitute for an examination system.  As I said on the last day, any alternative seemed to involve such a personal factor on the part of the selectors that it is very hard to think of anything that can, in the long run, be as fair and as objective as the system of examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to see in what way <Col N="179" /> you can eliminate, under any other system, the various factors that may operate as undue preference to the extent to which they are eliminated in the examination system.  I think, however, that particularly in the higher spheres of education, the system of interview and oral examination, in conjunction with the system of written examination, does much to obviate the objections which are inherent in the system of written examination alone. That development has gone on in modern times and a certain balance has been secured.</P>
    <P>Whether it is an examination for a degree or for a Civil Service appointment or for any other practical purpose, we find nowadays that the invariable practice is to have something in the nature of an oral examination or an interview where the examiners or selectors have an opportunity of assessing these intangible things that sometimes escape notice or cannot be put down on the examination paper.  However, the point I want to make is that when we talk about the examination system and changing it we are, largely, talking futilely.  We have to face a practical problem, and so far as I know nobody has suggested anything like a reasonable or workable alternative, especially when questions of fairness, equal chance for all candidates as far as possible, the elimination of personal influences, and so forth, are taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I should like to say to the Minister on this Estimate and which, I think, some of us have said to his predecessors in two Governments. After the child has received a basic education in the sense of adequately fitting him morally and intellectually for life there are the practical needs of modern life in regard to education to be taken into consideration. In stressing the practical aspect of it I want to make it quite clear that we are all agreed that the child's basic religious and philosophic training is of first importance, not so much in a question of detail as in the matter of general sound outlook, and that is more than ever true to-day. The child must, first of all, be brought <Col N="180" /> up to realise that religious, philosophic &mdash;if you like to use that word for want of a better one&mdash;and social ideas are basic and important, particularly important as a basis for life, and his whole outlook on life and the outlook of the community on life is ultimately to be reduced to this.  Admitting the importance and the primary nature of that requirement, we then have the second <i>desideratum</i>, namely, that it is a good thing to give the child as broad an education as possible built on the foundation of proper ideas which I have tried to put first.</P>
    <P>On top of that, we must then consider the practical requirements of life and these requirements are considerable&mdash; so considerable that the question of the time available for educating the child and young person and the amount that has to be got into that time pose a question of balance and must make our educators ask the following questions: What are the priorities?  How much time is to be allotted and what is the objective?  We must face the fact that having regard to the requirements of the average child and average young person in the community&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;average&rdquo; for the whole community and not in regard to children from any selected classes or with any selected objective in front of them &mdash;it will not be possible to cater for almost any particular subject to the extent that the theorist or one discussing the matter academically might think was desirable or even necessary. There is a practical point of view here which will have to be solved largely on the basis of cutting our garment to fit the cloth available&mdash;the cloth available in this particular case being the time factor and the requirement also of what the child is being educated for.  All that is very general but it is a necessary preliminary, perhaps as much to safeguard one from misrepresentation in the matter as anything else.</P>
    <P>Once the child has got a sound basic grip of the essential ideas he needs for guiding him through life, he wants a certain amount of definite equipment. What is it?  He needs, first, to be in a position to express himself accurately and to think accurately about ordinary <Col N="181" /> things.  That is achieved, in the first place, by having that background of definite solid ideas, religious, philosophical and social, laid down and imparted to him so that he has a background to which he can relate practical problems.  After that, he requires a facility for thinking clearly about the practical problems he is going to meet in life and to be able to express himself in regard to them.  For most of us these practical problems take a very humble form, if you like.</P>
    <P>There is the question of being able to write a clear and concise letter or to answer a letter clearly and concisely. There is the question of being able, say, to describe something that we have occasion to describe accurately, first of all, to grasp what we want to describe and, secondly, to describe it.  There is the question, for many people, of being able to make a report.  What that boils down to is accurate thinking when it comes to detail and an ability to express what we are thinking accurately.  I am not going into the subject of how far language is tied up with the processes of thinking, but this much is clear, anyway&mdash;that for the child it is essential that he has a grasp of his everyday language and that he can think simply and accurately in that language.</P>
    <P>That gets me to the teaching of English which is, if you like to put it so, unfortunately now the most used language by most of our people and the language that is used very much in our everyday affairs.  I find there was a lot to be said for the old system which concentrated in a humdrum and almost drudge-like way on such things as the elements of grammar, elementary composition&mdash;reading, writing and spelling, as it used to be called.  That system had this advantage, anyway, that it got the child down to detail. Instead of leaving him wander over a wide field, he was tied down to a narrower area but he was compelled to master that area in detail.  I think that is an important thing for us because I feel that, to some extent, one of our characteristics is a tendency to generalities and to a neglect of detail.  That tendency, I am afraid, was exaggerated and amplified by the <Col N="182" /> change in our educational system that took place in 1925, when the pendulum undoubtedly swung too far.</P>
    <P>I know there has been a corrective since and that that corrective is all to the good, but at one stage it had gone so far where, in the secondary schools particularly, the adolescent was introduced to a wide sphere of literature and all the rest of it to the detriment of his mastery of the more basic techniques and to the detriment of his ability to express himself.  It offered him an escape from detail in a wide wandering over a large field.  That has been largely corrected since, perhaps.</P>
    <P>I still feel that there is a need in our educational system to concentrate on these basic humdrum details.  As I pleaded in this sense before to the Minister's predecessor, I would like to make that point for consideration again.  It boils down to this, that one of the first requisites from the practical side and from the point of view of equipping a child for life is to give him ability to be able to do reading, writing and spelling.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the language aspect first, simple but accurate composition, accurate spelling and legible handwriting even though in this age of typewriters and all the rest of it it may be that handwriting is not of such commercial importance as it was.  Still, it is an important training for the child and, above all, definite composition, that is, to tie him down to expressing himself accurately about something definite.  And now as to the teaching of mathematics, I am afraid that to some extent here again there was a tendency to wander too far afield.  What does the average citizen in any walk of life, after he leaves school and college, really feel he needs?  What does any person here need for work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to understand the ordinary simple operations of arithmetic.  Some acquaintance with the most elementary algebra is of help. Some idea of elementary, straightforward Euclidean geometry is useful, but after that I do not think many of us, in the ordinary course of our lives, need anything further except we happen to be specialists and require further equipment.  In regard to such equipment as we do require we need facility, mastery and accuracy.</P>
      <P>These were the merits of the old intermediate system.  In the old intermediate system, starting in the primary school, the child learned his tables. The child who left the national school knew his tables and would always make two and two equal to four.  In doing a simple sum, whether he became a shopkeeper, served behind the counter or anything else he could be relied upon to have an intelligent grasp of the simple arithmetic involved. It aimed at securing a mastery of the fundamental, arithmetical techniques. In so far as algebra was concerned, the practical aspects of the subject were definitely taught and the forms of the tests and exercises were such as to give a facility and accuracy in the handling of these elementary operations and laid the groundwork for the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In geometry, he was confined to a definite system&mdash;a system that has stood the test of many centuries and after the experimentation that has been going on, my own view is that it is hard to beat him.  That is our old friend Euclid.  I know he was not popular with the schoolboy.  I hated him like poison myself, but his system had this definite merit, first of all, it was a logical system of geometry that taught you the fundamental facts about geometry which you might need for measuring a field, a tennis court or any of the ordinary everyday applications which are not very many.  In addition, it gave you a very useful practical training in logic.  It was a very practical and unostentatious method of teaching logical thinking.  It had this further merit, though this is probably the reason most children <Col N="184" /> abhorred it, it compelled a concentration and attention to detail which, I think, was very good for character.</P>
    <P>But be that as it may, the products of education at that time came out with a less general acquaintance with the general mathematical field than we find coming from our schools now but with a much greater mastery of the subjects which they had been taught. I see an advantage in limiting the approach in our primary and secondary schools to a limited amount of detail, and aiming at facility and accuracy in technique as against the approach of broad education in the line of mathematics at the expense of mastery of detail.  I think most people who have had occasion to deal with the student in the later stages, both in university and elsewhere, will agree that where higher mathematics are concerned the advantage is to have the child equipped in the ordinary arithmetical and mathematical knowledge needed to carry him through the ordinary average life.  In the past the children had that knowledge.  They were accurate and they were facile. The system had for them the great educational value that they had been trained to concentrate on certain things, to master certain things and to prosecute certain work to its ultimate conclusion.  I think such detailed training as that is very good character-training for a child, and that training is particularly necessary for an imaginative people such as we are.  That training and equipment was generally ample for the child in after life in whatever profession, business or career he chose to follow.  The knowledge was real.  It was applicable.  If the child wished to enter a sphere where further mathematical education was necessary, that approach was infinitely preferable to the general introductory approach that became so popular for a time after 1925.</P>
    <P>Consider the case of a child who ultimately becomes an accountant.  Is it not much better for him that he should have such a command of figures, the ordinary arithmetical and elementary algebraic operations, that he can, so to speak, almost perform the calculations blindfold?  Is it not much better that he should be swift, <Col N="185" /> sure and reliable in that technique? A child who has that foundation will have no difficulty in mastering systems of accountancy or in the practical application of the knowledge he has acquired.  His agility and facility will enable him to become really competent. On the other hand, the child who leaves school without that basic technique will fumble through life, make mistakes, never feel sure of himself, and be much slower because he has to stop and check.</P>
    <P>For a person who intends to go into business where a detailed knowledge of arithmetical methods is required the approach I have advocated is, I think, the desirable one.  The same principles hold good in relation to the child who intends to become a specialised mathematician later on or a specialised scientist in which occupation a considerable mathematical technique is required.  Those of us who went through the 1925 system subsequently found ourselves labouring under a certain difficulty.  We had been introduced in the secondary school to a very wide field.  We had been introduced to the theoretical basis of both the differential and the integral calculus.  We had gone considerably further in co-ordinate geometry than had our predecessors. That general knowledge was acquired at the expense of time that could have been more properly devoted to accurate manipulation and exercises in basic techniques.  We always found ourselves at a disadvantage in time, in speed, in accuracy as against people who had received the earlier basic training I am advocating now.  Our wider knowledge was not compensated for by the fact that we had got a premature preview of the wider theoretical field we later came to explore more fully.</P>
    <P>I have heard university professors express the opinion that they would prefer to have in their classes students who had heard nothing about the calculus but who knew the arithmetical, algebraic and fundamental geometrical formulae inside out.  I have heard them say they would prefer students who came to them knowing a little science and knowing that little well <Col N="186" /> rather than students who came with a general preview of the whole field.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the average requirements, I think it is too early to start specialising in the secondary school.  Even from the point of view of the child who subsequently becomes a specialist it is desirable to concentrate on the basic techniques, to restrict the curriculum with that object in view and to insist on accurate knowledge and facility.  The child who is equipped with that training will find no difficulty in acquiring the wider aspects afterwards.  There are many theoretical educationists who will not agree with me.  I wonder what the parents and the teachers think.</P>
    <P>I think we should endeavour to ensure that the programmes in both the secondary and the primary schools are adjusted to fit the child for his future life.  The language that he uses as his ordinary medium of communication should be taught to him in such a way that he will have an accurate knowledge of it, together with an insistence on good writing, good spelling and facility in expression.  He should be taught elementary mathematics so that he will have a complete mastery of them.  The same object should be pursued in relation to whatever other subjects he is taught.</P>
    <P>It is largely a question of balance.  I have compared the old system and the new.  I believe there has been a tendency towards correcting the balance over the last ten years.  It is a national failing on our part to try to evade detail.  I think it is a failing of all imaginative people.  Some corrective is necessary in relation to education. Most of my remarks apply to the training of the child in the secondary school.  It must be remembered that the primary school is really the basis of that training.  In the primary school, too, it is essential that there should be more emphasis laid on the importance of detail, concentration and the prosecuting of something to a definite conclusion.</P>
    <P>People who talk about education often fall into the error of being too specialised in their thinking about it. For that very reason they suffer from <Col N="187" /> the defects to which all specialists are prone.  Do we ever sufficiently consider the point of view and the problems of the average teacher and the average parent?  What does the parent want from education for his child?  I think the parent wants, first of all, that fundamental background to which I have referred.  He wants the child equipped to face life.  From that point of view that basic equipment is in reality the ordinary elementary subjects learned in the way that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>What about the teacher?  I have often wondered have we considered enough the teacher's practical problems in some of our general directions and in the ideas that have been thrown at our teachers from time to time.  Now, I am thinking rather of the individual teacher, the teacher with practical problems in his school rather than teachers as a body expressing themselves collectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the interesting points.  There is nobody who would have such a grasp of what the exact moment requires as the actual man who has a class before him, who has a particular set of children before him to teach, and who is engaged in imparting knowledge to them in a particular set of circumstances. There is nobody likely to have such a grasp of what the problem is, and what are the methods of attacking it as that particular man.  It is in that sense that I suggest that, perhaps, we have not been as close to the teachers in our thinking as we might have been. However, I content myself merely with making that suggestion to the Minister as another point of balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I will conclude with what I have to say on this generally.  As I said the last day&mdash;Deputy Collins is here now&mdash;I had no intention of wandering into that line at all, but some of his remarks were responsible for the <Col N="188" /> reply.  Now, there is another aspect of education.  I have mentioned it already in one connection and I mention it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In what sense does the Deputy hold me guilty of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that he should read his own speech.  The point is this&mdash;the importance of vocational training and of vocational education.  I have mentioned it already from the point of view of our teachers, but from the point of view of training technicians in this country&mdash;I am using it in the very broadest sense&mdash;of training people in the modern sense to be fitted to carry out whatever trade or calling they are following in the most efficient manner. From that point of view, modern industry and modern agriculture make certain demands.  It is to be noted that already in other countries certain difficulties have arisen.  It would take too long now to digress on that completely, but some of those difficulties have largely arisen, I grant you, from the armament drive and research</P>
      <P>In the case of a man of that sort, basically there are two problems involved. There is, first of all, the problem of producing the research man of the director type.  He needs a pretty broad education.  One of the things that were found to be at fault in certain places, in America anyway, was that in an effort to get specialists quickly there was over specialisation at too early a date.  Consequently, the education of those people was found to be deficient. That, I suppose, is a problem for our universities, but, so far as the Minister's Department is concerned, there is the problem of supplying to our industries, in so far as they want him, that type of man, and then, on top of that, there is the question of technicians; that is the man who is trained in a particular line, more narrowly but in greater detail to operate plant and carry out certain processes and so forth.  The training of such personnel is indispensable in modern organisation, and if we are to go ahead with industrial expansion here some provision will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be noted that elsewhere there <Col N="189" /> seems to be a shortage in some particular lines of people trained in that way.  It is a matter that we might be thinking about in this country.  The obvious way to deal with any deficiency that there may be in that particular category is through our vocational education establishments.  I would merely like to point out that there is an important future for that side of education here&mdash;that is if we are to succeed in developing this country in many ways in which it should be developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks which I propose to offer on this Estimate will naturally be more or less based on what my own experience has been, as well as on the views of pupils coming out of our primary schools.  I believe it is essential for us to try to get back in our own minds to the time when the students or pupils leaving the national schools in rural Ireland were able to travel further afield without, perhaps, ever having a thought in their minds of entering the doors of either a secondary school or a college. We must realise that if there were boys and girls in rural Ireland educated solely by a national schoolteacher able to travel from this country and able to hold their own in those days against the very hardest competition, either in this country or in other countries, then there must be something lacking in the present system which was so manifest and so noticeable in the past.  We all know, of course, that through force of circumstances many of our young men and women educated in our national schools had to go to America, for instance. We realise that when they did go they were able to avail of whatever opportunities came their way.  They were able to do that because the foundation of their education had been well laid in the national schools of this country. The standard of education which they received at that time was such that they were able to avail of any opportunities which presented themselves to them in America or elsewhere, and thereby proved themselves to be a credit both to their own people and their own country.</P>

    <P>If we are to base any discussion on <Col N="190" /> education in the national schools in rural Ireland, I believe that, first of all, we must lay particular stress on the condition of the schools where the pupils do their studies.  Some of us were educated in national schools that were anything but a credit to the country.  It is certainly trying on boys and girls to work in schools, so many of which are so dilapidated and so ill-kept. That, in itself, is certainly no incentive to the average boy or girl to settle down to the many problems placed before him or her by the teacher.  I agree that improvements have been noticeable for some years past in the way of providing new national schools.  A certain number of the schools have been renovated.  It is appalling, I believe, that we should have to admit that such a large percentage of our national school buildings are in a disgraceful condition.  I wonder is that due to the fact that there is not a full sense of understanding and co-operation&mdash;if there is not, I would not say that it is intentional &mdash;between the central authorities, the Department responsible, the local authorities and the local managers.  If there is not that full sense of understanding and co-operation, I believe that, even at this stage, we should attempt immediately to try to get it, in view of the fact that it is so essential.</P>
    <P>I will be quite candid in speaking on this.  I have in mind one school building in the County Cork.  I have had occasion to ask questions in the Dáil about it over the past few years.  I want to say here openly that, while there has been a very long delay and no attempt, so far, to go on with the building, I honestly believe myself that most of the responsibility for that delay rests locally with the people responsible, and not with the Department. Even if we are so insistent at times on blaming a Department of State, we must be prepared to blame other people no matter who they are if the blame should justly be placed upon those people.  I believe that that insistence is essential at the very start because the lives of these children, <Col N="191" /> both from a mental and a physical viewpoint, are vitally concerned, and they must be educated in decent surroundings and in decent buildings.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of badly kept and dilapidated school buildings, we have the terrible problem of the very bad system of sanitary arrangements throughout rural Ireland.  It is not impossible, no matter what anyone may say, to provide adequate sanitary arrangements in those buildings.  If, for instance, certain sections of the community obtain, as they are justly entitled to obtain, grants for the provision of water supplies, etc., we should also be prepared to provide a proper water supply and decent sanitary arrangements in every national school building.  We know, of course, at the outset that money is the problem in many of these cases.  Unless we base a scheme for the eradication of such conditions in these schools on a fairly long-term policy it would cost an enormous amount of money.  Yet if we adopted a scheme which would make certain improved facilities available it could be said that some progress had been made.  We realise that the sanitary authorities and the architectural experts have their viewpoint. When it is suggested that certain sanitary arrangements should be provided for the schools the architect who is called in on the job, whether he is an outside man or employed as an architect in the Board of Works, will start off with plans that will cost a huge amount of money, but surely when we understand that because so much money is involved there is a danger that nothing may be done, we should be prepared to say that to bring about a certain degree of improvement in those conditions would at least be an attempt to remedy the present unsatisfactory state of some of these school buildings and make them a little more comfortable for those affected.  We must admit that although it is desirable to have the most up-to-date sanitary arrangements in old school buildings, some of these buildings are in such a very poor state that it might not be so advantageous to spend a large amount in renovating them.  However, <Col N="192" /> we should at least endeavour to ease the position to some extent.</P>
    <P>In this connection I will say again that in any attempted drive in that direction we would be entitled to expect both the local authorities and the manager responsible for the school to throw their weight into this important subject with us.  I am not always in favour of large amounts of money being expected from local parishes towards contributions for various projects. When you know from experience the way of life and the standard of income of people living in a parish, you realise how hard it is for them to pay money for these projects, but I sincerely believe that the average family in rural Ireland would be prepared to throw in their 6d. or 1/- a week for a certain period towards funds to be raised locally by the responsible manager if the local authorities were also empowered, and not just empowered but compelled, to see that sanitary conditions would be at least adequate.  But they cannot do that unless the Minister for Education and his Department give a lead to those people.  They must tell those people that while so much must be expected from them, the lead will be given by the Department but that only on consideration of the local contributions being offered and secured by the Department would the work be carried on.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to mention is one to which I have referred on previous occasions on this Estimate.  It is one on which I have very strong views and that is the question of school books.  I cannot understand why a boy or a girl has to get so many school books at the start of the school term. The parents may have to pay anything from 10/- to £1 or 30/- or even more. That child goes through the whole term studying from the school books provided and the teacher will spend his or her time explaining the problems to that student.  Yet the following year, when there may be another member of the family stepping into the class from which the older boy or girl is leaving, that self-same text-book must be scrapped.  Why is that?  I believe there is some undercurrent or ring <Col N="193" /> operating in this country whereby school books must be changed year after year.  Some of us even in this House, who have our education solely from national schools, can recall that books that we used were also used by members senior to us in our own families.  If, in our time, it was possible for such a system to operate, why is it that fathers and mothers of young families are being fleeced continually year after year, that books, having been in use for 12 months, must be scrapped because, while they are apparently suitable for one certain year and for one certain pupil, the next member of the family, perhaps 12 months afterwards, is told: &ldquo;The book that your sister had is not sufficient. Go and get your father and mother to fork out more money.&rdquo;  I would be anxious that the Minister would do his utmost at least to have this matter investigated.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, it is not a new system that is operating since the present Minister took office.  The same system was in operation while the last Minister was in office and also before his time again.  Because it is going on so long and because I myself, as one member, and any other member that mentioned it, never received satisfactory replies from the Minister that we must keep on urging a remedy to the problem.  Many of us must have in our minds the firm conviction that it is because it suits certain people, certain booksellers, that this system is continuing in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera touched on one point on this subject which I intended to mention and which I believe it is vitally important to discuss.  I believe it is essential that there should be an agricultural bias or slant attached to teaching in rural Ireland, at any rate. Many of the subjects that are being taught are advantageous in themselves. Year after year continuous complaints are being offered about the emigration of boys, girls, men and women from rural Ireland.  In my view, we are encouraging them to leave the rural areas because they are not being given any information which would help them towards a higher and better standard of living in their native districts.  If we <Col N="194" /> are to get boys and girls interested in settling in rural Ireland, when they reach manhood, economic conditions must be such as to satisfy them that they will be able to make a livelihood there.  In boyhood and girlhood they must be taught to realise the true value of country life.  People living in towns and cities, and I have in mind some residents of Cork City, come out to the country and say to us: &ldquo;How do you ever live in the country?&rdquo;  They offer continuous complaints about country life and they are sincere in their complaints and mean no harm by them. They do not realise that they could be made to understand the advantages attached to country life.  It is only by giving people a full understanding of that peace and happiness which rural life can offer, if economic conditions are favourable, that they will realise the advantages that can be attached to such a life.  I believe that we should go back to the system of pointing out to the boys and girls that all around them in the countryside is something which they can never get in the cities and towns, no matter what they may be told about the lights, the beautiful conditions, and all the advantages attached to these places.  I feel certain that every member of this House, irrespective of his Party, is anxious to see the economic conditions in rural Ireland improved.  However, even if economic standards of life there were better, they would serve no useful purpose unless the inhabitants of rural areas were given a true philosophy based on a full understanding of what country life has to offer them, if they would only remain in their native places.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the national school teacher.  Deputy de Valera, when speaking about the national school teacher, said that he had in mind the individual himself or herself rather than the collective body.  This is what I have in mind also.  I am aware that one of the biggest drawbacks in our educational system at the present time is the worry of teachers about the examination system.  In national schools, where there may be large numbers of pupils, one may find a few boys and girls who may be much <Col N="195" /> higher in their standard than the others because they may be more brilliant than the average pupil.  That in itself, of course, is an incentive for the teacher to do his utmost so that those boys and girls may get places, as it were, in life.  In my view, our educational system is wrong in so far as everything else in the classroom is subordinated to the forthcoming examination. Year after year the teacher must try to base his views on specific questions set down in examination papers for some years past.  Because the teacher is anxious to have his pupils succeed in an examination, he must keep them within a narrow channel.  He must dispense with any teaching which does not cover questions on which the examination may be based.  I am not going to discuss those who prepare the question papers; that is another subject.  Perhaps they have set views because they are anxious that the children taking the examination, by being narrowed into this channel of education, will strike a certain line later on in life.  However, if the children had to do less examinations and were, instead, given a broader outlook in general education, we would be far better off in this country.  I will mention one point just as an instance.  I came across a little girl the other evening&mdash;a little relation of my own, just nine years old.  She was doing some arithmetic, and she asked me to help her out.  I found that this little girl had an excellent knowledge of her tables.  Her difficulty was that her tables were in Irish while the arithmetic she had to do was in English, and though she knew her tables perfectly she was not able to translate them into English.  If that child and other children are confined to a channel in which they will have to study papers dealing with certain examinations, it is no use for us to say that they can be given the broader and the truer sense of education which we all desire.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, though it may not be possible, that a system should be operated by which the results of the examinations, even of inspectors, would be based on the over-all intelligence <Col N="196" /> of pupils in each class in each school.  I would go further so far as the teacher in rural Ireland is concerned. I would go so far as to offer, by way of encouragement, to that teacher and to the children, be they boys or girls, substantial prizes for a group of parishes offering the best school having the best classes on all subjects.  That means that one or two children, who may be more intelligent than the others, would not be picked out for special mention but that the report would be based on the children as a whole.  That may not be possible, but surely something along those lines should be done rather than continue our present system.  What is happening in schools in rural Ireland at the present time is that one or two children who are inclined to be brilliant are picked out for special attention.  All effort is concentrated on them so as to get them through the examinations. Unfortunately, the other children throw in the sponge, as it were.  They anxiously await the day when they can leave school.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, when these children have finished school they are completely at a loss to know what they are going to do with their lives.  I know, of course, that this is correct but I have no intention of moving away from the subject under discussion because it is confined to primary teachers and education. However, I believe, as Deputy de Valera believes, that we should have a discussion, as we will have, as to whether there could be a slight preparation in the national schools for the possibility of technical education at a later stage.  This would improve the outlook educationally of our children. and I believe that that in itself would act as an encouragement to the fathers and mothers of these children.  It would show them that there would be an opening in life for their families very different from the opening at the present time.</P>
    <P>Fathers and mothers are anxious, if they can manage it at all, to send a son or daughter into a commercial school in Cork City, but the market is often so overcrowded, the competition so keen, and, to be frank, the wages <Col N="197" /> in some offices of such a standard, that it would not pay a boy or girl from the countryside to take up such employment. When these children grow up and find that there is no possibility of getting into such branches of employment in their own country, they must set off for the cities or across the water.</P>
    <P>If we are prepared, as we must be, to try to give them that broader sense of educational understanding of life, we must be ready to offer even radical changes, and, in offering these changes, we must take the national school teacher into our confidence.  We, all of us, at one time thought that our biggest enemy was the national school teacher&mdash;when we were kids and had to hold out our hands so often&mdash;but later we came to realise that they are human beings like Deputy MacCarthy or Deputy Palmer and that their anxiety is to do their utmost for the boys and girls under them to help them to face a future life.  We must be willing to take these teachers into our confidence and to listen to their suggestions and even to their complaints.  They are on the spot, as Deputy de Valera said and they realise the advantages and disadvantages of the system.  It is essential for us to concentrate on building a higher standard of education and, with co-operation from the teachers, I believe that we will have less complaints from fathers and mothers&mdash; genuine complaints&mdash;in the future. Co-operation must come from the local people as well as from the Department. It must come from the local authority and the manager.  With that co-operation provided a lead is given by the Department we will, I hope, at least be setting out on the road to a better standard in our primary schools, which mean so much to the boys and girls of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to preface my remarks by saying that, since the present Minister took charge of the direction of education in this country, he has given encouragement and confidence to those who are engaged in that high and holy work.  That, in the first instance, is a great encouragement to those who are engaged in what is indeed a hard and difficult work.  Growing up as he did, knowing the villages, the rural areas and the schools that were there in his early years&mdash;which we all remember&mdash;he has as a fundamental background for his examination of the problems of education in his own experience, the faults and merits of the various aspects of the educational system.  He has seen the bad schools and he is doing his best to remedy them as speedily as possible, to give them the amenities that should be theirs, to see that the school building should be an outstanding building in each parish, that it should be a centre of education and culture for which <Col N="199" /> both the parents and the students would have a high regard, of which they would be proud as the place where the pupils are fitted out with a certain competence in life.</P>
    <P>As far as primary education is concerned, we have had the experience of teachers who have been abroad.  Some of us from time to time who have travelled and have taken an interest in similar schools in other lands are convinced that our standards here are as good as they are in any comparable country in the world, even in countries far bigger than ours and with greater financial resources.  Perhaps sometimes those who have recourse to cities may be a bit brighter than those who have been educated in some country schools.  They may make a better show at examinations and may have the advantage of experience in some respects, but it is certain that the rural children are as fundamentally sound and as well able to face life in the educational sphere as those in most other countries.</P>
    <P>A council of education has been sitting for some time and has been considering the programme for the national schools.  I do not think there is very much wrong with the programmes. Perhaps, as Deputy Desmond has said, most people will agree that in the rural schools there should be some education in rural science which applies to the life in the country around them, in local history, the national monuments in the area and so on.  That is a thing that Padraig Pearse when he wrote &ldquo;The Murder Machine&rdquo; had in mind, when he spoke of freedom for the teacher and freedom for the scholars.  If the teacher wishes on a very warm day to take the children for a little walk to a nearby castle or abbey, to make the history of the locality more vivid, and if an inspector comes along and finds the teacher should have been doing arithmetic or something else, then, if he is doing useful work and can stand over what he is doing, it should be all right. That is a case where too much rigidity should not be insisted upon.  It is not education to be all the time with your nose to the grindstone, that you must <Col N="200" /> be doing arithmetic from 10.30 till 11 a.m. and if you are stuck in the middle of a problem or if the children are specially interested and you carry on until 11.15 and the inspector walks in when you should have been at geography or something else, that there is an adverse paragraph written in the report about it.  There should be more freedom for the teacher.</P>
    <P>The primary certificate entails an examination now in the primary schools and it is looked upon as the aim of primary education to get pupils to obtain this particular certificate.  I was speaking to some parents recently, very intelligent people, and they said that their children were better educated before the primary certificate was introduced and that they are quite convinced of that.  They said that when it came along first they were quite satisfied that, as somebody said, it would set a standard and would show the pupil had qualified in a certain course.  Perhaps the primary certificate should not be entirely condemned or at least an examination at the end of the primary course.  What I say about it is that it is quite unreasonable to expect that every child in the school on reaching that standard should be compelled to undergo an examination in every subject, even a subject for which he has no taste and in which he is not competent.</P>
    <P>In the secondary schools there are more or less selected pupils.  At any rate, there is a selection in other schools and from different walks of life, where they are going forward through education to get a position that education will help them to secure.  In the national schools, however, you have everybody who is striving to get a fundamental grasp of the basis of education which will enable them to go about their ordinary working business. Some pupils are not good at arithmetic and as everyone knows we very often find that those who are good at arithmetic are not so good at literature and those who are good at literature are not good at mathematics, though you might find an exception.  It certainly discourages a pupil who may be good at some subjects to be put in for an examination in all the branches. <Col N="201" /> Why not let him do, for the primary certificate, apart from the fundamentals just the particular subjects for which he is fitted?  In the secondary schools and other schools you have a pass paper and an honours paper.  If the primary certificate is to continue, why not have a pass paper and an honours paper in the same way, so that those who are not as good as the others may have an opportunity of taking a pass paper in one subject and an honours paper in another according to their ability?  That will give them encouragement that they are not working as cogs in a machine but that their capabilities and capacity are being taken into account and that they are being catered for in their own particular sphere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond has spoken about the books and their cost and the reason for the change in books.  We all know that in our own days the books passed down as a kind of heirloom through all the members of the family and the same books did for any school. The reason was perfectly obvious.  The system of education then was designed to do one thing: it was designed to teach us English and to get away from Irish.  They kept a standard set of books and when a boy went to school he learned off by heart: &ldquo;Jack has got a cart and can draw sand and clay in it,&rdquo; or something like that, but ask him to pick out the particular words and he would not be able to do it.  They learned these lessons by rote and their parents before them had the same lessons and so had even the senior members of the family and all were able to recite them.  That is how they got the English into the schools in our father's time and even in our own early days, even to the exclusion of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I often advocate that we should have a standard set of books in Irish for a number of years until the pupils get a grip of the language.  In the Gaeltacht they could depart from that but in other areas they should stick to those standard books at least for a few years.  It was most discouraging in years gone by, and even up to the present to some extent, when a pupil <Col N="202" /> learning Irish came across words spelled in a particular way on one page and on the next page, where the lesson was by a different writer, the same words were spelled differently.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that there are three Irish dialects and that the Minister did not speak in any of them &mdash;that he spoke more or less what was known as official Irish, whatever that may be.  Some of us have travelled all over Ireland.  We have been in Irish colleges and have met people from all parts of the country.  The differences between the dialects in Irish are no more acute than they are between the dialects of the spoken language anywhere in any country&mdash;England, France, even America, where there may be a different type of slang in the North and in the South&mdash;but the fundamentals of the spoken language are similar.  The Irish language is rich in dialect and vocabulary.  Anybody who criticises the use of a dialect or the blending of dialects is doing no service to the language, because the language is intrinsically the same in the north, south, east or west.  Whatever little peculiarities we may have we have them in our nature as well as in our dialects.  Anybody can appreciate that fact.</P>
    <P>With regard to books, the standardisation of spelling is a great advance.  The spelling has been standardised up to the third or fourth class but has not yet, I think, been standardised in the higher standards.  It is not so important there because the reading is more varied.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the changing of books.  That is due to the grouping of classes In our young days classes were not grouped except for singing and one or two other subjects. There was no grouping, say, of the first and second class, the third and fourth, and fifth and sixth, for reading. If the same book were kept on for a second year one group of children would be repeating for a second year the book they had learned in the previous year, which would not be to their advantage and which would be monotonous.  There is this further difficulty, that some pupils are kept for <Col N="203" /> a second year in a class.  They would be studying the same book again. Education must be made varied and attractive for those who are not very smart, just as for those who are bright.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned arithmetic. Inspectors and teachers will tell you that a completely satisfactory arithmetic for the primary school has never yet been published.  Arithmetics used contain such problems as: &ldquo;Find the cost of 27 horses at £84 17s. 6½d. each.&rdquo;  Who ever bought a horse and paid prices like that?  These problems have no relation to life.  I would suggest that an arithmetic should be compiled having a certain number of mental exercises at the beginning in Irish and in English, followed by a certain number of written exercises, and then followed by a number of problems in the particular process in Irish and in English.  At this stage all the arithmetics should be bilingual, with Irish and English on every successive page.  The time has come for it.  I would not have long obscure questions of three or four lines.  The questions should be simply put so that the children will understand the Irish word for &ldquo;multiply&rdquo;, &ldquo;divide&rdquo;, &ldquo;add&rdquo;, &ldquo;subtract&rdquo;, &ldquo;buy&rdquo;, &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, and these other everyday terms.  It should not be complicated.  The exercises should be set in a simple way that the children understand from their knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>A very good feature of education is the granting of scholarships to summer colleges.  The Gaelic Athletic Association must get its meed of credit in that respect.  Colleagues of mine, Séamus Long and Seán Óg Ó Murchadha and others, were interested in that matter and promoted scholarships which were confined to children who played in the school shield teams or in minor competitions, and so on.  They are continuing to fill some of the summer Irish colleges in that way.  Games and education are combined and the children get a knowledge of the country and associate with pupils from various parts of the country.  It is admirable work.  I was very glad to see that after his appointment as Minister one of the first things the Minister <Col N="204" /> did was to pay an official visit to some of these colleges where pupils of that kind were fruitfully spending their holidays.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I would like to deal is vocational education. Wonderful strides are being made in vocational education.  Everybody is delighted with the progress that is being made.  Apart from the work of the schools, which is excellent, there is a link-up now between the vocational schools and industries.  That link is becoming more extended year by year.  There is a link between the schools and the Motor Traders' Association.  On the domestic side, the gas companies give prizes for cooking. The millers also give prizes.  This co-operation between the vocational schools and industry is one of the most encouraging developments in education in recent years.  There had been a tendency to stress unduly the purely academic side of education, to prepare pupils for the leaving certificate examination.  Having passed that examination, the pupils tried to get into the Civil Service or into local government positions, the Electricity Supply Board and other Government or semi-Government organisations.  They would continue at school up to the age of 17 or 18 years and, if they failed to obtain appointments in such concerns, they were not qualified for commercial offices because they had not shorthand and typewriting, or book-keeping. They were unfit for legal offices or positions of that kind and at that stage they had to learn shorthand, typewriting or book-keeping or just emigrate, because they were untrained to work with their hands.  We were training too many pupils on these lines for the opportunities subsequently offering.  One can imagine the disappointment to their parents afterwards.</P>
    <P>I remember the case of one boy who obtained honours at his leaving certificate examination and at 24 years of age he never had got a day's work.  He subsequently got along all right but one can imagine the early disappointment which his parents must have experienced after having had such high hopes of him in his schooldays.  We <Col N="205" /> hear a good deal about juvenile delinquency and of young lads roaming about the roads at a critical period in their lives.  I do not know what suggestion we could make to deal with that problem but, at any rate, the development of vocational training is bound to give us a better balance at that age.  The teachers in schools, such as for instance the North Monastery school in Cork, will be able to advise certain of their pupils: &ldquo;You would be better off in the technical school; I do not think you would make the grade in the leaving certificate&rdquo;.  That is a system of advice and training that we ought to encourage.</P>
    <P>So far as higher education is concerned, I think the standard is really very good but the question arises as to whether or not in the promotion of the Irish language we should have oral examinations for secondary schools.  It would be rather difficult to examine all the pupils orally in Irish.  At the same time, it used to be done at one time in the colleges.  There was an oral examination in those subjects and a reversion to that system might be worth considering. We hear some people saying the Irish language is not making good progress.  I can never agree with such people.  I think it is making wonderful progress.  No doubt the number of people in the Gaeltacht is declining, but if the people who leave the Gaeltacht go to some other part of the country, they are not a loss to the nation and they know quite well that their children will be encouraged to speak the language in the schools.  If they go abroad, of course, they are a very serious loss to the country.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I think the extension of the amenities of life, such as the Electricity Supply Board services, available in the more populous districts, to Gaeltacht areas would do much to induce people to remain there. I have advocated before that instead of erecting large vocational schools, which may be all right for big towns we might adopt a scheme in rural parishes whereby one additional room would be added to the national school in each parish.  This room could be utilised for instruction in woodwork, rural science and domestic science and <Col N="206" /> music on alternate nights.  It is far easier to arrange to have teachers travel around to these schools than to have the pupils travelling long distances. It would not, of course, be advisable to have the instruction given at night in rooms that had been occupied by children during the day.  In the first place, it would not be so hygienic as if extra rooms were available for this instruction.  If such rooms are available, they can be thoroughly ventilated during the day and I believe you would get better results.  Irish classes could also be held in these schools at night.  There would be a kind of continuation school, so to speak, in each district so that the language learned in the primary schools would not be lost.  At intervals there would be an Irish dance or song&mdash;a blend of cultural and social life as the evening went by.  The Minister was in Cork recenly at a Cór-Fhéile in which all the pupils of the city schools participated.  It was conducted on a non-competitive basis and no prizes were awarded.  The entertainment lasted for a week and consisted of songs in our own language as well as an occasional song in other tongues. Four thousand children from the national schools participated in that Cór-Fhéile which was a magnificent success.  The city hall was filled night after night for the whole week.  The Minister was present at the opening entertainment which was held on the Sunday evening in the Savoy cinema. It was a most exhilarating experience for all who had the good fortune to be present at these entertainments and the teachers and pupils of the schools which participated are deserving of the highest approbation.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer although I do not think that, strictly speaking, it comes under the Minister's Estimate.  Even though we have a certain number of agricultural schools in the country such as Darraragh, Glasnevin and Athenry, and a dairy science school in Cork which caters just for the dairying industry&mdash;creameries, milk and butter production, etc.&mdash;we have no faculty of agriculture in this agricultural country. There is no faculty of agriculture in any of our universities where a person <Col N="207" /> could take out a comprehensive degree in agriculture.  We have, of course, faculties covering medicine and various other professions although many of the graduates with such degrees subsequently go abroad.  I think that agriculture should be put on a pedestal at least as high as that of the other faculties in our universities.  At least in Cork and Galway, there should be a special faculty of agriculture so that those who are trained in the various agricultural colleges throughout the country would have an opportunity by means of scholarships or otherwise, of high qualifications and knowledge of our basic industry.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on his efforts in getting the electrical engineering faculty established in Cork University College.  We hear a lot of talk about centralisation nowadays but heretofore it was necessary for students from Cork to come for their third and fourth year courses to an already overcrowded city here in Dublin.  Apart from that, only a certain number, not more than perhaps five or six, would be accepted in Dublin in that particular branch.  The building to be erected in the near future will be of permanent local value and will remain there to the Minister's credit in years to come.  Work like that is of genuine permanent national benefit.</P>
    <P>With co-operation and goodwill, this country, which had such a name in the past for learning and culture and the love of education which its people had down through the ages, will again in the general standards which are set before the people in the educational sphere keep those higher ideals of faith and nationality which a nation should cherish, with love for its history and for its patriots.  I think the present system of education, the present system of managership of schools, where proper co-operation is shown, will tend to bring out in the people of our nation the high ideals which are the rich heritage of the nation, so that the minds, bodies and souls of the people will be adapted to the tradition <Col N="208" /> that years of struggle have brought down to them for their edification. The present Minister is working on right lines, and with these remarks I close by saying: Beannacht Dé ar an obair.</P>

      <P>The high opinions which most people have of the present Minister were also shared to a considerable extent by his predecessor.  I for one had a very considerable admiration for the Minister's predecessor, and I believe that, like the present Minister, he set himself a very high ideal in regard to education.  I feel that perhaps he did not succeed in achieving everything he set out to do, but I must say that it was not for the want of effort.  I sincerely hope that the present Minister will be long enough in office to achieve the high ideals he has set himself and that when he retires he will have solved or gone a certain distance towards solving all the difficulties which face him and which face the educational system in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true to say that everything is bad in the educational sphere.  I do not entirely agree with the very optimistic attitude of the last speaker, Deputy MacCarthy.  I know that he is quite sincere in the views he has expressed, but I think he was looking entirely at the bright side of the picture. There is, however, another side of the picture.  There is on one side the students who have succeeded, the minority who have gone to the top, who, in every sphere, have made a success of their lives.  There is on the other side the large number who have failed to achieve very much in life, the large number who cannot find a livelihood in this country, the large number who cannot find a satisfactory means of livelihood here, and the large number who face life ill-equipped.  We ought <Col N="209" /> to make up our minds that in our educational system we shall strive to improve matters.  Even if it is as good as Deputy MacCarthy said, there is always room for improvement and it is on these lines that we have to think.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the young primary teachers coming together, just as the young farmers are coming together, trying to find ways and means of improving the educational system, of improving the standard of education in their schools.  They are the people who can do it, not the people at the head of the Department or even the Minister.  With zeal and enthusiasm on the part of our teachers, particularly the younger teachers, much good can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister remarked, and it is no harm to make a passing comment on it, that through organisation and improved methods he has been able to reduce the staff of his Department by four.  I was wondering by what process these four were eliminated.  I assume at least that they were not taken out and shot.  It is satisfactory, however, to find that in one Department an effort is being made to carry out the work which is being done with a lesser staff through improved organisational methods.  That is something which deserves being commented upon, because it is something which we hope every Minister will try to achieve within his Department.  A lot has been said during the past month or two about the burdens which have been placed on the taxpayer.  The only way to relieve these burdens to any extent is by reducing expenditure and that can only be done by ever-increasing efficiency.  Even though the results in this Department may appear to be small it is satisfactory to see that a step has been taken in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his introductory statement commented on the fact that the Council of Education at the moment are grappling with the problems of primary education.  Their operations are being conducted under two headings&mdash;(1) the function of primary education and (2) the curriculum to be pursued in the primary schools up to the age of 12 years.  It is evident from <Col N="210" /> this that the Council of Education are not completely satisfied with the progress being made in regard to primary education and that they have some hope that improvements can be achieved.  I think there are sound reasons for suggesting that a change of programme in the primary schools should be introduced in or about the age of 12 years.  The education of children under the age of 12 years should be confined, in the main, to the three R's&mdash;to getting a clear and firm grasp of the fundamental educational subjects, reading, writing and arithmetic. These ought to be instilled into the minds of the younger children.  It is not essential that children should at an early age acquire a large volume of knowledge but they should master completely what they are taught so that they can go forward towards advanced education or through life itself with a feeling of confidence and self-assurance.  That is the first essential in education.</P>
    <P>It might be desirable to introduce something in the form of technical education or agricultural education, if you like, into the primary schools for children who have reached 12 years of age.  At the age of 12 children are beginning to take a keen interest in life.  They are beginning to be naturally inquisitive in regard to life.  It is at that age that I think they should be introduced to even an elementary outline of vocational education.  It is particularly necessary that stress should be laid upon agricultural education or rural science.  Even in the towns and cities, a certain amount of such knowledge should be imparted to children.  It may be said that if you introduce a subject such as rural science into the primary schools you are cutting in on the time allotted to the ordinary educational subjects. The amount of time required need not be very great.  Even one or two hours per week would be sufficient if the teacher is enthusiastic in imparting this knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in concluding his opening statement, said: &ldquo;I have nothing startling to record.&rdquo;  It is time a Minister for Education had something startling to record.  In to-day's papers we read that the <Col N="211" /> Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, the Most Reverend Dr. Lucey, has something very startling to record particularly as far as rural Ireland is concerned.  He is reported in to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i> as saying: &ldquo;Rural Ireland is stricken and dying.  The will to marry and live on the land is almost gone.&rdquo; I think those words are a serious reflection on our primary education, on our educational system generally and, as a matter of fact, on our entire economic system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely true.  It is unnecessary to say so because the Most Reverend Dr. Lucey is one of those men who have studied the social problems affecting our people, and particularly the problems of rural Ireland, most intensively over a long period. There can be no question whatever about the truth of the statement. Rural Ireland will continue to decline unless something startling is done to change the attitude of our people towards life and towards rural life generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say it is satisfactory to see that the Council of Education are grappling with this problem.  If we can, even in our primary schools, instil into the minds of children over 12 years of age a bias towards rural life, towards agriculture, towards growing plants, towards animals and all the things that make up life on the land, we will achieve something of merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the old hedge schools were, in some ways, more successful, in spite of all the handicaps they had to contend with, than are our primary schools to-day.  I do not entirely agree with that statement but certainly it is true that the hedge schools achieved remarkable results. It may be that those hedge schools were closer to the life of the people, closer to the land, to the animals and to the plants.  I am not, of course, referring to the ash plant which might, possibly, have had some influence on the educational system.  Education as <Col N="212" /> we know it is not tending to make our young people desirous of living in rural Ireland and I think it is well that an effort should be made to change that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement, referred to the fact that an experiment has been tried out during the past year in conjunction with Macra na Feirme, the Young Farmers' Clubs, with a view to instilling into the minds of young children a greater interest in rural life. He stated that a project is on foot to assist and encourage young boys, and I assume young girls also, to own and rear some animal on their homesteads with a view to making them more interested in rural life.  I think that, as time goes on, that idea will achieve results.  It is only in its experimental stage now but there is no reason why a boy of 12 or 13 should not be encouraged to own some property, particularly agricultural property or live stock such as a bonham, a lamb or a calf.  In that way he would learn at a very early age something of the joys and sorrows and risks of farming.  The boy who is given a lamb or a young pig may find that it does not thrive. He may find that it will sicken, that it will die but in that way he is introduced to the problems of agricultural life.  In the majority of cases he will find that it will thrive and flourish.  In that way the boy will be encouraged to take a keen interest in agricultural life.  Where it is not possible for a boy or girl to have live stock of that kind encouragement should be given to him or her to own a little plot of land&mdash;just a few square yards&mdash;on which to grow plants, vegetables or flowers, thereby giving to our young people at an early age an interest in the land.  The Young Farmers' Clubs or the clubs of any other progressive association in the parish can help immeasurably towards the achievement of that idea by encouraging the parents and elder brothers to take an interest in the scheme and make it a success.  The Minister alone cannot do it.  No scheme of that kind should be put into operation without the co-operation and consent of the parents.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in relation to education generally about which it <Col N="213" /> is necessary to make some comment. I think I have remarked already that a percentage of children fail to make the grade.  They do not come out of the primary or secondary schools as good as they ought to.  Very often the teachers will say&mdash;and, perhaps, truly &mdash;that it is because of the training they have received in their homes.  No matter how important education is, no matter how important secondary education is, the most important education of all is that which very young children receive in their homes.  If the foundations are falsely laid in the home, it will be very, very difficult even for the best teachers in the world and with the best of goodwill to achieve success.</P>
    <P>Because of that the problem arises of how to ensure that children will be better taught in their homes.  Fundamentally, it would appear that the only way is to start with the children by educating them well so that when they in turn come to be parents they will give good example to their children. I think there is another aspect of this question which has got to be considered and that is the whole problem of adult education.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister made some comment in regard to evening schools.  I agree with that comment to a certain extent but I am enthusiastically in favour of evening schools.  In so far as those of our children who have not had the opportunity of getting a secondary education are concerned they should have the opportunity, in every district throughout the length and breadth of the land, of attending evening schools, so that, as Deputy MacCarthy pointed out, they can continue learning some of the subjects which they were taught in the primary schools.  Those evening schools should be run on an entirely different system from that of the national schools.  They would be purely voluntary in the first place and there would be no compulsory attendance. The young people would attend voluntarily and the subjects that they would learn would be voluntary subjects.</P>
    <P>For example, an effort should be made to have a course of subjects for two nights each week in the rural areas.  Those boys or girls who would not be interested in the subjects on <Col N="214" /> one particular night could attend on the other night.  Some might have a deeper interest in Irish, history or subjects of that kind and they would attend on the particular night those classes were being held.  Others might be more interested in rural science or woodwork.  They would attend on the particular night allocated to those particular subjects.  In that way education would be continued on, perhaps, for five or six years after the young people had left the primary schools.</P>
    <P>It would become a sort of pastime just as in the days, when the Gaelic League was in the zenith of its power, it was a pastime for so many young people who attended the Gaelic classes. Young people between the ages of 15 and 20 are always anxious to learn. If given the right incentive, instruction and opportunity they will attend, perhaps, not all the classes that are provided but they will attend the particular classes in which they have a particular interest.  That is what is needed.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of education, as I see it, should be to give our young people the knowledge that they want and encourage them to want the knowledge that is good for them.  In other words, instead of compulsion, instead of dragooning, the whole idea should be to lead the young in the right direction. Here again two questions would arise&mdash;in the first place the question of accommodation.  It would not be desirable or proper that young people over the school-leaving age should have to attend the night school in the ordinary national schools.  That would be bad for the school and in any case I think it would not be desirable because it would be necessary to have a certain amount of paraphernalia for the carrying out of technical or other education.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be necessary to have additional accommodation.  Halls are being provided by voluntary effort in nearly every parish now and there is no reason why these halls should not be used for this particular educational purpose.  In the parish in which I live a hall of very fine dimensions was erected recently entirely by voluntary effort of the people.  That hall has <Col N="215" /> been and is being used at the moment for evening classes and woodwork. There is no reason why that system should not be extended and made a permanent and continuous feature of our education so that no boy or girl will be forced to go through life, as so many are to-day, entirely dependent upon the knowledge and training that they received in the primary school. That training and knowledge should be supplemented and if a real effort of the kind I have suggested were made that could be done.  I am not suggesting that there should be any large State expenditure on this effort in our present financial position.  In most cases voluntary effort could provide a local hall suitable for evening classes.  I know that there would not be a sufficiency of teachers or instructors to ensure the holding of evening classes in every parish in the country. That would be beyond the capacity of the existing teachers.  I think voluntary effort is desirable.  The Minister is taking the right course in asking for the co-operation of Macra na Feirme. There are other associations which would also be glad to help.  With that voluntary effort, it should be possible to ensure these evening classes on at least two nights each week in every district in the country.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I make is that local educational committees should be established to look after these evening classes.  The leading personalities in the district could assist.  I am sure the agricultural instructors would give all the help they could.  In addition to that Radio Éireann should be harnessed for the purpose of giving lectures and instruction in particular subjects at a certain hour each evening. There is no reason why competent teachers should not be able to provide such lectures over the radio.  I do not think we are utilising modern equipment to the extent to which we could utilise it.  I think the radio holds out enormous possibilities in relation to instruction in evening schools and it is along such lines we will achieve a forward step in regard to education generally.</P>
    <P>Practically all the ordinary subjects could be taught in these evening <Col N="216" /> classes&mdash;Irish, English, rural science, history, with particular emphasis on local history, singing, music, civics, engineering and so on.  All this would be in addition to the work done in the vocational and technical schools during the day.  It is desirable, as the Minister suggested, that employers should release their apprentices for the purpose of permitting them to attend vocational schools during the day.  In these day classes they should receive instruction in a wide variety of subjects. The success of Danish economy to-day is largely due to the enthusiasm aroused 60 or 100 years ago in relation to adult education.  That education was mainly of a cultural nature.  It imbued its recipients with a love of their country, with a desire to improve themselves, their standard of living and their standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I think there is need here for instilling into the minds of youth a proper sense of citizenship.  Good citizenship is most important in the building up of a nation.  It is sad to think that there are very few local authorities that can lay out a park or plant trees without the very real fear that their work will be destroyed by young boys in the neighbourhood.  I think that is a serious reflection on our educational system. It is the duty of everybody to ensure that respect for property, for authority, for the aged and for the weak is instilled into the minds of our young people.  Only in that way will we succeed in making life more pleasant.</P>
    <P>Education at the present time is sadly in need of a proper spirit of enthusiasm.  I think the Minister will agree that the nation's most important asset is the young people who are just now leaving school.  They are the people who have enthusiasm.  They are the people who can lift our nation up.  When the Minister is introducing his next Estimate I hope he will be able to record a startling improvement in education generally.  I hope the Council of Education will make recommendations that are both progressive and practicable.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked a question yesterday about the summer holiday periods.  It is a very big question, not perhaps as big as some people would <Col N="217" /> try to make it, but it is, I suppose, important.  It is a good thing that the Minister is anxious to consult with the people who are concerned in regard to this matter, and with Deputies of all Parties in regard to the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a demand in some quarters that the summer holidays in the primary schools should coincide entirely and absolutely with the summer holidays in the secondary schools.  I would like to say, first of all, that it is a dangerous thing to try to equate two things which are not equal.  The conditions under which pupils labour in the primary schools are not exactly similar to the conditions in the secondary schools.  If there is a very long holiday period in the secondary schools, it does not follow automatically that there should be an equally long period in the primary schools.  We must remember that, in the secondary schools owing to our examining system which has been commented on by other Deputies, the strain and the stress on the pupils at a difficult and perhaps delicate period in their lives is very severe.  It is, I think, essential that boys and girls who are doing an intensive course in the secondary schools, and have to compete in very severe competitive examinations, should have a fairly long break so as to enable them to recoup their strength.  It is also possible that boys and girls of that age may be able, because of the fact that they have reached a higher age limit, to improve themselves in other ways during the holiday period.  Some may assist on their parents' farms during the holiday period or in whatever business the parents are engaged in.  Others of them may pursue a summer course, and others, who can afford it, may travel to other countries and thereby gain increased knowledge for themselves.</P>
    <P>But when you are dealing with small boys and girls in the primary schools you are dealing with an entirely different proposition.  It would be hard, I think, to make the case that they would benefit by a three months' holiday period.  It would also be hard to make the case that their parents would really desire to have them running <Col N="218" /> about at large for such a long period.  I imagine that it would also be hard to prove that the small boys and girls attending primary schools could, at their age, assist to any great extent in the work on the farm, or in whatever avocation the parents may be engaged in.  In addition, there is another question which arises, and that is the effect which a long holiday period would have on the teachers. Even though their remuneration has been improved somewhat in recent years, I doubt if it is sufficient to enable them to save enough money to engage in a holiday lasting three months.  I am afraid they would be completely bankrupt by the time it was over.  Taking it all round, I think there is not very much of a case for as long a holiday period in the primary schools as there is in the secondary schools.  I know that when I was a small boy I looked forward to the six weeks' holiday as something in the nature of half a lifetime.  I thought that a holiday of that duration was quite sufficient, and I think that the children of the present day would feel just the same.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency, I think, to look upon matters of this kind as they affect the well-to-do sections of the community.  I know there are sections of the community who, when their children leave the secondary school, can afford to take a fairly long holiday. I think they are the people who would like to have the children in the primary schools taking their holidays at the same time, but I think that the overwhelming majority of the people are not of the opinion that there should be this long holiday period and, indeed, are not in a position to take advantage of it.  Neither do they think that the holiday period in the primary schools and the secondary schools should coincide.  I would suggest that the holidays in the primary schools should be taken from the 1st July to the middle of August.  Farmers may not agree with that, although I think one would find acceptance for the view now that children attending primary schools to-day cannot assist to the extent that children used to do formerly on the farms, particularly at harvest time.  The reason is that farming <Col N="219" /> has become more mechanised than it was when we were children.  In the old days, small boys were recruited to tie the corn in the harvest time and did give valuable assistance in those days. At that time, the holiday period in the rural schools, at any rate, was from early in August to the middle of September. The object of that was to cover the harvest period.  I would prefer to see the children released from school during the hot days of July.</P>
    <P>I have very little to say on the subject of secondary education.  I had not the advantage, to use Deputy Everett's phrase on a famous occasion, of a college education.  I was sent to harrow at a very early age, and I was promoted to the plough afterwards. I think that, more or less, completed my education.  I do think, from the experience I have gathered in regard to the secondary schools, that the people who are engaged in conducting secondary education at the present time, are rendering a great voluntary service to the nation.  The secondary schools are, in the main, conducted by religious orders, the members of which have devoted their lives entirely to providing higher and better education for the youth of the country.  Their services to the nation, and to education generally, cannot be measured in terms of money.  It is generally accepted that the competition at the examinations, both for the intermediate and leaving certificates, is becoming altogether too severe.  There is the feeling that there is too much cramming, too much intensive cramming, in preparation for those examinations, and that as a result the opportunity for imparting real education is, to a certain extent, being curtailed.  What is the alternative?  One alternative would seem to be to trust approved secondary schools to impart the necessary education without having any necessity for a uniform examination standard.  I do not know whether or not that is practical.  There does not seem to be any reason why, if secondary schools were put on their honour, they would not send forward to the university only those boys and girls who are qualified to go there.  In my view, <Col N="220" /> the system of competition as between one school and another&mdash;the system of publishing the numbers of boys and girls who have qualified at various examinations is not a good system.  I feel that if we are to have real education it ought to be modified in some way.  That is all I have to say on this particular subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to let this opportunity go by without saying a few words on this thorny problem of the revival of the Irish language.  I know that when I speak on this particular matter I am bound to make myself open to criticism from some very cranky elements in the country who have taken upon themselves the view that they and they alone are the sole apostles of the revival of the Irish language.  Over the past 30 years there has been an annual debate on education in this House.  In those various debates many speakers have contributed eloquently to this vexed problem of the revival of Irish.  It is my belief that a great deal of humbug and hypocrisy was spoken in the course of those debates.  A great deal of humbug and hypocrisy is apparent outside this House with regard to the revival of Irish.  I do not want to be taken as being opposed to the revival of Irish and I do not want my words here to be misrepresented.  However, I think we should face realities in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy has suggested in this debate that a great revival has taken place in Irish throughout the last 30 years.  I maintain that there has been a greater knowledge of Irish in the last 30 years than prior to that period.  There are more people capable of speaking Irish to-day than was the case prior to 1932, but, to my mind, that is not the key to the problem. The success in the revival of the Irish language can be determined to-day by the number who speak it.  There are more people in a position to speak our native language at the present time than was the case 30 years ago.  Yet, I maintain that no greater numbers speak the language even though they may have a knowledge of it.  That is what must be righted; in other words, <Col N="221" /> the spirit necessary for the revival of Irish is missing.  The machinery is available in the shape of schools and excellent teachers.  Yet, in spite of all that, once the pupils leave school they make little or no attempt to use Irish as an everyday language.  I feel that is the problem which needs serious examination.</P>
    <P>We all look upon the Gaeltacht areas as the cradle from which the Irish language came, and we maintain that it is from the Gaeltacht areas that Irish must be spread throughout the rest of the country.  Deputy MacCarthy for one, has admitted in this House that the numbers in the Gaeltacht areas are dwindling&mdash;that the Gaelic population is decreasing.  I believe that, as far as the Government and the State are concerned, this should be the danger signal.  Surely if the all Irish-speaking people within the Gaeltacht areas are flying from those areas, there must be some contributory causes.  In my view, the revival of the Irish language must be co-ordinated with an economic revival in the Gaeltacht areas.  I had a quarrel in this House with the Taoiseach on the question of the industrialisation of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to make my remarks relevant to education in Gaeltacht areas.  The very fact that the people in the Gaeltacht areas are able to speak Irish does not mean that they are able to eat or live there.  In order that they may get work of a permanent or secure nature, the people, who are in possession of the Irish language, must leave the Gaeltacht areas and go elsewhere.  I see no reason why the Minister for Education, considering his responsibility for the Gaeltacht areas, should not take an active interest in seeing that industrial development takes place in those areas, so that, thereby, the language can be served.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing it.  I am trying to point out the fact that the more people who leave the Gaeltacht areas, the less chance there is of reviving the Irish language.  At the present time the trend for the people in the Gaeltacht areas is to Britain and America, not to other parts of Ireland, as suggested by Deputy MacCarthy.  I see nothing whatever wrong in making full employment available in those areas thereby ensuring that the Irish-speaking population will have an economic means of existence and will not be forced to learn English in order to emigrate to Britain.</P>
      <P>If any proof is needed of the statements I have made as to the numbers leaving the Gaeltacht areas and about the anglicisation that has taken place there, I will only suggest to the Minister that he send to the Department of Lands and to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a list, if such lists are available as they should be, of those people who have come into the Gaeltacht areas from Britain throughout the last 15 years.  Let one go down to Galway, to Connemara, up the Corrib or to any of these places, and one will find that a good number of houses in these areas are owned by Colonel So-and-so or by Major-General So-and-so, from the Indian Army, the Australian Army or the British Army.  The people are leaving the Gaeltacht areas and they are being replaced there by gentlemen retiring from foreign service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not suggested that he has.  I have told him that if he wants proof of the fact that the Gaelic-speaking population has dwindled, all he has to do is to go to the Department of Lands or the Taoiseach's Department and he will get figures to prove what I am telling him here.  If you are serious about making Irish the spoken language in this country, then you must give bread and butter to the people.  Go out to Connemara to-morrow morning and meet any of the young girls for whom there is no employment available; find out what their wish is and it is to be become proficient in the English language. They move into Galway City; they get domestic employment in the hotels, in boarding houses and with private people, and inside of three to six months they are proficient as good English speakers.  As soon as they have a good working knowledge of the English language they get a train in Galway and they end up in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester or some place else.  In other words, the incentive in the Gaeltacht areas, in Connemara and elsewhere, is to learn English in order to achieve a livelihood.</P>
      <P>That is all I propose to say with regard to the revival of Irish.  I want to make it clear that I am anxious to see it done properly.  I am anxious to point out to the Minister the dangers that are apparent there and that must be tackled.  One of the real methods of conserving or protecting the Gaelic language and keeping it alive, especially in those areas, is to get the right type of employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the general question of education, some speakers here have suggested that there was a better educational system in this country 100 years ago.  I do not think that is correct. I believe that our educational facilities have improved immensely in the last century and that the general standard of education has improved also.  We have only, to my mind, to <Col N="224" /> see the record of any of the secondary schools, any of the schools run by the religious orders, and see the list of successes published yearly as a result of their efforts to educate the youth of the country.  We have only to look at the list of the successes as regards degrees given out each year in our universities at Galway, Cork and Dublin, to know that there is available to-day a huge number of trained people, doctors, engineers, dentists, professional men of all kinds, and women, too.  But I wonder how many of those professional people in the last 25 to 30 years succeeded in establishing themselves in security here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like one of those secondary schools in existence for a long number of years to examine its records of all the pupils that passed through its hands in the last 30 years and find out just how many of those pupils are now living here in Ireland and have secured employment.  I think it would shake some of the people in this House to realise that most of those people have achieved success outside this country. In other words, England, America and every other country have been delighted to take Irish doctors, Irish policemen, at the time when they are trained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And Irish nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, of course, have mentioned with regard to women that Irish nurses are looked upon as the best in the world and they are gladly seized in every country because they are trained before they go there and it does not cost the particular country any money in order to make those people expert in their particular profession.  That is the position with regard to our university end of it.  At the other end of the scale, we have that section of our people who do not go past the national school.  At the present time the national school leaving age is 14.  After that, those boys and girls who are not in a position. through one reason or another, to obtain secondary or vocational education, find themselves on the labour market.  Their services are also snapped up in Britain and there in <Col N="225" /> Britain they become the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the English people who would not descend to such menial tasks as have to be performed by the badly educated Irishman who has to leave this country for a living.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is much better, if we do have to allow people out of this country, if we are not in a position to provide for them at home, that we send them out educated, able to work with their hands or with their brains, not send them out as they are going at the present time, barely able to read and write.  There are facts to bear out what I have to say in this debate in regard to that section of our people who emigrate to England every year, those boys and girls who have not had the opportunity of getting a secondary education, and who go to England and work there in domestic employment and as labourers.  If all those who emigrated from Ireland in the last 100 years had held their Catholic Faith and if their descendants held the Faith as well, there would be in Britain to-day over 10,000,000 Catholics.  It is beyond contradiction that one of the reasons that the Faith has failed with our Irish population in Britain and their descendants is the fact that these boys and girls when they go to Britain first have not a sound or proper education.  A very prominent sociologist once said that education was the rudder of the State. I think that statement is perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if the steering at the present time is being done in the right direction.  Is our educational system tending towards the ultimate good of the State?  I believe it is true to say that if anybody in this House goes down to a national school and asks a pupil: &ldquo;What would you like to be?&rdquo;  he will find that the majority of the boys would like to be bus drivers, doctors, engineers, priests. Very few, you will find, will say that they would like to be farmers.  Go and ask a girl in the national school what she would like to be.  The majority nowadays would like to be nurses or air hostesses or film stars.  Very few would suggest that they would be satisfied <Col N="226" /> with a domestic occupation, or to become housewives, and that is the ultimate future for the majority of those girls.  Yet it is looked upon as strange to-day if a boy says he would like to be a farmer.  In other words, there is a wrong bias towards rural Ireland and that wrong bias can be traced to a great extent to the fact that all the streams of thought towards education emanate from Dublin, emanate from people with minds divorced from rural Ireland.  It is an utter and entire impossibility for a man who is living here cooped up in Dublin with the same mentality to decide what is really good or what is the right system of rural education.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I am very glad to welcome into the arena bodies like Muintir na Tíre because if there is any hope in the world for the future of the youth in rural areas, if there is any hope that a proper type of education will at least be made available, it will be through bodies like Muintir na Tíre and not through the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I must say that in the past few years there has been a great change among parents in rural Ireland, so far as their ideas on education are concerned. There is a wonderful demand to-day in all parts of the West of Ireland that I know for more vocational training. There is a demand from every parish in my constituency at present for some form of vocational education and I am speaking as a member of a vocational body.  I appeal to the Minister, while that enthusiasm is there and while that urge to give boys and girls a good sound practical type of education is there, to take every possible means to see that that demand is met.  That demand cannot be met until sufficient teachers are available.  We could employ another ten to 15 vocational teachers in Roscommon, but we cannot get them, although the demand is there for them.  There are a number of schools&mdash;national schools which are not being used, as the number of school children has decreased&mdash;which could be utilised for vocational classes, but we have not got the teachers.</P>
    <P>The position so far as I can ascertain is that no sooner have a number of <Col N="227" /> these people taken out their degrees than they are snapped up by industrial and business concerns.  In other words, the pay attaching to vocational teaching is not sufficient to attract candidates into the profession.  They prefer to take up employment with firms and industrial concerns and I appeal to the Minister to make conditions still more attractive in order to bring the very best possible type of teacher into the vocational system.  In addition, there should be at least five times the number of people in training as vocational teachers.  The numbers are too limited altogether to meet the demand all over Ireland.  I am sure the Minister is very sympathetic towards that problem and that I am not speaking to a man who will let it in one ear and out the other.</P>
    <P>One of the matters at present under consideration by the Council of Education is the question of the school-leaving age.  I do not propose to dwell on it at any length because other speakers have made their contributions and my words would only be a repetition of what they have said, but I should like to urge that the school-leaving age should be raised as soon as possible. I do not suggest that it be raised to 16 years, but I feel that it is a matter which should be tied in with vocational training.  It would be ridiculous to raise the school-leaving age in primary schools merely in respect of the subjects they are doing at present.  I should prefer to see school children doing with one year less in the primary schools and being diverted into various vocational lines until they reach the age of 15 or 16.  There is nothing as useful to-day for any man as a sound and practical training in carpentry or mechanies of any kind.  A man who is skilled in any of these lines after a period of training in the technical school is never stuck afterwards for employment, and if he has to leave the country&mdash;unfortunately, quite a number of our people have to leave it at present&mdash;let us at least see to it that, when he goes, he will be able to compete with the best that Britain herself can produce for the different types of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I should like to emphasise the necessity for changing the present bias in education.  Up to recently, at any rate, the aim of parents was to get a son or daughter into the Civil Service or some other job in Dublin.  The bigger the town they could send them to for a job, the better they liked it, and the height of their ambition is to wear a black hat and striped trousers and carry an umbrella in Dublin.  The brainiest boy in the home was sent either to the university or to Maynooth. I have no objection to brainy people going to either place&mdash;they are needed &mdash;but I think that the best mind in the family, the ablest member of the family, should be given a chance on the land.  The idea up to the present has been that the &ldquo;dope&rdquo; of the family should be left at home.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons I welcome the Muintir na Tíre group into the arena because they have brought a new look into rural Ireland, so far as the farming community are concerned.  The Minister should co-operate to as great an extent as possible with groups like Muintir na Tíre and get their views, so that the mainstay of our country, agriculture and the farming community, will have at their disposal trained men and women educated with a bias towards the land.  If we can achieve that, if we can bring about a feeling in our youth to-day that the land and the activities associated with it&mdash; forestry, market gardening and so forth &mdash;are of a higher nature than the activities for which they are being trained, the Department of Education would be doing a good work for the economic security of this country in years to come.  No Deputy can deny that our economic security is bound up with the land and with agriculture.  If we give to agricultural life and pursuits the very best cream of our nation, they will be the best safeguard towards the security of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, as most of the points one would like to make have been made by others and repeated several times.  I would like to impress on the Minister the desirability of giving every possible assistance to meet the present increasing demand for vocational education. <Col N="229" /> The primary schools lay the foundation and mould the character of the pupil.  For most pupils&mdash;those who are not desirous of continuing self-study thereafter&mdash;there is no opportunity for secondary education.  Thousands of our people to-day have not a hope of availing themselves of secondary education in any form, for the simple reason that they cannot afford it.  If they are not within easy reach of a vocational school where they can continue their education, they must be content with what they have been able to glean from attendance at a national school.</P>
      <P>There is no part of the country where vocational schools are needed or where that case could be applied better than in the Gaeltacht.  The present Minister has given the green light in the erection of such schools there, but he should remember too that that is imposing a heavy burden on local authorities, which most of them can ill afford to bear.  I would like him to consider making better financial provision for the congested areas and particularly the Gaeltacht areas, for the type of school that is as good as you would find in the cities.  Any attempt at the improvised school is likely to have a bad effect, to have the opposite effect to that intended, in so far as it may not create the confidence that would be created by a well-established, properly staffed, large type vocational school. The Minister should consider making financial provision more on a population basis than on the basis of areas or counties.  The congested areas would be bound to benefit under a scheme of that type.</P>
      <P>Some time ago a commission sat to inquire into the system of youth education and I think one of the recommendations they made then was that we should have vocational guidance officers appointed to ascertain particular classes and segregate the types that would be suited to a particular vocation.  That would be well worth following up, if and when we had a suitable number of vocational schools. We have scarcely reached the position yet where we can say that vocational education is at the disposal of every family in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should realise how unfair it is <Col N="230" /> that even in 1952 there are thousands of families, particularly in the Gaeltacht, who will not in their day have a hope of getting any secondary education whatever, just because their parents cannot afford to send them to secondary schools.  The vocational school is the poor man's university and the only hope he has of giving his children a secondary education.  One may say that the vocational school really makes provision for the trades, but there is no reason why the curriculum should not be more comprehensive and extended so that general education would receive better attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that there is a shortage of teachers, but that could be easily remedied over a short period of years.  Furthermore, we naturally expect a bias towards rural science in such technical schools and there should be more provision for plots attached to them in rural areas.  If we concentrated on that and proceeded along those lines, we could feel that, just as there are facilities for primary education for every single child in the country, there are also facilities for secondary education for every single child.  The Minister could not go far wrong in considering seriously the making of better financial provision, particularly for the Gaeltacht and the congested counties, for the establishment of vocational facilities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the vexed question of ex-teachers' pensions, I think the case made in their claim for better provision is an unanswerable one.  I refer to those who retired prior to January, 1950.  It is sufficient to point out that they can hardly be expected to exist, as some of them have to, on £3 or £4 a week, no more than those who retired after that year and who benefited under a better arrangement.  The excuse offered is that it is a question of finance, that the amount involved is too great, but that means merely accepting the fact that one section of the ex-teachers are denied what their colleagues were more fortunate in getting.  There is no answer to the case they have made on the grounds that they are able to exist on the miserable pittance they are getting at the <Col N="231" /> moment.  It is degrading to see how some ex-teachers have to live at present.  It holds out no great incentive to those who may be contemplating putting the family into the teaching profession, to take a look around and see how some of the past teachers are compelled to end their days.  That reason in itself should be sufficient incentive to the Minister to find the money in some way, to give these people some increase to meet the cost of living and enable them to live with a little more comfort in their retirement.</P>
    <P>The condition of the primary schools generally has been referred to by most of the speakers.  An all-out effort, a general blitz, should be launched regarding the uninhabitable schools in the country.  Building is a much discussed topic at the moment.  Efforts are made to clear slums and to improve farm dwellings and housing in the towns.  There is no type of building more necessary or more urgent than the building of national schools of a better class throughout the country. As has been repeatedly pointed out, the national school is the only school that some pupils have a chance of attending.  A very poor impression will be left in the minds of those who have to attend badly equipped derelict schools that are not suitable in any way for their purpose.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that a few hundred pounds extra would not be spent when a school is being built to provide a decent playground or playing pitch. When children are let out of school for recreation, in some cases they go into a yard which is comparable to what one would expect to see at a farm house, and they are hemmed in there for half an hour, in some cases on a dirty half-rood of land.  That cannot have a good effect on the character of any child, particularly in the case of a child who has not a chance of attending any better institution.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the advancement of the Irish language. Some of the things he said were perfectly true.  There is one point at which I could not agree with him, namely, his reference to the humbug and hypocrisy <Col N="232" /> of people who are working for the restoration of the language.  It is very easy to make statements of that kind but, personally, I believe that if we were to regard the problem in its true light we should have the greatest admiration for anyone who in any way makes an effort to further the cause of the Irish language.  It is an onerous task and a difficult one.  We should be proud that we still have amongst us thousands who are prepared to sacrifice their time and energy in that great work and who in some cases devote their entire life to it.  I wonder do we, who sometimes are inclined to criticise them, pull our weight in that direction.  I am afraid we do not.  The least we could do is to encourage them, to extend to them our admiration and thanks for the great effort they are making in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is not an easy job to restore a language in any country and there is certainly no easy way in this country any more than in any other place where it has been attempted.  The fact remains that more people have a knowledge of the Irish language to-day than before.  In spite of what has been said, we are rapidly advancing towards the time when we can accept the Irish language as the language which can be used in our everyday life, in our business circles, in our professions, and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue this long-drawn out debate by repeating what has been said already.  On the general question of education, in so far as education is the principal weapon with which to fight ignorance, poverty and squalor in this or any other country, the Department of Education should have a broad outlook and should be prepared to investigate and experiment in every possible direction with a view to advancing the education of the people.  It does not matter what their ultimate destiny may be, if they are educated, the people will be better equipped for life, whether at home or abroad.  Education is a weapon in their hands which they will always find their greatest friend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that our educationists are more preoccupied <Col N="233" /> with means, with methods, than with ends.  Education, considered from the social point of view, must have a definite objective.  It must set before our people high ideals of value and develop the ideal of service, as the truest and the noblest form of self-expression, and the achievement of these ideals is not merely giving education, which will help our young people to get on in life, but the education which will help them to understand what life is, and to train them to take part in the social and economic reforms and civic life generally.</P>
      <P>Having some knowledge of boys and girls leaving school and going into industry, meeting them year after year in certain assemblies, I have to express my surprise and my displeasure at the value we are getting for the amount of money we spend on education.  The previous speaker very properly referred to education as a means of fighting poverty and ignorance, and I would add, ugliness in life.</P>
      <P>A great defect in our system of education is that the talented boy or girl is too often debarred from education because of the economic and social position of his or her parents.  I feel that democracy cannot be established in any country until there is equal opportunity for education.  I have in mind a number of talented boys and girls whose parents were pleaded with by teachers who knew their talents to try to keep them to school but, owing to the economic circumstances of the home, these boys and girls had to take up jobs at 14 or 14½ years of age and their talents were lost to the country.</P>
      <P>There are some people who are shallow enough to say that the boy from the slum or the boy from the uneconomic holding in the Gaeltacht area can become the President of this country.  We must admit that some boys do master and surmount many difficulties but what chance has the talented boy or girl in the remote parts of this country of reaching any high position by reason of his educational attainments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will all agree that many of the teachers in our schools and colleges have a national outlook in life.  The great mass of them who go through the training colleges are fashioned in <Col N="234" /> the ideas of our existing economy. Therefore, the minds of the children they are teaching are moulded in accordance with the present social system.  The result is that we have not got education for social change.</P>
    <P>I should like to say&mdash;and I venture to suggest that the Minister will agree with me&mdash;that the first and the most obvious dividing line between men everywhere to-day is between those who see and believe passionately in the need for social changes, and those who, having vested interests, intellectual or material, want to maintain things as they are.  Education then must stand on one side or other of that dividing line.  It must aim either to educate children to maintain things as they are or to educate children to make the needed changes in society. I think no man with eyes can go through our country to-day seeing nothing of its problems and its needs.  The man and particularly the educationist who pretends that he is above the struggle, is ranging himself with those who want to maintain the <i>status quo</i>&mdash;a status of poverty, ignorance, ugliness and social injustice.  I repeat that we need to educate for social change.  I think I may also safely say that posterity will think our attitude very cruel in that we are permitting thousands of young boys and girls to leave school at the most plastic moment of their lives, improperly prepared to meet the impact of life.  It is at this stage that you require the adult education to which previous speakers have referred; it is here we need the social education to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister that we have to rid our minds of the idea that the present system of education in the country is all right, because it is not.  The Minister has a good rural background and, in considering the question of education in rural areas, I think he will agree with me that the present system of education makes practically no allowance for the needs of rural areas.  I remember when I was going to school in the country I had two books dealing with agriculture. I am informed that for years there is no such thing as books on agriculture in the national schools.  During <Col N="235" /> my time at school we had to devote so many hours every week to lessons on agricultural subjects.  I think the statement in to-day's paper from His Lordship the Coadjutor Bishop of Cork, is based on fact because undoubtedly the rural population is diminishing&mdash;not for a moment am I suggesting that we can always maintain the rural population, because the person talks lightly who says that we can keep boys and girls in the countryside if there are no opportunities of employment for them.  We are bound to have a number of them leaving the country in present circumstances. I want to say that in my opinion we are not making country life sufficiently attractive to keep these young people in the country.  If there is one thing more than another necessary for that purpose, it is the erection of rural halls in different areas.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is this question of scholarships. I think we should have more scholarships in order to assist the poor man's child to get somewhere in life. Considerable difficulty sometimes arises in the administration of existing scholarships.  I know that sometimes a number of children are selected because of their talents to enter certain classes to study for scholarships.  After being in these classes for some years, they discover that because their parents' income is something over £8 per week they are not qualified to sit for these scholarships and the result is that these children have to leave the scholarship classes.  I think that is not giving a fair chance to the talented boy or girl.  Even though the father of such children may have up to £8 5s. or £8 10s. per week, there are other members of the family who have to be supported and who have no chance of going for scholarships.  Of course they have no chance of ever reaching a university.  There again we have a means test operating against talented children and preventing them from getting the education to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The last speaker and some other speakers spoke very highly of the education afforded by vocational schools.  I want to reiterate that <Col N="236" /> testimony.  A number of boys and girls who may not reach leaving certificate standard are left without training and the only schools that can cater for them are the vocational schools.  I would appeal to the Minister that the teachers in these vocational schools should be placed on the same status as national teachers.  I see no reason whatever for any differential there.  Having some experience as a member of the Vocational Schools Committee in Cork, and knowing the work which the vocational teachers are doing in the different schools in Cork, I have often asked myself the question on what grounds should there be a lesser status for vocational teachers than for national teachers.  I hope the Minister will give some consideration to that question with a view to improving the status of vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke on the question of school holidays and Deputy Cogan to-day attempted to put his own interpretation on the demand for extended holidays.  I believe that it is wrong to keep children in school during the summer months of June, July and August when they should be out enjoying the sunshine and fresh air but I believe that they should have fewer holidays at Easter and Christmas.  I can assure the Minister that there is a very strong desire amongst parents that the children should have had a longer period of holidays during the summer months.  If the Minister takes the trouble to interview a representative section of parents, he will find that they will agree with that view.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prevent the Minister from getting in to conclude the debate before 7 o'clock, but I should like to say in conclusion that much remains to be done by the Department of Education to improve the civic spirit of the boys and girls leaving school.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be in any way personal but I feel that young boys and girls of 14 and 14½ years of age leaving school have very little sense of civic pride or civic virtue.  I often wonder if we are to put all the blame on their parents and I am afraid we cannot.  I think civics should be taught more in our schools than they are.  The Minister <Col N="237" /> has listened to many comments about the system of education and I hope we may look forward to the day when we will have young boys and girls taught a better sense of citizenship. After all, we are looking forward to their making a better Ireland in the future, and I hope they will, but they must be taught how to make that better Ireland, and I think the teachers and the system of education which we have are not doing that.</P>

      <P>Nuair do thosnaíomar ar an gceist seo a phlé bé an chéad fhear a labhair ná an Teachta Ó Domhnaill.  Dúirt sé nár thuig sé ach strac-fhocal uaim nuair a bhíos ag caint; go raibh an Ghaeilg loitithe agam agus ag an Roinn Oideachais.  Chuir sé in iúl dúinn go raibh an Ghaeilg aige féin agus ag an Teachta Palmer ón gcliabhán ach nár thuig ceachtar acu pé rud a bhí ar siúl agam.</P>
      <P>Do mhol sé an módh díreach dúinn ach do thréig sé féin an módh díreach. I mBéarla agus i mBéarla amháin do labhair sé.</P>
      <P>Is dócha gur cruaidh ar Ghaeilgeoir dá leithéid gan Gaeilg a labhairt.  Acht mar mhaithe liomsa, mise atá sa doircheacht leasmuigh, dc nocht sé a smaointe dhúinn i mBéarla agus lean an Gaeilgeoir eile ó Chiarraighe ar an mbóthar chéanna.</P>
      <P>Más maith leis an mbeirt Teachtaí seo an Ghaeilg a chur ar aghaidh tá buadh faoi leith acu chuige&mdash;an Ghaeilg ar a dtoil acu agus líofacht teanga.  Ba cheart dóibh úsáid a bhaint aisti.  Bheadh bunús éigin faoina gcaint dá mba rud gur i nGaeilg a labhradar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Muna bhfuil Teachtaí sásta an Ghaeilg a labhairt bheadh sé níos fearr <Col N="238" /> acu agus níos oiriúnaí dhóibh gan aon tagairt a dhéanamh dí.</P>
    <P>Nílim chun freagra a thabhairt ar gach duine faoi leith dár labhair ar an Meastachán ach déanfad iarracht ar gach ceist tábhachtach a tógadh sa díospóireacht a shuathadh, a scrúdú agus d'fhreagairt, ach le h-eagla ná tuigfeadh na Gaeil mé déanfad triail a bhaint as an mBéarla.</P>
    <P>One of the things that have been causing much anxiety to me and about which there is a public opinion now is the question of the provision of proper and adequate school buildings.  We really have a number of very poor school buildings, about 600 of them. Of course when a poor honest man like me puts his finger on a particular problem any amount of fly-boys come along in the newspapers and elsewhere and they make a racket of it without understanding at all what the problem is.  Some of them in the newspapers grew quite lyrical about it and some of them rather hysterical.  There is no need for either lyricism or hysteria. Sometimes I begin to believe that there is something more or less anticlerical about it, that it is utilised as a weapon wherewith to point out that the local parish priest is not doing his duty and when it is not the local parish priest who is not doing his duty it surely must be the Department of Education and, particularly, the inefficient Minister who is for the time being in charge of the Department.</P>
    <P>This is by no means a problem confined to this country.  <i>The New Statesman,</i> dealing with English schools on 9th February, 1952, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems broadly true that we have had almost no replacement of old schools.  Many hundreds of schools that were blacklisted 20 years ago are still in active use.  We are keeping our future citizens in surroundings which were out of date a generation ago.  Even the blacklisted schools have not been replaced and there are thousands of others which fall below any decent minimum of amenities or convenience.  A thorough and almost universal replacement of our present buildings is required.  For every satisfactory building you will find a dozen that are not, and half a dozen that are <Col N="239" /> horrible.  Eleven thousand new classrooms are needed and the Minister's calculation was that 3,000 new schools were needed for 1953.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is England.  In the <i>New York Times</i> of April 8th, 1952, it was pointed out by an educationist over there who examined the situation that ten billion dollars were needed to build 600,000 classrooms during the next six years. These are the conditions that obtain in England and America, much more rich, much more powerful countries than ours&mdash;countries which have had their freedom for hundreds of years and which are not subject to the difficulty to which this country was subject.  I am not suggesting that the fact that that condition obtains in countries like America and Great Britain is any excuse for our not tackling the problem, but I do want people to realise that, in the main, the great majority of our school buildings are reasonably good and some of them are very good.</P>
    <P>Possibly 20 per cent. of our school buildings are not satisfactory.  For normal replacement of schools, the life of which should be about 100 years, we should build 50 schools yearly.  I think that for the next five or six years we should try at least to double that amount so as to destroy the existing evil condition.  In order to do that we shall have to look for more money.  I hope that when we make an appeal for that money we shall not be told that we are pressing too hard on the unfortunate taxpayer.  I think an investment of public money in education is the best investment and will pay the greatest dividends to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately true that there are delays in relation to the building of schools such as Deputy Desmond mentioned.  The sites have to be sought.  The local people have to provide the site.  I had a letter this morning from a man who wants to build a school in a village where there is no priest, no doctor, no civic guard, and which is ten miles from a railway station.  The price of half an acre of land is £600.  The people of this country have such a tremendous desire <Col N="240" /> for education that when it is intended to build a school the site costs as much as it would cost on Wall Street.  The parish priest has to find the money for the site.  He has to get a certain local contribution.  Very often he is accused of not doing his duty simply because he cannot induce his parishioners to contribute the little amount they should contribute.  It has come to be a fact that the State contribution is greater as the years go by than it was. At one time it was a minor affair. Later it came to be about two-thirds; now the local contribution is down somewhere around 17 per cent., with very special consideration for backward and poor areas.  Whilst that must happen, I am afraid it is unavoidable. Nevertheless, I think we should insist on a certain local responsibility.  If people have any respect or desire for education they should show their respect and desire for it by providing the small amount which is due from them.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to all architects.  I think that the school buildings that have been erected lately are as good and as satisfactory and as suitable as the buildings erected in any other country.  I think the work of our architects compares very favourably with the work of school architects in any other country.  One thing on which I will insist is that, having gone to all the trouble to secure sites, to make beautiful plans and to build the schools, no contractor who contracts to build a school for us will be allowed to get away with anything.  I have been in some schools which were built within the past ten years, and I am really ashamed of the work that has been done.  Some of the work is very bad.  I think that people generally should have ideas about that in their own locality and should not be chary of opening their mouths in criticism of bad work.</P>
    <P>Another problem in relation to school buildings is the problem of maintenance. Deputy Mulcahy mentioned a school which was built in 1914 but which looks as if it were built in 1014, because not merely has there been no maintenance or attempt to keep it in good condition since it was built but it <Col N="241" /> has been a target for the stones of every schoolboy passing along the road.  It is time we induced some element of civilisation even in the backward areas so that schools will not be attacked in that fashion.  I have the idea that local people should maintain the schools.  I do not think that people everywhere should try to utilise the State as a crutch for every purpose. Deputy Desmond said that a local committee might be utilised to provide such maintenance.  I see no reason why public-minded citizens should not take sufficient interest in schools to band themselves into a local committee and see that the schools are properly kept.  A beautiful building which is well kept has a very definite beneficial effect on the minds of children. In a great measure, the schools which were built in the past looked like places of detention.  Schools ought to be happy places where good work can be done.  I think we are now making progress in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another matter often raised by Deputies and by teachers is the question of heating and cleaning.  There is a certain State grant for that purpose: maybe it should be bigger but it would cost a good deal of money to meet the suggestions that have been made.  Here, again, I do not see any difficulty in the local community giving a much greater contribution than they have given heretofore.</P>
    <P>We must not expect too much of children in the primary schools, but sometimes we are so modern in our outlook that we seem to believe that the child is rather a brittle affair. Children are tough.  You can knock them about a bit.  I see no reason in the world why, particularly in the smaller schools where it can be done, children should not take it in their turn to sweep the schools.  With all his faults, I think Mr. Squeers had one idea anyhow&mdash;that of teaching the children to keep the school tidy.  I swept schools.  A lot of rubbish is talked about the dust getting into children's lungs and giving them tuberculosis. I swept schools, and I did a good deal more than that round schools.  I do not think it did me any particular harm.  I think it is a good thing that a kid should be asked to <Col N="242" /> do it.  When teachers think they are imposing upon the children or when parents believe that their children are being imposed upon once a month for a saving to the State and to the general public of possibly £100, I do not see there is any reason why they should not be asked to do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to do it anyhow.  The question of the conciliation for teachers was raised.  That conciliation and arbitration scheme was an experiment undertaken for one year and was subject to review after a year. I understand that the Civil Service arbitration and conciliation scheme is being considered and when any definite arrangement is made in regard to it that one of the outcomes will be another review of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>There was under the conciliation and arbitration scheme an adjustment of salaries quite recently, and I was surprised when certain teacher Deputies raised the question again of inadequate salaries immediately after a settlement by conciliation had been reached.  I suppose they were the living examples of Deputy Hickey's view of education for a social change.  Are we to be constantly in a state of revolution? There must be some particular period of peace and, when a settlement has been made, it ought to last for some little time anyhow without being raised again as an urgent matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The salaries of the teachers were fixed by way of an agreement with the executive of the teachers' body and I would like to pay tribute to the responsible approach of the members of the I.N.T.O. executive to that particular matter.  I know that they have their own difficulties, that possibly some of their members are overasserting their personality of independence and rather prone to look upon any settlement as a settlement that is not satisfactory, but the executive of the I.N.T.O. certainly met this matter in a vigorous fashion and at the same time in a reasonable fashion.</P>
      <P>I think that they really understood that they had reached the limit of the State resources and could not ask any more than they did ask.  I do think that everybody concerned here in the Dáil should realise that we cannot change from day to day the settlement reached.  I would, of course, naturally find myself in disagreement with many of the ideas of teachers.  At the same time, I would like to say that, in my opinion, the character of our teachers is a high one.  In general, I think that they are a very admirable body of citizens.  I think that our educational system is in good hands.</P>
      <P>I realise, of course, that there is a tremendous effort to be made by a good teacher.  He has a very heavy burden of competitive effort.  One of the things that I am very much interested in is the creation of interest in the pupils in any particular subject. I do not mind what it is.  I think that if we could arouse the initiative of the child to follow any particular line of his own that that interest should be created and that that would be a start towards a general interest in the question of education.  I do think that the school curriculum in the primary schools should be kept as simple as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a believer in overloading any programme.  There is much talk about overloading of programmes.  I do not know if that is correct.  Many of the subjects taught are so closely allied as to be one subject.  Whatever <Col N="244" /> Deputy Hickey or any other Deputy says, as long as I am Minister for Education agriculture will not be tolerated in the primary schools.  I have no idea at all of the use of agriculture in the primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the primary school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>No idea.  It was possibly all right 50 years ago and much of the criticism that is aimed at schools to-day is based on a forgetfulness of conditions that existed in the schools of 50 years ago.  At that particular time many boys and girls remained in the primary schools until they were 16 or 17.  Therefore it was possible to give them an added teaching in various subjects.  To-day children leave school at 14 years of age and many of the best do really go from the primary school much earlier to the secondary schools.</P>
      <P>The question of Irish has been raised in various ways.  When some Deputies were speaking here on the subject of Irish I did not know whether it was the Estimate for the Department of Education that was being discussed or those for the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Lands or Agriculture. I am not responsible for the Gaeltacht. It is my responsibility, as far as possible, to secure the spread of the understanding and the speaking of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy here mentioned the fact that children in the Gaeltacht were anxious to learn English.  I would be no party to denying them that.  If they want to learn English they must be permitted to learn it.  It is part of the equipment they need to earn their livelihood in this country at the present moment but that is not any reason why we should not in every fashion try to strengthen the use and the development of Irish not merely in the Gaeltacht but everywhere.  It is unfair to the people of the Gaeltacht to suggest that they must live in a sort of confined space out of touch with the rest of the world just for the convenience of the rest of the country which may or may not want to learn Irish.  I think we can preserve Irish far better in the Gaeltacht by removing the anxiety of the parents in that area in regard to the idea they have that we wish to <Col N="245" /> deny their children the opportunity of learning English.  I would like to place in their hands what Canon O'Leary called &ldquo;Dhá eirim aigne&rdquo;&mdash; two languages.  Instead of one language adversely affecting the other, both would, I believe, help each other.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to Deputy O'Donnell, the native speaker from Donegal, I do not believe that dialect is a drawback in any language.  It is generally held by experts that dialects strengthen the language.  Anyone who has read the works of Robert Louis Stevenson will recollect his pointing out in &ldquo;Familiar Studies of Men and Books&rdquo; the tremendous number of dialects that existed, not only those that were known, but also many that were unknown, all over Scotland and England, without having any effect on the language generally.  I do not take much notice of differences in dialect. I remember speaking in the town of Moville during the election of 1918, and somebody asked afterwards who the chap was that spoke like a policeman. All the policemen up there were from the south, and the local inhabitants naturally found it more difficult to understand me when I spoke in English than when I spoke in Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to textbooks that passed down from generation to generation.  I believe these books were preserved because of their unsuitability for school children. I remember <i>The Impeachment of Warren Hastings</i> and <i>The Vision of Mirza</i>&mdash;large indigestible lumps of language which no child of ten, 12 or 14 could ever hope to understand.  It is no wonder such books were preserved.  They were never looked at.  Men sometimes tell me now how valuable the information was that was in those books, how interested they were in them, and how much they remember of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the complaint is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make my own complaint.  The reason they remember them is because they probably read them when they were adults.  No child could possibly absorb the stuff that was in the fifth and sixth book years ago.  Complaint is made that the textbooks <Col N="246" /> cannot now be handed down from one child to another.  That cannot be done nowadays, because the books are used, and they fall asunder through use.  Deputy Desmond must come from a very careful family if the books were preserved there in the way he says they were.  In my family they always fell to pieces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The books I mean are Irish books like <i>Slí an Eólais</i> and <i>Séadhna,</i> and the fourth-class arithmetic. I am not speaking of the kind of books the Minister has mentioned. I never read them.  I quite admit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing children as I do, I find it difficult to believe they would preserve anything.  Textbooks can be very narrow.  They can be very uninteresting.  I would like to see a library in every school.  I would like to give every child the run of a school library.  I would like him to pick out some book he wants to read.  If a child becomes interested in any book he will probably read a number of others subsequently.  If I could send a child out of the primary school able to read and with a liking for reading I would have accomplished my purpose.</P>
      <P>A good deal of play was made about the primary certificate.  There is only one examination in the primary school.  There are two in the secondary school.  How can one find out what progress is being made if there is not some kind of test?  I know there is a system of inspection.  It is not possible to inspect individually every child and the only way in which progress can be measured is by having some standard of examination.  Perhaps the present method is not the best one but I do not know of any other way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan referred to the questions of pensions and gratuities in connection with teachers who have retired. Many Deputies adverted to that matter.  This problem was handed on to me and it is less easy of settlement now than it might have been when it <Col N="247" /> was created by my predecessor.  I am having the matter examined.  I know how difficult the financial position is and I will not hold out any undue hope.  The result of the examination that is taking place will be communicated in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Finance seem to be tough people.  Your Minister was tough, too.  The question of the marriage ban was raised.  There is no marriage ban.  Anybody who likes can get married.  I suppose there is a certain difficulty in the imposition of what is described as a marriage ban. There are also certain advantages and on balance I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.  This may be a matter that will be examined in the future and may be resolved but at the moment I have no intention of lifting the so-called ban.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the closing of small schools.  I think it is undesirable to close schools in any area if it is at all possible to keep them open, but attendances may drop to such a figure as to render it impossible to run the schools effectively.  I am very much in favour of preserving all schools.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the problem of backward children.  That is a very difficult problem.  It will be a particularly difficult problem in the rural areas.  It may be possible to deal with it in the city and already one of our teachers in the city has evolved an idea in connection with the handling of the problem here in Dublin.  I want to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work done by two teachers who have been dealing with that very difficult problem.  I propose to hold discussions with the people working on the matter shortly in an effort to discover if we can evolve some solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem, a social problem too, is the question of reformatories. I really think, in spite of the very effective and unselfish work done in our reformatories, that we have not <Col N="248" /> really reached much further than making them places of detention.  I am convinced that, for the removal of social evil, and for the prevention of a great economic evil even, it would be wise on our part to spend a good deal more money in developing our reformatory system.  I do not think it is as good as it should be, even though I do appreciate fully the fine and unselfish work that is being done by the teachers and those in control.  In fact, all the social changes in the world, no matter what social welfare schemes we might introduce, none of them is going to replace the work that is being done in our orphanages for blind children, for mentally deficient children and for the deaf.  I think that members of the Dáil, and public men generally, do not really understand the amount of work that is being done in those schools, the successful work, and the amazing unselfish effort there is.</P>

I found that the blind children could read more clearly and far better than the children outside. No praise could be too great for the patience of those in charge of that school.</P>
      <P>I have seen, in a school for the mentally deficient, the work that is being done, work that no money could buy. I really would like those who believe&mdash; I am not attacking any Party&mdash;in the outstanding value of social welfare to see what is being done at present by unselfish people.  If they could see what is being done, they would realise that State interference can only go a certain distance, and that it must, at some particular time, be reinforced by character, sympathy and charity.</P>

      <P>I would like to say about the National Gallery that, under the new director, it seems to have come alive.  The display of pictures in the National Gallery and the general layout have been much improved.  I have heard strangers, who came along to see <Col N="249" /> me, say that in their opinion the National Gallery is equal to any gallery that they have been through in Europe. I am glad to say that word of praise. We have instituted a series of lectures in art in the National Art Gallery which will take place during the year and which, I hope, will be a valuable educative influence here.  Very good work is being done in the National Library.  It is always satisfactory. Sometimes we are short of money to buy more books.  I hope that if we have to come to the Dáil that the Dáil will be generous with us in this matter.</P>
      <P>One difficulty, in the case of the National Museum, is lack of space.  I have been considering the question of an extension of the museum by way of the creation of a folk museum.  These have been very valuable educative factors in other countries, and we are considering the question of the provision of a folk museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick asked me what were cosmic physics.  Mind you, that was a $64 question.  Nevertheless, cosmic means universe and physics the study of matter and energy.  I have been supplied with a much more informed answer to Deputy Blowick's question, and, if he was really seeking information, I would be very glad to send it to him, but I do not think he was seeking information.  I would suggest to Deputy Blowick that there was in America, at one time, a gentleman like the man who originated the School of Cosmic Physics.  His name was John Quincey Adams, President of the United States.  When he was President, he put forward to Congress the idea of the building of a planetarium, and in his campaign for the Presidency, on the second occasion, this was used against him by the followers of Andrew Jackson, a man like Deputy Blowick. He talked about the man with his head in the stars and his feet off the ground. John Quincey Adams was defeated for the Presidency, but when he was an old man, just before he died, the American people took him out of Cincinnati to speak at the opening ceremony of the first planetarium built in America.  It took America almost 45 years to appreciate the prescience of John Quincey Adams, but I sincerely hope that it will not take Deputy <Col N="250" /> Blowick 45 years to appreciate the fact that Eamon de Valera is a great man.</P>
    <P>Vocational schools have been mentioned, and some difficulties about schools on the borders of counties and of children from other counties going to them.  I think we should live and let live.  I see no reason why, when our universities will have pupils and students from other countries, there should be any reason for denying to County Cork men the opportunity of ever attending a school in the County Limerick or <i>vice versa.</i>  There can always, of course, be a mutual arrangement. I deplore any parochial outlook on that matter.</P>
    <P>Now, as regards agricultural and vocational education.  The city vocational schools, and the vocational schools in the big towns do not need any encouragement.  They are created now and they will gradually snowball into a much bigger organisation; everything is developing that way.  They do not need any further push because they are just developing naturally.</P>
    <P>However, I would like that in the rural vocational schools we should have a very definite bias towards agriculture. Everything taught in the rural vocational schools generally has a rural bias but I am particularly interested in that particular section which deals with matters on the land.  I do think that very good work is being done along those lines and I intend to develop that to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to Macra na Feirme for their co-operation in the development of the vocational schools.  They have been of very great assistance.  Deputy McQuillan mentioned Muintir na Tíre; maybe they are good but I have had no contact with them.  I have had contact with Macra na Feirme and I found that they have been most helpful to us and most anxious to give us co-operation in the development of agriculture in the schools.  There are a number of other matters with which I do not think I need deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies, I think, are aware that Orders made by the Government under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, have to be confirmed by the Dáil within eight months or else they cease to be operative.  This Bill is designed to secure the confirmation of a number of Orders made during the present year imposing, reimposing or altering certain protective duties, and the earliest of them has to be confirmed by legislation before the 24th June.  The commodities affected by these Orders are: cotton quilts and blankets; cast-iron baths; metal pot scourers; component parts of bicycles; personal clothing and wearing apparel; plastic toilet seats and covers; cotton thread and ply yarn; ungalvanised rainwater goods; hard surface floor coverings; dressed sheep skins; agricultural forks and wooden handles.  Of these duties, those imposed on cast-iron baths, metal pot scourers, plastic toilet seats and covers and dressed sheep skins are new protective duties.  The other Orders either effect some change in existing duties or reimpose duties that have been temporarily suspended.  In the case, for example, of cotton quilts and cotton blankets, the Order merely effects an administrative change by transferring these articles from the category of woven articles for domestic use to the category of bedding without altering the rate of duty.  It achieved an administrative conveyance in the administration of the duty.</P>
      <P>The Order dealing with certain component parts of bicycles removed from the scope of the tariff certain components that are not likely to be manufactured here at an early date.</P>
      <P>In the case of cotton thread, ply yarn and agricultural forks, the existing duty had been suspended during the war.  The present Orders affecting these goods restored the duties at reduced rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The Order relating to agricultural forks also deals with wooden handles. The position was that different types of wooden handles were subject to duty at different rates, and there was considerable difficulty in enforcement. It led sometimes to the evasion of the full duty.  Now, one uniform rate of duty has been made effective on all types of wooden handles.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with personal clothing and wearing apparel restored to the clothing industry the same degree of protection as was granted to the industry before the war.</P>
    <P>Iron and steel rainwater goods are subject to duty if protected by galvanising. The practice was developed of protecting them by painting instead of galvanising.  Articles so protected were held by the Revenue Commissioners to be exempt from the duty, and the definition has been altered now so as to prevent the evasion of duty by that device.</P>
    <P>The only other Order to which reference must be made is that relating to the duty upon hard-surface floor coverings, that is to say, oilcloths.  They were subject to a standard rate of duty of 6d. per square yard, which was imposed prior to the war.  The duty became less effective with the alteration in values since the war and has been raised to a flat rate of 1/- per square yard.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned, for instance, one item&mdash;cotton thread.  While naturally we agreed with the imposition of tariffs to protect the home industry, can we take it from the Minister that the imposition will not mean, in this particular instance, a sudden increase in price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of some of these goods, it may be that the exclusion of imports may have an effect on prices, in the sense that imports were coming in here at prices which <Col N="257" /> were regarded as uncompetitive.  In the case of cotton thread, that is distinguishable from the others in the sense that, at present and for a long time past, maximum prices are fixed for cotton thread.  They are still in operation and will be maintained so long as required in order to ensure that supplies are available to everybody at controlled prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an easy thing to do.  In the case of most of these articles manufactured here, no increase in price will follow.  In the case of some, a decrease in price may follow, in the sense that a higher output may result in lower costs.  That is undoubtedly true in the case of wearing apparel.  At the present time because of trade depression in Great Britain, and also because of a certain accumulation of stock there which was manufactured for the Australian market but which has now been excluded there, there would be a possibility of obtaining occasional lots at a lower cost than the same type of goods could be manufactured here.  By excluding these goods, we are depriving ourselves of a temporary advantage of obtaining occasional lots of low priced goods.  By so doing we, of course, keep our own industries functioning and, in the long run, we think this is the wiser course for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain industries we agree that where the market is small, as it is here, overhead costs would be spread over a smaller number of articles and that the price will be higher than if there is a bigger market. I want to get the exact figures.  We agree with the general principle that it is better to employ our people here, thereby creating a small increase.  The House, I suggest, is entitled to know how much that increase is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That information could <Col N="258" /> not be got in each case, if I understand the Deputy rightly.  Where the Government agrees to impose or reimpose a tariff it satisfies itself that the price of the home product will either not be increased or will be kept at what appears to be a reasonable level.  It would not be possible to attempt to estimate to what extent the imposition of tariffs on imported goods has prevented these goods coming in cheaper than they would be manufactured here.  Our position here is that we are a small market.  A large-scale manufacturer in another country can export occasional consignments here at prices lower than he could sell them in the country of origin.  It is just not practicable to attempt to establish any basis of comparison between costs of production here and the price at which this country could occasionally import goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss these matters in a sensible manner. Imports at the present time have the advantage of being placed on the market at low prices.  It is natural for us to assume that the Irish manufactured articles are not on the market at present at as low a price as some of the imported ones owing to the advantages these latter enjoy.  If the price of the Irish article at the present time is based on cost of production, plus a certain profit, will the Minister say if there will be a danger of an added profit being put on such articles as a result of protection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of some of these goods like clothing, competition will take care of that situation.  There is a large number of factories, most of which are not producing to capacity at the moment and which are cutting their prices in an endeavour to get sales.  In the case of other goods mentioned, there might be only one producer and, in such a case, the Department will take measures to ensure that an arrangement is entered into by the firm concerned as to the prices at which its products will be sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking yesterday there were a few items which I was not able to reach, and in dealing with them now I will be as brief as possible.  There is mention in this Bill of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and some speakers drew attention to it.  It is important to do so, especially as there is provision in this measure whereby a person borrowing under the Small Dwellings Act will have advantages additional to those available under the previous measure. As that is the case I should like to <Col N="260" /> draw attention to what are, to my mind, abuses under that Act.  In order to be able to borrow under that Act a person is supposed to be unable to build his own house without borrowing. I may be wrong but from my reading of the Act it seems that people who are solvent financially and well able to put up the necessary money, be it from their own bank balance or by any other means, are able to borrow under the Act.  I believe that these people are not entitled to the advantages offered by it.</P>
      <P>I have noticed on many occasions in County Cork persons, by manager's order, getting various amounts of money on loan from the county council &mdash;anything from £700 to £900 or £1,000, and maybe £1,200 and £1,300.  There was one specific instance, to which I drew attention at a meeting of the Cork County Council, of a person&mdash;not a national of this country&mdash;who came to reside here.  Because he was able to get two people living in the locality to act as guarantors he was able to get from the county council the advantages offered by this Act in the shape of a large sum of money.  At the same time other people have been denied these advantages.  The Minister may say, as any Minister for Local Government might say, that it is a matter of final arrangement by the local authority, but it is because it is mentioned in the Bill that I want to draw the Minister's attention to abuses and disadvantages which are so noticeable in connection with it.  I want to give full credit to the authorities in some of the counties who are wise enough, sensible enough and businesslike enough in their approach to make such arrangements as to enable ordinary decent Irish people who are anxious to build their homes, but who are not in a position to put their hands in their pockets or draw on their bank balance, to do so.</P>

    <P>In some counties, when an applicant lodges the title deeds of his house and plot of land on which he is building, and, I presume, provides an insurance policy indemnifying the local authority in case of fire, he will get, provided the local authority is satisfied that he is a safe person, an amount of money <Col N="261" /> by way of loan under the Small Dwellings Act.  Unfortunately in other counties, and particularly in County Cork, as well as giving the full title deeds, an applicant must also get two solvent sureties, two guarantors, to guarantee him for 35 years.  I believe that is fantastic, because, no matter who the applicant may be, even if he is in a fairly safe job with good wages, it is scarcely possible to expect two neighbours, no matter how they may trust him, to guarantee him for 35 long years.</P>
    <P>The result is, as I have already stated in Cork, that there are people now living as tenants of local authority houses who never wished to go into these houses.  They wanted to build their own homes, but they were not facilitated by the local authority under this Act.  As I say, in some counties people can get loans on handing in their title deeds.  The local authority has a full mortgage on the house then and it is important to remember that, as they only give roughly 80 per cent. of the balance after the grant has been deducted, it means that the county council cannot possibly be at a loss.  If anything could be done in this particular respect to help the person who is not financially able to go on with the building of his own house&mdash;it means that the local authority will not then have to house him in a house for which in many instances the tenant does not pay an economic rent because the rents are subsidised to a certain degree&mdash;it will have the effect, at least in County Cork&mdash;it may be difficult and some local authorities may say that it is a ministerial usurpation of their powers&mdash;of enabling many people, such as tradesmen and artisans, who at present have to be housed by the local authority, to go ahead with the building of their houses, without having to beg their well-to-do neighbours to act as guarantors for them and will eventually be a great help to the local authority and to the applicant.</P>
    <P>Section 5 repeals Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  There is a complication again in Section 7 of the 1950 Act and while normally it may seem that Section 5 of this Act before us in repealing that <Col N="262" /> Section 7 will remedy things, my difficulty is that already so much confusion has been caused&mdash;and I am sure the Minister's Department is aware of the difficulties of prospective successful applicants for the double grant, that is, the extra grant from county councils&mdash; that the whole thing has been held in a certain degree of suspense for these people.</P>
    <P>It seems&mdash;at any rate, in County Cork again&mdash;that many of the people who had built their homes within even the last 12 months or a year and a half were getting the grant not as individuals, but as paid-up members of a public utility society and the Government grants went through the utility society to them.  Then, from a legal aspect, we have been informed&mdash;as such persons expecting the advantages of getting a local grant as well as the Government grant were informed also&mdash; that members of a public utility society should not get the benefit of the second grant.  I am sorry to say that while the Cork County Council did, in principle, provide a certain sum of money, roughly £60,000, for paying a number of applicants, when they came up against this difficulty the whole thing was held up.  What I would like the Minister to say is whether it is possible for us to get out of that difficulty, whether in view of the fact that these people were&mdash;indirectly, perhaps&mdash;informed that they could avail of the additional grant from the county council within the last 12 months or so&mdash;I am speaking of new houses and the improved grants here applied to reconstruction&mdash;in the case of newly-built houses, some provision may be made whereby we can straighten out this legal difficulty.  If we cannot do that, it seems that a larger number of people will not be able to avail of the second grant.  That, in itself, will be a grave disappointment to many people who have already completed their homes, and it will even in the future be a deterrent to people to build even through the system of the public utility society.</P>
    <P>The irony of it is that, as every Deputy here who is a member of a local authority knows, when there is a legal quibble or when a legal question crops <Col N="263" /> up at any council meeting, everyone is going to suffer by it.  In our county, as well as those who have been told they are not eligible, there is a large number who get their grants as individuals and not as members of a utility society, but just because the legal question has arisen everybody has suffered by it.  Therefore, I should like if the Minister could help us in this matter by saying if there is any way whereby we could get over this difficulty.  Financially, it will not make any difference in the amounts, but it will make an awful difference to the recipients, the people who had hoped they would get this double grant and who have been denied it and who, perhaps, in the future, as well as in the past, will be denied it.  It is no use for us here in discussing impending legislation to hope for the very best, while at the same time we may see difficulties or some problem which will mean that, in spite of all our efforts to help in the case of improving legislation, there is a hindrance to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also an item to which I would like to draw attention in Section 32 (1) (c).  It mentions there&mdash; which in itself is excellent&mdash;the right of local authorities to sell or to lease land.  I mentioned this from one angle last night, showing the advantages of that, and certainly they can be many. There is, however, one point I would like to have clarified.  They can lease or sell to utility societies or to private individuals.  That in itself may be an advantage to county councils, as naturally such people will not sell at any price which means a loss to themselves. Could there be a danger there, however?  In the case of a private individual buying land from a county council, according to my reading of this there seems to be no provision whereby the county council will have any say whatsoever regarding the rents that he as a private individual may charge tenants afterwards. It may be difficult to get over that.</P>
    <P>I said last night at the very outset that in the remarks I would offer to this measure I was simply asking for information or trying to help in any <Col N="264" /> possible way.  I consider, as a member of a local authority, that the obligation is on the local authority in this respect.  If the Cork County Council were to facilitate in the future any group of individuals or any single individuals, the onus would be on us to see that since that person or group was getting certain advantages through the efforts of the local authority, that person should be in such a position that he could not play on the market just as it suited him, according to the supply and demand for houses.  That is why I should consider it important to have some protection.  We all realise that in the case of building and letting houses a person is entitled to a fair return.  That is natural.  However, if the local authority is to facilitate such a group or such an individual, the local authority should be in a position to see that the person getting these advantages is not going to charge rents which will be prohibitive.  Some of the rents already being charged in the Cork suburbs are definitely prohibitive.  It is no use for us to offer advantages to people who are just simply out to enrich themselves at the expense of the individual in the State and also at the expense of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Another point I should mention is the question of loan charges.  Again, it is only a matter of my inquiring for information.  This Bill states that the charges will be governed by Local Loans Fund limit.  As far as I can see, there may be a difficulty there again.  For instance, when a local authority is offering money or is advancing loans to prospective tenants or builders, their difficulty is that if they raise the money through their own banks that bank, or group of banks as the case may be, will probably be charging a higher rate of interest than the Local Loans Fund. It means then that, while it is not the fault of the county manager or of the members, that local authority is not being recouped to the degree it should be recouped.  The answer the Minister may give may be a genuine one.  I am simply drawing his attention to it in order to find out what exactly might be done in regard to it.  Could there be some compromise in the case of a <Col N="265" /> local authority having to secure their money through the banks, such banks charging a higher rate of interest than allowed by the Local Loans Fund?  I would like to know where we stand in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I now want to draw attention to something about which the Minister and I have differed for a long time. Everyone is entitled to his view.  The Minister, as any Minister of State must, depends on the information given to him.  Members of this House or of local authorities have their responsibilities to the people that they represent and, when we are given information which has been verified time and again, there is an obligation on us to draw the attention of the responsible authorities.  I refer to the question of the delay in sanctioning grants, reconstruction or otherwise.</P>
    <P>This Bill has advantages.  The 1950 Bill had certain advantages.  The difficulty, of course, is that a local authority cannot pay up until the person reconstructing or building is in a position to secure the Government grant.  I have had reports which I have checked in the local authority offices in Cork and I repeat what I have stated on other occasions in the Dáil that there are extraordinary delays in dealing with claims.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming local officials.  I am not blaming the inspector.  As I have said in this House, I know their difficulties.  The amount of work involved in such a large county as Cork is so great that it is impossible under the present system for an inspector to carry out his duties as we should like them to be carried out.  The Minister informed me some time ago that where there is a large amount of work to be carried out additional help is given. That may be so.  The difficulty is that the persons who are awaiting grants have not gained one iota.  I have had complaints that these people are being pressed by builders' providers and contractors for the money, and that they cannot pay because they are themselves held up.</P>
    <P>If there could be more co-operation between the local authority engineers and the local inspector of the Department, it might help somewhat but, if <Col N="266" /> the people are to obtain the advantages of this Bill, it is imperative that there should be as little delay as possible in giving this money.  People who are anxious to obtain the benefits of the Bill discover that in the case of their neighbours there was a very long delay, and that militates against the work that could be carried out under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said at the beginning that any criticisms I have to offer of this Bill are offered sincerely.  I have tried to be constructive in my criticism. I wish the Minister and the staff concerned with this Bill the best of luck in bringing before the House a measure that will help to relieve those who are anxious to carry out reconstruction or to build houses.  No matter what Minister or what Government brings in a Bill of such an important nature as this is, they are entitled to the greatest possible co-operation.  If we could get the information which we should like to have on the points that I have raised we would know whether it is possible to have any of these matters cleared up by the Minister.  If we are wrong in our approach, and if we are assured by the Minister when he is replying that our approach is not correct, I can assure the Minister that we will accept the Minister's word, and will continue to give a full measure of sincere co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Deputies, welcome this Bill.  There are problems here.  It is unfair that further burdens should be thrown under this Bill or under any Housing Act on the ordinary ratepayers.  When Section 7 of the Housing Act was introduced the Cork County Council, in common with other bodies, received a shoal of applications for grants.  When we began to examine the scheme we found that the applications for grants would represent roughly a burden of between 3/- and 4/- in the £ on the ratepayers of the county and that 85 per cent. of the applicants were not county ratepayers. Due largely to the neglect of housing by the local corporation in Cork for a number of years there is an unfair burden being thrown on the county in respect of the area immediately surrounding the City of Cork.  That is very <Col N="267" /> easily seen in the hundreds of applications for non-municipal houses in the vicinity of the city.  It never showed up more glaringly than when we came to prepare a scheme to give grants under Section 7.</P>
      <P>In the scheme that we first submitted to the Minister we had taken steps to protect county ratepayers in some way. I understand that there are complaints from the city that they have not the power to make those grants for building outside the city, but I suggest to the Minister that power should be given&mdash;that an amendment should be made to this Bill that would give that power to the corporation.  I understand that a local authority, under this Bill, has power to lease land to an individual. Perhaps that will get over the difficulty.  I can see no justification for asking a man who, through the other provisions of this Act, is prohibited from obtaining a reconstruction grant in his own case and is prohibited even from getting a grant under Section 7, to provide through his rates for a grant for individuals far better off than himself.  There is no comparison. In a very large portion of my constituency a farmer whose poor law valuation does not exceed £35 on land and buildings would not be the occupier of 20 statute acres of arable land where the valuation is up to 30/- an acre.  I do not think the Minister would dream of comparing a farmer with 20 acres of land with a gentleman with £400 odd a year.  Unfortunately, under Griffith's valuation these anomalies occur.  It is bad enough to have a large section of the ratepayers in my constituency cut out, as they have been cut out&mdash;during my time, at any rate&mdash; from taking advantage of any of the Housing Acts that have been introduced, but it is worse still to have them compelled at the same time to give grants to people who are far better off than they.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like this manoeuvre by which the Minister now takes power under the letting grants.  I saw Deputy Keyes, when he was Minister for Local Government, attempting that game before.  We resisted him in the interests of the ratepayers we represent. <Col N="268" /> Surely there should be some means, if the Minister is going to exercise that power, by which he would step in and prevent extortionate rents being charged?  I suggest the best judges of whether or not a rent is extortionate or unreasonable are the local authorities concerned and not the people in Dublin who have no knowledge of local circumstances.  I feel rather keenly on that as one who had to fight it and who had to fight it with the practically unanimous support of our own local authority.  You had people of the get-rich-quick class coming along building houses and charging whatever rents they would get due to the scarcity of accommodation. They charged that rent and got away with it and then came along to get £40 for ten years off the local authority and put it in their pockets as additional profit.  I suggest to the Minister that he is doing wrong in taking the power which he is taking in the Bill, that the best judges as to whether a rent is extortionate or not are the local authorities themselves.  I think we have at all times been reasonable in our approach to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what has happened. I can give the Minister definite proof that the moment Section 7 was passed by this House and the moment these schemes were adopted, housing contractors put up the price of houses by over £200.  This section of the Bill is not going to benefit, to the extent the Minister thinks, the man who wants to build his own house.  The men who are going to draw the honey out of this are the building contractors unless the Minister has some means of keeping contractors within some kind of bounds.  The contractor is the man who is going to draw the loot.  As soon as they found in Cork that the county council were doubtful about giving grants or when it became doubtful whether the grants would be given or not, the price of the houses fell.  We are not here to provide loot for certain sections of the community at the <Col N="269" /> expense of others.  We know what contractors do.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister, because this is a matter which is definitely holding up housing by local authorities in Cork, whether he can provide any means by which, when land is taken by a local authority from an individual, that individual can be paid in his lifetime for the land.  We, as members of local authorities, have to travel around selecting sites for people who apply to us for houses, whether labourers' cottages or non-municipal houses.  We go into a farmer's land and tell him that we want two or three acres, as the case may be. The man then asks: &ldquo;When are you going to pay me for the land you took off me in 1948, on which you have a house built?  Jack So-and-so lives in it now, but I have not seen a penny for my land yet.&rdquo;  Is the Minister aware that, out of some 490 of these cases in the area of the South Cork Board of Health, only 60 people have yet been paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will send down a few of his officials to travel around with the sites committee. I can assure him that I will see that they will get a proper welcome. I suggest to the Minister that it is time that the ceiling was removed from reconstruction grants.  As I pointed out, a farmer in my constituency, with a valuation of £35, is regarded as a small farmer; some of them have round about 20 acres of land.</P>
      <P>There are two ways open to a farmer of that class if he requires a house.  In a large number of cases what is happening is that he goes in for building a new house where he could have reconstructed the old one. He builds a new house because he will get a Government grant.  Then he goes to the county council and borrows money.  In a large number of cases the person concerned &ldquo;goes burst&rdquo;.  I do not agree with Deputy Desmond in regard to waiving the sureties in the case of loans, particularly in the case of the professional classes and others. Circumstances change very quickly and if anything happens the breadwinner of the household the county council will be out of their money for quite a long time because a county council will be very slow to evict a widow and children out of a house and there will be no other course left to them if the sureties are not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, 80 per cent. of the loans granted by the Cork County Council have been given to individuals who did not reside in the county.  They resided in the city, but because the Cork Corporation neglected their duty these people came out to the more generous country boys for cash to build homes for themselves.  Up to the present about £200,000 has been issued by the Cork County Council in loans. That is a pretty hefty Bill.  So far as the grants are concerned, I hope the Minister will either make provision in this Bill by which the Cork Corporation can lease land and give grants to people desirous of building new houses for themselves or bring in an amendment which will at least protect the rural population from having to provide <Col N="271" /> for people who are far better off than themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard of the discussion on this Bill, it seems to be welcomed by every Deputy because of the improved conditions which it contains, particularly as they apply to the rural areas and to the slum areas in urban towns and boroughs.  I am glad to see provision made by which a grant of up to £50 will be given to any person who builds a house in an area where there is not an existing water supply.  That is certainly something that was needed, because if a water supply did not exist in an area in which houses have been built the facilities for sanitation, etc., could not be availed of.  Under this Bill a man who builds a house in such an area will be given a grant to provide himself with a water supply and, as far as I can interpret the Bill, he can also take advantage of the grant which applies to houses in which there is proper sanitation.  In addition such a house will be free of rates for seven years.</P>
      <P>The provision in Section 8 is one which I cannot understand.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A grant shall not be made under Sections 9, 10 or 11 of this Act to or in respect of a person who, at the date of his application for such grant, is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) living in premises provided by a housing authority or by the commissioners of a town under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts if such premises have been disposed of to him (whether by sale or lease) by the authority, or</P>
      <P>(ii) occupying premises, acquired by a housing authority or by the commissioners of a town under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts, which, in the opinion of the authority, are not of a type suitable for occupation by a person of the working classes or an agricultural labourer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person purchases a house which had been the property of a local authority, and is the occupier of that <Col N="272" /> house, I cannot understand why he should be prevented from taking advantage of the provisions in Sections 9, 10 and 11.  I cannot see why he should not be put in the same category as any individual who would qualify under other sections of the Bill.  I fail to see why he should not be allowed to take advantage of any grant which is available to people who are the owners of houses which are not local authority houses.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on that point.</P>
    <P>The question of local authority grants will be a big problem for most local authorities.  The local authority of which I am a member have not yet decided to do anything in connection with these grants, even under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  At the same time, I am glad to see that where a local authority is prepared to supplement the relevant grants a system is laid down governing the allocation of particular grants.  A farmer of £12 10s. valuation can get the full grant decided upon by the local authority. According as his valuation increases the amount of the grant decreases until a valuation of £35 is reached, when there is no further grant.  The same thing applies so far as grants to people in the lower income classes are concerned&mdash;from £208 to £416.  I believe the introduction of that system will help the local authorities if they decide to implement the local authority grants in connection with these houses.</P>
    <P>I come now to the reconstruction grants.  Again I must compliment the Minister on the section whereby a floor space of over 1,400 square feet will not prevent a person from taking advantage of the reconstruction grant and also on the section whereby the grant is increased from £80 to £100 in the case of a four-roomed house and from £100 to £120 in the case of a five-roomed house.  The big point, however, is the provision whereby a person will qualify for a grant even though the floor space is greater than 1,400 square feet.  Since those grants were provided there has at all times been a difficulty in respect of certain people living in big houses which are in bad repair&mdash;people who are not themselves in a financial position to have them repaired and who <Col N="273" /> are disqualified from being able to take advantage of the grant because the floor space exceeds the specified area.  At first the area was 1,200 square feet and later it was increased to 1,400 square feet.  Anybody whose house exceeded that area could not get the grant.  The result was that a number of people in rural areas who lived in that type of house and who were not themselves in a financial position to have it repaired could not take advantage of the grant.  I compliment the Minister on the new provision.  I am sure a number of people throughout the country are very glad that the Minister has seen his way to increase the floor space area.</P>
    <P>There is also another point in connection with the reconstruction grant. Provision is made in this Bill whereby a person who received a grant for reconstruction work and carried out that particular work can now, if that reconstruction work was executed ten years ago, and if it is a question of covering a roof that was thatched with slates or tiles, obtain a second grant.  The old stipulation of 15 years between the issue of the first and the second grant has been set aside and the period is now ten years instead of 15 years. However, I should like the Minister to reconsider that matter, as it is a hardship on certain people also.  A number of people took advantage of the £40 grant when the grant first became available.  Some of those people had houses with a slated roof which had not deteriorated to the extent that it required stripping and re-slating. Therefore they used that grant to build a small additional room or a small porch for shelter ór to do some external and internal plastering, and in some cases they probably got new windows and new doors.  They preferred to use the grant in that manner rather than strip and slate the roof, because though the roof might not have been in perfect condition it had not deteriorated to the extent that it was necessary to take it off.  I would remind the Minister of the heavy storms which occur in this country from time to time. Where you have an old slate roof, particularly in this country, ten or 12 years make a big difference in its life. Therefore I ask the Minister to look <Col N="274" /> into this matter and see if he cannot agree to allow this provision to stand as it is but to add that, as in the case of a thatched roof to be covered by slates or tiles, it will apply also to a roof of old slates.  I hope I have made my point clear.  I desire that in the case of an old slated roof, which ten or 12 years ago had a lifetime of ten or 12 years before it, the individual concerned will be given the facility of a second grant to strip that old roof and replace it either with slates or tiles.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Desmond recount for us the position that obtains in Cork City and Cork County Council in reference to the loan involved under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I was surprised to hear him say that not only had the individuals who are looking for the loan to deposit their title deeds in connection with their land etc., in the county council offices, but they had also to provide two solvent sureties.  That qualification does not obtain in the council with which I am associated.  I attend housing meetings every month, and we have two or three applications for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The individual who asks for a loan is sent out a certain document containing a certain number of queries.  The applicant is supposed to fill in that document and return it to the county council secretary.  He is asked to give certain information as to his financial circumstances in general.  That is verified as far as possible by the county secretary and, when the matter comes before the housing committee, the councillors from the particular area in which the individual is looking for the loan to build the house, express their views on the <i>bona fides</i> of the particular individual concerned.  After that, so far as I know, at any rate, there is no other qualification necessary.</P>

      <P>I am speaking for the county council.  We do not look for them as far as I know.  I was surprised when I heard Deputy Desmond <Col N="275" /> state that.  Deputies Corry and Desmond referred to the acquisition of land in order to develop it, sell it or lease it either to individuals or public utility societies.  Some people interested in house building are very fearful because of Sections 29 and 32 of this Bill.  They are afraid that the councils will take upon themselves to acquire land from an individual.  It may be a voluntary purchase.  It may be necessary to acquire the land. Where the council will acquire that land&mdash;if it is potential building ground which, I presume, it would be, otherwise the council would not acquire it &mdash;they cannot understand why the council should take that land from them and afterwards either sell or lease it either to individuals or public utility societies who will eventually reap the benefit because of the fact that it was good building ground and the former owners will possibly receive not even the ordinary market value of the land concerned.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to that and let him know that there are certain people who are worried about those particular sections.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister on the matter when he is replying.</P>
      <P>I think I have nothing further to add except to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  It does contain very much improved conditions particularly in its application to the rural areas.  There is just one matter I had overlooked.  It is a very important matter and it is one to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  I refer to the cost of building ordinary labourers' cottages to-day and the rents the tenant will have to pay eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have built quite a number of cottages in the County Wicklow in the past two or three years.  The approximate cost of the cottages was somewhere in the region of £800 as a result of the Government grant and, for a period, the moneys from the Transition Development Fund, plus the imposition of a certain amount on the rates in the year.  The rates, I think, amounted to somewhere in the region of 1/- a week for cottages.  The cottages built in the past two or three years have been let to tenants at approximately <Col N="276" /> 4/- a week.  That was the rent for a cottage built at a cost of £800 which is subsidised by the ordinary grant, by the moneys from the Transition Development Fund and the amount levied on the rates by the county during the year.</P>
    <P>Within the past 12 months or so the cost of a similar-type cottage has risen from £800 to approximately £930 or £940.  That represents an increase of about 15 or 16 per cent. on the cost of building.  I am not quite sure about the percentage, but the unfortunate thing about it is that, while there is only 15 or 16 per cent. of an increase on the cost of building, there is an increase of 100 per cent. on the rent which will be charged to the individual who will eventually have to occupy one of those houses that cost £940.  It is hardly necessary for me to point out the difficulties that will arise there.</P>
    <P>You have one individual living in a cottage, built within the past 18 months under a scheme at an approximate cost of £800, who is paying 4/- a week, and you will have another man living a couple of hundred yards up the same road in a cottage built under another scheme, the cost of which is approximately £940, who will be asked to pay 8/6 a week to meet the commitments. If it is the intention of the Minister and of the local authorities to do their utmost to house those who are in need of houses, it will be impossible to solve the problem while that position obtains because we will get very few tenants for our cottages at rents such as I have suggested when we make the comparison as between A and B.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we will get over that difficulty.  There is the extra £130.  It is not subsidised and that makes all the difference.  Something will have to be done.  No tenant will go into a cottage and pay 8/6 per week when his fellow-worker is in a cottage 100 yards away at 4/- a week.  I am afraid local authorities did not ask for enough in the last housing drive.  I know that even 4/- provides a certain difficulty for an ordinary farm labourer.  A rent of 4/-, on a cottage costing £800, bears no relationship whatever to 1/- per week on a cottage built for £80 40 or 50 years ago.  I am <Col N="277" /> afraid that is where the mistake was made.  How we will overcome the difficulty I do not know.  The Minister will have to try to get the local authority out of its present unhappy position. As long as the present position obtains tenants will not be found for the houses that are being built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any steps taken to give an impetus to the housing drive will be welcomed by everybody but I do not see anything in this Bill which will make the housing of the working classes any easier in the future than it has been in the past.  The difficulty in relation to tenants will arise in regard to their inability to pay the rates charged.  For a four-roomed house built by the Cork Corporation at the moment the lowest charges are anything up to £66 a year.  The lowest charges on a five-roomed house are up to £83 per year.  When one converts that into weekly payments the interest on the rent alone is something in the region of 25/- in the one case and 30/-, or more, in the other case, plus all the other costs in meeting the housing situation in Cork.  I take it that the new bank rate which came into operation last March will go on to the cost of housing by the different public bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think it would and it will go on the people to whom Deputy T. Brennan referred, the people who are not anxious to pay these rates.</P>
      <P>I see that Cork Corporation, as well as Dublin Corporation, will not be able to take advantage of the Local Loans Fund under this Bill.  The Dublin people can speak for themselves.  As far as Cork is concerned, our difficulty is to get money on the open market. The Cork Corporation floated loans as far back as 1939.  When we asked for £250,000 we got £142,000 from the investing public.  The banks at that time did not give us as much as one shilling because we floated the loan at 4 per cent. at par.  We floated a loan last year of £500,000 and we got less than one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> The Minister for Finance had to come to the rescue and make up the balance. We have still 20,000 to house in Cork City, and if we were to meet their requirements over the next five years we would have to build 800 houses per year.  For that purpose we would require £500,000 each year to carry out our programme.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must admit that Cork City, where 1d. in the £ brings in less than £100,000, should be able to avail of the Local Loans Fund rather than have the corporation looking for money on the open market.  The position may be easier for Dublin because the wealth of the country is concentrated in Dublin, and Dublin Corporation may be able to get money on the open market, but the year before last they had difficulty in getting £5,000,000 from the banks.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider Section 14 as far as Cork Corporation is concerned, and reconsider his attitude in connection with the raising of money on the open market.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have seriously faced the financial aspect of housing. Where will we get the money if we depend on the investing public and on the banks?  Can we expect to get money for housing at 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. while people are offering 10 per cent. for industrial concerns. Not so long ago there was a request for £200,000 share capital from the investing public.  In less than 15 minutes £7,000,000 was offered to that particular firm.  That is on record. The chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation stated that it created a record for all time.  Last year we asked for £500,000 in Cork.  We gave all the security we had, rents, rates and everything else, and all we got was less than one-third of £500,000.  Are we really facing up to the financial aspect of housing when we leave it in that casual way?  Who will give us the money?</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should consult with his Cabinet and face up to the reality of meeting the financial aspect of housing.  The tenants cannot pay the rents.  The ordinary man earning £6 a week&mdash;and the Taoiseach told us recently that the £ is now worth only <Col N="279" /> 9/&mdash; cannot walk into a corporation house to-morrow morning and pay £50 on the rent alone for interest charges, plus all the other charges.  The ordinary workers in Cork to-day are paying 39/- and 40/- a week rent because it so happens that they have a son or a daughter in employment, and the combined incomes are taken into consideration.  Under the differential renting system these tenants are paying 30/- a week, 35/- a week and 40/-a week rent.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Government and to the members of the House that this housing question is going to remain with us until the financial aspect of it is tackled.  We have not done that up to this, and this Bill does not indicate any change in that respect. The building of smaller houses in the hope that the tenants would be able to meet the rents was advocated by some Deputies.  The aim surely should be to raise the standard of living accommodation for large working class families and not to lower it.  It is a poor thing that a suggestion to build smaller houses should be made, especially in these days when we hear so much talk about progress, education and enlightenment.  I hope it is one that is not going to be entertained.</P>
    <P>The building of flats was also advocated. I said here eight or ten years ago, and I repeat it now, that I am definitely opposed to the building of flats.  What that really means is the warehousing of human beings.  I feel very much indeed for the big numbers of decent people who are obliged to live even in the modern flats.  Suppose, for example, there was an outbreak of disease, what chance would there be of segregating the big numbers of people congregated in flats? There surely would be a very great danger in that respect.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I feel that neither in this Bill nor in previous Bills have we faced up to the financial aspect of housing.  Until we do that the situation is not going to be greatly improved.  That is a point that I am especially concerned to put before the Minister, or before any Minister in charge of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hickey's reference to flats has tempted me to speak on this Bill.  He referred to the danger of disease spreading in flats if there did happen to be an outbreak in one of them.  That did occur, of course, in the old days when we had big numbers of people living in the old tenement houses in this city, but I suggest that now that we have fine new flats for the housing of the people there is no such danger.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Hickey to accompany me through the city to see the magnificent new self-contained flats which have been built by the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited them long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the new self-contained flats with the separate hall doors opening on to balconies.  An outbreak of disease would have no chance of spreading there.  In the case of the old tenement houses such a thing as the Deputy mentioned was possible.  The new flats built by the corporation are magnificent ones. They are of the same type as those built by big companies, utility societies and corporations in London and in other big cities, not in hundreds but in thousands.</P>
      <P>Dublin is such a very old city that it is almost impossible to get sites in it for housing, and so we have to send our people out to live in Coolock and Baldoyle.  The latter is seven miles out and men employed in the city who have to travel that distance to and from their work are suffering grave hardships by having to pay high rents for their houses, as well as bus fares amounting to 10/- or 15/- a week.  I am aware of one such case where the bus fare amounts to 15/- a week. Deputies should remember that the transport service in the city is in the hands of a monopoly and that, without permission from anybody, it can increase bus fares.  The desire of all of us is to increase the standard of living for our people, but it is hard to do that under the conditions I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am definitely for flats.  I am ready to shout from the house-tops for good self-contained flats of the type <Col N="281" /> which the corporation has recently built at Fatima Mansions and Donore Avenue.  I would ask the Minister and his staff to visit them.  There is not anything of the kind in Europe that could compete with them.  They are three and four-roomed flats.  The people living in them are quite happy. They are near their work and near churches, schools, cinemas, hospitals and dispensaries.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hickey that the ideal solution would be cottages for the people, and not small cottages either.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will see that nothing will be done to build a smaller type of cottage than we have at present&mdash;nothing less than three rooms and a kitchen, because people want to rear their families in decency.  I agree with Deputy Hickey on three of the four points he made.  I would ask the Minister to see that, through the Department of Finance, local authorities will get increased grants to enable them to build houses and flats at a lower price than they can do so at present.  The best and the most magnificent return we can get for such expenditure is good health amongst our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a better return than what you get from the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authorities could get increased grants they would be able to let the houses at lower rents.  Deputy Hickey referred to the extravagant rents which working-class families are expected to pay.  In Dublin, unfortunately, the people, as well as having to pay the high rents which are being demanded, are, in many cases, called upon to pay up to £1 a week in bus fares.  That applies to workers who have to travel long distances to their work in the city.  That is one reason why I and my colleagues in the corporation feel that we must do something to rebuild old Dublin. It is a grand old city where we have churches and schools and every other convenience for the people.  Something must be done in the direction I speak of.  We have nothing but praise for both Governments for the efforts they have made to help us.  We had <Col N="282" /> to take down old tenement houses in this city in which you had eight and ten families living.  You had tenement houses of that type in Seán MacDermott Street accommodating up to 60 people.  Thank God, they are all gone or nearly all gone, due to the activities of the Governments we have had here over the years.  I should like it to go on record that from the first day we got the power to manage our own affairs our Governments have attempted to solve this problem.  We cleared a site in Dublin that was known as Glorney's Buildings.  It was the worst in Europe.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to put up there new blocks of flats.  I hope the Minister will not be swayed by anybody who would suggest that we must not have flats.  I, like Deputy Hickey, would prefer cottages if we had the sites, but we cannot get them in the city.  The result is that the working-class people have to live miles outside the city and pay high rents and high bus fares.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this housing problem which I would like to refer to.  I met a small shopkeeper not long ago who said to me: &ldquo;Our rates are going up and at the same time you are taking our customers from us.&rdquo;  These small shopkeepers admit that they are very happy to see the people being housed, but they complain that, when they are taken outside the city to the new houses, they lose their custom.  They say that the corporation is paying a high price for sites on the outskirts of the city.  I have already pointed out that it is impossible to get sites in the city for building.  The complaint made by those small shopkeepers is that they have lost the custom of those who formerly lived in the vicinity of their shop premises.  The people who own the sites on which shops are being built demand high ground rent from the shopkeepers.  These shopkeepers must get the high rent somewhere and, therefore, they put it on to the cost of the goods for sale.  Any persons living on the outskirts of the city who are glad and happy to get houses must pay the prices charged.  We must bear in mind the cost of transporting goods to these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has raised some <Col N="283" /> points that I intended to make.  I congratulate the Deputy on what he has said.  I agree with him on three out of four of his points.  The position would be different if Cork were as old as Dublin.  Fortunately for the people of Cork, they can afford to move further outside the city boundaries than the people of Dublin.  Dublin has no sites.  Sites on the outskirts of Dublin have to be compulsorily acquired at very high prices.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word in relation to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. People are taking full advantage of the loans given under these Acts and the loans given by the public utility societies. I feel the corporation should be enabled compulsorily to acquire land at a nominal rent; the present rent is too high.</P>
    <P>A young man who wishes to build his own house usually has to deposit £250; he gets £275 by way of Government grant and he gets the balance under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. The ground rent charged by the corporation is usually about £10 per annum and, to my mind, that is twice the amount it should be.  I read recently in a morning paper that £200 was being asked for private sites and £20 a year ground rent.  I fail to realise why that charge should be allowed.  I cannot understand how the people who charge this sum can stretch their consciences so far as to take such an amount of money from the types of persons who choose to build houses for themselves.  The scarcity of sites is the difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has made reference to the differential rents.  Like the Deputy, I earnestly hope that the Government and the municipal authorities will be able to do something to see that the rents will be somewhat reduced, and that the people will get houses at a rent which they can afford to pay without causing any hardship to their families.</P>
    <P>The limit of £1,800 which is advanced under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts is, in my opinion, too little. I feel that the Minister should reconsider that matter with a view to seeing if the limit could be advanced even to <Col N="284" /> £2,000.  The cost of house building has increased, rents have gone up and interest on borrowed money is going up. Therefore, people will find it more difficult to purchase houses.  People are very desirous of owning their own houses in Dublin, and I am sure the same is true of the people in Cork, in other cities and big towns and in the country districts.  Workers earning £8, £9 or £10 a week wish either to build or purchase their own houses.  It would be well if the Minister would encourage municipal authorities to continue the house building projects.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, his officials and my own colleagues to visit the new corporation houses which have been erected at Philipsburgh Avenue, Fairview, which is situated within a twopenny bus ride of Nelson's Pillar. We in the corporation take pride in our achievements.  We built 210 houses in this district and the applicants for them numbered 1,700.  The conditions laid down were that the purchaser should pay a deposit of £50 and legal expenses amounting to £25.  It was heartbreaking to sit on the committee and try to decide which 200 of the 1,700 applicants were the most deserving. In that instance there were 1,700 people wishing to become owners and to give their families a good chance.  I advocate strongly that the municipal authorities, both in Dublin, in Cork and in the big towns and other cities should adopt the house-building projects so as to give a man and his family a special interest in life.  If a man has to pay £2 per week outgoings on a house he will, at least, know that he is thereby becoming the owner of the premises.  Deputy Hickey has informed us that it costs 36/- per week to rent a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>£2 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It costs £2 per week to rent a house.  The position in Dublin is that the intending purchaser of a corporation house has to deposit £50. pay £25 by way of legal expenses and pay outgoings of £2 per week for a period of 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his interest.  Recently he gave his blessing to our efforts, and we hope to continue <Col N="285" /> our good work.  I feel that the occupiers of municipally-owned houses built within the past 20 years should be given an opportunity of becoming the owners of these premises.  Becoming the owners of houses built prior to that period might not be an asset to the people concerned.  I feel a scheme should be evolved immediately so that every person would be given an opportunity of becoming the owner of his own home.  My reason for saying that is that the Soldiers' and Sailors' Land Trust are bringing out a scheme through which they will sell houses to their tenants.  I trust the Minister will not mind my getting this point in: it has been brought to my notice that occasionally there is an eviction from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Trust houses pending the sale of these houses to the tenants.  I know one case concerning a soldier from the British Army.  Both he and his wife died.  They have left a large family who will be turned out on the roadside unless our Government and the British Government take steps to try to prevent these evictions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to consider the point put forward by Deputy Hickey advocating the granting to municipal authorities of increased grants which will permit the letting of houses at a fair rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good many new matters included in this Bill.  One of the new sections which, I feel, will be most welcome in the Gaeltacht area is the section allowing those people who have built houses under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts to qualify for a county council grant.  I would like the Minister to consider the following point: if he would allow those people who have got the first grant before the 1st August, 1950, to qualify, it would bring them into line with those people who have built under the Local Government Housing Act because they could get a county council grant under the 1950 Housing Act.  If those who build in the Gaeltacht areas were allowed to qualify when they did not get the final grant before 1st August, but had only got the first one, that would be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I would like <Col N="286" /> the Minister to consider.  When the forms are sent out to applicants who are building new houses I think it would be a good idea if the Minister could put on the form a warning about the danger of building houses near Electricity Supply Board high tension wires, for this reason, that rural electrification is spreading very much in the countryside and people are not aware of these regulations.  Actually, I came on a case of a man a short time ago who built a house immediately under a high tension wire.  Neither he nor the contractor knew there was any danger.  He got practically up to the roof; then the house had to be discontinued, and he could not get a grant or even half a grant.  He is now completely at the loss of that house.  If some warning could be put on the form it would be useful for people who may be under the same misapprehension that it is perfectly all right to build under a wire.</P>
    <P>The county council cottages that are passed by the Department are generally of a very good standard, but there is one thing that is very defective, at least in cottages passed for the Kerry County Council, and that is the chimney.  Chimneys were not designed to-day or yesterday.  There are chimneys 100 years old, and you would think it would be possible by this time to know exactly what sort of chimneys draught best.  In the county council of which I am a member we find that we build cottages at great expense to the ratepayers.  The tenants go in, and they admire everything very much, the construction of it, and so on, but they have to leave the windows and doors open because the smoke is so terrible. If the Minister could get experts in his Department to come together and design a chimney that does not fill the cottage with smoke, he would earn the gratitude of many tenants in the country districts.</P>
    <P>There is just one more point I wish to mention.  I would like if the Minister would make it quite plain whether the Local Loans Fund will be made available for all types of housing grants by local authorities, that is whether it would be available for giving grants for new houses as well as <Col N="287" /> reconstruction grants and also for building cottages.  That is a point on which I am not quite sure and I hope that the Minister will allow the Local Loans Fund to be made very readily available because of the difficulty of getting loans elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister wishes to conclude the debate and I will not prolong it beyond the few points I wish to make.  It is agreed on all sides of the House that this Bill is a forward and a progressive measure. The improvement in the grants for the reconstruction of farmhouses in rural Ireland is a step forward.  In the same way the grants for the reroofing of old thatched houses, which is something I advocated in this House, is long overdue. Many people, small farmers, built a room on to the old thatched house and they found that, after a year or two, the old roof had deteriorated to such an extent that the entire family had to move into the new room.  That position is being rectified and it is an advantage.  In the recent census it was pointed out that only a very tiny fraction of the houses in rural Ireland have a piped water supply.  In this Bill an attempt is being made to remedy that situation and to increase the provision of piped water supplies to rural houses.  These things are all advantages which will be appreciated.</P>
      <P>There have been for a considerable time demands that the reconstruction grant should apply to houses over 1,400 square feet.  That concession has also been made and will be appreciated. When concessions of this kind are made there is always someone to ask for a little more.  I have come across a number of people whose valuations slightly exceed £50 and they have been excluded from the reconstruction grant up to the present. Unless the Minister decided to amend this Bill I suppose they will be still excluded.  I think a reasonable case could be made for raising the valuation limit a little higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know, the limit started at £25; it was later raised to £35, then to £50, but I think a case could be made for raising it a little higher.  It may be <Col N="288" /> suggested, of course, that a farm of £50 valuation represents a very substantial income.  In some cases it may but in many cases the income from such a farm may be anything but substantial and the circumstances of the family living on the farm may be just as difficult as those of people under the £50 valuation.  The cost involved in raising the valuation limit a little higher would not be very great.</P>
    <P>There is one other small point; it is small, perhaps, in regard to this Bill and possibly does not come entirely within the scope of the Bill.  But it is a matter which frustrates to a great extent the operation of this measure and the preceding measures as far as the small dwellings (acquisition) grants and loans are concerned.  I refer to the long delay which is involved in securing a proper title to a housing site once it is acquired.  I know in country districts people desiring to build their own houses have acquired a small site, perhaps an acre, half an acre or less off a farm; then the matter goes to the Land Commission and from the Land Commission, I suppose, to the Department of Justice.  There is a very long delay &mdash;in some cases a delay of over a year, sometimes two years, in securing title. and, of course, it is impossible to obtain a loan from the county council until a proper title is secured.  The Minister should make representations to the Departments concerned to have that matter cleared up because it is a hardship for the owners of new houses and, I suppose, also for their legal advisers&mdash;I think I hear one of them applauding&mdash;to find that they are held up in this way for a very long time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a number of speakers to the system of differential rents.  That is a system to which I am very much opposed.  It is a matter which should be considered very carefully.  County councils have tied themselves in knots in connection with this system and I think it would only create problems which would baffle solution in the future if the system were to be applied on a comprehensive scale&mdash;that is to say, if rents were to be graded according to income.  As the income of families in many cases varies from week to week <Col N="289" /> there would be many cases of severe hardship.  If a high rent is fixed on a cottage because the family income is high, by reason of the fact that a number of the family are working, a number of the workers in that family may become disemployed or may go away, and the tenant is then in a very difficult position.  I feel that it is something which ought not to be generally adopted.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the matter of building houses for specific cases comes within the scope of the Bill, but I think that, in a general way, it does. I understand that it is the general policy of the Department to depart from that system, but I want to point out that there are cases in which it is desirable that a house should be built for a specific tenant.  If a young man, a single man, working for a farmer contemplates marriage, and if the farmer is prepared to give him a site on the understanding that he will be the tenant, I think it only right that facilities should be afforded for the building of that house.  There are exceptions in rural Ireland which ought to be considered, and it would be wrong to depart entirely from the principle of building houses specifically for particular applicants who have employment convenient to where the house is to be built or who are working for the farmer who provides the site.  In such cases, the local authority should be empowered to let the applicant have the house.</P>
    <P>We all realise that it is desirable to give housing accommodation to persons most urgently in need of it, but we ought to contemplate, so far as rural Ireland is concerned, the position in which, in a very short time, the housing problem ought to be solved.  There is no reason why it should not be solved in rural Ireland. I know that the problem in the cities and large towns is frightening and appalling.  We have talked here about flats, but while we talk about building flats in the city, we are flattening houses in the country.  That process is going on&mdash;the country is becoming more depopulated, and the cities more and more crowded and spreading out further and further.  It is an appalling problem, and I do not propose to <Col N="290" /> touch on it, but so far as rural Ireland is concerned, there is a problem which we are in sight of solving, and we ought to ensure that, where any farm worker, a single man, applies for a house on a particular farm and, in particular, where the owner is willing to provide the site, there will be no hesitation whatever in letting him have it, and in facilitating an agreement between the applicant and the owner.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter which was touched on by a few speakers and which is also an appalling problem.  I refer to the profiteering which goes on in regard to housing sites in all urban and city areas.  Sooner or later, the State must take action with regard to it.  I do not think it is right or proper that the community should be held to ransom by people who have acquired housing sites in the vicinity of large towns or cities.  They are exploiting a public need and taking advantage of public money which is being made available by the State and the local authorities for the provision of houses. It is a matter which should be looked into with a view to seeing that there is no unjust profiteering.  I should like to follow Deputy Hickey into the realm of housing finance, but I am afraid it is rather late now to enter into such a discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction, but I should like to point out to the Minister some of the difficulties experienced by small farmers in rural areas.  The problem in regard to the development of housing in rural areas is the financial problem.  As the Minister is aware, the grants over the past few years have been fairly reasonable and, in particular, since the introduction of Section 7 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, whereby local authorities were empowered to make a grant to supplement the local government grant.  There has been a certain amount of doubt with regard to the local government grant and, so far, in my county, where a large number of houses are under way in the hope that the grant will be forthcoming, we have had no specific indication as to what the conditions are.  When the Minister is replying, perhaps he will <Col N="291" /> make it clear what the conditions are, because a number of people are labouring under all kinds of misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister appreciate that to-day, when a man who proposes to erect a five-roomed house has the site selected and passed by the housing engineer and goes to the builders supplier, he must be in a position to put down anything from £300 to £400? Many of these small farmers of £3 10s. valuation are not in a position to put that amount of money down.  Time and time again, these small farmers have approached Deputies and members of local authorities asking if it would not be possible for the Government to give the first half of the grant in advance, when the site has been passed, to enable them to put the money down for the securing of the necessary materials.  Many more people would have erected houses but for the fact that they are not financially in a position to do so.  It is impossible to go to the local authority and secure a loan.  You will get nobody to-day to act as guarantor for a small farmer, which immediately eliminates the idea of a loan from the local authority.  You will get nobody to guarantee a small farmer to-day for a loan from the bank, and such men cannot proceed with the erection of houses because they lack the capital.</P>
      <P>That condition of affairs is widespread and the thatched cottages are going to continue unless some finance is provided for these men in advance. So long as an applicant proves he is genuine, that he genuinely intends to erect a house, I cannot see why the Government should not be prepared to advance the first half of the grant to enable them to make the necessary deposit, or why the Government should not deposit that amount at any builders' supplier they indicate so that they may get the material necessary to enable them to go ahead.  That is one of the big obstacles in rural Ireland where they have not got the essential finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another type of person who is extremely poor and even with the full aid of the grant they are not able <Col N="292" /> to supplement that grant out of their own private money for the simple reason that they are living on a very small valuation, 15/- to 20/-.  They cannot be described as labourers and so cannot avail of a cottage under the Labourers Acts.  They are farmers in a sense and as these people are deprived of this aid they have to continue living in a slum, in houses that definitely would come under the condemnation of any medical officer of health.  I have come across a number of these people in my constituency, some of whose members and breadwinners died of tuberculosis.  They were small families, living under desperate housing conditions and unable to find any way out, due to the fact that they were classified under that heading as farmers and deprived of the benefits of a labourer's cottage under the Labourers Acts.  That is another point I wish to make.</P>
    <P>One thing that I am pleased with is the amendment here of the floor area space, which has been inserted and which is very welcome.  I would ask the Minister now if that is going to be retrospective.  I understand it is not, and it is a pity if it is not retrospective over even five or six months.  Quite a number of farmers who have small valuations, farmers who inherited large mansions on estates that were divided up, and where those mansions required reconstruction, find that they are denied the grant due to the floor space of those houses.  They have gone ahead with the reconstruction of those mansions and now have discovered that on account of the floor area they are denied the grant.  They are hoping that under this amendment they will be considered.  I would ask the Minister, if he does not make it retrospective, to see that at least the applicants would receive some consideration. There is quite a number of them in my county and I am sure in every other county as well, where you have these re-settlements and division of estates.</P>
    <P>A further point I wish to make is&mdash; and I hope the Minister will do something about it&mdash;in relation to the speeding up of the examination of houses when they are completed or half-way through the erection stage.  Many of <Col N="293" /> those people who undertake the building of houses find that they do not get the first half of the local government grant until long after the house has been actually completed, and then they may be living in the house for a year or two before they get the second half. The Minister and some of his officials might be surprised to know that in some cases the Department of Local Government has sent on the money to the utility society or the person responsible and they have held that money for two, three or four months in the bank and have denied its existence to the builder or the occupant of the new house, and it is only after considerable questioning that they have forced these people to relinquish the money and admit that they had it from the Department.  That has happened and I am sure some of the officials are well aware of the representations made in a number of cases.  That is really what happened.  It has been in the hands of these people and they have failed to notify the person concerned and have held the money in the bank for two or three months&mdash;for what motive we will leave it to suggest itself. These things show the need for careful scrutiny and examination.</P>
    <P>Another point is that when an applicant fills up an application form for the erection of a house it may be three or four months before the housing engineer comes along to examine the site and gives sanction to the person concerned to go ahead with the building.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased at the increase in the reconstruction grant.  It was essential and long overdue.  I am equally pleased at the amendment in relation to the 15-year period.  There is one point I have difficulty in understanding. The Minister mentions the thatched house.  How about houses that were slated and reconstructed some 15 or 20 years ago, where people now wish to put in windows and doors or perhaps plaster the inside and the outside?  Could they now qualify under this or does it apply only to thatched houses that got a grant for doors, windows, porch and so on?  Are these the only types of applicant going to qualify or will the people who got grants 15 or 20 years ago qualify under this amendment?  I hope they <Col N="294" /> will, as there is quite a number of those who have been turned down. The officials are well aware of that. In fact, they are annoyed with correspondence, I am sure, from Deputies on every side of the House in relation to that particular problem.  We find it very difficult to explain to these applicants why it is they cannot get a grant.  They find it difficult, too, and are highly annoyed and really do not believe us until they see a letter from the Department stating that under section so-and-so they are not entitled to a grant.  Some of them still do not believe even that.  I hope this amending Bill before the House will cover that type of applicant.  The Bill is one which is long overdue, and I am very pleased that it has been introduced.  It is a step in the right direction, and I congratulate the Minister and his staff on its introduction here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters about which I wish to say a few words.  The Housing Bill before the House is one that has been welcomed by all sides.  It is an advance on any housing legislation that has been placed on the Statute Book up to now, and it shows that progress is being made in the improvement of the conditions for people who wish to build houses for themselves.  There has been general dissatisfaction throughout the country in regard to the long delays in the preliminaries, even up to three months, in respect of grants to private persons to build or reconstruct their own houses.  For some particular reason some few years ago, the local authorities were brought for the first time into this matter of the housing grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what advantage it was to have brought them in.  In the local authority with which I have some connection, I know it has added to the delay.  I think they were brought in originally to expedite the preliminaries for grants and to get them out more quickly, but I think it has added to the delay.  My experience is that the local authority has so much on hands that the engineer and the staffs are very little concerned about doing whatever they have to do in getting these applications up to the Department.  I find <Col N="295" /> from experience&mdash;whether it is so in all local authorities or not&mdash;that my own local authority has been responsible in this respect.  There have been times also where there has been delay in waiting for the housing inspector of the Department to come round.  Leinster is particularly unfortunate in that respect, as I think there is only one inspector for three counties.  He may call every month or two months but people are very dissatisfied because of the long delay, especially when it is a good time of the year&mdash;like the present &mdash;for getting the work done.  I hope the Minister will get something done about that and try to shorten the period between the making of the original application and the receipt by the applicant of permission to go ahead with the work.  I hope it will not be necessary to refer to that matter again.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been mentioned, namely, the regulations under the 1948 Act or the 1950 Act.  I hope the Minister will take steps in this Bill, if necessary, to alter those regulations because they did not work out.  All local authorities were opposed to them and were up in arms against them.  Where a farmer gives a plot to his neighbour to have a house built, the local authority considers whether the person is in need of a house or not before they accept the application.  The old specific instance provision should be reinstated in the regulations.  It is not in the regulations at the moment although local authorities are getting over the difficulty by ignoring their own regulations.  That is the only way they have out of it. Families that had been waiting nine or ten years for a house and who had obtained the original plot and who were considered as specific instances found themselves without the house when the regulations were altered.</P>
    <P>On the matter of rural cottages and the sale of rural cottages to the tenants, it is many years&mdash;up to 15&mdash; since the Act was passed making provision for the sale of rural cottages to tenants and no progress has been made, taxing the country as a whole, under that Act.  I am told by the principal officers of local authorities <Col N="296" /> that there is some flaw in the Act and that it requires amendment.  I am sure the Minister and his Department are fully aware of it.  That is one of the main reasons for the hold-up in respect of the vesting of these cottages in the tenants.  I am fully convinced that if there is anything that the Minister and his Department and the local authorities can do to have all the rural cottages vested in the tenants, the quicker they do it the better.  It is all-important to have that work carried out.</P>
    <P>Most local authorities have gone three-parts of the way in the matter of rural housing, and vesting is the next matter that they should undertake. I often wonder why, when rural cottages were built, some plan was not made to vest them in the tenants from the start.  The tenants should have been made owners from the day the cottage was built.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter with a view to devising a scheme whereby the tenants would be made owners from the day they go into the houses and would pay, over a reasonable period&mdash;a long period if you like&mdash; sufficient to reimburse the local authority for the house, taking into account the State grant and the local authority grant.  That is a matter that has been let-up on all over the years. We have allowed a large number of local authority houses to remain on the hands of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is a sound principle that every person should own his home.  We should do everything possible to put that principle into operation.  Tens of thousands of houses are owned by the local authority, which constitutes a serious problem, because the low rents that were originally fixed for many of these houses and the rents at the moment do not go one-third of the way to keep them in repair.  I do not want to put a liability on the tenant but at present, when it is so costly to build houses, the houses should be vested in the tenants and the liability should be put on the tenants to maintain them. The sooner that position is brought about the better.  Such a plan would make for better citizenship.  Many of the tenants are first-class tenants but <Col N="297" /> a good number take no interest whatever in the condition of the house and do not try to maintain it.  They are a minority.  All the houses should be vested in the tenants and a scheme should be devised to make the tenants the owners from the day on which they first occupy a house.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before the House there is some improvement in respect of rural housing, that is, for persons other than workers and persons for whom local authorities are liable to build houses, but it falls short in many respects in the matter of housing the people who live on the land.</P>
    <P>Time and again I have brought to the notice of the Minister that there are large numbers of people who have valid title to their holdings, but whose title is not in order through no fault of theirs and who find themselves unable to get a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act or from the Credit Corporation or from the bank for the purpose of building a house. If they have not the capital, there is no source from which they can get a loan.  The local authority cannot give them a loan because they have not proper, full title.  The Credit Corporation will not give them a loan.  The joint stock banks will not give them a loan unless they have very good security, more security than they could get.  Something should be done to help such people.  I have in mind a number of cases of houses on farms which need to be rebuilt.  The people have not the capital.  Some of them are medium-sized and small farmers. They have not the capital and cannot raise it.  I hope that, in time, something will be done for these people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky referred to small farmers in his constituency whose valuations are from 15/- to £4 and their difficulty in getting money to build houses for themselves.  Such persons can be housed.  There is provision in existing housing legislation to enable the local authority to provide houses for them.  There is no doubt about that.  They are not farmers.  A person whose valuation is 15/- or even £4 could not be considered a farmer in the ordinary sense.  They must be earning a big portion of their livelihood by <Col N="298" /> some means other than farming because a man could not get a living out of the amount of land, the valuation of which would be £4.  The local authority has full power under the existing Housing Acts to house all those people, and they should not be disqualified from having a house built for them because they have a small bit of land.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Mrs. Crowley refer to the matter of smoking chimneys, because that is a problem all over the country.  I hope the Minister will take up that matter with the local authority engineers and county managers.  In this enlightened age of engineering it is a sad commentary that we have not been able in respect of every new house that is built to design a chimney that will draw smoke up.  In some of these houses smoke goes any where but up the chimney, and complaints are general.  It is not beyond the art of man to design efficient chimneys.  Many tradesmen are noted for their ability to build houses in which the chimneys will not smoke while others fail to provide satisfactory chimneys, I think, as Deputy Mrs. Crowley suggested, a standard nonsmoking chimney should be devised and insisted upon by the Department and the Minister, in respect to all houses built either by local authorities or with the aid of State grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone expected that the housing grants would be continued, and it is only quite natural that they should be continued under this Bill. We certainly did not expect that they would be discontinued.  We are glad to see that the amount of the reconstruction grants has also been increased from £80 to £100 and £140.  These increases were badly needed, having regard to the big increase in the cost of reconstruction in the past two years. The provision under which a farmer can get a second reconstruction grant after ten years instead of after 15 years as heretofore, is also to be welcomed, but these are the only two features in the Bill which represent any advance on the existing legislation.  So far as the grants for providing water supplies for farm houses are concerned, these grants were already available under <Col N="299" /> the Department of Agriculture for rural areas.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that the effect of this Bill will be to close down on housing in regard to schemes administered by county and city authorities.  I speak with some knowledge of the matter, because I am a member of both the city and county local authority in my area.  In the county we always gave housing grants to every farmer who wanted to erect a house, irrespective of his valuation.  Some people thought that we should have scaled the grants according to the valuations, say from £50 down to a £10 valuation, but we felt that, in many cases, a farmer with an £80 valuation who had a large family might be in much more difficult circumstances and much better entitled to a housing grant than a farmer with a £30 valuation.  As I say, the scaling down of grants will mean a complete close down on housing in many areas. One can hardly credit a statement that a person in the country will be entitled to the full 100 per cent. grant from a housing authority only if his rateable valuation does not exceed £12 10s. That means that many farmers whose holding would be only about five acres would not be entitled to the full grant. Personally I think the intention behind the Bill is to stop the provision of housing in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past six or seven months people had been looking forward to this Bill in the hope that they would get increased facilities.  These people are dismayed now that the terms of the Act have become known.  A farmer whose rateable valuation exceeds £12 10s., but does not exceed £20, will get only two-thirds of the grant; if his valuation exceeds £20 but does not exceed £27 10s., he will get 50 per cent.  of the grant; if it exceeds £27 10s.  but does not exceed £35, he will get one-third of the grant, while if his valuation exceeds £35 he is cut off altogether. When we come to consider grants made by a housing authority in the cities, the position is even worse.  A man can qualify for 100 per cent. grant only if the family income does not exceed £4 per week.  Can anyone imagine a man with £4 a week at the present time attempting to build a house for himself? <Col N="300" /> Is it not ridiculous to mention such a condition in connection with these grants?  Then, if the family income exceeds £8 a week, the man is cut out altogether from these grants. In the case of the Kilkenny Corporation, a small authority where 1d. in the £ in the rates brings in only £110, we gave a full grant to a person whose income was about £420.  We then scaled the grants down, so that a person whose income was £750 was entitled to a grant of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Imagine a white-collar worker in receipt of £8 a week being completely cut out from these grants.  That is the reason I say that this Bill has in my opinion been brought in to stop housing altogether.  If the Minister does not want to close down on housing in the country, I would seriously ask him to reconsider the terms of the Bill.  Perhaps it is only now he realises, having looked at the Bill, that the only person entitled to a full grant from a housing authority is a person in receipt of an income not exceeding £4 a week and I do not know whether stamps would be included in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Crowley was anxious that the Minister should allow local authorities to borrow from the Local Loans Fund for housing.  I think it is a shocking thing that local authorities have to go to moneylenders, insurance companies and banks to raise money to finance housing grants.  There would be some reason for cutting away local authorities from recourse to the Local Loans Fund if these local authorities had not been paying their way, but the local authorities have paid their way and I do not see why the Minister should cut them off from recourse to the Local Loans Fund.  As I say, in present circumstances they have to approach moneylenders, insurance companies and banks who have to consult their head offices in London before they can advance the money.  Now that the grants have been reduced so seriously, I think the Minister should allow local authorities to obtain loans from the Local Loans Fund.  My own opinion is that not many of these loans will be required because housing will be completely shut down in many cases as a result of the cutting of grants.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Mrs. Crowley's <Col N="301" /> complaint about smoking chimneys, I may say that we have built about 800 houses in Kilkenny and we received only one serious complaint.  That was in the case of the last building scheme where a person had to leave the new house provided for him until a proper chimney was provided.  One of the members of the council, presumably in explanation of the bad chimney, said that the house was built on a fairy pass.  Whether that was right or not I do not know, but that was the only complaint we received.  I would again ask the Minister to reconsider the grants.  I think it is most ridiculous to expect that a man who has only £4 a week could build a house without the fullest assistance from the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the last speaker when he states that this Bill is likely to prove detrimental to the progress of housing in the country.  It all depends on how one paints the picture.  In my county, County Kerry, the chairman of the housing committee is a prominent member of Clann na Poblachta, and he <Col N="302" /> recently paid a tribute to the Minister in regard to this Housing Bill.  He said it was the best piece of legislation, so far as housing was concerned, introduced in recent years.  That is in direct opposition to Deputy Crotty's description of this measure.  There are a few points in connection with the Bill to which, as a member of a local authority, I should like to refer.  We have had some controversy with the Department in regard to certain matters, and we are very keen on having the difficulties which arose rectified.  In connection with the Gaeltacht housing grants, I am glad to see that the Bill allows a local authority to allocate a grant in addition to the Department grant; but I should like to make the point that the grant should be made retrospective to August, 1950.</P>
