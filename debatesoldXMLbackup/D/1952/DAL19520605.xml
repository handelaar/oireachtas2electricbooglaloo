      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the cause of the delay in issuing payments to the Sligo Harbour Board in respect of repairs carried out to the harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant of £47,000 or 70 per cent. of the total cost, whichever shall be the greater, is being made from State funds towards the works at Sligo Harbour.  An agreement entered into with the Sligo Harbour Commissioners provides that the balance of the cost of the works <Col N="600" /> shall be paid by the harbour authority in such manner as the Minister for Industry and Commerce may direct.</P>
      <P>The Sligo County Council have undertaken to lend to the harbour authority the amount required to meet the local contribution.  Payments amounting to £25,532 have already been made from the State grant, and amounts totalling £9,527 from the local contribution.  There has been no delay in meeting the payments due under the State grant.  There has been some delay in meeting the local contribution, due, I understand, to the need to comply with the requirements of borrowing from the Local Loans Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must be completely misinformed in this matter.  Every payment was made on the due date and, from the reports I have seen in the local Press of discussions of the harbour authority, there has been no suggestion of delay on the part of the Department.</P>

      <P>I am aware that two American priests stayed in the airport passenger hostel from 26th to 29th May.  There are no official regulations prescribing that visiting priests must obtain the airport manager's permission before celebrating Mass at the airport.  As is customary, the matter is regulated by the local parish priest, at whose request arrangements have been made whereby visiting priests desiring to celebrate Mass at the airport furnish certain particulars to the airport manager's staff as to their Order, parish, diocese, bishop, etc. The necessary facilities are then made available to them.</P>

      <P>There is no specific provision in the Marshall Aid Loan Agreements to cover the eventuality of another devaluation of the Irish pound the effect of which would, of course, be to increase the interest and repayment charges in Irish currency in respect of the dollar borrowings.  The only relieving section in the agreements reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If at any time or from time to time the parties hereto determine that it would be in their common interests because of adverse economic conditions or for any other reasons to pospone, or provide for the postponement of, any instalments of interest or principal, or to alter or provide for the alteration of any provisions of the aforesaid promissory note relating to payment of interest and principal, or to modify the aforesaid promissory note in any other respect, they may by mutual agreement in writing provide for any such postponement or alteration or other modification.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra liability on foot of the American loan as a result of the devaluation of September, 1949, is £5,085,058.</P>
      <P>The interest payments on the American loan will total $72.46 million. Converted at the current rate of exchange with the United States dollar ($2.80 to the £), this amounts to £25.88 million.  If the pre-devaluation rate of exchange, namely, $4.02 to the £, were still operative, the total interest charge would be £18.03 million. The extra interest payable as a result of devaluation is, therefore, £7.85 million.</P>
      <P>The rate of 2½ per cent. per annum at which interest is payable in dollars on the dollar total of the loan is equivalent to a rate of £2.16, 3 per cent. on the proceeds of the loan, namely, £40.7 million.  The explanation for the higher rate of interest as applied to the proceeds of the loan is that the interest charge of 2½ per cent. attaches to the liability for principal which at the current rate of exchange is £45.8 million.</P>

Schemes for the development of privately-owned bogs are also submitted by the parties directly concerned. These schemes are not primarily intended for the relief of unemployment.  The moneys available in the Employment Schemes Vote are intended to provide a spell of work during the winter months for men in receipt of unemployment assistance. Appropriate provision will be made for County Laoighis in due course.

The figures have decreased by 50 per cent. in that period.  So far as bog development schemes are concerned, as pointed out in the question these schemes are not primarily intended for the relief of unemployment. Minor relief schemes are provided for that purpose to cover the period from November to March.  Laoighis will get a fair proportion of the money when the programme is being made out, and I think it will be a greater proportion than they got last year or the year before.</P>

I should like to remind the Deputy, even though he was not in public life in 1948, that it was in December, 1948, the decision was taken to close the school.

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the circumstances have altered during the past few years?  There are now on the island nine children of school-going age, between six and 14 years of age. I cannot see how he has reduced that figure to five.  I am aware of the number of children on this island. There are 14 in all and nine of these are of school-going age.  The Minister has these figures in his office.  I will go further and say that it is as a result of some political influence being used by representatives of the Minister's own Party that this assurance given to me has not been honoured.  Possibly it could be traced back to the local Fianna Fáil cumann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Representations have, however, been made by other interested parties, to whom the matter was fully explained. The position is that there are at present only two children of school-going age on the island, and I regret that it is not permissible under the regulations to make a grant-in-aid of a boat service to convey such a small number of children to school.</P>
    <P>Where a grant-aided boat service cannot be established it is open to my Department to make a small grant towards the cost of maintenance of island pupils living away from home in order to attend school, but as these children live at home and attend Hare Island school the question of a maintenance grant in their case does not arise.</P>

He has endeavoured to get the children accommodated on Hare Island, but that is an impossibility. He is a very poor man, and it is very difficult for him to take them to school in the morning and go back for them in the afternoon.

As I stated in the House on the 15th November last in reply to a question by Deputy Roddy on this subject, it is not my intention to proceed with the parish plan as envisaged by the previous Administration.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the <Col N="626" /> Revenue Commissioners advised the Minister on the basis of the proposed alterations in the allowances before giving him the estimated revenue on the basis of income-tax at 7/6 in the £.  I would be glad to know if the Minister would indicate to the House the estimate the Revenue Commissioners gave on the basis of the increase in income-tax for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get that for the Deputy.  I would have assumed that we could discuss this matter more relevantly on the various sections which follow.  The net yield from all the impositions in this year will be £910,000. The income-tax code is being amended not merely by Section 1 but by Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill. The position in respect to these taxes is this, that in a full year if it were not for the very significant modifications which we are proposing in the general code, a simple increase in the standard rate would represent an additional revenue of £2,800,000.  However, the reliefs provided for in this Bill substantially change the incidence of the tax and accordingly the position in a full year should be, after allowing for these reliefs, that 6,000 companies will pay £900,000 extra; 7,000 surtax payers will pay £650,000 extra; 11,000 individuals whose income, if earned, is above £900 per annum and below £1,500, will pay £100,000 extra; 170,500 individuals will get a net relief of £867,000, leaving retained in the Exchequer £783,000 in a full year.  So the Deputy will realise that, despite the increase in the standard rate, we are granting very substantial income-tax reliefs to the general body of income-tax payers.  In this connection, perhaps I might say a word or two upon some points which were made, particularly by Deputy Corish, and others in the course of the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked why I did not tax companies, why I did not increase the corporation profits tax, and why I did not impose the excess corporation profits tax.  I quoted two leading authorities on the subject&mdash;a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer and a former junior Minister in the <Col N="627" /> Labour Government.  Both of these pointed out that the excess corporation profits tax was, in effect, a tax upon marginal earnings and, therefore, a disincentive to increase production.  Not only that, they also maintained that it was a tax which laid itself open to fraudulent evasion and that, if we really wanted to tax company profits, the right sort of tax to impose for the purpose of getting after profits while at the same time avoiding the disincentive effect of the excess profits tax and not opening further avenues of evasion was income-tax, income-tax is the tax to be relied upon.  The figures which I have given to the House to-day, in response to Deputy Cosgrave's query, amply substantiate that.  I think, perhaps, I had better quote them again.  Of the gross amount of tax which we hope to collect this year, no less than £900,000 will come from 6,000 companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that this is just a normal paragraph in this Bill.  However, the imposition of 1/- in the income-tax is not only by no means normal, but, coming in a year such as this when the industrial and commercial life of the country are suffering owing to the increase in the bank rate with the resultant unemployment and dislocation of business that would generally follow therefrom, particularly in this country, it is an outrage.  To lift that unmitigated burden of £2,800,000 a little bit off the ordinary person whose income is less than £900 per annum and to throw it over, to the extent of £900,000, on 6,000 companies and on 7,000 other people, to the extent of £650,000, is just planting that burden on people whose business will be, to some extent, a little bit dislocated as a result of it, but who are in the favourable position of being able to pass this additional burden on to those to pay for the services and for the cost of providing for these companies. I submit to the Minister, while he throws aside the idea of the Labour Party, that taxes should have been put on companies in other ways, that the taking of £900,000 from 6,000 companies, in this particular way is just as hard a blow to them and will create the same difficulties for them as if this <Col N="629" /> money was taken from them in the guise of tax with another name.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the imposition of this additional income-tax at the present time.  I feel that the manner in which the Minister has distributed it, instead of helping the economic situation generally if the money were required, will bring the blow to bear at a focal point in the organisation of our employment and our industry in a manner that will dislocate the machinery that employs people and gives them their living.  In my view, what the Minister has done in this case is not a mitigation of the blow, but it is an attempt at hiding the fact that the blow has fallen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest also against the increase in income-tax provided for in this section.  This is one of the taxes imposed by the Budget to which statutory effect will be given by the Finance Bill when this Bill becomes law.  In my own view, it is wholly unnecessary. The Minister for Finance, when he was introducing his Budget statement on the 2nd April this year, having reviewed the financial position of the country, the requirements of the revenue in the coming year and all the necessary moneys that were to be put into it to meet the required expenditure is reported at column 1144, Volume 130, No. 8 of the Official Reports as saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But a further sum of £800,000 or so must be found if the estimated current outlay is to be fully covered and for this I must look to the inland revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a Budget of the size which he introduced, a sum of £800,000 is a comparatively small item.  Having gone through a variety of taxes, and having indicated that he intended to take away the food subsidies and to impose taxes upon other commodities, what might be regarded, in some senses at all events, as essential commodities, he then proceeded towards the income-tax payer to recover the comparatively small sum of £800,000.  I assert that that sum could have been easily found by other means without putting an additional penny on the income-tax. <Col N="630" /> That sum is a small amount.  As a justification for the imposition on income-tax, it used to be said that it was the fairest tax.  Modern conditions have belied that which some years ago was taken to be a truism.</P>
    <P>The Minister tries to justify the imposition of this increased tax by pointing to the increased reliefs which he proposes to give.  The whole proposal is reeking with an air of political expediency.  The only reason why income-tax was increased was that the Minister was taking away the food subsidies and proposed to tax beer, spirits, tobacco, petrol and other commodities and, according to his lights, it would not lie with him to say that he left the income-tax payer untaxed in that set of circumstances.  That is the only reason why the increased income-tax is imposed this year. There was no necessity for it.  The sum of £800,000 could be easily got by some savings on various sub-heads, by the overestimation which inevitably occurs in various Departments, and by savings that could be effected during the course of the year.  But, of course, it would have been politically unsound tactics for the Minister to leave the income-tax payer untaxed at a time when he was increasing the tax on essential commodities, directly and indirectly.  That is the only reason for the increase in income-tax this year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the rate of income-tax when it passes beyond a certain point becomes a burdensome imposition on the people.  Income-tax at the present time is not what it used to be some years ago, a tax upon the rich.  There are very few people now, whether they work with their brains or with their hands, in business or at a profession, who escape or who ought to escape liability for income-tax.  The worker now has to pay it upon his earnings and practically every section of the community has to pay it directly or indirectly.  The imposition of too great a burden undoubtedly leads to a slowing up in initiative, in enterprise and inevitably leads to increased tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I have said that income-tax used to be regarded as the fairest tax.  Because <Col N="631" /> of the widespread net which is flung at the present moment and because there are many loopholes in that net and because of its heavy imposition, there are large numbers of people in this country evading their liability, thereby increasing the burden on those people who by reason of their circumstances or their conscience have to pay an additional imposition.</P>
    <P>Increasing income-tax beyond a certain point undoubtedly leads to increased evasion&mdash;that is a matter that could be remedied; it is a matter that could be dealt with by increased staff in the Revenue Department, by a greater spurt of energy, on the part of those whose duty it is to assess and collect income-tax&mdash;but a greater evil perhaps than that is the fact that burdensome income-tax such as is proposed to be imposed by this section leads to the slowing down of private enterprise, thereby causes unemployment, leads also to the eating into their capital by people who are unable to meet their liabilities because of the burdensome effect of increased income-tax. It leads above all things to the fact that what we require most in this country at the present moment, savings by the people, becomes almost impossible.</P>
    <P>The Minister, towards the end of his Budget speech, paid lip-service to the desirability of the Irish people having increased savings.  With taxation of this kind, with an income-tax of the height of this proposed imposition, savings become almost impossible.  Not only do savings become impossible but there is an inevitable frittering away of capital which ought to be employed in productive enterprises.</P>
    <P>If there is any economic urgency at the present moment it is the desirability of increasing the savings of our people.  We want the savings of our people for the purpose of carrying on those capital schemes which are necessary for the development of our underdeveloped resources.  The only real way, according to the Minister himself, to finance those capital projects is through the savings of the people. With burdensome taxation of this kind, those savings become impossible.  With <Col N="632" /> the general attitude of the Minister and of his Department towards saving, there is no incentive to our people at the present moment to put aside their earnings in the form of savings or to give them to the State for investment in projects which will increase the productivity of the land and of our industries.  These are some of the outstanding vicious characteristics of this particular type of taxation.</P>
    <P>It is no use for the Minister to say that he, by raising the tax, is giving reliefs to certain people.  The proper tax policy is two-fold, in my submission to Deputies.  In the first place, the economic policy of the Government must be directed towards increasing the national income so that, from the same or lower rates of tax, increased yield of revenue can be got and, secondly, out of that increased yield of revenue the necessary reliefs that are purported to be given by this Bill can be given without increased taxation.</P>
    <P>It is little use for some people to get increased allowances if, at the same time, they are offset or nearly offset by increased taxation.  The policy is to increase the national income so as to increase revenue by the imposition of the same or less rate of taxation and, out of that increased revenue, to give the necessary reliefs so urgently required and which will enable some free money to be available in the economy for savings, which the people will give to a Government that has a proper economic policy for investment in productive capital enterprises for the development of our undeveloped resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this excellent example of facing both ways. Listening to the speech, first of all, of Deputy Mulcahy, one would have thought that I had not been at pains to explain to him in the simplest terms possible&mdash;terms which I hoped he would understand&mdash;that there was no use conducting this debate on the basis of the stark yield&mdash;to put it that way &mdash;which would be derived from an increase in the standard rate of tax.  As I pointed out, the effect of such an increase will be considerably mitigated by the reliefs which it is proposed to extend to the taxpayer under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill&mdash;and one must take into consideration those reliefs because they cover the whole general body of individual taxpayers, the surtax payer as well as the individual taxpayer in the lower ranges of income&mdash;and the net effect of the increased allowances which we are proposing will be, even in the category where increased tax will be paid, to reduce the yield from the bare standard increase in the standard rate &mdash;to put it that way again&mdash;from £2,800,000 to £1,650,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yield is further very greatly reduced by the exceptionally large number of individual taxpayers who will benefit from two of the reliefs, and in some cases from all three reliefs, conceded by Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  The point is that the general purpose of this scheme is to provide relief for over 170,000 taxpayers.  Of course, in order to do that, we have to compensate the Exchequer by securing the money for these reliefs in some other way.  I pointed out what we intended to do.  Six thousand companies will pay in gross £900,000 extra&mdash;that is at the average rate of £150 per company per annum.  I do not think that that can be regarded as an undue burden on industry, having regard to everything we have been told by Labour Deputies and by Deputies of some <Col N="634" /> other Parties including, I think, our friend, the former Minister for Finance, about the excessive profits which these companies were making.  If the companies are making these substantial profits, they can at least pay an average increased tax of £150.</P>
    <P>Then we have 7,000 surtax payers and they will contribute £650,000.  That will work out on the average about £95 extra per annum.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that I regard that as a light imposition on the average surtax payer.  I do not.  Quite frankly it is a substantial increase in his burden.  As against that, I have to consider the situation of the general taxpayer.  I have been concerned to relieve the wage earner, the salaried worker and the middle class generally from some of the burdens they have been carrying under our predecessors. I think I have done it with some success and I am sure with full regard to the canons of social justice.  Let us see what we have done.  I shall give one or two examples, taking them almost at random.</P>
    <P>Take the unmarried person whose earnings run from about £300 to £500 a year.  Naturally, of course, if he is at the bottom of that particular scale, the total amount which he will pay will not be very substantial.  Under our predecessors he was paying £16 5s. but under this Government, which is supposed, according to certain Deputies in the Labour Party, not to be concerned with the interests of the wage earner, he will pay substantially less. He will pay almost 25 per cent. less&mdash; £12 15s.  That is to say there will be a net gain to him arising out of the change in the income-tax code of £3 10s.  If he is a man who earns about £8 per week, which would give him in round figures about £425 a year, under Deputy Costello's Administration he would have paid £48 15s. and under the present Taoiseach's Administration he will pay £38 12s. 6d.  That is a net gain to him of £10 2s. 6d.  If he earns £450 a year, even as a single man he will now pay only £44 5s. as against £55 5s. which he would have paid under the last Government&mdash;a reduction of £11 or a gain to him of about 20 per cent.  That class comprises generally the industrial wage earner, the <Col N="635" /> shop assistant, the clerical worker, the junior civil servant and Gardaí.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the married person with an income of £650 a year who has no children.  Under the Coalition, that taxpayer would have been paying on an earned income of £650, £61 15s., and under the new scheme he will pay £47 16s. 3d., a net gain to him of £13 18s. 9d.  He gets a relief of almost £7 per head for himself and his wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not meet the increased price of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It will do a great deal more.  The increased expenditure imposed on a person by the reduction in the food subsidies has been closely calculated and works out at an average of 1/6 per head per week&mdash;less than £4 a year.  As against that this married person will save £13 18s. 9d. on his income-tax.  It will compensate not merely himself and his wife for the increased price of foodstuffs but will leave a substantial sum over.  Again, taking the married couple with one child, if the husband's total income is £750 a year, provided always that his income is earned, his tax under the Coalition would have been £61 15s., whilst under the present administration it will be £45 18s. 9d., leaving him a net gain of £15 16s. 3d., or almost £16 a year.  There is no use, therefore, in getting up and saying that we are imposing undue burdens on the taxpayer. What we are, in fact, doing is relieving very substantially 95 per cent. of the individual wage earners in this country.  I want to emphasise wage earners&mdash;taxpayers under Schedule E. Apart altogether from taxpayers under Schedule E, over 90 per cent. of individual taxpayers in general will benefit from the proposals embodied in Part I of the Finance Bill.  It is all very well for Deputy Costello to get up and talk about the burdens we are imposing on industry but let us not forget that, when Deputy Costello talks in this way, what he is objecting to really is the reliefs we are giving to the taxpayer.  That is the point.  He is objecting to the fact that in our proposals the companies which he used to talk about as making inflated <Col N="636" /> profits, the surtax payers, the wealthy classes we hear about from the Labour Party, are being taxed in order to relieve the burden of over 95 per cent. of the taxpayers on the Schedule, 95 per cent. of the wage earners.  Deputy O'Sullivan does not like the truth but that is the truth.  Fine Gael Deputies do not like the truth; it does not appeal to them.  They are only pre pared to get up and go through the masquerade that Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Costello performed a few minutes ago in protesting against this scheme which is going to give substantial reliefs, as I said&mdash;I repeat it so that Deputy O'Sullivan will come to recognise the force of it&mdash;to the general body of individual income-tax payers, particularly the wage-earning and salaried classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two remarks I want to make on the Minister's alleged answer to the points I made.  The Minister accused me of facing both ways.  I accuse him of either facing no way or facing backwards. He did not answer any of the points I made.  I should like to underline the point I made at the outset, that this increased income-tax is purely a matter of political expediency. He did not answer the criticism I made that a sum of £800,000 <Col N="637" /> only was required, according to himself, to balance the Budget when he put on this increase of 1/- in the £. It was entirely unnecessary and that amount could be got otherwise.  He did not answer the point I made that if we are to give these reliefs which he says he is giving and which I say are entirely illusory, the way to give them is not by additional taxation but by an increase of national income.  He can give these reliefs without increasing income-tax.  That was our policy and we did it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says&mdash;of course it is purely politics&mdash;that the purpose behind this section is to provide relief for 170,000 income-tax payers.  I wonder how many of these income-tax payers will believe a single word of that&mdash;that the purpose of increasing the income-tax to 7/6 in the £ is to give relief to income-tax payers.  Does anybody believe that any of these reliefs will go the entire way, or even a considerable part of the way, to ease the burden imposed by the increased prices of foodstuffs and other essential commodities?  Beer is an essential commodity to the working man and tobacco is very nearly an essential commodity.  The Minister did not take these matters into account.  They were left out of his calculations, just as they were left out by his predecessor in the Government which preceded my Administration when making up the cost of living index figure.  It did not suit them to have beer, tobacco and cigarettes included in the index figure, as the cost of living would be shown to have increased from time to time rather catastrophically.  In his calculations to show the reliefs he was giving no account was taken of these increases and the increases in absolutely essential foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also did not take into account that the inevitable result of the proposals in the Budget and in this Bill taking away the food subsidies will be to cause a widespread demand for increased wages and, if there is that widespread demand, there will be further income-tax on these increased wages.  Did the Minister take that into his calculations?  Of course he did not.  These reliefs are purely illusory.  He speaks about the wealthy <Col N="638" /> corporations and companies and the surtax payers.  These are the people who are very well able to sustain a certain amount of income-tax over and above what ordinary people are, because they are able to pass it on, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, to the consumer. The wages earners will demand increased wages to try to compensate themselves for the increased cost of living, and on their increased wages there will be a further increase in income-tax, which will to a considerable extent neutralise the allowances purported to be given in the Budget. The wealthy corporations and the surtax payers can pass this on to the consumer, and will pass it on in the form of increased prices, and those increased prices will have an impact on those people who, the Minister would have us believe, are getting these allowances.</P>
    <P>Our policy was the proper policy, namely, to increase the national income and get additional revenue by means of the same or less taxation and give reliefs without increased taxation. That was our economic policy and we succeeded in it.  We reduced income-tax several times while we were the Government, and last year Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, increased the allowances and reduced the tax.  That was our progressive policy.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill indicates a deflationary policy which will hit everybody in the community, rich and poor. The Minister did not take into account when making the political case he made this afternoon, that this increased taxation was for the purpose of increasing the allowances to wage earners, that the effect of the Budget and of this Bill and the increase in the income-tax will be to increase unemployment. The unemployed man is not in the least bit particular whether the income-tax is 7/6 or 1/- in the £ as he has no income to pay income-tax.  That fact was not taken into account by the Minister when he said that the income-tax was increased for the purpose of giving benefits to wage earners.  The impact of this tax on those people who employ wage earners and the general policy in this Bill will cause unemployment. I think the object of the policy behind the whole scheme of the Budget and of this Bill is to cause unemployment. <Col N="639" /> Where there is more unemployment, there is less taxation to be paid by the unemployed.  No amount of arguing about allowances to wage earners is any solace or comfort to the man who is unemployed as a result of the policy enshrined in a section of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister was in Carlow the other night and over a cup of strong tea he was telling us to read the military correspondent of the London <i>Times</i> in order to make ourselves alert to the things we ought to be doing in this country.  We are to pay great attention to what is happening outside this country from a military point of view.  He was reading the tea-cups.  I wonder are we to pay any attention to what is happening outside this country from the economic point of view?  The fact is that the Minister, while appearing to follow an almost ready-made budgetary formula taken from Great Britain, is applying it to this country in a way in which the results will be entirely different. The British Government have applied a budgetary policy to their country which is intended to shut down and to drive employment from certain normal classes of industries into industries that they require for their armament proposals and industries in which they require to develop an export trade.  We have been hit by the bank rate side of that policy here with the result that our normal industry is being disturbed, employment is being reduced and short time is developing. As a result of the impact of the bank rate on this country we are in danger of accentuating the type of thing that is happening in other countries.</P>

    <P>When dealing with the Budget I drew the Minister's attention to an article in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> by Bertrand de Juvenal.  He pointed out in that article that there was a strong tendency towards a slump in the world and that even the arguments that were being advanced against the probability of a slump were so concentrated as almost to point to the inevitability of it.  Summing up the situation in a way that we can readily <Col N="640" /> understand, he suggested that what was happening was that unemployment was developing, short time was developing and a slump was coming. while the remedies of the budgetary policies of the Governments concerned were such as would hasten and accentuate that slump.  He argued that what was necessary was an easing off of taxation.  He indicated that what would inevitably happen under the budgetary policies employed by various countries at the present time would be that when the impact of the real slump came the Governments of these countries would start out on their own initiative and create all kinds of public works to try to keep employment going.  The result would be that Governments would dig deeper and deeper into the people's resources. strengthen the power of the State and officialdom over the people and eventually enter into a worse situation than that into which they might necessarily go if they took the proper remedial measures.  The Minister is imposing an additional 1/- income-tax here.  He tells us that he is easing the burden on the income-tax payers generally.  It will not help an income-tax payer to have his burden eased if as a result of the impact of the additional tax on the employing machinery his employment is rendered insecure and he is put either on short time or driven into unemployment, driven into unemployment perhaps in economic circumstances which, once his employment is terminated, will not make it easy for him to climb back again.</P>

      <P>I should point out, because I think it is important that we should realise what is being done in regard to these sections, that this section in the Bill will increase the limit in relation to a dependent relative. At the present moment where a taxpayer maintains at his own expense a relative of his or of his wife, who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity, or who maintains his wife's widowed mother, whether incapacitated or not, may claim a deduction of £50 for income-tax purposes in respect of each person whom he so maintains. However, there is a condition attached to that.  The deduction can only be granted in a case in which the total income of the maintained dependent relative does not exceed £50 per year from all sources. In this section we are proposing to raise this annual income limit from £50 to £80 per year, which will be a substantial advantage to many taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Again, this section represents a very substantial concession to a considerable number of income-tax payers.  Under the existing law, as the House is no doubt aware, the first £100 of taxable income&mdash;that is, the taxpayer's statutory income after effect has been given to the various deductions and allowances&mdash;is chargeable at one-half of the standard rate of income-tax and the balance is chargeable at the full standard rate.  This allowance is generally referred to as the reduced rate relief.  For the present year and, I assume, henceforward, under Section 4, which is now before the House, the first £100 of taxable income will be charged at two-fifths of the standard, that is, 3/- in the £ instead of 3/9 as at present, and the next £100 will be <Col N="643" /> charged at 6/- in the £ instead of 7/6.

      <P>Section 5 repeals an exceptional concession which was granted in the Finance Act in 1941.  It repeals Section 2 of that Act.  As the Deputy is aware, under the double income-tax agreement between this country and Great Britain, usually spoken of as the residence agreement, a person who is a single resident in this country and not in Great Britain is exempt from British income-tax. As regards the double resident I do not think I need tell the Deputy what the term means.  He is assessed to tax by both countries and both countries afford their share of the double tax relief.  It was found, due to circumstances which existed in 1941, that some taxpayers who would normally be double residents were unable to comply with the conditions attaching to the relief.  Section 2 was introduced in the Finance Act of 1941 to cover that particular circumstance.  We do not feel that it is any longer necessary to make provision for that circumstance and, accordingly, I am proposing to repeal the section.</P>

      <P>Everyone knows that these petrol tractors use anything from ten to 16 gallons a day.  Therefore, this extra tax is going to add to the costs of agricultural production.  It will certainly bear very heavily on the very large number of farmers who are now using agricultural tractors.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he gave any consideration to the possibility of exempting agricultural tractors from this increased taxation.  It was done by his predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, as a result of representations made to him by the users of these petrol tractors.  Having regard to the high consumption of petrol, even in their normal use, by these tractors, this increased tax will probably mean an added burden of from £1 to 30/- a week. That will mean anything from £70 to £80 a year.  Consequently, I am anxious that the Minister should give the same consideration to the question of exempting agricultural tractors from this tax as was given formerly.</P>

Taking it that it works on six days a week, that is 60 gallons. With an increased tax of 4d. a gallon, that will amount to about £1 a week. I think the Minister must agree that that is going to impose a considerable hardship in tillage centres in Ireland. My own constituency in Wexford is an example.  Quite a considerable number of Ferguson tractors are used in my constituency, and I should say that from 25 to 30 per cent. of them are entirely petrol-driven.  I think the Minister ought to consider this.  I do not think that this concession has been abused as he says.</P>

      <P>In my constituency the majority of the tractors which are engaged on agricultural work are owned by contractors.  They hire out the tractors which do the work for neighbouring farmers.  An enormous amount of work is done by tractors hired out in that way.  It is a great advantage to farmers that these tractors are available to them.  It means that they can do with one horse and so can carry more stock on their land.  As a matter of fact, during the busy time these tractors are working day and night.  I have seen them working all over my constituency, and I must say that I have never seen anything occur which would force me to the conclusion which the Minister has drawn that there has been a gross abuse of this privilege.  In fact, the result has been, I think, quite the opposite.  The use of these tractors has encouraged increased agricultural production as well as a reduction in agricultural costs.  I deplore the accusation that farmers are guilty of this abuse.  If this is so, it should have been brought to light before now and some evidence shown that such abuse existed.  I am living in an agricultural area where these conditions exist, and I can vouch for the farmers in my own <Col N="647" /> constituency.  No such abuse exists there.</P>

      <P>This tax throws up a very important point for discussion. Within the last few years combine harvesters are being used extensively in this country.  Most of those machines are using petrol and this tax will impose a great hardship on the users of those machines.  An exemption has been given from any tax imposed recently to the users of tractors.  That also applied to combine harvesters.  The consumption of fuel in these machines is very large; they use up to 25 gallons a day, and if this tax is to be imposed it will mean a big increase in the cost of the running of those machines.  I feel it would be very unjust if there is no exemption for these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But unless one is utterly regardless of one's responsibility as Minister for Finance, one does not make a promise to the dance-hall proprietors to take £100,000 off them and sock it on to the bus fares of the citizens of Dublin without inquiring as to what the impact on the bus fares will be.  We had fortuitously the letter from the dance-hall proprietors on foot of which the Minister is taking off £100,000 from their back, but surely the chances that brought that letter into our hands setting out that one dance-hall proprietor had subscribed £250 to the Fianna Fáil Party funds and that they expected others to do better so that the full weight of their opinion might be felt, should not be depended upon to inform us as to what the repercussions of the transfer of that tax from the dance-hall proprietors to the fuel oil to be used in the buses for the Dublin and rural transport services are going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it an extravagant demand that the House, having heard the Minister for nearly three-quarters of an hour, distinguishing between dancers and all-in wrestlers for the purpose of justifying the removal of the £100,000 from dance halls, should ask how fare-paying passengers on the buses can <Col N="653" /> equitably be expected to take up the burden which the dance-hall proprietors so willingly laid down?  Is it more necessary for the disciples of terpsichore to dance than it is for working people to travel on the buses? Does the Government commend as an equitable arrangement that bus fares should be raised in order that dancers may dance tax free?  That would be a very good case relatively to the case that is made, because that is not the case he hopes to make.  The case he is making is that bus passengers must pay the tax, not that dancers may dance free, but that the dance-hall proprietors may open their doors more profitably than heretofore, so that the reservoir from which the £250 came for the Party funds may be more adequately replenished for the crisis that lies ahead for the Fianna Fáil Party in two or three months.  How much of this £100,000 is designed to help the staggering hulk of Fianna Fáil during the pending general election? Is it £10,000 they have promised, or £20,000 or £30,000?  Come, let us canvass on the question, and I will make a deal with the Minister which I am sure my colleague, Deputy McGilligan, will adopt, if he will tell us what percentage of the £100,000 he has covenanted for as a subscription to the general election fund which Fianna Fáil will require about July or August.  We will content ourselves by making estimates of how much the fare-paying bus passengers will have to contribute through this tax.  I say nine-tenths is being borne by the buses in Cork and Dublin.  What has Deputy McGrath of Cork to say, that public-spirited citizen who had aspirations to be Lord Mayor of Cork?  Will he now defend the fare-paying passengers of Cork because they are going to be taxed in order to relieve the dance-hall proprietors?  By a remarkable coincidence it is their contribution which is required to furnish this relief to the public-spirited dance-hall proprietors of Ireland.  Come now.  I think Deputy McGrath has a duty to us to intervene for the purpose of giving his blessing to this aromatic arrangement. Somebody had to bear the burden after all, or the poor dance-hall proprietors might not have coughed up the <Col N="654" /> expected sum next July.  Does Deputy McGrath think that it is the bus passengers of Cork who should have been called upon to pay it?  I cannot see any other urban Fanna Fáil Deputy here at present.</P>
    <P>None of them has the valour of Deputy McGrath.  All the others have moved their blushing countenances elsewhere, but he can speak for them. He will speak for the city as will his colleague, Deputy Lynch.  It will be a nice duet.  The Deputy is dashing.  He will dash while Deputy McGrath supplies the deep-sounding bass.  Come now.  Let us hear the pleasing tenorbass duet about &ldquo;The Moon Hath Raised Her Lamp Above.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems signally appropriate &ldquo;The Moon Hath Raised Her Lamp Above&rdquo; so that we will dance free, albeit that we pay a little extra to travel on the bus to the dance hall or to our daily work.  I hope Deputy McGrath will not blush unduly.  Let him stop grunting and rise to his feet and hail this noble use of the Budget, a great instrument of social policy.  Let the people dance, albeit that they have to walk to the dance hall and walk back again, for if they dance they know they are making the dance-hall proprietor richer than he hoped to be by their subsequent contribution to the bus company when they travel from Crumlin to their work.  Come now.  I can speak only of Crumlin.  Deputy McGrath can give us a similar picture for the City of Cork.  It would be a shame if he did not give us a description of the happy light-hearted people of Cork making their modest contribution to replenish the depleted coffers of the dance-hall proprietors, so that they may be generous when next called upon by the disintegrated Party which at present governs this country on a minority basis.  Come now.  We will wait with interest.  What a pitiful reluctance on the part of the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the information in my possession. The Deputy was not very concerned about that aspect of the matter when, in his Finance Act of 1948, he increased the excise duty on diesel oil from 7d. to 1/- per gallon, nor at the time of the Finance Act of 1951 when he increased it by a further 2d.  Therefore, in three years the Deputy who is so concerned about the effect of the increase in the rate of duty on diesel oil on the cost of public transport increased it by 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any person need pay any attention to Deputy Dillon.  He comes in here and makes the usual dirty charges which are associated with his name and of which the public are so tired.  Whenever these charges were investigated elsewhere the Deputy has run away from them, or the court or tribunal has found that they have been made without any sense of public responsibility. I have no association with dance-hall proprietors.  The only dance-hall proprietors I knew were a member of the Clann na Poblachta Party who sat in this House and the leader of Clann na Poblachta in a country constituency. Those are the only dance-hall proprietors with whom I have had any contact&mdash;to my personal knowledge. No promise or undertaking was given by me to them nor have I seen them. That is all I have to say regarding the disgraceful performance of Deputy Dillon here to-day.</P>

When he was pressed to have those charges investigated in the House a colleague of the Deputy had to stand up and lie publicly to protect the Deputy by saying that <Col N="656" /> documents had been destroyed, documents which existed and which if they were produced would show how false the allegation of the Deputy was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It merely makes my task a little more tedious but it makes it all the more informative for that. When we levy a tax we naturally ask ourselves for what is the tax.  We do <Col N="660" /> not levy a tax for the fun of it.  The Minister for Finance has thumped the desk in front of him and the Tánaiste has thumped the desk and has asked in lachrymose accents: &ldquo;Why do we raise these taxes?  What is the reason for our having put these taxes on?&rdquo;  I explained that one of the reasons was to provide soft jobs for the Minister for Finance and the succession to Deputy de Valera's high position for the present Tánaiste, but that does not explain this particular tax.  I think that this tax is designed to produce about £100,000.  That is a significant figure.  We think that it will probably produce a little more than £100,000.  The more over the £100,000, the hotter we are getting, because we cannot divorce from the back of our minds that somebody was hoping to get £140,000.  As we bridge the gap between the £100,000 and the £140,000, up over the horizon begins to appear the figures of the people who hope to get the £140,000.</P>
      <P>Now, who are they?  Are they the birds of the air or the lilies of the field?  I do not think so.  I know of only one body of citizens in this State who hope to get £140,000 out of this Budget.  Who are they?  Hush&mdash;we must not mention them until we come to Section 14.  But we will then. They must be the only body of citizens in this State who, over their own signed manual, went forth to plunder the Exchequer and ended up enshrined in permanent glory in Section 14 of the Finance Bill.  The only other person who has enjoyed this distinction is Admiral Lord Nelson and he had to win the Battle of Trafalgar to get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This has to do with the £100,000 which the Minister tells us is being levied under the section.  He cannot tell us how.  He cannot tell us who is likely to pay it or how much Córas Iompair Éireann, the national transport company, will have to contribute towards it.  We are feeling our way around to find out.  I quite agree that if the Minister were not the silly little man he is and had read out of the brief he has before him the measure of this burden on Córas <Col N="661" /> Iompair Éireann, all this debate would have been unnecessary.  He has the figure in his brief, but he is ashamed to read it.  He is afraid that Deputy McGrath behind him would get a weakness if he heard how much the Cork bus passengers will have to pay for the purposes of Section 14.  I am going to ask Deputy McGrath to do a public service.  Will he take the Minister out and give him a dish of tea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let him tell him that if he does not know the answer himself, he will find it in his brief, and that he will enjoy for this evening, if he will industriously read his brief, a guarantee that no one will comment on the fact that he is reading what he says, and not thinking it up.  This, however, is certain&mdash; and Deputy McGrath ought to agree with it&mdash;we have a duty, before we consent to the imposition of this tax, to discover in how far the poorer sections of Deputy McGrath's constituents will have to contribute to it, and I think Deputy McGrath's conscience will prick him when he thinks that all they contribute is going to be turned to a certain purpose.  Deputies from rural Ireland will recollect that, if you go into a shop to buy something and do not want to say what exactly is the purpose for which you want the commodity, you ask for &ldquo;a ha'porth of aloes for a certain purpose&rdquo;.  This tax reminds me in more ways than one of that ha'porth of aloes for a certain purpose.  The purpose is so disreputable that no one dares to mention it in the House.  The Minister wants £100,000 for a certain purpose.  He is ashamed to tell us what it is, and he is ashamed to tell us from whom he is going to take it, because he is ashamed to confess the group to whom he is going to convey it.  He is no more than a conduit pipe of £100,000 collected under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The anger displayed by the Minister some moments ago and the extremely bad taste shown by him in his remarks in connection with Deputy MacBride show clearly the bad case which he and his Government have in relation to this tax and every tax imposed in the Budget.  We can leave all that to the coming judgment of the people.  We can, I hope, look forward shortly to an opportunity being given to the people to decide whether these taxes are justified and whether those who seek to impose them have the right to do so.  I only want to refer in relation to this tax to the propaganda used by the Minister and his Party 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>When the Finance Act of 1951 was before the House, the Minister and his colleagues spared no effort to create the impression that the Budget introduced by Deputy McGilligan in that year was in some way oppressive on sections of the people.  They went as far as indulging in every form of ingenuity to find some section who were hit by the Budget.  When, in the last Budget, hydrocarbon oil was proposed to be taxed, not by 2d., as the Minister said, but by a mere 1d., the Opposition case was opened by the Minister who became very eloquent on the effect of a tax on diesel oil on the poor people. I want to refresh the Minister's mind on what he said on 2nd May last year, when the former Government sought to increase the tax on diesel oil by a mere 1d.  The present Minister said, in relation to the fuel being taxed:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is the fuel which the Minister informed us ... drives the buses which bring the workers of Dublin to work, the oil which drives <Col N="663" /> the vehicles upon which most of those who have to live in Kimmage and Crumlin and who are earning their living in the City of Dublin have to travel twice and sometimes four times a day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am concerned with the fact that the people in Crumlin and Kimmage will have the cost of transport appreciably increased to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy MacEntee 12 months ago when the then Government sought to impose a tax of 1d. a gallon on diesel oil&mdash;saying that he was concerned for the poor workers living in Crumlin and Kimmage.  It is the same Deputy who now, as Minister for Finance, comes in to ask the House to tax diesel oil to the extent of 4d. a gallon.</P>
    <P>I do not know what honesty can be behind either the views he now makes or the views he expressed 12 months ago.  Deputy MacEntee, as Deputy MacEntee, was either dishonest on the 2nd May of last year, or as Minister for Finance he is now being dishonest to-day.  What he said 12 months ago may have been true.  If it were true, then he has no case whatsoever for imposing this tax now.  If what he says to-day is correct, then his opposition expressed in this House to the previous Budget was dishonest opposition. There cannot be any way of reconciling both his expressions of opinion.  We all know, of course, that the present Minister is a consummate actor.  We all know that he dearly delights in saying something merely for the purpose of saying it.  We can appreciate that his conduct 12 months ago as an Opposition Deputy was merely acting a particular part.  Unfortunately, he now has to live up to the views he expressed and the opposition he followed when the previous Government was in power.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the fact that, in a very callous manner, he now seeks to tax &ldquo;the fuel that drives the buses that bring the workers to work&rdquo;.  He is doing that without being able to give this House any assurance that that tax will not eventually be passed on in the <Col N="664" /> way of increased fares and, incidentally, be a further tax on the working-class people.  He cannot give that assurance.  He expressed himself previously as being concerned with the possible effect of this tax, and it does seem that, once again, the case which he is seeking to make is a bad case. I think that the badness of his case was the reason that we had this very regrettable display from him here to-day.  I, Sir, think that someone on this side of the House&mdash;if no one on the other side does it&mdash;should protest in as strong a manner as possible at the conduct of the Minister here.  He may not have infringed the rules of order, but he gave a display which certainly was not becoming in this Parliament, a display of bad manners, of bad taste and pettiness which discloses quite clearly that he has a very bad case and is afraid of what other people may think of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, as I did before when the question of diesel oil came up, either to give a guarantee or to recommend to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there should be no increase permitted on the bus fares of the ordinary working-class passengers in the Cities of Dublin or Cork.  The Minister gave no guarantee.  As far as I can see, instead of the bus company making a claim for increased subsidy to meet the tax, they will go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and ask for sanction to increase the bus fares on people who are already heavily overtaxed and who, as a result of this Budget, will be more heavily overtaxed than ever in their lives before.  I ask the Minister to give us a definite assurance that this tax is not going to be put on the people of the towns and cities who are using buses as a means of transport to and from their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in Dublin City, as the Minister and every member of the House knows, the municipality, the Dublin Corporation, seeking sites for housing. The next site that they will get for housing the people will be at least 4d. or 5d. away by bus from the centre of the city.  That works out about £1 a week of an increase on some families <Col N="665" /> in bus fares alone.  It is a scandalous state of affairs if this is going to be the new way of taking extra money from the people using the buses.  I appeal to the Minister to make a recommendation to the Department of Industry and Commerce that they shall not sanction further increases in bus fares in the City of Dublin or anywhere else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential will be as before.  The position is not changed in regard to diesel oil.  I feel I should say something about the case that Deputy MacBride and others attempted to make here.  Anybody listening to Deputy Dillon on occasion should know, of course, that he is what is known in country districts as a horse chemist, that is to say, that he deals in drugs and therefore is familiar with the specifics which the ordinary country people use for certain natural conditions. The Deputy, therefore, had to engage in that type of language and he had to have his self-purgation here to-day before he left the House.  That is not to be wondered at.  We know that the Deputy does boil over on occasions. We all take him here not too seriously, except when he endeavours to degrade the public life of this country by making charges of corruption against people against whom such charges have been levelled by him before.  Yet on every occasion their honour has been vindicated by independent investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position?  The tax which is imposed on diesel oil is closely related and is, in fact, part of the tax which is imposed on mineral hydrocarbon light oils by Section 6.  It is necessary to impose this tax on diesel oil in order that the tax on petrol may be effective.  If we have to increase the tax on petrol for any reason we have correspondingly to increase the <Col N="666" /> tax on diesel oils.  That is what my predecessor had to do.  It is not because of the money that one gets out of this tax that you impose it but in order to make the tax which is the money-getter effective.  That is what my predecessor had to to when he increased the duty on petrol from 9d., as it had stood from the 1st June, 1946, to 1/2 on the 5th May, 1948.  He increased the tax on petrol again from 1/2 to 1/4 on the 3rd May, 1951. Because of that he had to increase the tax on diesel oil correspondingly from 9d. to 1/2 in May, 1948, and from 1/2 to 1/4 in May, 1951.  We propose to increase the tax on petrol and, just as he had to do, we are increasing the tax on diesel oil accordingly.</P>
    <P>I hope that blows sky high the charges which Deputy Dillon dared to level here that this was how we had to find money in order to remit the entertainments duty on public dances.  I will deal later with that matter on the relevant sections.  That is why we had to increase the tax on diesel oil &mdash; in order to make the tax on petrol effective, and it was for no other reason that it was done.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to concede to Deputy O'Higgins or anybody else that it is undesirable that we should have to increase the taxes, but we have no other option if we are going to maintain the public services.  If we are going to provide the social welfare benefits, pay the increases in old age pensions, provide the increases in the remuneration of civil servants, Gardaí, Army officers and Army personnel, and teachers of all classes, which followed inevitably upon the acceptance of the principle of arbitration and upon the acceptance of the arbitrator's award last year &mdash; for each and all of these purposes &mdash; we have to find the money. Therefore, while I concede that it is undesirable that we should have to impose a tax of this sort or a tax of any sort, nevertheless, it is much better that we should do that than borrow abroad in order to maintain the public services.  We must have this tax if we are going to maintain this State &mdash; if we are going to build up this community and pay our way as we go. Despite what has been said about the undesirability of this tax &mdash; and, again, <Col N="667" /> I concede it &mdash; we have to get the money and, that being so, we have to ask the people to accept the necessary burden of maintaining the State.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point of order.  During the course of the debate on Section 7 a Deputy accused the Minister for Finance of having uttered a lie.  He was asked by the Chair to withdraw the expression.  He refused to withdraw it and he left the House.  That Deputy re-entered the House on the division being challenged and voted in the division.  I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, whether it was proper for that Deputy to enter the House and vote, having withdrawn from the House rather than obey the ruling of the Chair.</P>

      <P>I put it to you that the Deputy withdrew from the House rather than withdraw the unparliamentary expression.  Does the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; still stand on the official record in relation to something that I said during the debate?  I was challenged that I had stated that a person had had to lie in order to protect a certain Deputy.  I stated to the Chair that, if the word was unparliamentary, used in that context, I withdrew it.  Does the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; still stand, in as far as it imputes falsehood in this House to me?

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been to some extent &mdash; I suppose it is inevitable &mdash;a certain amount of confusion in thinking in regard to defence generally, and that confusion comes not so much from any lack of appreciation by people who are dealing with the matter as from the fact that their arguments were not strictly <i>ad idem.</i>  I think that a certain amount of that confusion may have crept into this debate in regard to the statements made about guerrilla warfare.  Everybody I think will instinctively sympathise with the background to the expressions of opinion made in that regard.  The suggestion that our forces should be organised for guerrilla warfare does seem to meet, and does in fact to some extent meet, many of the difficulties with which a country such as ours would be faced if the unfortunate emergency of war were to come upon us but, if one looks at it a little more closely, one finds that one cannot answer the question completely on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, with the permission of the House, to deal with a few general considerations touching on this problem, always having in mind what I think some Deputies said earlier and what I said last night, that it is a mistake for anybody here to try to become an armchair general and to dictate to the staff.  It is legitimate and proper that we should consider the problem broadly and comprehensively, but it is a mistake to try to go into the technical details and do the work of the staff.  Subject to that qualification. I should like to expand a little on the point raised last night.  It does mean a repetition of things that some of us have said on a number of <Col N="674" /> occasions in this House during the past three years, but it relates fundamentally to what we want our forces for and what the aim of our Defence Force should be.  When that is clarified, it follows that you can arrange for the type of organisation, equipment and all these other matters that have been mentioned.</P>
    <P>So far as I can summarise it, we want our Defence Forces to fulfil a rôle something like this.  It is impossible, as was pointed out on very many occasions before, for a country such as this to provide for absolute defence. The objective of providing a Defence Force to resist and repel any aggressor is simply beyond us.  We must take a more modest view of the problem. What we can hope to do, however, is to have such a Defence Force here as will minimise the danger of interference and go a long way towards preserving the individuality, if you like, or the integrity of the country, and provide a shield for the people in that way.  I think that some attempt at a definition of that policy was made as far back as 1926.  It has always been the policy of successive Governments to aim at a Defence Force that, first of all, would garrison the country, provide its own local and internal security, would fill the vacuum, so to speak, and thereafter be able to provide a force of sufficient strength to deter anybody from interfering with us.  That policy seems to be the only rational one and, as I have already said, was the one adopted by each successive Government from 1926 onwards.</P>
    <P>More specifically and related to the present-day situation we have something like this: Geographically placed as we are, if the emergency of war should come there is an immediate necessity for supplying our own local protection and for garrisoning the country.  Otherwise there would be a vacuum in the greater portion of this island that would be dangerous to ourselves and perhaps to others.  In the emergency of war that vacuum would have to be filled in any event.  It is, I think, unnecessary to argue that here now but on previous occasions in the debates on the Estimates in 1948, 1949 and 1950 we developed the point in <Col N="675" /> some detail.  It is obviously desirable from our point of view, seeing that the vacuum has to be filled, that we should fill it ourselves rather than that other people should do it.  That is a thing that is desirable both from our own point of view and from the point of view of any friendly powers in our vicinity.  If we are going to do that we must provide forces to give us internal security &mdash; forces to garrison the territory with sufficient density to fill the vacuum; forces to garrison vital installations and strategical points to afford them immediate protection; forces sufficient to deal with light or accidental interference.  All these things are implied in that defence policy.  Over and above that it is necessary to have forces of sufficient strength and efficiency to be able to deter an attacker; more specifically, forces of sufficient strength and efficiency to be able to put up an initial resistance of sufficient magnitude to hold an attacker, even if it is only for a very short space of time, and so impose upon him substantial delay.  In other words, not only must you supply your internal security and local garrisons and such matters, but you must have defence forces of sufficient strength to be able to deter an enemy by the certainty of making it costly for him in man-power, in material and in time.</P>
    <P>Now that objective is within the power of this State and it has been so calculated to be within its power, because it is a notorious fact, and perhaps a fortunate fact for a small country such as this, that a small force well organised will compel anyone who wishes to overwhelm it to deploy a much larger force against it.  Therefore, if we have a relatively small force here properly organised, with a certain minimum amount of equipment, you have the certainty that an aggressor against you will have to employ against you considerable forces, a considerable amount of material and, to defeat you or overrun you, will require a certain time factor.  All these things, of course, act as a serious deterrent.</P>
    <P>When we consider specifically that we are unlikely to be the main objective, <Col N="676" /> any interference with us will be an incidental matter.  In the circumstances as we visualise them, nobody is going to come along and declare war on us and fight a war with us alone.  That is a totally different situation and would perhaps require a totally different approach.  What we have to consider is the question of, what I may call for want of a better word, incidental interference.  In that situation you go a very long way to protect yourself, if the approach is that indicated. In fact, given a few fortunate breaks, you will go the whole way towards protecting yourself if you are able to supply that resistance which will compel an intending attacker to deploy such forces against you that it will be costly for him both in men and material and if the force which you have is of such size and efficiency as will inflict certain delay upon him and so deprive him of the advantage of surprise and swift action against his main opponents.  As I said, it is in regard to some greater issue that we would be interfered with.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is better for the moment to take an example from the last war. It is unlikely that we would have been interfered with in any way during the last war by, say, the Axis Powers as far as we ourselves were considered. But there was at one time at any rate a certain danger that that interference would come in the course of an offensive against Britain.  If the way had been wide open by this particular route for a lightning and successful attack, which fortunately was not open because of a combination of circumstances, including the sea barrier, then one has only to reflect to see that the probability of being interfered with would have been very great.  In such circumstances, where there is a temptation to come in a particular way, that temptation may be removed if, on calculation, it is found that there are forces in the path which can cause delay for a sufficient length of time and so deprive the attacking forces of the advantage of surprise.  That factor alone may be enough to wipe out all the other advantages in the approach.</P>
    <P>I am labouring this merely to bring out this point, that not only will you <Col N="677" /> have the advantage of the deterrent from your own point of view &mdash; it will he costly for the intending aggressor to interfere with you &mdash; but, in the specific set of circumstances you may contemplate where an attack on you is likely to be incidental to a more widespread operation, you also have the advantage that your deterrent action will deprive him of the advantage of surprise and, when that particular advantage is taken from him, he may very well find that it is not worth while interfering at all.</P>
    <P>I have stressed that because that particular point has a bearing on the understandable arguments of people who advocate organising our forces on a purely guerrilla basis.  There are really three things involved.  First of all, there is the local internal security and the garrisoning of the country. Then there is the question of being able to resist an attacker initially. Thereafter, there is the question of putting up an indefinite and prolonged resistance.  It is quite clear that, in the second stage, the initial resistance I have spoken about and which is so important from the point of view of discouraging anybody from interfering and also from the more general point of view which may be inferred from the remarks I have made about surprise in the course of a major operation against somebody else, we of ourselves are unlikely to be able to put up a very prolonged, organised and unpenetrated defence.  Let us admit that to the people who are talking about guerrilla warfare.  We are with them that far. It may very well be that you may have to fall back on operations of a guerrilla nature.  Therefore, as I visualise it, if the worst came to the worst, the situation might be summarised this way.  Granted that you are given time, a certain, perhaps, indefinite time, you would first have mobilisation, the garrisoning of the country and the organisation of the troops.  That would continue until hostilities became an actuality.  Then, apart from incidental, accidental or minor diversionary efforts, if a major effort was made against you, you would put up your main resistance and you could only hope to survive that for a limited period of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Now, one of two things can happen if that situation arises.  The fire will spread, so to speak, and others become involved at that stage, or else one is left isolated, in which case ultimately one will be forced back to the guerrilla basis.  I think that is the picture we have to face, generally speaking.</P>
    <P>Now, when one looks at the picture in that way one sees that there is immediately a qualification to the suggestion that our forces should be organised for guerrilla warfare.  If our forces are organised and dispersed initially for guerrilla warfare they will not be able to put up that particular initial resistance and it would be very easy to penetrate right through them. If that type of policy is adopted <i>ab initio</i>, therefore, without qualification, we must forgo the advantages we would have from a properly organised defensive policy of being able to deter an attacker, while at the same time losing the advantage of being able to hold him or pin him down for a sufficient length of time to enable one to have the advantage of the other factors to which I referred, through the compulsion of deploying initially against us heavy commitments in men and material without the compensating benefit of surprise.  These particular advantages will all be lost if one merely regards one's defensive forces as a number of organised guerrilla bands.</P>
    <P>When one follows the argument to its logical conclusion it seems, therefore, that what we have to do is to organise our forces as a defensive force capable in the initial stages of operating as a military force in the more or less conventional sense.  In addition to that, our troops and reserves should be organised in such a way that they can immediately break up and, if necessary, fall back on guerrilla or cavalry tactics &mdash;if one likes to put it that way.  That objective is more than ever realisable now because there is a tendency towards that type of operation even in the conventional form of war.  I have expatiated on that matter in some detail in order to show that we can lean too much towards the idea of having small independent columns without adequate co-ordination and relying almost exclusively on the smaller type of equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> If that is the type of problem we have to face, then it is obvious that the forces we require must be built up out of the three components that we have at our disposal &mdash; the Regular Army, a First Line Reserve and the F.C.A.  In order to organise these forces, it will be necessary to have on mobilisation a certain disposable force right from the start.  Because that force will be required immediately it will have to be composed largely of Regular Army personnel brought up to unit and formation strength with First Line Reserve personnel.  Certain points and certain installations will have to be garrisoned and it is in that personnel that one will find the cadres for the embodiment of one's reserve units straight away.  Now, all this will simply lead me to a repetition of the arguments that have already been given in such detail and I do not propose to give again all the reasons why we want a certain minimum Regular Army.</P>
    <P>I come now to the importance of the First Line Reserve.  The ideal First Line Reserve consists, of course, of the soldier who has served a number of years &mdash; or even for one year &mdash; in the regular forces, the soldier who is completely conditioned to military life and military activity and who can take his place in his unit and function there without any further training.  There is obviously a limit to the number of men that can be found for that type of Reserve.  That Reserve is an essential component of our forces since such a Reserve enables one to work effectively with a smaller peacetime Army than would otherwise be necessary. By having such a Reserve one's peacetime Regular Army units can be kept under strength, and on mobilisation the vacancies that exist in them can be filled immediately by trained personnel from the First Line Reserve, which gives one the advantage straight away of having a strong Regular Army disposable and ready at a moment's notice, an important consideration in all this matter</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that type of First Line Reserve is limited of necessity. It is difficult to draw material conclusions from the data we have as to that <Col N="680" /> Reserve.  I think, however, I am justified in making this general observation. From the figures it looks as if &mdash;I admit this may be no more than a coincidence &mdash; the size of the First Line, which corresponds roughly to the A Reserve prior to the war, will not greatly exceed in numbers the size of the standing Army.  According to all calculations on paper, it should exceed it.  One should be able to get considerably greater forces for the First Line Reserve from the outflow from the Regular Army provided the strength of the Army is maintained. In practice it seems as if we have never been able to do much better than have approximately the same number in the First Line Reserve.  I am speaking now of the period for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>At the moment the First Line Reserve is actually much less than it should be and that is a rather disturbing factor.  In order to maintain that Reserve there must be a certain outflow from the Regular Army.  That outflow will be ensured to some extent so long as a certain percentage of regular soldiers keep coming out after a few years' service.  In addition to that, it is vitally important that we should maintain the strength of the Regular Army, because if the strength diminishes the outflow will diminish pro rata and one's First Line Reserve will diminish.</P>
    <P>Some of us voiced a warning some years ago as to the dangers resulting from a policy of keeping the Army under establishment, thereby inducing a deficiency in the First Line Reserve. Judging by the figures, I think that fear was fairly well-grounded but, be that as it may, it is important that one's regular forces should be kept up to establishment.  I commend to the Minister's attention the desirability of keeping the First Line Reserve up to establishment.  To a large extent that is beyond his control.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is conditioned by the flow from the Regular Army which, in turn, is conditioned by (a) terms of service in the Regular Army, and (b) strength of the Regular Army.  However, it is an important element in the forces and should not be neglected. <Col N="681" /> Remember this, that it is on the combination of that First Line Reserve and of the Regular Army that you will mobilise.  We had the experience that I outlined in detail in 1948, 1949 and again, perhaps, in 1950.  We had the experience, fortunately, that it actually worked out because of other factors on the last occasion.  We had the experience of knowing that even with an effective Regular Army of 14,000, as it was in 1940 &mdash; a then Regular Army to which, during a period of, roughly, from six to nine months had been grafted a First Line Reserve &mdash;that even on that nucleus the task of meeting commitments in 1940 was very nearly beyond us.</P>
    <P>The First Line Reserve is going to be the immediate available material which is going to give us a regular force so that it can supply immediate needs &mdash; essential garrisons, cadres on which to build up your other reserves and, perhaps, organise another army as we did in the past, supply certain tactical forces that will be available for immediate use so that at the critical stage of mobilisation you will not be completely without shelter.  To secure all these things &mdash; the maintenance and the efficiency of the First Line Reserve, the standard of the First Line Reserve and the strength of the First Line Reserve &mdash; is of considerable importance for the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>So far we have dealt with two elements in our Defence Forces, the First Line of Reserve and the Regular Army.  We now come to the other.  An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil, which, let me hasten to say, is an equally important part of our forces.  It will be a major part of our forces and will, because of its very nature, require, perhaps, even more attention than the other elements.  That particular force has been the subject of a good deal of talk. I wonder are we completely clear about it now?  By the way, I should like to say now that I agree with much of what Deputy O'Higgins, the former Minister, said in regard to that.  I would like the Minister to take heed of one phrase in his speech where he pointed out the difficulty of getting regular personnel to appreciate the importance of that force.  There are <Col N="682" /> certain historical reasons and other reasons for that, but I think there is something in that point.  As a member of a voluntary force before the war myself, I felt that the potentialities and the importance of such a force were not sufficiently realised.  Then afterwards, I must confess, seeing it from the other side as a whole-time soldier, one was inclined to concentrate on what appeared to be the more immediate problems and to put the L.D.F. second in priority.  That was a very natural temptation for what I shall call the regular outlook.</P>
    <P>There has been a warning voice in that regard here and I think that matter has to be constantly borne in mind.  In saying that there is no question of any imputation that there has been any neglect or lack of interest in the F.C.A.  It is just some psychological factor in the machine, if you like, but it is a thing to be guarded against.</P>
    <P>I pointed out as far back as 1948 that if that force is to be a success facilities must be provided, and these facilities not only mean training facilities and accommodation but they mean administrative facilities, and that, of necessity, a certain proportion of the regular whole-time personnel will be absorbed in the running of that force, both from the training and administrative point of view.  I remember in 1948 making a point which seems to have been substantiated by later events.  I made it on the basis of experience gained as a member of a voluntary force before the war.  It was this: that there is a maximum to the size of the volunteer force which you can maintain. You cannot maintain a greater force and that maximum is set or fixed by the size of your regular cadres which, in turn, is conditioned by the size of the regular army.  I said in 1948&mdash;and I still feel&mdash;that effectively to administer the F.C.A. means that a certain minimum number of regular officers, N.C.O.s and men must be conallotted to that force and must be considered as fulfilling a mission in every way as honourable and as important as those of any other personnel in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Incidentally we have to get back again <Col N="683" /> to another argument, and that is why a certain minimum is set to the effective strength of the Regular Army.  It all comes back to this when one analyses it: that if you do not provide it with a skeleton there will be nothing to hold up the body.  If I seem constantly to be harping on that point it is because nearly all the avenues lead one to that conclusion.  The question is whether you are going to have an effective defence force and an effective F.C.A.  If you are going to have that, a <i>sine qua non</i> is to have an effective regular force not below the minimum calculated for establishment.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the F.C.A., some of us have felt &mdash; I find that the point was made on the Estimate in 1950&mdash; that there is a certain amount of confusion in regard to the rôle of the F.C.A.  Perhaps it would be well to trace back a little its origin and history, because I think the Minister will have to give the question of this force a little further thought for this reason. The original intention or proposal of the staff was that you would have your Regular Army and First Line Reserve. They visualised bringing up that First Line Reserve so as to give you an effective mobile Army on mobilisation. After that it is considered, and it is a necessity of modern warfare, that a local defence force is needed.  A rough analogy could be made and, in fact, was made in the House between active service units during the Black and Tan days and the local Volunteers of those days.  If we have a defence force, even in the sense we have been talking about in the discussion on this Estimate, we need behind it a local defence force.  I mean something in the nature of a home guard who will be part-time soldiers even during war &mdash; a group who will garrison their own towns, villages and factories on a part-time basis, going on with their civilian duties during the day.  A local defence force in that sense is necessary and will be necessary, and that is one of the gaps that will be filled by our F.C.A. Incidentally, that was the original concept of the L.S.F. and the L.D.F. However, we have gradually adopted the view, over the past three years, that we will ask our L.D.F. to do something <Col N="684" /> more: that they should be a reserve of the Regular Army.  I wonder if we have quite thought out that problem. If another emergency should come, having mobilised the Regular Army and the First Line Reserve as we have, we will still be very deficient in numbers.  We can visualise one or two things to meet that situation.  There will be another drive to have an emergency Army if a war emergency comes.</P>
    <P>If that situation arises we will have to maintain, as we did last time, a very much greater standing Army than the sum of our First Line Reserve, as at present, and the Regular Army, which is a good deal less than 20,000 in number at the moment.  If we do that, it seems to indicate that we will have another emergency Army recruited and grafted on to the existing mobilised force.  Large numbers for that emergency Army will come from the present F.C.A. force.  That is all the more reason, therefore, why the training given to this force at the present time should be the most general and the most efficient kind which we can possibly provide.  The probability is that if we only continue training the F.C.A. personnel on the present basis, we will have a situation comparable with that existing during the last war &mdash; a situation in which we have an emergency Army, and an L.D.F. force a lot of whom have already been trained in their own areas, less such persons who volunteered and joined the permanent force. That is what is likely to happen if we do nothing more about the situation.</P>
    <P>However, there is another possibility and it would, perhaps, be the more prudent course to follow; it would give greater efficiency, smoother working, smoother mobilisation, and save time if and when a crisis should come.  I suggest that that course would be to consider now whether, within the framework of the F.C.A., we could not develop a further element of the First Line Reserve; in other words, whether we could not consider having certain F.C.A. battalions, which could be mobilised to do their part in conjunction with the regular force, leaving other units for local protection.  Of course, that would mean supplying substantial cadres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> I do not think I should labour that point any further for the simple reason that I would be going into technical details which would prove a little bit dangerous for us here; they are matters for the General Staff to consider, and matters for careful consideration in view of all the factors involved.  I will just make this general suggestion: There is still a gap in regard to the First Line Reserve. While we allow that, we will not be able to provide quickly the Army which will be necessary if an emergency should come.  It has already been decided that we will not take the steps that other countries have taken to fill the existing gap.</P>
    <P>In this country we have a force which is already organised.  That force, with some adjustments, could be made to provide, not only the local home guard, which it was originally contemplated it would provide, but also the balance which is required in the First Line Reserve, in the sense in which I have used that term.  That is a problem that should be considered, and it would have this great advantage: we would be calling on the very best elements in the country &mdash; a force which is already there and which, in my view, is the most promising thing we have had in this country or that we are likely to have.  I make that point for the Minister's consideration. It was made in one form or another in the past.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the defence of our country, that problem should at least be examined and some definite conclusions reached and some definite policies pursued.  However, it does seem that, merely recruiting the F.C.A. as a local defence force or as a home guard to operate on a part-time basis, even in times of emergency and to have a force equivalent to our Regular Army plus its present First Line Reserve only, would inevitably result in a repetition of the 1940 emergency.  It would mean a chaotic drive to expand the Regular Army by the means which we then adopted.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that point.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now as one who had experience of and was in fact a member of one of the predecessors to the <Col N="686" /> F.C.A. force.  Between the years 1934 and 1936, we had the problems which the F.C.A. have now to face, and the conditions in our force were similar to those operating in the present body.  As a result of that experience, I would urge on the Minister to see that the F.C.A. force gets active encouragement at all times.  It is an extremely difficult force for the personnel of the Regular Army to handle.  It is not attractive to them because it takes up some of their week-ends and some of their nights; it does not appeal to them because its personnel are not whole-time soldiers; if the money would only allow it, the idea would be to have a standing Army at full strength and efficiency and to cut out all the rest; that is the natural view of the whole-time soldier in regard to the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the importance of this force is, in many respects, a first priority.  With that in mind, there should be a constant insistence on encouraging the force and giving it facilities.  To provide these facilities, training officers and administrative officers would have to be made available and their posts with the F.C.A. force should be regarded as posts of importance.  The higher commands in the F.C.A. force which will be exercised by regular officers, detailed for that purpose, should be regarded as important commands and should carry appropriate ranks.  The officers tackling the work should be made to think that they are not, so to speak, being put into a back-water, but that they are engaged in a very important aspect of national defence.  Their chances of promotion should be in no way prejudiced but enhanced. There should be a change-over of personnel periodically so as to ensure that all permanent officers would have an appreciation of the potentialities and difficulties of that force as well as of the regular problem and the more orthodox side of the picture.  That is important from the point of view of the L.D.F., and it is important from the point of view of the Regular Army.  The adequate supply of other ranks, N.C.O.s for training and N.C.O.s for administration and the provision of training facilities in <Col N="687" /> weapons are exceedingly difficult problems and they are cropping up every day in different forms, but must be solved.  Having regard to our particular circumstances, we have largely to rely for efficiency and effectiveness in the end on these voluntary soldiers who will have a considerable amount of ability.  Since that is the picture, these elements should be provided.  I would like to lend my voice strongly to what has been said by Deputies on all sides of the House and to what has been said in that regard by Dr. O'Higgins.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not apprehensive that the extreme severity of this impost may, in fact, have an adverse result on the Exchequer instead of the one he hopes for?  Does the Minister not consider in the circumstances of the taxation that the amount levied against this particular <Col N="688" /> item may defeat the object that he has set himself out to achieve?  Can the Minister explain to the House and, through the House to the country, why he asks this particular branch of the licensed trade to take this severe impost in one go?  Can the Minister indicate to us what is the final tax potential capacity?  Is he satisfied in his own mind that this imposition is, in fact, not going to defeat itself and that the severity of the impost will not result in such a reduction in consumption as to defeat the Exchequer return that he envisages?  Has the Minister considered whether or not this imposition may not, in fact, have the complete reverse effect from the point of view of tax yield to the one which he at present envisages?</P>

The fact that I am submitting it to the House is proof that I am hopeful that the tax will give us the yield we anticipate. I do not think, in all the circumstances of the time, that the tax is excessive.  It certainly compares very favourably with the taxes imposed on this commodity elsewhere, and even after the increase, substantial and all as it may appear to be, I think our people will still be able to enjoy each other's convivial company much less expensively than would be the case if they lived elsewhere.</P>

      <P>No, I did not talk about anything you mentioned anyway. The general principle underlying the attrack on beer is common to both sections and is contrary to the positive assertive assurances given by the Minister, then Deputy MacEntee, on the hustings in Rathmines, wooing in his capricious way the votes of the public.  We want to know from the Minister the reason for this assault. Is it something sinister, something fundamentally spiteful, reverting to the catastrophe into which they led themselves before by this type of stupidity? We are entitled to ask the Minister why he has changed since he gave the categorical assurance, when dealing with honesty in public life and the whispering campaign, that there would be no impost good, bad or indifferent on the drinkers of the country.  He made that the issue: whether there would be honesty or dishonesty in public life.</P>
      <P>We have had enough somersaults on point 15 of the 17-point programme. This has been nearly enough to choke the erstwhile captain.  We are entitled to ask both on this and on the next section what brought about the Minister's vicious somersault.  What has changed his attitude since he was bewildered by the malign whispers that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would be an increase in the price of beer and tobacco?  He described it as a mendacious whisper, something completely unfounded in fact, something completely nutrue.  I would like him to explain now to his bewildered supporters around the country where the mendacity really was.</P>

      <P>Far from improving the position of breweries in rural areas, I believe this section is causing the breweries to alter their economy.  I am told on good authority that many of their staffs have been reduced as a result of the proposals here.  It appears to be a double-edged weapon. We know of course that the farmers were made to bear their share of the burden.  We remember when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture had a conference, at which the price for barley was announced at 7/6 less per barrel than the farmers had been receiving previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking so much.  I can quite readily understand that neither Deputy Cowan nor the Minister are feeling too happy about these two sections, the Minister because of a speech he made in Rathmines Town Hall &mdash; I will have a few words more to say about it later &mdash; and Deputy Cowan because of the fact that that speech was made by the Minister and that assurance given.  I am perfectly satisfied that Deputy Cowan and some of his colleagues were able to salve their consciences by remembering that speech and by remembering point No. 15 of the 17-point programme which was not put before the electorate but was put before the Deputies whose support was sought in order to ensure the election of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not read these speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not read even my own, much less Deputy Cowan's. The Minister did make a very definite statement in his speech at Rathmines, and, listening to him replying to the debate on the Budget, I wondered whether the Minister meant one word of what he said, because he made what appeared to me to be a very significant statement in the course of his reply to that debate when he said that the additional duties which were imposed <Col N="695" /> by the Government in the emergency Budget of 1947 should never have been removed.  I think the Minister owes some explanation to the House and the country regarding this complete departure from the policy which he stated in connection with these commodities during the general election.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt, whatever, so far as beer, or porter or stout is concerned, to a very large extent it is not a luxury in this country.  It certainly has ceased, in the opinion of a very considerable number of people, and particularly certain sections of people, to be thought of as a luxury, and I put it to Deputies that it does enter into the budget of the average family. There is no doubt whatever that, if the Minister's hopes in relation to the amount of revenue he expects to get from the beer duties are realised, they can be realised only by the house going short of something else.  I know, like every other Deputy, that, even at the new price, beer or stout or porter will be drunk, although, perhaps, not to the same extent, but if the Minister is to get his revenue, it will have to be very close to it.</P>
      <P>I take the view that it is a very heavy impost.  It will bear hard upon many working-class families, and will bear particularly hard upon families where the income is small.  I am not at the moment thinking of or concerned with the average household, where one or more members of the family may consume beer or stout &mdash; call it what you like &mdash; to excess.  I am thinking of the man who, at the end of his day's work, takes a pint of stout or a bottle or two of stout.  If he takes only one pint of stout per day, and there is nothing excessive about that, or a couple of bottles of stout with a friend or fellow-worker at the end of the week, it does impact, taken in conjunction with all the other impositions, fairly severely on that family income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you ally that with the additional cost of cigarettes or tobacco, he need not smoke to excess to find a very heavy impact on his income.  If he is to continue doing that, it can only be done at the expense of some other requirement in the home.  I am informed <Col N="696" /> that there has been a fairly substantial reduction in the amount of drink being consumed.  Whether that is so or not, I am not in a position to say.  Some people will tell you that there is a big reduction, while others say that they do not notice any change at all.  The Minister will have to be more concerned about that than I, but I am concerned to the extent that the average working man, the average man with a small salary or wage or small family income, who drinks very moderately will find this a very heavy impost.  I do not think Deputy Cowan can just clear himself of his dilemma and I think he is in a bit of a dilemma.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has satisfied himself that he has completely burned his boats, he is right to stick it out, because there is no possible hope of retracing his step.  I know, however, that the Deputy is not feeling in the least happy about it.  I know also that Deputy Cowan could make a much more eloquent and a ten times more effective speech against either this section or the next section than I could make and an infinitely more effective and eloquent speech against it than he can make for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be said that it is not fair to concentrate entirely on the tax on beer on this section, as that is not what the intention of the section is.  Deputy Cowan is right in calling attention to the fact that this deals with customs duty on beer, that is, on imported beer, whereas the next section, Section 10, deals with duty on home-brewed beer.  But in the Budget speech the Minister put them both together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to discuss them together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The present duty on beer is £5 12s. per standard barrel, compared with £5 in the years before the war &mdash;an increase of only 12/- on 36 gallons or ½d. a pint.  In the light of this fact an increase in the excise <Col N="697" /> duty on beer of £4 1s. per standard barrel is justifiable.  It will have the effect of increasing the retail price by 3d. per pint, allowing some margin to the trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After a few interruptions, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A corresponding increase will, of course, apply to imported beers. From these changes in the beer duty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>both lumped together&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope to gain an extra £2,400,000 in the present year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The table explanatory of the Budget shows that figure as £2,360,000.  However, the difference is not considerable. First of all, at a time when I was considering these things I was informed that the revenue calculation was that 1d. on the pint brought in £1,250,000 if the Budget were introduced at the usual time, round about the month of May, when a certain period of the year had been lost, but in a full year 1d. on the pint would bring in £1,500,000.  We are now dealing with 3d. on the pint&mdash;it does not matter whether it is on imported beer or home-brewed beer, as the two are lumped together and we can discuss them together.  The point that I wish to talk about is not beer at all but the demand put upon the housewife to find the money for the beer out of the pay packet of her husband, by saving on the necessities of the house, in domestic appliances, in children's clothes or in her own clothes, or in anything else in the household budget.  This is the smaller part of it, but the tax is the same.</P>
    <P>The first thing to note is the 3d. on the pint in the full year and that the Budget was introduced on the 2nd April, so that the tax became effective from that date.  It was a tax that should bring in £4,500,000.  The Minister's calculation was that it would bring in £2,400,000.  Although he is budgeting on the 2nd April and, therefore, getting a full year, he says it will bring only £2,400,000.  That is a significant difference.</P>
    <P>It may be explained by an expectation that the consumption of beer will drop off and that therefore there will be only £2.4 million instead of the <Col N="698" /> £4.5 million which would normally be brought in.  But, of course, there is another explanation, that is, the explanation we discovered already in the tax on petrol.  I have explained already that the calculation which was given to me was that 1d. a gallon on petrol brought in £300,000.  Therefore, 5½d. on petrol should bring in £1,650,000.  The Minister says he is only calculating for £1.4 million.  To my mind, that is an underestimate of £250,000&mdash;only there is the extra fact that this year no rebate is being given to the farmers for the petrol they use in agricultural tractors.  When I was given the calculation of £300,000 it was on the basis of 1d. put on petrol but with the rebate to the farmers.  Now the full whack of the 4d. is being taken this year.  I do not know what the calculation was, because I never inquired, but I assume that 1d. on petrol all over the community would yield at least £350,000 instead of £300,000, so that there ought to be brought in from 5½d. £1,925,000, which means an underestimation of nearly £750,000.  Again relating that to this tax, are we again in the field of underestimation that we have already explored, where we think the revenue this year is being completely underestimated and the expenditure completely overestimated and no allowance made for any surplus whatever, so that the Minister may have an enormous surplus later that would allow him to go to the people in jubilation and say that they are able to finance the capital programme out of the revenue for the year?</P>
    <P>That is one side but here is the second side&mdash;and here we must go further afield than beer.  I do not mind the difference between imported beer and home-brewed beer.  On both the Minister expects to get £2.4 million or a little less, according to Table I explanatory of the Budget.  The £2.4 million, as opposed to the £4.5 million, represents a drop of a considerable percentage in the consumption of beer in the country; but notwithstanding that he is going to get £2.4 million from beer.  He is also going to get £5,500,000 from tobacco and £1,020,000 from spirits.  All those added together come to £8,880,000.  There we have the amount that is going to be <Col N="699" /> taken from the people over and above the compensatory benefits alleged to be given under social security&mdash;benefits of almost £4,000,000.  If those are added together it is the sum of almost £13,000,000.  Where is that to be found?  The Minister is not trying to prevent people from drinking beer, for if they did that it would completely destroy his Budget.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to explain to the House my own experience&mdash;and in doing this I am not revealing any secrets, as this should be known to anyone who knows anything about economics.  Taxes on beer and tobacco are always described as deflationary taxes.  That means that the people who impose those taxes do not expect people to stop consuming either beer or tobacco.  They expect that the consumption will go on and that the money must be found for these things.  If the money has to be found from the same wage packet as the man used to get before the taxes went on, then the savings must occur elsewhere. To those who felt that the Minister might have been taking any view about an increase in wages, I wish to give what his attitude was, as given in the Official Debate for the 2nd April, 1952, column 1138:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government are satisfied that as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the background effect of the whole picture, that &ldquo;incomes have advanced more than the cost of living&rdquo;.  It is not possible, the Minister says to himself, to go boldly at the policy of reducing wages, but there is an insidious way of reducing wages, and that is by increasing the cost of, first of all, the things that people must buy and, apart from that, the things that people will buy.  The &ldquo;must buy&rdquo; things are bread, flour, tea, sugar and butter.  If you increase the price of those and wages do not advance, it is the same as reducing wages.  If in addition to that you increase the cost of the things which it is your expectation that the people will buy, namely, tobacco, beer and spirits, then you get <Col N="700" /> a further reduction in the value of their wages&mdash;at least in the value of their wages as applied to the ordinary necessities of the household.  There is nearly £13,000,000 between these food taxes.  Deputy Peadar Cowan may want to interrupt again and say there is no food tax.  To be precise, it is only a reduction of subsidy.  Let him explain that to the working man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the same?  The reduction of subsidy is going to put up the price of flour by 2/1.  Is that not the same as putting a tax of 2/1 on flour?  Really, are we mincing words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that on the family budget it produces the same result.  A sum of £13,000,000 has to be found by people of whom it is alleged that their wages have already advanced beyond the increase in the cost of living.  The whole theme of the Budget was that wages are too high and that as we cannot attack them directly we must attack them indirectly, and that this is the way to do it.  They are getting Deputy Cowan to agree with that.  He is, therefore, attacking the wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say they are too high.  I think they are too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is reducing them by voting for this section. The Deputy, therefore, does not agree with the pivotal point&mdash;I think the Minister described it as the &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; in his Budget speech&mdash;that incomes have advanced to a higher degree than the advance in the cost of living.  Let me quote the Minister's words precisely again for the benefit of the House.  I quote from column 1138 of the Official Report of the 2nd April. 1952:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have given careful thought to this problem over <Col N="701" /> recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living and as essential foodstuffs are no longer scarce, there is now no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food for everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anybody contradict me when I say that what this Budget aims at is to make the people find £13,000,000 for foodstuffs&mdash;bread, flour, butter, tea and sugar&mdash;and for the tobacco and the beer and the spirits that the Government expects the people to this extent to consume?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not finding £13,000,000 for extra State expenditure on social services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say that this extra taxation is necessary although I do not agree that it is.  For the sake of argument, however, let us say that it is necessary.  The way it has to be found now is to say to the housewife: &ldquo;Out of whatever money your man brings home each week in his pay packet&mdash;and we do not want that increased because we think wages have advanced beyond the increase in the cost of living&mdash;you will have to find £3,918,000 for extra cost of food.  You will find £8,880,000 for the beer, spirits and tobacco that we expect, if our Budget proposals are correct, your husband to consume&rdquo;&mdash;or maybe the husband and wife between them to consume.  There is the point of view. We are not discussing the beer.  What we are discussing is an attempt to prevent people from spending money on household goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be said about any tax, could it not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Suppose the Minister were a social reformer and that he came in here and said: &ldquo;Beer and tobacco are being consumed in extraordinary quantities in this country&mdash;more than the country can afford. <Col N="702" /> I am going to put a severe tax on them in order to put the people off drinking and smoking.&rdquo; Suppose he then brought in a Budget and said: &ldquo;My taxes are so severe that there will be a drop to about one-quarter of the usual consumption of both beer and tobacco which will, henceforth, be consumed, in the main, only by people with big incomes.  I am now getting a flow of the tax on only one-quarter of the old consumption.&rdquo; But, in this Budget, there will be a 10 per cent. reduction in the consumption of whiskey and a 6 per cent. reduction in the consumption of beer, according to a calculation made by the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>For the rest of it, the expectation of the Government is that beer will be drunk and tobacco will be smoked to the point at which they will yield, between them, an extra £7,860,000, and that whiskey will be drunk to yield an extra £1,020,000.  The belief is that all three will be consumed to the point at which they will bring in an extra £8,880,000.  If people stopped drinking beer or whiskey to any great extent or stopped smoking to any great exent, the Budget would be ruined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister knows that they will continue to consume these things and he is happy about it.  He is not saying: &ldquo;I know you are badly off and that it will be a hardship on your wives and families if you drink and smoke too much.&rdquo; That is not what he says.  In his Budget statement he said that incomes have advanced beyond the advance in the cost of living.  He says to the people: &ldquo;You have a bit of money in hand which you are entitled to spend on tobacco and drink.  I am going to take it from you, but I am not stopping you from smoking or drinking.&rdquo; The Government are not acting as social reformers and putting people on a Lenten fare of going off drink and smokes.  Their outlook is: &ldquo;Drink as much as you can and smoke as much as you can, and when you do that you will have less to spare for other things.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This year's Budget is divided into three parts&mdash;(1) a general economic survey; (2) the Budget last year; and (3) this year's Budget.  The general economic survey was given pride of place, and the conclusion of the general economic survey was: &ldquo;We cannot afford the present scale of spending abroad in excess of our current external earnings.&rdquo; Does that mean anything other than that the Government are going to make goods from across the land and sea frontiers scarce?  Look at those goods in any of the returns of imports and exports for any quarter.  What are the goods that come from across the Border and from across the water?  To the greatest extent, they are consumer goods&mdash; carpets, rugs, curtains, furniture, wash-hand basins, and so forth.  They are all things which people want for their houses.  That is what we have to stop, and the Budget set out the way to stop it&mdash;by taxing food, because people must eat to live.  Tax the butter, tea, sugar and flour because the people must get these things, and <Col N="704" /> they will have less money to spend on the things that come from across the frontier.  Then you add the tobacco and beer and spirits, which will yield an extra £8,750,000.  The Government say they will get that revenue, and that by getting it the public will have £8,750,000 less to spend on the stuff coming from across the frontier.  The bankers will be happy, the balance of payments will be rectified, and we shall have the position again that the bankers will be bossing the community. That is the result of the food tax.  Do not think that you would be voting against the beer drinkers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not, apparently, realise yet that when he is voting for a tax on beer he is voting for the subtraction of £2.4 million from the purses of the people. That £2.4 million is usually spent on curtains, rugs or domestic goods.  That is what the Deputy is taxing.  He is trying to prevent people from spending money on these goods.  That is the object of this tax.  Whether it be on imported beer or on home-brewed beer, the principle is the same.  The object is to stop spending and equate wages to the level at which the Minister would have kept them.</P>
      <P>On one occasion the present Minister for Justice, Deputy G. Boland, lamented the increase in the salaries of civil servants, Army personnel, the Gardaí and the teachers.  He said that now local government officials and workers everywhere would expect the same increase in their salaries.  Can Deputy Cowan see any difference between a wage policy which will reduce the wages of the community by £13,000,000 and taxing things which the people must buy to keep alive and which they must buy out of the same weekly pay package as before?  The Deputy says that he wants wages increased.</P>

I cannot consider beer out of the framework of the whole Budget. That is the framework of the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan's statements were rather enlightening. <Col N="706" /> Deputy McGilligan had another way of meeting these matters.  There was a guarantee given, before the Deputies opposite succeeded in getting into office, that they would reduce and do away with the increased tax on beer and cigarettes.  In order to do that they had to do something which I will describe in this way.  Suppose the 31st March was approaching and the rate collector came to me and said; &ldquo;You have to pay your rates,&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I have not got the money,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Come to the bank and I will get it for you.&rdquo;  I went to the bank; the rate collector secured me for the money; I handed the money to him and I am paying for it since.</P>
      <P>The people are paying and will continue to pay for the next 30 years for the cheap pint and the cheap cigarettes that they got from February, 1948, to the end of that financial year.  They borrowed the money to pay for it and the people have to repay the principal and interest.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has wandered rather far afield.  I want to keep as close as I can to the point.  Deputy McGilligan wants to know what the money is for.  Deputy McGilligan knows that when he introduced his Budget on 2nd May there was a decision given or, on the point of being given, by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.</P>

      <P>He is not that big a fool. That must be found now.  That, Sir, I suggest, would just about cover the tax on beer and whiskey.  When we hear of honesty and decency in public life, I would like to allude to another item, which is the cause, I suggest, of our having to pay the increase on beer. The following is a letter dated 3rd February, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" />&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>In reference to your letter (ref. G. 53/49) of the 26th January, enclosing a copy of the county manager's order No. 46/51 proposing a further increase in the remuneration of superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers by a temporary allowance of 12½ per cent. of their annual salaries, I am directed by the Minister for Social Welfare to inform you that the revision of salaries which took effect from the 1st June, 1948, is regarded as a comprehensive adjustment, and he is not prepared to sanction the proposed further increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the 3rd February.  On the 7th May this letter was issued:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Social Welfare to state that he has had under consideration proposals from local authorities for the payment of a bonus allowance to meet the increased cost of living to superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers.  I am to state that he approves of the proposal to increase, as from a date not earlier than the 1st November, 1950, the salaries of these officers by 12½ per cent.  Where a proposal for an increase has not already been submitted by a public assistance authority, the Minister will be prepared to consider favourably a proposal on the foregoing basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How is this related to the duty on beer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Portion of this money for health services had to be found in this Budget.  That is how it comes into this.  Here is the Minister, who informed officials on the 3rd February, 1951, that they were not entitled to anything, saying, four days after the Dáil dissolved, that they were entitled to it; that not alone were they entitled to it in May, but were entitled to it for four months prior to February, from November, 1950.  That is the money we have to find now.  This is honesty in public life.  This is the <Col N="708" /> purchase price of the seats of some of the Deputies over there.  The people who have to visit the poorest of our people who are living on home assisance, a week before the election took place, had inside in their pockets six months' increase in back pay and a guarantee of an increased salary.  They went around to the poorest of our people on whose behalf Deputy McGilligan is bewailing the price of bread, butter and the pint.  That is how this game is worked.  That is why we have a bill to pay.  That is why the people now have to be asked to pay it.  Corruption in its filthiest form.</P>
      <P>Another of these letters was issued from the Department of Local Government on the 4th May.  Two issued from Deputy Costello, one on the 7th May and another on the 17th.  Between the three of them they account for £855,000 in this Budget.  That has to be found. Will Deputy McGilligan have the neck to defend that?  I am glad I have got him where I can look at him.  I am delighted to look over at the gentleman who, on the 2nd May, brought in a Budget and who apparently did not know that the Dáil would be dissolved on 3rd May and that on the 4th May the boys would send down the bribe.</P>
      <P>Let us count it up.  There was £3,600,000 for the Civil Service; there was £855,000 in those couple of letters, plus the £2,000,000 that the ratepayers had to pay in addition&mdash;the poor people for whom Deputy McGilligan has been fighting for the last hour.  These are the poor people, on whom 1/8 in the £ was put in order to pay the purchase price for a couple of seats here, and that is why the price of beer has had to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have another little item.  He told Córas Iompair Éireann last year, when he was introducing his Budget: &ldquo;You will have to live in future on your own resources and get revenue to meet your expenditure.&rdquo; He provided nothing for them in the Budget, although he knew that a sum of £980,000 had to be provided for Córas Iompair Éireann in the Vote on Account for that year.  As a matter of fact, a total of £1,800,000 had to be provided for that purpose last year, Add all these figures up and <Col N="709" /> see where you are going to find the money for these purposes.  The payment for the three years' little spree that the Deputies opposite had on borrowed money will cost the people of this country £6,000,000 extra in interest and sinking fund on that borrowed money.</P>
    <P>That statement can be confirmed from the records of this House in which there will be found a reply which I got from the Minister for Finance nearly two months ago.  Neither Deputy McGilligan nor any other Deputy had the neck to challenge that statement since.  It is down there in black and white.  If the statement were wrong, surely Deputies opposite would get up and deny it.  We have, therefore, to provide an extra £6,000,000 a year for interest and sinking fund on borrowed money over what had to be provided in 1947-48.  Add that to the other three items I mentioned and ask yourselves where is the money to be found.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to this and examine it in the same way as any householder would examine his own accounts.  I admit that the gentlemen who had the neck to borrow in order to reduce the price of the pint in 1948 would have the neck to borrow to maintain the food subsidies this year or next year, if they could get anyone from whom they could borrow, but if you have to go to a bank manager as these gentlemen had to go to the money-lenders, and tell him that you wanted £5,004,500 in 1947-48, £9,800,000 in 1948-49, £20,480,000 in 1949-50, £21,000,000 odd in 1950-51, and £38,980,000 in 1951-52, you would not get very much money advanced to you. That was the cost of the spree&mdash; £98,980,919&mdash;and that is what the people of this country will have to pay for the next 30 years.  No doubt you had a good time.  You had a royal time while it lasted, but no attempt was made to provide for an increase in industry.</P>
    <P>To get closer to the question of the tax on beer, according to the chairman of the Licensed Vintners' Association there was an increase in consumption of 36,000 barrels last year.  I do not know who swallowed it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are Fianna Fáil publicans.  I was given a description of how the Fine Gael publican acted when he started to fill a pint.  He would say to his customer: &ldquo;This extra price has ruined us.  This last bit of a rise has finished us.  Here you are, Mickey,&rdquo; and he would hand out a pint with about two inches of froth on the top of it.  Let me say that the majority of the people of this country do not drink for the sake of drinking.  The majority of the people go into a public-house in the evening to have a social chat, perhaps a drink with their neighbours and a game of cards or a game of rings.  When they go into some of these public-houses, they hear a lot of moaning and groaning: &ldquo;My God, Mickey, it has gone up.  It is 1/2 a pint now.&rdquo; Then the publican hands out the pint with two inches of froth on the top of it.  The lad who sees that, goes into the Fianna Fáil pub the next night where he gets the full pint.  I am only relating the facts of the situation as I know them, as they have been given to me by reputable publicans in my constituency.  They have given me that description as an explanation of the reason why extra customers are coming in to them.  I can tell you that some publicans down there have lost customers because of their conduct in trying to condemn the Budget, at the behest of the Fine Gael organiser in the district, and they are not too thankful to the Fine Gael organiser because of the loss of these customers.  As I say, there was a <Col N="711" /> pretty hefty increase in consumption. There were 34,000 extra gallons of whiskey drunk last year.  I am not making any wild statements.  I am repeating the statement made by the chairman of the Licensed Vintners' Association and published in the public Press last March.</P>

It gave him a little help in that way.  Deputies talk about honesty in public life and then issue documents like the letters which I have read here.  I am not saying that they were not entitled to it, but if they were entitled to it in May they were entitled to it in February.  If they were not entitled to in February, then why pay them back to November, 1950?</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins had a little experience in that line.  I say that the Minister's difficulty 12 months ago and the Minister's difficulty to-day are two very different matters.  We all know how long it takes an auditor sent down the country by the Local Government Department to go into accounts. <Col N="712" /> It must have been a terrific job to go into these accounts and find out what was unprovided for, what Deputy McGilligan quite forgot.

I can take the question of beer back <Col N="713" /> to the period when agricultural labourer's wages were around 26/- a week and the price of the pint was 9d. If Deputies have the idea that every other thing must go up, but that there must be no increase in the price of drink, let them put that into practice. I certainly consider that the price of drink must go up the same as the price of boots, clothing and anything else, particularly when it has to go up in order to meet increases in the salaries of civil servants.  Some 4,730 extra civil servants were brought in after the emergency.  I could understand an increase in the number of civil servants during the emergency, but 4,730 were brought in after the emergency during the three and a half years of the previous Government.  I had no intention of speaking on this matter at all, but when I saw the barefaced attitude taken up by the Deputy who was responsible for this situation when he was Minister I thought something should be said about it.</P>

      <P>The comment has frequently been made in regard to Irish history that there were two distinct classes of folk who did a little bit of oppression upon their own in this country.  There was one class that came in from outside&mdash;the Planter crowd with a little bit of breeding behind them.  They looked down on the people in the country as low, common people.  They bred a class who worked under them as their agents and who were recruited from amongst the common people of the country, and Irish history has always pointed out the fact that the agent recruited from the common people was much worse towards his own than was the Planter, the man of breeding who came in from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who think that this Budget means a wages policy will surely have learned a lesson from the vulgar, ignorant diatribe of Deputy Corry this evening, a man raised a little bit above the rest of the people who sees red because a local authority employee gets an increase in his salary and the gentlemen from Dublin&mdash;the auditors from the Department of Local Government&mdash;get an increase in their salaries <Col N="714" /> and will, perhaps, as a result of that, get a better pension when they retire. The man who raises himself even one step above the ordinary people here is always harsher on what he regards as the lower classes than the invader ever was with his old family background and breeding.</P>
    <P>What is Deputy Corry always grousing about?  He is grousing because people got an increase in their wages and salaries in our time.  I am glad they got that increase.  Then the Deputy in his ignorance follows up his grouse by saying that we borrowed to pay these increases.  We never borrowed a single penny to pay a civil servant or a local government employee. Neither did we force anybody else to borrow for that purpose.  The Deputy started to say that I knew before I budgeted last year what the Civil Service Arbitration Report was. He then corrected himself because the date was given to him in such a way that even his benumbed head could not fail to understand the position.  The report was published on the 24th May. I budgeted on the 2nd.  Yet I am supposed to have known what the arbitration report was on that date.</P>

      <P>Would anybody but a congenital idiot enter into negotiation and arbitration revealing what he thought the people against him should get and then let them make their claim on that?  Evidently that is the Deputy's idea of negotiation.  I left plenty of money behind me to pay the civil servants.  The increased revenue last year brought in £3,000,000.  That one item brought in enough to pay not merely the civil servants, but the Army, the Gardaí and the teachers as well.  Not one penny piece was required <Col N="715" /> beyond that increase in revenue from the lower taxes that we imposed in our time.  Those lower taxes paid the whole lot.  It may not have paid the arrears but there was £2,000,000 in the kitty for that type of reserve against that sort of emergeny and the odd £600,000 could have been paid out of that for the civil servants, the teachers, the Gardaí and the Army. Not one penny piece of taxation was required.  I realise now, though I did not realise at one time, that that is so much a part of Fianna Fáil policy.  I did not realise it until Deputy Boland, now Minister for Justice, spoke in relation to the matter and lamented that the increase in Civil Service salaries would cost about £700,000.  That was the earlier increase. Do not let Deputy Corry forget that when he gets mad and raves and shows his ignorance over increased emoluments given to people who deserve them.</P>

      <P>The pivot of the Deputy's evocativeness and the burden of his complaint now is that money has to be found for the increases in Civil Service and other salaries last year. The burden of Deputy Boland's complaint at that time was that the increase in Civil Service salaries would <Col N="716" /> cost £700,000 in one year.  He lamented that the total cost of the increases in relation to the Army, the Guards and the teachers had not yet been exposed at that time.  Deputy Boland was making the people apprehensive.  He warned that the total cost was not exposed. He said that local government officials would naturally expect increases. Of course, Deputy Corry would not agree with that.</P>

It was a heavy bill for the people who have to pay, but do not forget that the Statistics Department has provided a chart and that chart shows the increase in the cost of living over the war years when Deputy Corry, through his Government, helped to keep wages pinned at a certain point through the medium of a standstill Order.</P>

      <P>The chart shows that wages stood still.  There is a line showing the cost of living and in between there is a big balloon-shaped space.  That space represents the area that was not filled by an increase in <Col N="718" /> wages to meet the increase in the cost of living.  It represents that so much money was subtracted over the war years from the pockets of the industrial and agricultural workers in this country through the operation of the standstill Order while the cost of living was allowed to soar sky-high.</P>
      <P>The civil servants are, so to speak, in that chart.  They were hit earlier than the ordinary employee.  Their salaries were subject to a standstill earlier than people in outside employment because they were under the thumb of the Government and could be better managed.  The balloon had to swing wider still with regard to what was taken out of their lives.  When the arbitration award came, it was not to make up in one go what they had lost but just what had to be given to them to meet what was required in opposition to the increase in the cost of living in relation to their salaries. That is what happened.  The award was a just award.  I am told that I made no provision for it.  There were bundles of money to meet all Civil Service awards and all other awards, and on the economy side there was enough to pay all back-dating of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry has shown his hand to-night, and he speaks for the Party. He is against wage increases, and that is why he so easily swallows this document. He kept clearly away from what I had spoken of.  He says that I spoke irrelevantly.  At least, I spoke relevantly on this point that the whole idea of the Budget is to stop imports coming into the country.  How can you do that?  Stop people having the means to buy.  You can meet that in two ways.  Decrease their wages. Even the barbarity of Deputy Corry could not get the Party up to that line. The next thing is effectively decrease wages by increasing the cost of what people have to buy.  They must buy food.  Increase that cost by £3,918,000. Let us think of something else.  They still smoke, they still drink a pint and take an odd half glass of whiskey.  Very good, we will take £8,880,000; and all that is going to be found out of pay packets which are small enough as it is.  Deputy Corry would like to have them smaller.  He is mad at the <Col N="719" /> increases that were given.  The Minister says they are not to go up because they have already gone beyond the cost of living.  That is the kernel of the Budget.  That is why we are trying to get £2.4 million out of beer; not to stop people drinking beer, but in the hope that they will go on drinking, and so that their wives will not be able to buy furniture or clothes, and that there will be no imports across the Border.  The bankers will be in great jollification.  The Minister for Finance will stand as a hero with the bankers, and the bankers will still refuse to invest the money of the people in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not be much longer in this House.  The Minister, with his extraordinary capacity for cerebral gymnastics, did not rise to explain the speech he made in the context that the issue was honesty in public life, that the issue was politicians who make false promises.  In that context the Minister for Finance &mdash;then Deputy irresponsible MacEntee &mdash;was making the statement that people were making mendacious statements and whispering that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would hit the poor man's pint and tobacco. That was a foul slander according to him&mdash;something that was not going to happen.  He then gave his classic assurance, in the context of honesty in public life, that there would be no increase in beer and tobacco.  I want to say to the Minister that the impost in this section is going to be felt hardest by the poorer sections of the community.  I do not think that, in honesty, the Minister any more than Deputy Cowan, could deny to the heavy type of manual worker the right <Col N="721" /> to a certain amount of relaxation, whether he works at the docks or on the land, of having a pint of beer or a pint of stout after a hard day's work. I think that the impost he is being asked to bear here is an unfair one.  I have felt, and I have said it when dealing with this Bill before, that if these taxes had to be raised there should surely have been a more equitable way of finding them than by putting this tremendous impost where it will ultimately fall&mdash;on the poorer sections of the community.  But I feel that there is no need for these taxes.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister that, if he had exercised a little judgment and shown a little sanity when dealing with the buoyancy in the yield from this particular tax, he could have made a more equitable distribution and still have got, if he wished it, a reasonable amount of increased revenue.  I am opposed to asking the poor man, as this Budget does, to carry an inequitable share of the burden.  In my view, there are sources from which the Minister could have extracted the money without resorting to this particular type of penal imposition, which I consider to be a hardship on the working-class of this country.  This is a particularly obnoxious tax, considering the appeal made by the Minister and by the Government in general for greater effort and for greater production. We have problems enough in this country without seriously increasing them by this ill-judged and illconsidered taxation of the simplest types and of the more generally used types of beverage.  We hear moans about the denuding of rural Ireland. Will the Minister tell me, when replying, where is the incentive to greater production and greater effort in rural Ireland in this cruel type of assault on the simple luxury-cum-necessity of the people working in those areas?  Is there any incentive when you regard the problem in its reality?  Deputy McGilligan put it quite clearly; the till is no bigger; there will be no addition in the wages of the man; there will be the same wage packet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the plainest statement one could have on mid-Victorian economics.  Decking himself in the voluminous petticoats and skirts of the early Victorian maiden, the Minister for Finance comes into this House with this economic theory and with the crystallised principle that wages are high enough; that the Government have considered that; that they are satisfied that, out of the same pay packet, they can ask the man, first of all, to work harder and produce more and, secondly, that they can ask the housewife to pay more for essentials.  The larder is being effectively, cruelly and unjustifiably raided. At the same time, the Government are, in the main, going to ask the same people to carry the burden by giving to the Exchequer approximately £2.4 million as a result of this additional impost.  It means at least this: the person who is being asked for greater effort by way of national production is going to eat more and to drink less. The position at the present time is that most of them can eat only barely enough, and that very few of them can afford to drink too much.  Such is the situation that will arise under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking again what has altered the position as to the net estimated yield of 1d. on the pint? Is the estimated yield of 1d. on the pint the same for the full year&mdash; £1,500,000?  If it is, how can the Minister justify this increase?  If he is only budgeting for £2.4 million, how can he justify an increase to the extent which he now seeks?  I want the Minister <Col N="723" /> to explain to us if the theory of his Government is further crystallised in this savage imposition&mdash;the theory that the Irish people are living too well, eating too much and drinking too much? Is this a further indication of the fact that Fianna Fáil, as a Government, resent laughing faces and smiling eyes throughout this country?  Is this another pushed-out tentacle of their autocracy shown by putting their hands into the pockets of the people lest they should earn the right, as they should earn it, to enjoy any little extra luxury if they feel like it?  One of the principal luxuries, or avenues of enjoyments for the working man of this country is the local public-house, a bottle of stout and a pint of beer.  This Budget has been cruelly designed to impose constantly in every direction on the poorer sections of the community, in the main.  Is there something wrong about giving the working man of this country and his wife, if she feels like it, the right to drink a little beer or stout and to obtain it at a reasonable price?  I say to the Minister that if the framework of his Budget is to get increased taxation and still keep up consumption, he is cutting off his nose to spite his face.</P>
    <P>It would be infinitely better for him to reconsider the effect of this tax.  I feel that, if he reconsidered the matter and left the pint and the bottle of stout within the capacity of the working man and his wife, if she likes to drink a bottle of stout, the buoyancy of the yield from it might compensate him far better than this savage imposition. We are entitled to ask, on this question, what is the Government's general tendency on the economic view of this country?  Is this part of a forced devaluation?  Is it part of the game to dissipate and to detract from the work done by their predecessors? Is it their policy to convert an expanding country ready to expand further into the bewildered and contracted state which operates in credit and in business to-day?</P>

      <P>To some extent, the discussion on the last section and on the present section, so far, reminds me of beer that is too high.  There is <Col N="724" /> a tremendous lot of froth being poured out.  Deputy Collins made two contributions on this section.  Having spoken in error on Section 9, he again makes, on Section 10, the point, which he adopted in his second attempt from Deputy McGilligan, that the worker has got to pay this increase from the same pay packet.  That was Deputy McGilligan's point, that he had to make provision for the reduction in the food subsidies and make provision for this extra taxation out of the same pay packet.  Both Deputies forgot that the situation has altered.  It has altered as far as the old age pensioner is concerned.</P>

      <P>I read the papers and I see that there are some negotiations whereby one of the congresses of Irish unions and the Federation of Employers are discussing a 12/6 a week rise.  That is in the papers every day.  It appears that something is agreed.  Apparently the Trades Union Congress think it is not enough but there is to be an increase in wages in the near future.

      <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Collins were perfectly wrong when they said that these taxes have to be paid out of the same wage packet.  That is wrong.  There had to be this new Social Welfare Bill.  There had to be those increased allowances.  We were promised that we would have those increased allowances.  In order to make provision for those increased allowances and for increases in wages in different Government services and because of an increase in Government administration, there had to be some new taxation.  The Government decided&mdash;it is the responsibility of a Government so to decide&mdash;to put this increase on the price of beer, this tax on beer, brewed in Ireland.  I think it is, in fact, the beer that really was under discussion in the last section and that we should be discussing now. If this tax was not imposed where was this £2.4 million to come from?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to meet representatives of the licensed trade to discuss this matter of their margin of profits, the anomalies that exist and the grievance they have in regard to the operation of the laws in regard to their licences.  I think that if the Minister does that it may be possible to meet the reasonable case that can be made by representatives of the licensed trade.  Apparently, if one is to do that, if one is to meet what are considered to be the just grievances of the publicans who are a section of the community it would offend Deputy Flanagan.</P>

I sincerely hope that efforts will be continued by the whole trade union movement to increase the wages of all workers so that the restrictions and taxes we have in this Budget and in subsequent Budgets can be met from wages.  The whole trouble, the whole point put forward by Deputy Collins and by Deputy McGilligan prior to that on Section 9, when in fact he was discussing Section 10, was that our present rate of wages would be a reasonable standard without those taxes on beers and tobacco&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to make those two points.  I want to make the case to the Minister that the grievances, which the representatives of the licensed trade feel they have, should be examined, and I think that that request should be supported by every Deputy in this House.  I think it is reasonable for the licensed trade to ask that they should be met and that the point they put forward regarding the margin of profit should be taken into account.  That point, as Deputy Morrissey says, does affect their profits and the value of their licensed premises. I am not one of those people <Col N="735" /> who condemn publicans just because they are publicans.  I think that publicans render a great social service to the community.  I agree with Deputy Collins when he said that they do provide places of entertainment, places where people in the country and in the cities can go and sit down in comfort to enjoy a drink or two in a congenial atmosphere.</P>
      <P>I know that during the last ten years or so publicans, particularly in Dublin, and generally speaking throughout the country, have spent a considerable amount of money on improving their premises and providing all the amenities necessary, not only for our own people but for visitors and tourists.  Any reasonable proposition they put up should be sympathetically examined by the Minister, and I am asking him to do that. I think I can say that that is strictly within the ambit of Section 10.</P>

      <P>The words deflation and inflation have been often bandied about the House in connection with this question.  But I think I have never seen a better example of deflation than Deputy Peadar Cowan during the past two or three months. As I listened to him here during the last ten minutes, my mind reverted to a comment in one of P.G. Wodehouse's novels on the embarrassing spectacle of a man who in a waiting room consented to hold a baby for a strange woman. That was about 4.15 p.m.  He looked at the clock at 6.30, and found that there was no relief, and as his train was going at that hour he wondered if he had done right or whether he would miss the train on which he intended to travel.  The Deputy is holding a lot of babies, cheap tea, sugar, bread and butter.  We sometimes get more vocal and say beer and tobacco, but the Deputy is more concerned about missing the train than about the embarrassing load he has to carry.  I do not think he will find himself in good company if he runs and finds that he still has to hold all the embarrassments he has taken on in the course of this debate.  He talks about a wages policy.  The whole Budget is a negation of a wages policy. <Col N="736" /> The principle and background of the Budget is anti-wages, and the Minister so stated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan spoke of an increase in wages and I want to point out how contrary that is to the spirit of the man who introduced this Finance Bill.  Column 1141 contains a few remarks the Minister made about beer in his Budget statement. At column 1138 there is the preamble:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have given careful thought to this problem over recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He then goes on about foodstuffs and food subsidies and the reduction in these subsidies, meaning an increase in the cost of foodstuffs and, therefore, a reduction in the effective value of wages, and he then moves on to tobacco and beer.  They are all in the same framework&mdash;wages are already too high; the standard is too high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to, but I am entitled to give the background in respect of the beer tax which is to bring in £2,400,000.  Deputy Cowan's counter to that is that we will have increased wages and social benefits. These points were dealt with by the Deputy in a 20-minute or 30-minute speech and I am entitled to reply.  It is said that the beer tax is to bring in £2.4 million, but I have got no answer yet, and I do not think Deputy Cowan has heard any answer, to the point I make.  I was in the Department of Finance for three successive Budgets and the information was always supplied that the yield of 1d. on the pint was £1,250,000 in the first year where the Budget was a month or two late and £1,500,000 in a full year.  This year, the Budget was introduced on 2nd April, so that the full year's tax will come in.  The amount of tax put on should yield £4.5 million, but the Minister <Col N="738" /> says he looks to get a good deal less than that, £2.4 million.  Where is the rest of it?  If it is going to be reduced consumption, the point Deputy Cowan makes about the publicans is a good one.  Their business will go down by the difference represented by a consumption which would yield £4,500,000 and a consumption which will yield £2,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The margin of profit is arrived at in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. Quite clearly, their business is going to drop to the point at which the tax yield instead of £4,500,000 will be less than £2,500,000.  I do not believe that will be the result.  I feel that there is what we discovered in respect of another matter, the petrol business, underestimation of the revenue and that there will be probably £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 more or maybe the whole £4.5 million.  In any event, a considerable sum is going to be taken from the people who will continue to drink beer. The Minister puts it at £2.4 million and Deputy Cowan says, in answer to that, that the pay packet is not going to remain the same.  He also says: &ldquo;Look at the social security benefits.&rdquo; I look at them.  Here is a brief statement which can be read at a glance: &ldquo;Provision for proposals in the Social Welfare Bill and other current services, £3,000,000.&rdquo;  A sum of £1,000,000 is held over for something yet to come&mdash; we do not know what it is &mdash; and there is a sum of £2,000,000 for what is already agreed, and then: Deduct savings on food subsidies, £6,668,000. These are supposed to be less the compensatory social welfare benefits of £2,750,000, leaving a net saving of nearly £4,000,000.  Does Deputy Cowan realise that the Government there give their balance sheet &mdash; that on the food subsidies they are making £4,000,000 and giving away on social insurance benefits £2,000,000?  They have a profit of £2,000,000 from pilfering the people's food.  Deputy Cowan thinks that is all right, and, if he does, I hope he will explain it to his constituents.</P>

      <P>Out of the pay packet, reduced by the £2,000,000 after the social security benefits have been got in and the extra money paid for food, the housewife has to find £2.4 million for husband's beer, the community husband's beer, and under the next section, £5,500,000 for tobacco and under the section already passed, £1,000,000 and some odd thousands for spirits, the whole thing amounting to nearly £8.9 million.  How does the Deputy believe that wage earners are going to be any better off after that? They are having their food increased; they are getting certain benefits and some people are getting some extra compensation; but, over and above, the Government are making a profit of £2,000,000, and then they say: &ldquo;We want another £2.4 million from you on beer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are told that, apart from the benefits given, there is a wages movement on, that the Congress of Irish Unions have agreed to a 12/6 per week increase, or at least have looked for that, and the Trades Union Congress say that that is not enough.  That is a misrepresentation of what the Congress of Irish Unions agreed to.

      <P>Let us assume that there is a demand for wages to meet the increased cost of the beer tax and let us suppose that it is granted.  The Congress of Irish Unions and the people they cater for do not represent all the people who are going to pay, in all the households that have to subscribe the £2.4 millions for beer.  There <Col N="741" /> are many more households than those affected by the Congress of Irish Unions or even the Trade Union Congress.  Have we again to go through that weary process of readjustment that we had to take in hands before, that was left to us before, when we found that the civil servants and everyone under the thumb of the Government had their wages kept down while the cost of living had been allowed to soar?  Is this financing being done in the same way?  We went through that whole business over a period of three years, trying to adjust the thing to the reducing value of money.  Must we do that again because of this beer tax?</P>

Is not that the theme of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy means why not spend at home, the reason is that the manufactured goods are not there and they spend it abroad.  Surely the two themes in the Budget are that we are bringing in too many goods across the frontier and that the people are too well off?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, when you say that the incomes are above the cost of living and you are going to hack incomes, is not that the same thing?  The two things meet when you put a stop to the purchasing power. If we decrease it &mdash; as I suggest we are decreasing it by £13,000,000 &mdash; by raising the cost of food and the things that people will buy, there is £13,000,000 less to spend on the goods that come across the frontier.  Now, £2.4 million for beer is only one part of that, but the whole philosophy of the Budget is in that part, as it is in the other part.</P>

He went as far as he could, while keeping within the rules of order and I believe I am keeping within them, too.  The food subsidies are the point at issue with Deputy Cowan, as well as the beer tax.  Would he dare go to Clontarf to-morrow and say: &ldquo;My views as expressed to you mean that you are going to get social security benefits and you are to pay for them, first by an increase in the price of food and secondly by an increase in the price of the beer that I know the husbands in families are going still to consume?&rdquo;  Will he go and say that to his constituents and ask the people to return him as carrying out his election promises?  Will he say: &ldquo;That is the programme I have this year and I believe that is the programme I had last year&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about the last election, or, I think, the previous election, and the success he had.  Here in my hand is the Budget he was facing them with, here is the table explanatory of the Budget of 1947.  There is a whole heap of taxes in it &mdash; but what are they for?  To pay for subsidies. Taxes were then put on to pay for subsidies.  We took off the taxes and kept the subsidies.  It is wrong to say that anything we did would require any new taxes.  The existing rates of the tax we left would have carried the expenditure we left, including the Civil Service and other demands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If Deputy Cowan votes for this section it means that the purchasing power of the wage earner will be decreased.  Every proposal in the Budget and most of the proposals in the Finance Bill were voted upon and they had the wholehearted support of Deputy Cowan.  He says to the world: &ldquo;We have to pay more for foodstuffs and more for beer, spirits and tobacco&rdquo;.  He says that the people of the country will have to pay more for these commodities and that that will decrease their purchasing power. He says that their wages are not as great as they should be and then he turns to the Labour Party and, in an effort to save our political souls, admonishes the labour trade unions, as he calls them.  On the one hand he decreases the purchasing power of the community and on the other hand he turns to the Labour Party and says that it is the Labour Party's job to get increased wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, the Minister informed us that he desired a very great increase in revenue this year.  We are asked, under this section, to supply him with £2.4 million. I assert again that this is a device to take this money from the pockets of the hard-working and poorer sections of the community.  Beer is not a luxury though one might be inclined to think so as a result of some of the statements <Col N="747" /> made by the present Minister for Finance and other people.</P>
      <P>Beer is the only relaxation which a hard-working man has at the end of his day's work or at the end of the week.  The Minister explained that the reason for the extra tax on beer under the 1947 Supplementary Budget was that foodstuffs must be subsidised to maintain the entire family.  This time, however, a double-edged weapon is used.  Not alone are these taxes reimposed with even greater severity but at the same time the subsidies go by the board.  We feel that the Minister is not at all sure that revenue will be as buoyant as heretofore as a result of this great imposition this year because he has also included in his Budget certain protection for small breweries.  Why did he do that?  Was it not their tacit admission that he was driving the working people of this country to the point when they could no longer afford to buy that simple little luxury.  Deputy Cowan, self-appointed understudy cum stand-in to the Minister, is very interested in the closing hours of public-houses in the city.  I would remind him that the licensed trade in the little towns and villages and at crossroads throughout the country are also concerned about the matter of closing hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Cowan would not wish to confine <Col N="748" /> the selling of beer to public-houses in the city.  The people in the rural areas must be considered also.  However, the publicans in my town and in other parts of my constituency engage in the hackney business to enable them to improve their premises and to provide adequately for the requirements of the people in their areas.  Now they are being saddled with an imposition which they cannot bear.  Very frequently, their families contribute to the social life of the town or village in which they live.  It would be disastrous if those families should now have to emigrate as a result of this imposition.  People who are out cutting turf all day like to stop with their creel of turf on the road and go in for a drink.  People who work for long periods away from their homes rely on the bottle of stout as a substitute for the tea which they would get if they were at home.  These types of people are the hardest hit by this section.  We all realise that people with higher incomes have other interests and enjoy other luxuries.  They are able to go to the golf course, to bridge parties, and so forth.  The small farmer, the farm labourer, the road worker and the people in the rural areas enjoy no such luxuries.  I do not want to be taken as advocating heavy drinking.  I am merely stating that the proposed tax on the bottle of stout and on draught is unfair to a very considerable section of our community.  I may say that a lot of draught is taken.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister of the effect which the increase in the tax on wine had on a previous occasion.  The revenue derived from that tax was not anything like what was expected with the result that the tax had to be remitted.</P>
      <P>Throughout the country, a number of people are employed by bottling stores, bars, and so forth.  These people are now feeling the pinch.  In a bottling concern close to where I live, three men were dismissed in one week.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has any reason to feel <Col N="749" /> too happy about his own record in view of the fact that in his Budget statement he gave the House and the country figures which were subsequently proved by this Party to be completely wrong.  The Minister's conscience should certainly dictate that he should keep his mouth closed. He presented the House and the country with wrong figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To return to what we were discussing, I want to say that in order to secure re-election to this House the present Minister for Finance went to Rathmines and assured his constituents there that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power they would not reimpose the taxes which were imposed under their Supplementary Budget of 1947.  I think I was the first Deputy to refer to that speech in this House and while I was doing so the Minister for Finance interjected: &ldquo;I never said any such thing.&rdquo;  The Minister's statement in Rathmines was quoted in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; and I am sure that the <i>Irish Press</i> would not misquote Deputy MacEntee.  Despite that, Deputy MacEntee calmly stood up in this House and denied that he had ever made that promise to his constituents. However, the Minister was not alone in making that appeal for re-election. Deputy Lemass had to go down to Cork City and make a speech there because the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, told the electors of that city that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office they would reimpose the taxes which they had imposed under their Supplementary Budget of 1947 on the simple luxuries of the people.  That matter was considered of such great consequence in the election campaign in Cork City that it was not enough for any one of the four candidates going forward to reply to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. They had to bring down Deputy Lemass, the present Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, to assure the people of Cork that it was not the policy of Fianna Fáil to reimpose this tax.  In fact, he said: &ldquo;Why should <Col N="750" /> these taxes be reimposed?&rdquo;  That was only 12 months ago.  In this very year, within a few months of coming into power, they went back on all of these statements which they made so as to secure re-election to this House and re-election as Government.  Then they bring in this measure, imposing these taxes.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister, and he will mark my words, that the imposition is of such severity that it will defeat its purpose, that the revenue which he expects will not be secured, because, as Deputy McGilligan has stated to-night, the result will be to prevent people within the limited income group enjoying these little luxuries, and certainly there will be no incentive to increased production, which, we are told, is so vital to the economy of the country.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made the point that he was voting for this tax on beer because he understood that it could be met by increased pay packets and he took Deputy McGilligan up on the point that it would be the <Col N="751" /> same pay packet.  I will expect the Deputy to be just as vociferous in the House when the farmers look for an increased price for their products.  I hope the Deputy will be then as quick to rise to his feet to help every other section in the community who have not regular pay packets and who will be expected to contribute as much for the coming 12 months to the sum of money which we claim the Minister does not require and which he in his optimism expects to get.  Despite the fact that the Minister stated on an occasion which will not be forgotten that the country was on the verge of desperation, he considers that the people are so well off that they can bear the brunt of this imposition and give him the increased amount that he says is required. We do not feel that it is required at all.  We feel that the result of this will be to take from the poorer sections of the community and the hardest working sections what was to them, not a luxury, but a necessity.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there are doctors who advise their patients to take a bottle of stout?  What will be the effect on those people who are convalescing and who need a bottle of beer to nourish them?  Is it a luxury to them?  Is it not a fact that this Government intend to replenish their coffers by taxing these people?  Is Deputy Cowan in agreement with that?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is in agreement with this policy but I do not think that he was in a position to inform his constituents, when he so narrowly escaped defeat at the last election, that it was the intention of his new-found friends to do again what they did in 1947 but this time to do it to a much greater extent, an extent which was never envisaged when the people went to the polls a brief 12 months ago.  We feel that the Government, in imposing this tax and the other taxes in this Budget, are doing something for which they have no <Col N="752" /> mandate, for which there is no necessity whatever, which can result in decreasing employment, depressing the incentive to produce more and, as has been said by many Deputies, which bears particularly heavily on the section of the community that are least able to bear it.</P>

      <P>We have listened to most extraordinary statements here in regard to Section 10.  One would think the Irish people lived on porter.  We have been told how their pockets will be rifled, how their children will be without bread, their wives made miserable because the price of the pint has gone up by 3d.  That is the level at which this subject has been discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what is the foundation for those statements. It is proposed to collect £2,400,000 of increased tax on beer.  How many people in this country drink beer? Would I be exaggerating if I said the number of beer drinkers ranges between 600,000 and 700,000?  Let us take the least favourable figure from my point of view.  Assume that it is 600,000.  Six hundred thousand people between them pay an additional £2,400,000 a year.  Divide the £2,400,000 by 600,000 and you get an average increase of 80/- per year per beer drinker &mdash; a little over 1/- a week, less than you pay at the present moment for a packet of cigarettes &mdash; about 1/6 per week.  The Irish people are asked to pay 1/6 per week per beer drinker&mdash; put it that way &mdash; in order to enable us to pay the increased old age pension which we carried through last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an addition. They are asked to pay it in order to provide them with the new Social Welfare Bill, in order to pay the increased salaries of all the public officials which have flowed from the fact that the principle of arbitration was accepted by our predecessors when they appointed an arbitrator. Not merely did they appoint an arbitrator but, as Deputy Corry has informed the House, they gave the <Col N="753" /> arbitrator a headline which he could not disregard when he was considering the claims of the civil servants. We are asking them to pay this in order that we might meet the losses on Córas Iompair Éireann, the company which they nationalised, having first of all bankrupted it.  We are asking them to pay 1/6 more per week in respect of porter and stout in order to enable us to provide the needs for national defence.  Deputy Dillon, speaking on the Estimate for Defence the other day, said that we should have an Army of 12,000 men.</P>

      <P>This section has been attacked here as if we had some sort of sadistic passion to gratify in imposing the tax.  We are imposing the tax for a very simple reason.  Deputy McGilligan quoted from the Table Explanatory of the Budget.  Perhaps I would be permitted to follow him and to point out facts which apparently Deputies who have been speaking have overlooked.  On the basis of last year's taxes the total revenue, tax and non-tax, of this State would amount to £86,000,000 odd.  On the basis of the Estimates for the Supply Services and the demands for the Central Fund Services, the total expenditure to be provided for would amount to £107,000,000.  We are deducting from that &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo;, which are the Supply Services which are borrowed for, and they amount to £9,000,000.  That represents a net figure which has to be found out of revenue of £98,679,000, as against a total revenue of £86,581,000.  Then we have had to add £3,000,000 for the Social Welfare Scheme and for &mdash; I want to be quite frank &mdash; any unforeseen contingencies which will have to be met or for other purposes which we know may arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are unforeseen because we cannot tell at present what precisely they are going to be, but being practical men of experience, we know that things which are not foreseen will inevitably arise during the year and, as I have said, will have to be provided for.  That gives you a total sum of £101,679,000 to be found as against an existing revenue of £86,581,000.  There is a gap of over £15,000,000 to be closed. I should like to tell the House, if I may, <Col N="755" /> how that gap has arisen.  It has arisen quite simply.  There were, first of all, the losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann last year which were not provided for in last year's Budget and which have to be provided for in this.</P>

      <P>There is then the Social Welfare Bill to which I have already referred.  There is the cost of the increase in the old age pensions granted last year, which were promised by Deputy Norton but for which no provision was made, and for which we are providing this year out of revenue. There is the increase in the remuneration of civil servants, members of the Garda Síochána, national teachers, secondary teachers, vocational teachers and the officers and men of the Defence Forces, none of which was provided for last year but for which we are providing this year out of revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are increased grants for public health authorities which were given last year arising out of the letter which the then Minister for Health, Deputy Costello, issued to local authorities but again for which no provision had been made in the Budget.  There is the interest on the Marshall Aid Loan which did not arise last year but which becomes payable in respect of the last half of the current financial year, amounting to £600,000. Then there is the annuity on the voted capital services to which our predecessors committed us last year and for which we have to provide this year. There are these and other incidental expenses arising out of the Estimates. That in the main is how this gap of £15,000,000 has been created.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has said that we must discuss this tax in the background of the Budget.  There is the background of the Budget &mdash; £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 expenditure, commitments into which you entered last year but for which the Coalition made no provision whatever and which we have to recover out of taxation this year.</P>

      <P>Our political skins will soon be tested and so will yours. There is one thing the people are getting this year and that is an honest Budget.  We are not running away from it.  When Deputy McGilligan introduced his Budget on the 2nd May, last year, he knew that that Budget would not stand a moment's examination. Rather than face the debate here on the General Resolution in the Dáil, the then Taoiseach rushed up to Arus an Uachtaráin and begged the President to give him a dissolution on the 7th May.  That is what happened Mr. McGilligan's Budget last year.  That is not going to happen in regard to this Budget.  The people know what this Budget is for.  They know what services we are providing for and they know why we have to impose this additional taxation on certain commodities &mdash; beer and spirits amongst others.</P>
      <P>I want to say again that I think the discussion on this matter has been on a lower level than it has been my sad experience to witness for many a long year in this House.  We heard Deputy O'Sullivan following in the footsteps of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, that idolater of the porter-barrel, who has now been taken into the bosom of Fine Gael.  We have got a new god amongst the Fine Gael Party.  May I say this in regard to the suggestion made by Deputy Cowan?

I will not receive Fine Gael politicians masquerading as publicans or receive them under the tutelage and guidance of a person whom I know to be just merely the tool or instrument of the Fine Gael Party, the man who did his utmost to try to ensure that the Fine Gael Party would remain in control of this country after the last general election.</P>

I would not trust them to give an honest account of what would transpire at the discussion.  Deputy Cowan has disclosed in this House to-night that a document purporting to be the minute of a discussion which he had with certain gentlemen had been submitted to him and that he had to strike out from the record a statement suggesting that he had given certain pledges and promises to these particular individuals.

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to a statement which I made in Rathmines. I did make that statement in Rathmines. I made it in respect of the Budget of that year because I was fool enough to believe that Deputy McGilligan would not stoop to the depths of deception to which he stooped when he presented this Dáil, on the 2nd May, 1951, with a statement which was false and misleading in many essential particulars. I could not believe that Deputy McGilligan would mislead the House and the country for political purposes in the manner in which he did in order to bring in an electioneering Budget.  Therefore I assumed that there was no necessity to impose any additional taxation beyond the additional taxation which he had imposed himself in last year's Budget &mdash; because he did impose taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Deputy, who has been groaning and wailing to-night about what we did, imposed taxation to the tune of £1,000,000 in last year's Budget.  What is more, he has tried to give the impression to the House that he imposed that taxation unnecessarily.  He had been speaking about £2,000,000 he handed over to me.  There was no such sum.  If he had £2,000,000 in hand why did he find it necessary to impose £600,000 additional taxation on petrol and £400,000 additional taxation on death duties?  However, as I said, when I spoke in Rathmines it never entered into my head that a person holding the responsible position which Deputy McGilligan held as Minister for Finance even in a Coalition Government, no matter how much they were at sixes or sevens, would have so deliberately misled the House and the country as to the real state of the <Col N="759" /> public finances.  Therefore I assumed that it was not necessary to impose any additional taxation.  That was last year, however.</P>
    <P>We have a problem to face this year &mdash;the problem of finding £15,000,000 to close up the gap between revenue and probable expenditure.  Am I to say to the workers of the country: &ldquo;I will do what the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did when in office? I will reduce the old age pensions.  I will tax your sugar and your tea.&rdquo; They put positive taxation on these commodities.  Tea and sugar were not subsidised over the years when Cumann na nGaedheal taxed these articles.</P>

      <P>I will tax beer and I will tax spirits rather than tax tea and sugar and the necessaries of life.  When they were not subsidised the Cumann na nGaedheal Government taxed them. When the prices of tea and sugar were <Col N="760" /> unsubsidised, they levied taxes on them.  We removed them.  When Cumann na nGaedheal were in office they thought that the prices were not high enough even though they were economic prices.  Therefore they increased the tax on them.  I will not put myself in the situation that I will allow any trade or profession to go scot-free from taxation if I have to tax the ordinary working-class people. With that reservation, I am prepared to meet the representatives of the licensed trade on Deputy Cowan's assurance that they will come to me as representatives of their trade and not as representatives of the political element in the trade.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that he made this statement in Rathmines, but in certain ignorance.  He has admitted now that he made the statement.  When I first brought the matter up here, he stated categorically in this House that he never said any such thing, and that is on the record.  Now he states: &ldquo;I made that statement, but I was wrong.&rdquo;</P>
