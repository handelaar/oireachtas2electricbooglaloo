      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment last night I was indicating that Deputy Costello, though he made a very able and eloquent speech and one which we would all commend for its industry and eloquence, was in the position of a very able counsel handling the rottenest brief that ever was handed to a member of the Bar. The reason for that is the fact that he was trying to put across to the House a case which was decried and disowned by his own Minister for Finance when he was in office.  I indicated last night that Deputy McGilligan, 12 months ago, had given the same summary of the economic and financial position of the nation to-day as the Minister for Finance did last night.  I indicated also that Deputy McGilligan emphasised the fact that our balance of payments is so unsatisfactory&mdash;or was so unsatisfactory when he introduced his Budget statement last year&mdash;that, unless it improved, corrective measures would be called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There we have a very clear indication that Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance realised fully the serious economic and financial position of the nation.  But unfortunately, for political reasons, he was not prepared in his Budget statement or in the Budget which he introduced at that time to take measures to improve the position. Neither were his fellow Ministers prepared to emphasise the very serious points which he had raised.  In fact, the entire jazz-band of the inter-Party Government was concentrated in all its sounding fury on drowning the small tin whistle of the Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government.  I suppose that at that time the Government were actuated by a feeling that <Col N="2039" /> the best political card to play was to keep on emphasising their claim that the nation was never so prosperous in living memory and that nothing but prosperity faced our people.  They knew perfectly well, just as Deputy McGilligan knew, that the external balance of payments was going against this nation.  They knew perfectly well that, as Deputy McGilligan emphasised, the country even at that time was living far beyond its means.  They were not prepared, however, to take any measures to improve the position.</P>
    <P>Now, when a programme of effort is being outlined for the nation with a view to improving the position, they raise a howl of protest.  I would strongly urge the Minister for Finance and the Government not to be deterred or intimidated by the wails of the lost souls at the other side of the table. They are not concerned about the future development of the nation; they are simply howling for the jobs they have lost.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves seriously whether there is anything wrong with the programme of development which has been outlined by the Government in the speeches of the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and the other members of the Government.  What is that programme but a programme of intensive development of our resources?  Deputy Costello for some reason or other thinks that he can formulate a policy by brooding over certain set phrases, such as &ldquo;increased capital investment&rdquo;, the necessity for &ldquo;a double Budget&rdquo; and all those other catch words which mean nothing. For a long time yesterday he talked about a double Budget as something which would save the whole financial and economic position of the nation. We all know that the double Budget means very little.  Speaking as a layman, I think it is an undesirable way in which to present the Book of Estimates. Capital and current items of expenditure can always be clearly identified, and I think it should be the function of the Government, when budgeting at the beginning of the financial year, to decide how much or how little to borrow and their decision <Col N="2040" /> should be based upon the financial and economic needs of the nation.  They should not be put into a sort of strait-jacket and compelled to borrow a certain specified sum and to raise other sums from taxation.</P>
    <P>Facing the future as it is our duty to face it when we are voting a considerable amount of money to carry the nation over the next three or four months, it is well to consider what are the most urgent needs of the moment, and I think that every serious-minded Deputy will acknowledge that the most urgent need of the moment is increased agricultural and industrial output.  So far as agricultural output is concerned, I pointed out last night that it has been steadily declining over the past three or four years.  Some Deputies of the Fine Gael Party find it difficult to believe that, because they have been so mesmerised by the audacious assertions of their Minister for Agriculture that they were led to believe that there had been an enormous expansion in agricultural output, but the figures are clear and cannot be disputed.</P>
    <P>If we take 100 as the basic figure for agricultural output in 1939, we find that it rose by 12 per cent. in 1945.  The index figure for the value of net agricultural output in 1945 was 112, including turf, but, if we leave out turf, we find that the basic figure for agricultural output in 1945 was 110.5, and, in 1950, after all the progress made by the inter-Party Government and by Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, the figure had gone down to 97.8. That was the sum total of the achievement of the inter-Party Government in regard to agricultural production. They forced the net output of agriculture down to a level of 3 per cent. below the 1938 level, in spite of all the talk about scientific development, increased use of fertilisers and all the other boasts made here about agricultural expansion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was forced last week to go to the Statistics Office and try to get the figures of agricultural output revised, so as to prove that he had not been as great a failure in his position as Minister as these objective figures indicated.  He put up to the Statistics <Col N="2041" /> Office the proposition that account should be taken not only of the volume of agricultural output as sold off the farm but of live stock on the farm, of changes in the number of live stock on the farm at the end of the year as compared with the beginning of the year.  Having found the figure representing those changes, he had it added to the figure for gross agricultural output. It is an extraordinary thing that the inter-Party Government should claim credit not for what was produced by the agricultural industry in this country, but for what was produced in the United States, in Australia, and in Asia.  Gross agricultural output, as the wording implies, is gross agricultural output, with imported feeding stuffs, fertilisers and all other imported raw materials used in agricultural production added in.  In other words, Deputy Dillon, in an attempt to bolster up his failure in regard to agricultural policy, sought to take credit for the £6,000,000 worth of maize which was imported in 1950.</P>
    <P>I have always tried to be absolutely fair and objective in dealing with matters of this kind and when Deputy Dillon came into the House and suggested that account should be taken of the changes in the number of live stock when computing agricultural output, I considered that some case could be made for that proposal and I, therefore, thought it desirable to seek from the Statistics Office the relevant figures for the net volume of agricultural output, with the changes in the number of live stock taken into account in calculating it.  I have here the figures I received.  Taking 1938 as 100, the official index figure for net agricultural output, adjusted for changes in live stock and excluding turf-therefore, giving Deputy Dillon all the advantages&mdash;in 1940, was 102; in 1941, 98; 1942, 107; 1943, 109; 1944, 107; 1945, 111.4, and 1950, 100; which was back to the 1938 level.  On Deputy Dillon's own basis, on the index figure calculated according to his own suggestion, we find the net result of Deputy Dillon's and the inter-Party Government's agricultural policy.  I stress this because I feel that there is an urgent need for reform and very far-reaching reform in general agricultural <Col N="2042" /> policy and that cannot be done unless we take note of the mistakes of the past three or four years.  We must ask ourselves where we went wrong and I think that it can be very readily acknowledged that our first step in the wrong direction was when the Minister for Agriculture in the last Government set out to drive the farmers away from tillage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit to you very respectfully that I in my speech, with your kind forbearance, enlarged at some length on the balance of payments problem, and pointed out that one of the ways in which we might be able to solve it was by expanding agricultural production?  That, I think, would put some large part of what the Deputy is saying in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  I take it that every Opposition Deputy who is to speak on this matter will be entitled to enlarge upon it to the same extent as Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to allow the Deputy to enlarge upon agricultural policy.  I will allow him to proceed to a certain extent on the general policy of the <Col N="2043" /> Government.  I cannot allow him to enlarge in that way because some other Deputy may want to go into detail regarding the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Local Government, and the whole lot would be raised for discussion.  The Deputy may glance over the matter, but I do not want him to go over details of the whole policy such as the change over from cattle production to tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of doing so, but it is my duty to indicate that this nation can make no progress whatever unless the balance be redressed, first of all in favour of agriculture, and, secondly, within the agricultural industry in favour of more production from the land.  Is it not true that although we are proposing to spend £94,000,000 the position at the present time in this agricultural country is that any young man who wants to make a good living will naturally turn his steps from the land because he would earn more elsewhere?  Any man who has money to invest in the development of our nation and who wants at the same time to make a substantial profit will turn from agriculture to commerce and industry.  Is it not also true that any man who decides to engage in agriculture, to put his money in the land, will find that he will get a bigger, a better and an easier return by growing Deputy Dillon's favourite crop, grass, than by cultivating the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an appalling situation which has driven tens of thousands of people away from the land.  It has created a problem of unemployment in our cities and of under-employment on the land and it has denuded the rural areas. Should it not be the first task of our Government to set themselves deliberately to tilt the scale in favour of more intensive agriculture?  I believe that the scale is being tilted and deliberately tilted against intensive production on the land.  While we have been following a policy which was believed to be a policy of imported cheap feeding-stuffs leading to increased export of eggs, bacon and other products to <Col N="2044" /> Great Britain, we have had instead a position where those feeding-stuffs were not available and after our farmers had been discouraged from producing feeding-stuffs for their live stock and poultry the imported food for them was not available and there was a retraction in the total volume of agricultural output.  The policy of the inter-Party Government during their three years of office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin knows that I supported the inter-Party Government's agricultural policy for the first year while it was getting a trial but I voted against the Agriculture Estimate in the second year the inter-Party Government were in office and again in the third year.  In the clearest possible way I indicated by my vote that they had failed and, having turned away from a sound agricultural policy, were pursuing a line which had driven agricultural workers off the land, would reduce the volume of agricultural output and would mean eventually the economic decay and ruin of our little nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was all personal spite. Does everyone not know that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said from time to time that the Deputy reminded me of a new-born infant in his intellectual capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pay much attention to what the Deputy says anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is altogether wrong to suggest that any Deputy in this House would be actuated by personal spite.  I have never shown or indicated any ill-will towards any Deputy during the 13 years I have spent in this House but I have been prepared to fight against any policy which I considered wrong.  Deputy Davin, on the other hand, who claims to represent the agricultural workers, was prepared, in order to keep a certain Party in power and to keep another Party out, <Col N="2045" /> to support a grass policy which drove tens of thousands of agricultural workers out of agriculture and out of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the policy of Deputy Davin&mdash;I will not mention Deputy Dillon at all&mdash;whose Government advocated one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough, the number of cows went down by 1 per cent. in the last year of the inter-Party Government's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is keeping exclusively to the details of agricultural policy.  I endeavoured to warn him off that ten minutes ago and he is still at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it necessary that Deputy Davin should have the percentage figures of the reduction in output, and if you will allow me I will give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this nation is to make progress we must endeavour to break the bottlenecks which hold up expansion and I think it is an appalling thing that the Government that talked of one more cow has presented a position in which the number of in-calf heifers was down by 33,000 or 29 per cent. of the total.  The picture of a reduction of 500,000 in the acreage of tillage presents an indication of agricultural decay which must be arrested if our nation is to make progress. Deputy Davin is very anxious that I should get away from dealing too much with his support of a grass policy.  I was not dealing with agriculture at all. I was dealing with a grass policy.  It was a grass policy instead of an agricultural policy which Deputy Davin supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the late years of the administration of the inter-Party Government there was a great deal of talking or boasting about the ability of that Government to avoid increasing taxation.  Any Government, I would say, can avoid increasing taxation for an indefinite period if they are prepared to sink deeper and deeper in debt.  In three years I think £76,000,000 was added to the national debt.  If a Government can go on borrowing without any ill results either to the national economy or to the people generally it is right to go on borrowing. Unfortunately there are evil results, a fact which Deputy McGilligan pointed out to us last year in his Budget statement.</P>
      <P>On that occasion he mentioned the evil results of extensive borrowing to meet current expenditure, and he referred to the serious situation which had arisen, according to him, last year, but which had been arriving for some time previous, in which there was too much money attracting too many imports; in other words the policy of extensive borrowing for ordinary revenue purposes or for purposes of current expenditure had resulted in inflation.  An increase in the volume of unnecessary imports was the inevitable result of a policy of spending freely without raising the money in the ordinary way.  It is very clear that that policy was unsound, as Deputy McGilligan admitted before he went out of office, and it is just beating the air for Deputy Costello or any other member of the Opposition to claim that it is undesirable to seek to correct that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech last night, Deputy Costello indicated that agricultural output should be increased and that the agricultural industry would make progress if there was more capital investment in that industry. Like many of his supporters, he likes to dwell very extensively upon this question of an increase in capital investment, but during the whole period that the inter-Party Government was in power I found very little willingness on the part of the inter-Party Government to invest any money in agriculture with the exception of the <Col N="2047" /> comparatively small amount which was invested in land reclamation.  The whole country was completely bam-boozled with the cry about £40,000,000 for land reclamation.  Of course, there was never any intention of spending that £40,000,000.  At the rate at which expenditure was incurred on land reclamation, that £40,000,000 would not be spent in 50 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently during the period that Government was in power at every available opportunity I stressed the necessity and the desirability of putting more money into agriculture, of giving the young people, particularly in agriculture, some help to start out and become the owners of live stock in order to improve their position.  I have always thought it wrong that young farmers should live for half their lives without owning anything and merely being dependents upon their parents.  I thought a forward move should be made and I did hope that it would be made.  It was not made and every appeal I put forward&mdash;and I had to make many an appeal to the inter-Party Government for increased facilities for agricultural development&mdash;was turned down and treated with absolute contempt.</P>
      <P>Yet to-day, when the inter-Party Government is out of power, Deputy Costello comes into this House and says he is all for increased investment in agriculture, for providing increased funds to help farmers.  Why did he not do it when he was in office?  Why did he allow farmers to be driven out of the production of cattle?  That is a question I would like some members of what was at the outset the inter-Party Government, but which developed in the later stages into a cocktail Party, to tell us why they were unwilling to make available to agriculture the necessary facilities during their years of office.</P>

We must go a great deal further so as to help the policy not only in regard to agriculture but in regard to industry and to every branch of our national development. The policy must be one of incentive; incentive to the businessman to improve his business, incentive to the manufacturer who wants to extend his factory and incentive to the farmer who wants to enlarge the output of his farm.  The incentives at the present time for the best form of development are not sufficient, and they have got to be improved.  It pays better to grow grass than to till. If one is carrying on grass farming it pays better to keep the right stock than to keep cows.  These are matters <Col N="2049" /> which have got to be corrected, one by one, until we reach the stage when we can go forward vigorously and with determination.  In this connection, I want to inform Deputy Morrissey that his Party have been engaged in a campaign to prevent increased agricultural production.  An alleged member of the Bar has been campaigning down in my constituency trying to discourage farmers against growing beet.  Unfortunately for himself, the individual in question knows very little about agriculture because he went down to a mountainous district where no beet had ever been grown and where there was no likelihood of beet ever being grown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can name a few others who have been giving that advice, and they do not belong to the Fine Gael Party.  The Deputy, who is an experienced grower of beet, would know all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have grown beet since 1925, and I will continue to grow it despite the advice of the Fine Gael Party.  I feel there is a national obligation on us farmers to grow beet whether or not we are satisfied with the price.  We are obliged to provide the foodstuffs necessary for our people, and we must also endeavour to grow the greatest possible acreage of wheat. I feel it is well to make it clear at the outset that a very narrow circle of the Fine Gael Party has been campaigning against the growing of wheat and beet in this country.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to campaign in every possible way for an increased acreage of both crops.  I am prepared to undertake, and I have, in fact, undertaken to increase the acreage of both wheat and beet on my own farm. If Deputy Morrissey wants to suggest that people outside the Fine Gael Party are campaigning against the growing of beet, he is completely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>He conveyed the impression that his idea of the Minister for Finance was that of a kind of a cunning old rogue who had reached the doddering stage and that the House was to be on its guard against him, even though he was senile.  That, however, has nothing to do with the Vote on Account.  Deputy Cogan seems to be very concerned about the agricultural community.  Having regard to the fact that agriculture is the principal industry in the country, that we all profess to be deeply interested in its welfare and in that of those who are engaged in it, I think that, on an occasion such as this, instead of trying to score politically we should get down to a broad approach to the whole problem of putting agriculture in a sound and safe position.  We should take it from the position we see it in and improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A call has gone from the Government several times that production must be increased.  That, presumably, includes industrial production as well as agricultural production but industrial production has not by any means the same volume as agricultural production. The emphasis, I take it, should be on agriculture then.  I do not agree with Deputy Cogan that the way to increase agricultural production is by taking the foundation stones from under it and encouraging the people who would be most helpful <Col N="2053" /> in agriculture, the young able-bodied men, to leave the country or seek some other occupation, either within or outside the country.</P>
    <P>It might do no harm if we gave a glance over the position to-day and the position last year.  Whatever fault the inter-Party Government may have had, I think that drainage, both arterial and local authorities' drainage, coupled with land reclamation, was one of the greatest drives to increase agricultural production and to put farmers in a sound position that was ever undertaken by any Government in this country.  I think that holding down arterial drainage and reducing by roughly 50 per cent. local authorities' drainage, which was one of the most beneficial Acts for the rural landowner, were two deadly blows to increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I think the Government, in allowing the cost of fertilisers to be increased from £5 to £7 per ton, deprived many small farmers from taking advantage of fertilisers.  I think that is also very, very wrong.  That is the most puzzling feature of the present Government who always parade themselves as being an out and out Irish Party, a Republican Party, but the Republican Party has been dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to come back to hear one point which is in relation to credit for Irish farmers.  One thing I cannot understand is why the Fianna Fáil Government left a vast sum of sterling assets in England, assets which were built up during the war years and which were the result of the sale of Irish agricultural produce.  That sum of sterling assets which was built up, principally as a result of the sale of agricultural produce from this country to Britain, was left in England at a ½ per cent. and was denied to the Irish farmers for the development of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> We brought back quite a considerable sum of that and proceeded to put the land of Ireland in as good order as we possibly could in the time we had at our disposal.  We now find that, if the Irish farmer wants a loan, the Government which is prepared to give the cash realised from the sale of Irish agricultural produce to the British at ½ per cent, now increases the rate for loans to farmers under a new scheme by the Agricultural Credit Corporation from 4½ to 5 per cent.  In other words, money realised from the sale of agricultural produce of the land of this country was left to England for whatever the British Government wished to do with it at a ½ per cent. but when our farmers want money from an Irish Government they must pay 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the little canter which the Minister for Finance took across the water lately and the fact that he has been sending warm messages of sympathy to Mr. Butler in the middle of his Budget, I ask myself why was this country freed at all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be unjust to the Minister for Finance in whatever he tried to do at that time and I think it would be cheap not to give him whatever credit that is coming to him.  Agriculture at the present time is suffering from under-capitalisation, emigration or movement away from the land.  The very best of our population are being forced to flee from the land.  We seem to have been sorely afflicted with a number of cranks <Col N="2055" /> offering free cures for every possible ill the farmer has and the result is anything but encouraging.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one other point. The Minister for Finance in his speech in presenting the Vote on Account mentioned forestry, a particular Department that was under my control during the inter-Party Government.  I want to accuse him of misleading the House when he says that £231,000 of a reduction in this year's Estimate was due to stockpiling by me on behalf of forestry.  A certain amount of stockpiling did take place.  I want to ask a question in that connection.  At a time when the Korean situation seemed to threaten a world conflict, was it wrong for me to lay in a supply of fencing materials to carry the Forestry Department over a number of years? I might ask another question.  Was it wrong for the Minister for Agriculture to bring in the famous fertilisers which the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to make out did not exist until they were compelled to produce the figures?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wrong in piling up the stocks.  Now it seems that my chief crime was having used the stocks that were there.  Under the Fianna Fáil Government, forestry was put on the long finger, and very much on the long finger.  Not alone were there no stocks of fencing materials when I took over, but there was not even a policy nor a desire to use the waste ground of our country for the planting of trees which would provide us with timber resources and give employment to some of our people.  I asked the Minister for Lands a question about the supply of barbed wire, rails, and so forth which he has on hands now.  If the <Col N="2056" /> world crisis has passed, the Minister for Finance can now direct the Minister for Lands to dispose of that material.  He can make between £15 and £20 profit per ton on the barbed wire which I left him, and he can make from £1 13s. to £1 16s. on the rails I left there for fencing.  Let the Minister sell out now and cash in on his stocks of these goods if the crisis has passed.  If the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance can assure themselves that the shortage of supplies of these materials, which are so essential to the forestry industry, has now eased off, then he can do what he likes with the supplies which he has on hands.  If the Minister tries to reduce the planting programme by disposing of young plants&mdash;as he tried in 1941-42 to burn some 12,000,000 plants that were in the nurseries rather than plant them out&mdash;while I am not in a position to stop him from doing so, at least the people of Ireland will be told of the vandalism that is going on.</P>
      <P>I want the members of the Labour Party and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to note that the reduction of £71,000 in the Vote for Forestry comes under sub-head C (2), paragraphs 2 and 3: Labour.  The reference is page 250 of the Book of Estimates, Vote 48, paragraphs 2 and 3 of sub-head C (2).  There is a total reduction in labour there of £71,000&mdash;yet the Minister blandly informed Deputy MacBride last night, when he was speaking on the same subject, that there was to be no reduction in labour or in the planting programme this year. However, we shall have more to say on that matter when the Vote comes up for discussion by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in the Land Commission Vote is tantamount to a reduction.  Do not forget that though in sub-head I there has been an increase of approximately £20,000 or £25,000&mdash;a small sum&mdash;it is only now that the effects of my revocation of the close-down Order imposed on the Land Commission by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1941 are being felt and that the accumulated stocks of land, which is the raw material of the Land Commission, are coming to hand and must be developed.  Of late, instead of disposing <Col N="2057" /> of that land to the particular type of person for whom it was acquired, the Land commission, apparently, have got instructions not to divide the land but to hold it as a money-making asset for the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a call for increased production.  There is only one way to increase production and that is to give the farmers every incentive to produce food for this country.  I have in mind, in particular, that section of the population whom we describe as &ldquo;farmers' sons&rdquo;. There is no doubt that there has been an increased flight from the land by farmers' sons since the change of Government last June.  If the policy <Col N="2058" /> of the present Government drives the very best of our young manhood from the land into different occupations within the country or to emigrate I think the Minister for Finance and every Minister of the Government must have their tongue in their cheeks when they ask the farmers to produce more food.  If we deprive the farming community and the land of Ireland of the very best help, namely, the farmers' sons, it is absolute hypocrisy to ask for increased production.  There is only one way to bring about increased production and that is to give an incentive to the people engaged on the land to do so.  One way would be to give them the best possible remuneration that can be afforded within the economic framework of the country for their work and their labour.  I hear Deputies from both sides of the House talking like children who do not know the first thing about what happened.  After all, what happened to the land, from which we must ask production, during the economic war years?  It suffered a blow from which it has not yet recovered.  As soon as the ill-effects of the economic war cleared up the world war broke out and the farmers were forced to draw on the reserves of fertility of their land during the war years in order to feed the population of this country.  Undoubtedly, it was good to have that fertility to draw on.  I attach no blame whatever to the then Government or to anybody else for the fact that during the war years the fertility of our land was alarmingly diminished because the land of this country would be of no use to us if it was not fit, in an emergency, to produce the food for our people which we could not then obtain from abroad. Nevertheless, there should certainly have been a stocktaking of the position when the war ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If such a stocktaking were made it would reveal that the fertility of the best land of the country had been depleted during the war years and that it is essential to make every effort to restore that fertility without delay if we want to put ourselves in a sound position again.  The restoration of the fertility of the land of this country <Col N="2059" /> after the economic war and the world war is as important a matter as an army or a defence force or anything else.  Although Deputy Cogan supported Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture for three years, when it suits him he turns him down and decries his efforts to restore the fertility of our lands.  It is absolutely essential to undertake the work of restoring the fertility of our lands because the value of the land of this country depends not just on the fact that it is land but on its capacity to produce crops and food.  By allowing the price of fertilisers to rocket sky-high, the Government are not going the correct way about restoring the fertility of our lands.  By allowing the young men who have hitherto worked on the land to go off the land is no way to increase production.  By increasing the charge for land, by cutting down credit and by footling with this very important industry in this country is no way to encourage increased production. One would think from the way in which the Government is acting that it was out deliberately to stop production because the first thing they did&mdash;their seats were scarcely warm after the change of Government&mdash;was to try to raise scares.  These scares had an immediate effect.  A lot of young men thought they were real and decided that it was better to leave the sinking ship while the going was good. I, for one, failed to convince them that the whole thing existed only in the imagination of the Minister for Finance.  The result was that they fled the country in fear and terror.  If the Minister doubts my word I can give him the names of at least 17 young men from my constituency who left the country, two of whom at least had come back from work in England during the period of office of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Finance wants to live up to the responsible <Col N="2060" /> position he holds, he might treat serious matters seriously and cease acting the damp squib.  When the Minister for Finance gets up and makes such speeches, people down the country do not know that he is gibing sneering, and smiling, and that there is no sincerity in the whole thing.  The unfortunate aspect of the matter is that such statements, coming from a man who occupies the important position that he fills, can do untold damage.  If we want to increase production, we must stop such foolish announcements, try to put the land into some shape, facilitate farmers who need capital for stock and machinery, and deal with what is in one sense our greatest blessing and in some cases our greatest curse, namely, the heavy rainfall which causes flooding.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should know that between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 acres of very good land are producing next to nothing because they are either waterlogged and subject to periodic flooding or to permanent flooding.  The slashing of expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act at one fell blow by 50 per cent. has certainly done more to stop increased production than any other factor.  I do not expect that the Minister can fully appreciate the disastrous effect of flooding.  As a matter of fact, nobody can, except a person who has been reared on the land, and who has suffered some heartburning from flooded lands.  If there is any farmer in the Minister's Party&mdash;and it is significant that there is not a single farmer worthy of the name in the Party&mdash;he knows of these problems, and the Minister might be well advised to have a talk with him and find out the magnitude of the trouble, and the importance of draining off the water from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are sincere in talking about increased production, one of our first steps should be to tap these 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres of land which the land reclamation scheme, the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the Arterial Drainage Acts were specially designed to bring into first-class production. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that included in <Col N="2061" /> that area of land&mdash;probably half of it &mdash;you have some of the richest alluvial land in Europe.  If the Minister wants a source of increased production, which I realise is absolutely necessary if our balance of payments is to be kept in a state of equilibrium&mdash;I do not ask for a favourable balance&mdash;one of the ways to secure that is to go back on these Estimates, restore the cuts that have been made in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the arterial drainage schemes and give every assistance and help in the reclamation of land.  The bringing into production of 2,000,000 acres of land is something which could be a lasting monument to the Administration of our time, no matter what Government took part in it or pushed it ahead.  The fact that this land is scattered in small areas all over the country should not be a retarding factor; it will add up in the course of time.</P>
    <P>If we are serious in calling for increased production that is one of the ways to secure it.  The other way is to give farmers, who are in need of them, loans at a low rate of interest. If we can allow the British to have £160,000,000 accumulated as the result of sales of our surplus products over there during the war, at ½ per cent., surely you should be equally generous with our own farmers?  Why should we give Marshall Aid, or should I call it MacEntee aid, to England?  It seems a strange thing, an incomprehensible thing, that the very Party that blames us for repatriating some of that money can afford to leave the balance over there at ½ per cent. but the very moment money is required by fresh blood amongst our farmers for the development of this country, not alone is the borrower charged a rate of 4½ per cent. interest but the rate is actually increased by ½ per cent.  I think the Minister for Finance should think over these things.  I give expression to them, not in any sense of bitterness but in a genuine attempt to point out to him what is necessary to obtain the increased production which is so very essential at the present time.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the cost of living because the question has become so <Col N="2062" /> serious that it has passed beyond the talking stage.  The Government, however, cannot disclaim responsibility for the fact that the price of practically every item for sale in shops in the country, and that has to be purchased by the average housewife, has increased beyond all bounds.  In most cases prices have doubled and I could quote some instances where they have been more than doubled.  All these things are helping to drive people from this country.  We are only a young nation, trying to get on our feet and I think there should be fewer attempts to score political points and more of a proper approach to the problem of developing the country.  My principal object in rising to speak was to point out where things are going wrong and to say that if the Government are sincere on the question of increased production, the smirks and sneers on the faces of Ministers when talking about these subjects would scarcely lead one to believe that they are sincere.  If they are sincere in their approach they will give every possible assistance to our farmers, hold out every inducement to our young men to remain on the land and tackle our drainage problem so as to restore fertility to the 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres of land, which are either permanently or periodically flooded.  I know that there are at least 2,000,000 acres of alluvial land equal to any in Europe which could be brought into production, included in that area.  We are calling for increased production but at the same time we are reducing to impotence the very schemes, the aim of which was to bring about that increased production.</P>
    <P>I want to see the balance of payments at least equalised.  This must be done if we are to keep our heads above water and make reasonable progress. If we are to do that, I am suggesting to the Minister, for what they are worth, some of the principal ways of tackling the problem.  It cannot be done by saying at the beginning of a speech that the country has gone into bankruptcy, that it is heading downhill, that everything the inter-Party Government did was wrong and that everything Fianna Fáil did was <Col N="2063" /> right, and then conclude by asking the people for increased production. Do not scare away the people by these alarmist pronouncements.  You will not get any results from that.  Some of the people in the country are absolutely puzzled as to what the Government mean while others are highly amused at the hypocrisy that is going on.</P>

      <P>May I congratulate the last speaker on being very well able to put it over and as a very fine character for representing facts as he finds them to-day?  The Deputy and the members of the Opposition can rest assured that the Government and we on this side of the House are doing our very best to increase production and to put the country back again on the map as a self-supporting nation. The policy of the previous Government during its period in office, supported by all the Parties opposite, was, as far as possible, to import foodstuffs which could have been produced in the country.  In view of that, I would ask the Deputies opposite to examine their consciences and see where that policy brought the country.  All those opposite are jointly responsible for having the country in the position in which it is to-day.  We may talk and try to do a lot of political scoring, but we have to be practical, and see how other peoples have succeeded in making their countries self-supporting. They have done so by developing their agriculture and their industries and by trying to get export markets for their products.  It is very hard to understand people here, such as my friends, Deputy Davin and Deputy Dunne, who as members of the Labour Party, always hold up their hands as being great believers in creating work for our people.</P>

Deputy Blowick tried to make the case that his Government improved the agricultural industry when, in fact, we know that it was they that <Col N="2067" /> killed it.  I see the ex-Minister for Agriculture coming into the House. During the three years of the inter-Party Government I pointed out to him on various occasions where there was a prospect of providing employment for our people, but he was more interested, supported by Deputy Dunne, in giving employment to the Dutch workers rather than to our own people.  That was the attitude he adopted towards one of our national industries, tomato growing, that we, in Fianna Fáil, had created and were hoping would develop.  Deputy Dunne, Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, and other members of the inter-Party Government were so concerned in case any person in Holland might be idle that they preferred to provide employment for the Dutch workers rather than for their own people. Every industry that we established in order to make the country self-supporting was described as a Fianna Fáil racket.  That is the kind of viciousness with which we were treated.</P>

      <Col N="2070" /> That was the method by which Deputy McGilligan told the House the capital investment programme of the year before had been financed.  In the coming year he had proposed to finance the capital investment programme as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To meet this year's requirements it is estimated that a net sum of £28.7 million will have to be found.  It will be necessary to seek again public subscriptions to a national loan.  It is earnestly hoped that these subscriptions and savings through the Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates will provide all, or at any rate, most, of our requirements.  It may be necessary to have resource to the American Loan Counterpart Fund, but it is desirable that this should be moderate...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass followed Deputy McGilligan in the debate on the Budget and it was quite clear from Deputy Lemass's statement that he and his Party were against a policy of borrowing for capital development. He referred at column 1913 of the same volume to the &ldquo;enormous expansion in the State debt&rdquo; during the period of the inter-Party Government and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For how long do you think it is possible for this State to keep adding to its debt in that way when, as the Minister admitted, the investment is not expanding and is unlikely to expand the national production in a corresponding degree?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the next column he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Must there not be at some stage a dropping of the political cowardice which has characterised his policy from the beginning and some realistic facing of the country's problems?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was reasonable to assume, when the Fianna Fáil Government took office, shortly after this debate on the Budget took place that, as far as the Fianna Fáil Party had a policy, it was directed against borrowing for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the change of Government a debate took place in this <Col N="2071" /> House on 18th July, 1951, and the policy of the Government came under review by the Minister for Finance. In the course of his remarks&mdash;Volume 126, No. 12, column 1873&mdash;the Minister referred to the problems which were clamouring for discussion and these were, first, the character and adequacy of the current year's Budget; secondly, the problem presented by an unwieldy programme of capital expenditure. Then he went on to refer to the balance of payments problem and the dissipation of our external assets. Second in priority the Minister put the unwieldy programme of capital expenditure and we on this side of the House assumed&mdash;and we were entitled to assume&mdash;that our programme of capital development would be pruned if not cut away altogether. Speeches were made during that debate and subsequently outside the House defending our capital Budget programme and pointing out the necessity for maintaining that programme.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the events which occurred after that debate.  It is well aware of the speeches that were made during the Summer Recess.  It is not necessary to recall the crisis and panic speeches that were made leading up to the issue of the Central Bank Report and the policy of deflation adumbrated in that report.</P>
    <P>During that stage of the Government's career the people were entitled to assume two things&mdash;first, that the capital investment programme was under review and was likely to be cut down and, secondly, that if it was not cut away altogether such of it as was left would be financed by taxation.</P>
    <P>Then we came to the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill last autumn and it was with a sense of relief that we heard at any rate one Minister, and the most influential Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, categorically denying that he was against cutting down on capital development and we hoped at any rate that he had brought his colleagues the full way with him in that policy.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance then <Col N="2072" /> a question in the Dáil as to what items of capital expenditure itemised in the Book of Estimates prepared by his predecessors he was going to cut down on and the answer was that the full items set out in the Book of Estimates were going to be expended this year.</P>
    <P>It was at this stage then that we had reached a situation that the Government was prepared to carry out our policy of capital investment.  There was one vital matter still remaining uncertain and that was the manner in which that capital Budget was to be financed.  It will be recalled that Deputy Lemass, the present Tánaiste, had come out against borrowing for capital investment in his speech on the Budget.  It will be recalled that the Fianna Fáil Party had expended large sums in placing advertisements on the public hoardings throughout this city in which they came out against the borrowing programme and told the people that the inter-Party Government was putting this country in pawn.</P>
    <P>We asked the Government were they going to float a national loan as Deputy McGilligan had announced in his Budget statement.  The reply I got when I put down that question in November was that the matter was under review.  In December, the Government announced its intention to go to the public for a national loan.  It has not gone to the public since that and it is well known why it has not gone to the country.  Because of its failure to float a loan in August or September of last year, as its predecessors would have done if they had remained in office, because the market had slumped, it was highly uncertain as to whether the Government would be able to fill a loan if they went to the country after September.  Because of the failure of the Government&mdash;a tragic and almost criminal failure&mdash;to go to the country last July, August or September for a national loan, the only way in which the Government could finance the capital investment programme was by drawing on the American Loan Counterpart Fund and dissipating it completely in one year.  The Minister yesterday interjected in the course of the debate that he had spent the American Loan on commitments of his <Col N="2073" /> predecessors.  There are two comments I would like to make on that.  Firstly, the commitments of his predecessors were not to be met out of the American Loan Counterpart Fund: they were to be met by a national loan and by drawings on new savings in the Post Office Savings Bank; and the balance was to be met, as it had been met the year before, by drawings on the American Loan Counterpart Fund. The figures have been given in the Dáil already and it is worth repeating them:&mdash;£18.1 millions of the Counterpart Fund was used up between 19th January, 1949 and 13th June, 1951; £18.5 millions was used between 13th June, 1951 and 30th October, 1951; and the balance has since gone.  The year before, in the whole year, the inter-Party Government had only drawn to the extent of £7.5 millions on the Counterpart Fund and that was because it had borrowed from the public, it had floated the greatest national loan that this country has had; and it was because of its intelligent policy of increasing savings.  By that policy the Government was able to draw only for a minor proportion of its total investment programme on the Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>Because of the criminal negligence of the Government last year, in failing to take the opportunity when the opportunity presented itself in July, August and September to raise a national loan, the only way they could finance the capital investment programme was by drawing on the Counterpart Fund and dissipating it completely, so that this year now the public will have to face all the rigours of taxation in order to help to meet the capital investment programme. That is the first comment I have to make on the Minister's statement yesterday that the Counterpart Fund was used to meet the commitments of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to refer in that connection is this.  The Government came into power within a matter of weeks after the presentation of the Budget.  The Government then could have taken any decision it liked in regard to any matter of the capital investment programme or any item in the Book of Estimates.  It could have <Col N="2074" /> pruned them or cut them as it liked and it was under no obligation to continue the investment programme as set out by its predecessors.  We, I think, were correct in believing at the beginning of its period in office that the Government were uncertain as to what they were going to do with the capital investment programme.  Deputy MacEntee referred to it as &ldquo;an unwieldy programme of capital investment&rdquo;. It was within their power within a couple of weeks after coming into office to cut down any one of the commitments of the inter-Party Government. I am glad to see that in the course of time they recognised that every one of those commitments was valid and good and productive of wealth and of employment in the State, and in a period of time they realised that none of those commitments should be cut down.  It was in their power, however, to cut them down if they did not believe in them.  It was also in their power to finance them, as they should have been financed, by floating a national loan.  Instead of that, they dissipated the American Loan Counterpart Fund completely last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last July also made a statement which is a valid statement of economic policy, but it is not necessarily a statement which we would agree would be applicable in the circumstances in which this country finds itself at the present day.  In Volume 126, No.12, column 1876, the Minister said as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No one with even a rudimentary acquaintance with economics should be complacent about Budget deficits in present circumstances.  I think that all will concede that, in an inflationary situation such as exists in the world to-day, the least the State should do is to refrain from making things worse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister then was coming out against what he termed &ldquo;Budget deficits&rdquo;.  To use the phrase without prejudice, just for the moment, as the Minister used it, that is to say, to arrive at a Budget deficit by deducting revenue from the total amount of expenditure, both capital and current &mdash;by using that definition we found that the Budget deficit this year he <Col N="2075" /> estimates will be in the nature of £50,000,000.</P>
    <P>I want to say, firstly, that I do not believe there will be a Budget deficit of £50,000,000.  I believe that the Minister is deliberately inflating the figures so that he will be able to come to the country when he introduces his Budget and say: &ldquo;It is not as bad now as we expected.&rdquo;  When he comes to his Budget statement in April, I would be prepared to prophesy that there will not be a Budget deficit of £50,000,000.  But supposing the Minister is correct, he is this year deliberately creating a budgetary deficit.  He describes such a deficit as inflationary and says that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;anybody with a rudimentary acquaintance with economics would know that the least the Government should do is not to help the inflation by creating a budgetary deficit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With that knowledge at his disposal and with that doctrine in his mind, he is deliberately, therefore, creating a budgetary deficit this year to the staggering sum of £50,000,000.  Either the Minister's economic doctrine is wrong or the Minister is deliberately setting out on a policy which is of a directly inflationary type.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which the Minister did not refer.  It must be recognised that a plan or a scheme of large-scale domestic development of capital assets by a Government is a direct way of increasing the deficits in the balance of payments.  The last Government with its eyes wide open proceeded to expand its programme for capital development, knowing that thereby the deficit in the balance of payments was going to be broadened. Yet the Minister here seems to be worried to the point of distraction at the deficit in the balance of payments, and he is going to increase that deficit by his own deliberate policy.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer shortly to this question of a deficit in the balance of payments.  If the Minister is sincere in wishing to get us into equilibrium at the present time and if he believes that large-scale capital development is <Col N="2076" /> inflationary and is going to increase the deficit in the balance of payments, he has no right to introduce a bill here for a deficit of £50,000,000.  We have the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister appearing to fear a deficit in the balance of payments to the point at which he says we are on the verge of desperation and at the same time he is bringing in a bill here for the country to meet which is going to increase that deficit greatly.  The Minister has it in his power to reduce the deficit in the balance of payments, to reduce the inflationary pressure&mdash; if he believes it is necessary to reduce those things&mdash;by reducing the capital investment programme; and he has not done so.</P>
    <P>I am glad that he has not reduced the capital investment programme.  It was one of the matters in which the previous Government took the greatest pride, and legitimately, I believe, took the greatest pride, this programme of national development.  The inter-Party Government set out deliberately to increase the capital assets of this State and it did so with its eyes wide open.  It recognised that the savings of the community, current savings, were inadequate to meet the capital development which the country required, and, in order to meet that development, it was necessary to draw on our past savings in the form of disinvestment from abroad.  Anybody with an acquaintance with the figures will realise that our current savings are inadequate to finance the scheme of capital development which we had proposed or to finance the scheme of capital development proposed by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The only means by which it can be financed is by drawing on past savings, by disinvestment of external assets. We were prepared to follow that programme and we followed that programme with our eyes wide open to the consequences.  The Government incurred a deficit in the balance of payments in order to enable schemes of capital development to be carried on, and, if there were no deficits in the balance of payments in the past three years, capital development in this country would have been greatly <Col N="2077" /> reduced, and the housing programme, the hospitalisation programme, telephone and electricity development and land rehabilitation would have been largely cut.  The previous Government thought these things were more important to the nation than the preservation of foreign assets which were depreciating yearly and which were liable to disappear almost completely in the course of time, if they were left where they were.</P>
    <P>The Minister came out with an extraordinary statement yesterday in relation to the deficit in the balance of payments.  As I heard him, and as he is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning, he announced that, in all, between 1947 and 1951, there was a fall in our external assets of £155,000,000. He has arrived at that figure by adding up the deficits in the balance of payments for each of these years and has assumed, in doing so, that the deficit in the balance of payments last year would be £66,000,000.  In parenthesis, may I remark that again, while I fully appreciate the dangers of prophecy in these matters, I venture to prophesy that the deficit in the balance of payments last year will not be £66,000,000?</P>
    <P>The Minister arrived at this figure of £155,000,000 by adding up the deficits in the balance of payments and went on to deduce from that that there was a fall in our external assets of £155,000,000.  The Minister's advisers should show him the figures.  There was no drop in our external assets of the same amount as the deficits in the balance of payments.  There was capital inflow during the period 1947-50, amounting in all to £51,000,000 in these four years.  There was an incurring of dollar indebtedness during that period amounting to £36.9 million, and during the years 1947 to 1950, while there was a gap in the balance of payments amounting to £90,000,000, external assets increased during that period.  The reason was that the deficits were financed not by drawings on external assets, but, first, by the creation of dollar indebtedness and, secondly, because a large portion of it was financed by new capital coming into this country.  The Minister should appreciate these figures <Col N="2078" /> and should not be trying to delude the people that our capital assets have declined by £155,000,000 in the past five years.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say that our assets will have been reduced last year.  I think that, for the first time since the war, there will be a net reduction in our external assets last year.  The reason is that there was a greater deficit in the balance of payments. There was less to draw on in the American Loan Account and, probably as a result of the Government's own policy, a lot of foreign capital has been frightened off coming into this country and we will not have the assistance of foreign capital to help us to meet the deficit in the balance of payments.  In respect of last year, for the first time we are going to see a reduction in our external assets.</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday and, in fact, in every one of his speeches which I have been able to study, refrained from referring in any degree to the necessity for savings.  We on this side have time and time again stressed the necessity of introducing a large-scale savings drive.  That savings drive is vitally necessary in order to see that the draw on our external investments is not greater than it should be.  Our capital investment programme in any one year can be financed out of current savings or past savings, and, as I have indicated, we have always realised that current savings are not sufficient to meet the investment we need, but the draw on external savings, that is to say, disinvestment abroad, can be reduced, if increased savings at home are brought about.  We had a policy&mdash; it has been adumbrated numerous times&mdash;of endeavouring to bring about a nation-wide savings campaign in order to enable the people to realise that, if they save, schemes of national development can be undertaken with more equanimity than if savings are allowed to be reduced.  If the Government is serious in wishing to bring about a reduction in the deficit, let them introduce this national savings scheme, but there was not one word yesterday in the Minister's statement, or in any of his statements that I have been able to find, in reference to the <Col N="2079" /> benefits which can accrue from a savings drive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the deficit in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>So far as we have been able to find out, the only policy the Government are proposing to adopt with regard to the deficit in the balance of payments is, first, the niggardly, petty one of reducing the foreign travel allowance to £25 and, secondly, the policy, if one could call it a policy, of import replacement which can only have the effect of increasing inflation at home and reducing our exports.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government is going to have the large budgetary deficit which the Minister announced yesterday.  I think it was deliberately inflated in order to show to the people when he does come to introduce his increased taxation that in fact that taxation is not as bad as was to be expected in view of the appalling circumstances. First of all I want to join issue with the Minister on his reference to this deficit of £50,000,000. It is wrong finance to lump capital services, below the line issues, Supply Services and Central Fund Services together and to deduct from that the estimated revenue.  The proper method to talk about a budgetary deficit is to take the Supply Services proper, that is to say, the current Supply Services, and the Central Fund Services and add them up.  That is the Budget which it is the duty of any Government to balance.  That is one of the reasons why we object to this Book of Estimates, which is a deliberate attempt to mislead the people by showing to them that the total cost of the Supply Services is £94.9 million without differentiating between capital and current services. Our policy was to balance the current Budget&mdash;and every Budget introduced by Deputy McGilligan was a balanced Budget&mdash;and for what was not current the proper policy was to borrow for it.</P>
    <P>If that is the criterion&mdash;and I suggest that it is the proper criterion on which to judge the manner of facing the budgetary picture&mdash;if the Minister does not tax for capital items included in the Estimates for the Public Services which amount to £9.3 million, he will <Col N="2080" /> have roughly £85,000,000 to be met out of current revenue.  In addition to that he will have the Central Fund Services which he said yesterday would amount to £13,000,000.  The Minister's task, therefore, is to balance this sum of £85,000,000 plus £13,000,000.</P>
    <P>If those figures are correct and if he does not bring about any reduction he has a duty to see that he has a balanced Budget in respect of those two items, but we will set out our hand and record our votes against any proposal to tax for items which we believe to be of a capital nature.  They amount to £9.3 million for the Supply Services and the below the line issues which the Minister has said will come to £26,000,000&mdash;but it will be very interesting to find how he arrived at that figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have a very great problem to find the money necessary for the capital Budget this year and I would suggest that the proper way to go about it is his predecessor's way: first of all to get the confidence of the people, to get the country into the frame of mind which the inter-Party Government had created, namely that we were developing the country in the interests of the country and if the Government can bring back the confidence which reigned during the three years of the inter-Party Government the Minister should not have great difficulty in raising a national loan.  I said in this House as long ago as July that if the Minister raised a national loan he would have the support of all Parties and I think I can say it again. It is in the interests of the country to raise a successful national loan and if the Minister and his colleagues try to restore confidence in Irish economy there is no reason why they should not get a loan from the country this year. I regard as criminal neglect the failure to go to the country last year for a national loan.  As a result of that neglect the Minister has no moneys from the American Loan Counterpart Fund to supplement what remains from the capital Budget.</P>
    <P>In addition to financing its capital investment programme by means of public borrowing the last Government <Col N="2081" /> partly financed it by increases in savings in the Post Office and by issues of Post Office certificates.  Let the Minister undertake what we have advocated, a nation-wide savings campaign, and a part of his budgetary problem will be solved.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made in the Seanad that foreign lenders should be enticed to our national loans and I think the Government should see that a large loan is floated which would, if the contributions of the people of this country were inadequate, be filled by lenders from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government also has the legal tender note fund of the Central Bank from which to obtain money for the coming year.  At present, so far as I am aware, the Central Bank holds no Irish securities in its legal tender note fund and there is no reason why say 20 per cent. of its backings of legal tender note should not be held in Irish Government securities.  At present the notes are backed exclusively by British Government securities.  The Central Bank has power, by virtue of the Currency (Amendment) Act, 1930, which was subsequently included in the Central Bank Act, to hold some of its backing of the Irish legal tender notes in Irish Government securities but up to the present it has never exercised that power.  There is a source from which the Government can obtain support for its capital investment programme for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Lastly we come to the taxation for it.  The last Government was enabled to carry out its capital investment programme without resorting to the tax-payer. We believed that it was proper financial policy, ordinary business economy, to create assets of a durable nature by borrowing and that it was wrong to tax people for one year for assets which would last a period of 50 to 100 years.  That policy of borrowing was severely criticised, but in present circumstances I would ask the Government to alter its feeling about our borrowing programme and to endeavour by the means I have suggested to raise the money for the capital investment programme this year from borrowing, not from taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> The Minister has followed to a remarkably close degree the steps of his colleague across the water, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. He has followed him in the reduction of the travelling allowances; he seems to have followed him in his general economic policy although it has been pointed out, time and time again, that policies required in England are of a fundamentally different character to policies required in this country.  Do not let the Minister follow him in his cut in the food subsidies.  I am sure that the food subsidies are a very tempting bait for the Minister for Finance at the present time.  If the Minister followed or would follow a proper financial policy, there would be no need for a cut in the food subsidies this year.  I am sure, however, that the people will have to meet a large bill for taxation.  They will be faced with a cut in food and fuel subsidies. I feel we are entitled to claim that a large degree of the increase in taxation which will be forthcoming is due to the ineptitude of the Government's financial policy last year and to the uncertainty which has existed in the economics of the Government since it has come into power.  It is not those who pay surtax or the companies making large profits who will have to pay increased taxation.  The ordinary people will have to pay by way of indirect taxes.  The hardships which the people will have to endure will be largely unnecessary and will be as a result of the inefficiency and the ineptitude of this Government's administration during the past nine months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Opposition cannot help the Minister for Finance and the Government to overcome the problems which face the country, they ought not to go out of their way to be mischievous.  It would be rather amusing, in other circumstances, to listen to some of those two-gun roaring republicans who, a few years ago, were referring to the dreadful fate which would be ours if we left the British Commonwealth of nations.  Deputy Dillon said a few years ago that we would be overrun within five years if we had the temerity <Col N="2083" /> to set up an independent republic in this country.  This is the gentleman who has the temerity to taunt the Minister for Finance in this House. What were Deputy Dillon and the remainder of his colleagues doing in 1948 making trade agreements with Great Britain?  They were telling us of the high prices our farmers would get.  According to Deputy Costello, the farmers would get a good remunerative price for all their products. How were these exports to be paid for? They were to be paid for in sterling assets.  The land rehabilitation project and the whole policy behind the administration of the Marshall Aid moneys in this country was based on the development of food exports to Great Britain&mdash;our best customer whom we were to drown in eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Our whole economy was being forced into the position that the task of our farmers was to produce food, presumably cheap food for Britain.  That food was to be paid for in sterling and, to the extent that we were not able to import in recoupment from Britain, the remainder was invested and forms our sterling assets and sterling balances.  The former Minister for Finance taunted the Fianna Fáil Government on several occasions with the depreciation in the value of money.  When he got into office himself he had other explanations and other theories.  When he was sitting on the Opposition Benches his cry was that Fianna Fáil, as a result of their policy, were depreciating the value of money.  According to him we were not taking steps to correct inflation, to restrict inflationary tendencies and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened afterwards?  In 1949 when the British decided to devalue the £ Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues described as financial cranks those who were not going to be tied by any conservative or mid-Victorian ideas of economy.  They were away in front of the whole world in their ideas on financial matters.  They had an <Col N="2084" /> excellent opportunity of showing us what could be done.  I feel it was a very good thing for the country that they were in office at the time.  These were the gentlemen who went around the country and talked about breaking the link with sterling and all the rest. How did they behave when the crisis was forced upon them?  There was a debate in Seanad Éireann on the 26th October, 1949 and this was a deliberate debate.  A motion was put down dealing with monetary policy.  What did the former Minister for Finance say with reference to this question.  I am quoting from Volume 37, column 130:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consideration might also be given to the question whether we could have established a completely new currency.  Senators will bear in mind that there are many other considerations besides that of legislation&mdash; financial, social and other ties which have driven us&mdash;let us say, forced, induced or invited us to follow the road which the British followed. These reasons are based mainly on the fact that we have such intimate trade relations with Britain that if we do not follow their devaluation, we would have been threatened with a disadvantageous situation in competing with our competitors in our principal market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on further to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not at all sure that the whole balance of consideration would not have driven us to accept devaluation and accept it as fully as the British did.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the people who have the temerity to taunt the Minister for Finance.  He has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of the value of our currency, for the preservation of the value of the people's savings and for the credit position of this country in the eyes of other countries, its ability to pay its way, make ends meet, and live within its income.  We should have the temerity to go across to London at the invitation of the British Chancellor to hear from that gentleman the position with which he was faced!  We are being told here by Deputy Costello and others that our problems are not the same as <Col N="2085" /> Britain's.  Has anybody pretended that they are the same?  Our circumstances are different.  What is there is the fact, as Deputy McGilligan, as Minister, stated: &ldquo;That we have such intimate trade relations with Britain.&rdquo; The question arises whether we are to take cognisance of that situation; whether, when the sterling area with which we are associated and the British economy upon which our trade is mainly based, are faced with a situation of crisis, whether the responsible Minister and the Government as a whole are not going to take cognisance of that situation.  Are they just going to close their eyes?  Are they going to wait until some other crisis comes upon them?  The devaluation crisis, we were told at the time it arrived, came quite unexpectedly.  The then Government said they got very little notice of it.</P>
    <P>At column 138 of the same debate, referring to a point raised by Senator O'Brien, the then Minister for Finance said he could not add to what the Senator said would have happened had we decided not to devalue in mid-September when Britain did.  I quote: &ldquo;He adverted to the matter of the banks and he asked me a question about what we should have done&rdquo;&mdash; that is to say, if there had been infiltration into this part of the country by people seeking to take advantage of the exchange rate from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The Minister said: &ldquo;I am at a loss to give him an answer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were told at that time that, on balance, the Government decided, as far as I recollect the public statement of the Minister for Finance, to follow the British line because it seemed to be the only alternative that could be followed.  The alternative of not following it did not recommend itself to them in the general national interest. Whether we like it or not, as the Minister for Finance pointed out yesterday, on the present pattern of our trade and having regard to our intimate trade relations with Britain our interests as part of the sterling area are influenced and can be seriously affected by happenings within that area.</P>
    <P>I think it is not an exaggeration to <Col N="2086" /> suggest that if a number of countries come together feeling that they have a community of interests as, for example, in the sterling area, and to take measures in common for their mutual advantage and benefit, it ought to be to the advantage of the individual countries concerned in so far as it is possible for them to do it, to co-operate.  Any co-operation that we are making or any steps we have taken in that regard are based entirely on our own interests. It is our own interests that prompt us to take cognisance of what is happening with regard to the sterling area and what is going on in the other countries in that area.  These happenings affect the sterling pool and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer is the main custodian of that pool.</P>
    <P>A communique was issued following the conversations stating that there had been an exchange of views.  The Taoiseach gave the country all the information that it was possible to give regarding that matter.  There was an exchange of views.  There was no agreement.  It is quite usual for Governments who have political or trade affiliations or connections to exchange views, to give information, to give even an indication of the steps which they may consider it necessary to take, feeling that the other party may be taken at a disadvantage if they are not accorded the information at the time, that it may cause them loss, for example, or may cause disturbance.</P>
    <P>We know that it has been the practice for the British Government, when the interests of other parties, as for example, those of this country, were affected, to give such information as they considered reasonable and proper to give.  Therefore, it is not true to say if the implication is there, that we can determine our policy entirely separate and in an isolated way from what is happening elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The defence that has been made over a period of years by successive Governments and Ministers in regard to the cost of living that is pressing upon the people, is that there are certain things that we cannot control: we cannot control the prices of commodities in the world market.  Washington <Col N="2087" /> may determine what the price will be but we have very little to do with it and to the extent that we have to buy essential materials we have to go out into that world market and purchase them.  In purchasing them we have to depend to a large extent on the reserves, the sterling balances, that we hold to finance those purchases. There is a machinery there, an organisation, a cushion, a reserve&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;that enables us readily, and has enabled us in the past to conduct those multifarious transactions with countries within or without the sterling area.  But in the straightening out and in the closing of our accounts with the non-sterling area, the sterling balances that are there and the sterling pool to which all the members of the sterling area are parties, plays an important part, of course.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Davin forgets is that money has been falling in value&mdash;the French franc, which in our time was worth about 10d. or 1/- is worth about ¼d.; the Italian lira is worse; the value of the English £ is nothing like what it was pre-1914.

      <P>I am not dodging the issue.  I will answer that question&mdash; although I am not going to admit that the Deputy has a right to hold me up&mdash;in the words of the former Minister for Finance.  In the same debate which I quoted a few moments ago, at column 142, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That leads to another consideration. Comment was made here&mdash;I think I have answered it&mdash;that the <Col N="2088" /> Irish £ in the counting-houses in New York was valued higher than the £ sterling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He gave a reason for that which was not the generally accepted reason.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When people say that our economy is more soundly based and, therefore, will offer a more secure investment than money in England, we have to consider the reality of the situation here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Davin will bear with me while I am reading this extract.  It is chapter and verse in this bible of capital investment that we hear so much about and which is not often used as a text.  I propose to put it forward as a text now.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From one angle, he said, it is very good to enthuse about capital development here at home and at times hearts (like Deputy Davin's!) might beat a little bit faster when they hear of these sums of money increasing from £700,000 up to £7,500,000 over a period of the financial year.  But sending that money into circulation through the hands of the community, into which money must get when expended, has, of course, a very definite inflationary effect.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Unless it were to lead to an immediate production of goods&mdash;and very little of this money as expended in this way is to lead to an immediate production of goods&mdash;there is bound to be inflation.  So at once, while I am pursuing this desirable course of making a tremendous increase in capital development, do not forget the other side, that I may be weakening the value of the Irish £ and, with the high rate at which Government expenditure, our capital account and current account, and with our situation in respect of balance of payments, I am not too sure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Senator O'Brien has said that he agrees that one may take the risk and, even though in the short run what you do may have an inflationary effect, it may be necessary to take the risk in order to get certain desirable objectives achieved.&rdquo;</P>

We might have taunted these new-found republicans with having followed meekly the English line but I presume their defence would have been, as I have mentioned, that the alternative before them, which they followed, was the one which involved the least loss and perhaps more gain to the community and the Irish people.</P>

Anything that we do we do it because we believe it to be in the best national interests.  We will face whatever popularity or unpopularity, odium or otherwise, which may come to us on that score.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the enormous surplus that Australia had as a result of the peak prices for wool? Within a few months the whole position changed in Australia.  From being a country that was booming they found themselves entirely on the wrong side, to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds.  We know that before the war countries which did not take heed in time and watch where they were going, or show caution and discretion when difficulties seemed to be looming ahead found that their sterling balances as in the case of New Zealand on a celebrated occasion were entirely dissipated.  They had to go with their hats in their hands to the English banks&mdash;how would Deputy Davin like that?&mdash;or to the banks of some other country to ask them to provide facilities or credits by hook or by crook, to enable them to buy essential materials without which the whole economy of the country might be paralysed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Davin would apply himself to finding where these finances are going to come from when the sterling balances are exhausted as they could be exhausted if we continue to use them up at the rate at which we have been doing.  What is going to happen then?  Are we just dealing with this important matter from a hand-to-mouth point of view or are we looking ahead to know what the position will be in two or three years' time?  We have no proof, as the Minister for Finance indicated yesterday, that the position is going to improve outside this country.  For all we know, it may disimprove.  There may be some other crises, whether they be war crises or depression crises.  When the present armament work comes to an end we do not know what we will be faced with.  We ought, at any rate, to consider carefully what our position is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for the reference of the former Minister for Finance which is here in this speech to the <i>desideratum</i> that capital investment, in so far as it is based on the repatriation of the sterling assets, ought to aim at providing the interest necessary to pay off the external debt. It ought, in other words, to be invested productively.  I think that it would be a fair statement of the position that these moneys, when repatriated, ought to be invested in such a way that the income derived from them would cover the capital charges and, in addition, add to the general wealth and productivity of the country.  We are not in a position to know to what extent the moneys that have been repatriated have been utilised to build up our productivity but we know, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, that some £90,000,000 was repatriated in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that it is possible that one cannot ascertain with accuracy or even give an accurate estimate of what proportion of that £90,000,000 found its way into productive industry or productive agricultural effort.  The Deputies' speeches and lectures on capital investment would be more instructive and more convincing if they could show us, as a result of these heavy expenditures, in what direction they are able to point to an increase in production.  Why is it that at present, for example, with regard to <Col N="2093" /> our basic necessities such as wheat, butter and sugar, we are depending, apparently to a greater extent than formerly, on the foreigner in spite of the difficulties of providing finances to pay for these imports?</P>

Let us spend millions more on capital investment if we are able to raise the <Col N="2094" /> money, but let us try and spend it in a way that will be of real advantage and benefit to the country and let us see, when we are spending it, that we will get value for it exactly the same as if it was the money out of our own pockets that we were spending.</P>

We were accused, by some of these people who have changed their minds again now on the question of capital investment, of piling up dead-weight debt and of using up the capital reserves of the country at too great a rate.  That was the position.  The Party in opposition had quite a different story then.  They were quite prepared, even in 1947, to support the views of the Central Bank when the Central Bank found fault with us for not paying more attention to the matters of the balance of payments, the realisation of our external assets, and so forth.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello tells us that we are suffering only from cost inflation.  How does it arise?  It arises because our output has not increased. Our costs have increased at a far greater rate than our output.  We have been hearing for the past 20 years from the economists in Sweden and elsewhere that there is no point in increasing wages unless productivity is increased at the same time.  Let us try to improve our methods of production and try to reduce our costs.  Let us try <Col N="2095" /> to ensure that there will be greater output and greater effort for the money that is spent.  If I may so suggest to Deputy Davin, the Labour Party and those who support them can make as big a contribution, and probably a bigger one, to the solution of the country's difficulties as any other section of the community except the agricultural community by putting their shoulders to the wheel and by determining that the proper way to solve the country's difficulties and to get greater output is to get more work done and more food produced.

      <P>I do not think there is any great need to dwell at length on the mess in which our fishing industry finds itself at the moment.</P>
      <P>I think it is agreed on all sides of the House that energetic steps must be taken to try to get this very important industry out of the doldrums.  It is accepted in this House that the most important industry in the country to-day is agriculture.  Many Deputies will also accept the fact that the fishing industry, if properly developed, would be, and should be, second only to agriculture.  Yet we have the extraordinary position to-day that, after 30 years of native government, two industries&mdash;one the major industry of agriculture and the other, fisheries, which could be made another major industry&mdash;are in a parlous state and that, since we achieved the limited political freedom that we have to-day, no native Government has succeeded in putting a proper policy into operation either in agriculture or in fishing. I think it significant that both of these major factors in our economic life are under the control of one Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> I do not want to be taken here as adopting the attitude that, because things have been a failure in both of these industries, we would be better off under the former régime.  The reason I draw attention to the deplorable state of the two industries is simply to point out to the House the necessity, from this day forward at any rate, of concentrating more on economic matters and forgetting, to as great an extent as we possibly can, this practice of political flag-waving.  I think it should be accepted here and now, if we are what we are alleged to be, that political freedom alone is not sufficient. As I said last night, the fact that we are able to fly a green, white and gold flag over our State buildings, that we are able to paint our buses and letter boxes green, does not mean that every-body is happy in this land.  All this talk of political freedom is so much eye-wash so long as we have not got economic freedom and it is quite apparent from this debate, and from the debate on the Vote on Account which has taken place to-day, that we are far from having achieved any reasonable measure of economic freedom in the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>This Fisheries Bill is, to my mind, a belated attempt to try to remedy the position.  As a genuine attempt to do something I sincerely welcome it and I wish the Parliamentary Secretary luck in his efforts.  I think, however, it is essential that the House should examine the type of legislation which is envisaged to revive the fishing industry.  Deputies on both sides of this House&mdash;that is to say, members of the two major Parties&mdash;have declared themselves in this House and outside the House as being in favour of the system of private enterprise. They have deplored time and again State interference in any sphere of economic life.  We can take up the daily papers and read the speeches by prominent members of both these Parties, and by prominent people who are not connected with politics, deploring the interference of the State in any economic matter or in any sphere of our social or economic life.  Yet here in this Bill we propose to give powers to the State that are completely <Col N="2097" /> dictatorial so far as the fishing industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wonder do Deputies realise the power they are about to give to the new board to be set up?  I do not want to be taken as being personally opposed to State interference.  I think in major matters such as fishing, agriculture, industry, health and so forth, it is essential, if we are to have a proper social and economic system, that the State must play its part and play an increasing part every day in all these major spheres.  But I do not like this hypocrisy on both sides of the House that deplores at one moment State interference in certain aspects of our national life and at the next moment tries to conceal the truth when legislation is brought forward under which the State takes absolute control. Should we not be quite frank about these matters, and say that we believe the State is the only body in a position to revive the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I believe our approach to the revival of the fishing industry is all wrong.  I think that in our approach to this problem, our aim should be to reap the greatest possible harvest we possibly can from the sea.  Our aim should be to seize with both hands all the wealth we can from off our shores. That is the policy pursued by other countries&mdash;by Norway, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain.  The objects of this Bill however are put very briefly in the explanatory memo-randum. It says that the principal objects of the Bill are to ensure improved outlets, with particular reference to the home markets, for landings made by the inshore fishermen. I think it can be established that under this Bill it is quite possible for the State to limit the landing of fish in this country and to limit the catch of fish, to protect a small or certain group of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not think it a right approach to legislation of this kind that we should come along and say: &ldquo;Oh!  if you catch too much fish, the inshore fishermen are going to suffer.&rdquo;  If that were our outlook in regard to agriculture we would be worse off, if that were possible, than we are to-day. No steps are taken in agriculture <Col N="2098" /> to suggest to the farmer that he should reduce the output of wheat, barley, oats or live stock in case he might not get a sufficiently high price. No steps are taken to suggest to the farmer that he should not produce the maximum from the land.  He is encouraged, actually, to produce the maximum.  Instead, however, in this Bill power is being given to limit the landings of fish here by Irishmen who have boats registered in the country for fear that, if the Dublin housewife or the Galway housewife, were to get a plentiful supply of fish the profits obtained by the fish factor, the wholesaler and the distributor would be reduced if there was a glut of fish. That danger lies in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have off our shores a major source of a food supply for man and beast.  Apart altogether from the food value, there are numerous by-products which the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of that could be processed from fish.  I think that, instead of limiting this Bill to ensure a livelihood for the inshore fishermen, we should try and grasp the opportunity that is now available of reaping the rich harvest that is just off our coast out in the deep.  I do not think that the inshore fishermen are going to suffer, but even if there was a question that the limited number of them available here would suffer under this Bill, is it not a fact that a properly organised deep-sea fishing fleet would absorb, and could absorb, any of them whose livelihood was likely to be affected by the Bill?  Is it not a fact that the families, friends and relations of those inshore fishermen could gain permanent and useful employment in factories established along our west coast for the processing of this fish if we went into the business in a major way?  As it stands, there is not a livelihood in it for anybody.</P>
    <P>I see mention in the Bill of boats or vessels exceeding 35 feet in over-all length.  When I see mention of 35 feet at all, I feel like saying that any boat under that measurement is as useful in connection with sea fishing to-day as a man with a rod and line.  As far as I can see, our aim in this Bill is merely to protect the inshore fisherman. <Col N="2099" /> At the present time he is suffering inside his own area from the depredations of the foreign trawler.  I am sure that other Deputies have mentioned the various trawlers that visit our coast&mdash;the Spaniards, the Portuguese, the French and the others.  They come into Bantry, Galway and the other ports, and fish constantly within our three-mile limit.  The only protection that we have for our own fishermen in that regard is that provided by some vessels under the Department of Defence whose job it is to patrol the coast-line.  It is admitted that these vessels are not able to carry out that duty in a satisfactory manner.  The fact is that we are not tackling the problem in a proper manner by simply depending on the protection given by defence units such as torpedo boats. That is useless.  The real defence for our inshore fishermen, and for our fishermen as a whole, is to give them the opportunity, with proper boats and equipment, of being able to go out into competition with these foreign trawlers.  Give them that opportunity and give them the boats, and once you allow them to go into competition with these foreign trawlers the question of protecting them will no longer arise. They will ensure themselves that the protection will be available.</P>
    <P>I have some figures here in connection with our inshore fishermen.  I would like to give a comparison with one or two other countries, one in particular. My information is that the number of fishermen employed in this country in 1950 was approximately 2,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whole-time.  In 1950, Norway, which it is admitted is not a very large country, employed 114,000 fishermen alone.  In 1950, Norway earned £22,000,000 from her fishing industry.  According to my information, we earned in the same year a sum of £500,000.  It would not be a bad achievement if we could earn even half of what Norway earns.  We have as big a coastline as any country in the world, bigger, in fact. than some; we have ports and we have fishermen <Col N="2100" /> available, but what we have not available is the courage, the initiative, to tackle this problem in the proper way.</P>
      <P>The question of distribution is mentioned in this Bill.  I think this is a very important matter, especially for housewives all over the country.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that there will be no limitation put on the amount of fish landed here by Irish boats or boats registered in Ireland, and that all possible steps will be taken to ensure that continued supplies will be made available for our house-wives. One of the most annoying things in rural areas, at any rate, is to find that you can get fish on one Friday, perhaps, and that in the following three weeks, say, you can get none at all.  If many people down the country could get a guarantee of a continuity in supplies, they would place a regular order for fish, but at present it is only a chance in a million if they can get fish in two succeeding weeks.</P>
      <P>Where the real trouble begins is where the fish is landed in this country, fish caught either by our own fishermen or by boats registered here.  Just as in agriculture and in other spheres of economy, the actual producer never really gets the profit which he deserves. We know that by the time fish landed in Galway Bay is put on the table for breakfast and dinner the price of it has gone up enormously.  If we follow the system of distribution that is in operation, we find that from the time the fish is landed until it reaches the breakfast table the biggest percentage of profit did not go to the fisherman but went to the wholesaler, the auctioneer or the distributor.  There are some of the worst vested interests in the country to-day engaged in the distribution of fish.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that all possible steps will be taken to smash these rings and that he will do away with what I can only describe as the hordes of bandits that descend on the fish after it is landed and reap all the profits before that fish ultimately reaches the consumer's table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to give careful consideration to the possibility of establishing a producer-consumer market in connection with the fishing <Col N="2101" /> industry.  I think that is the real solution because it will make things easier for the housewife and business better for the fisherman while eliminating to a great extent these brigands who now batten on both the fisherman and the consumer.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the fact that the amount of fish consumed per head of the population here is very small and that we are not really a fish-eating nation.  It has been said that much more fish was consumed in the past.  That may be so, but it must be remembered that in those days greater quantities of fish were available and the supply was much more regular.  It should be possible to restore that position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the different varieties of fish, I think our womenfolk are not as good as their continental counter-parts in the preparing and cooking of fish.  I would make one suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We have throughout the country a number of domestic economy instructresses employed by the various vocational committees.  They teach the rudiments of cooking to their pupils and they have achieved excellent results.  I think the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture should cooperate with the vocational schools by making available to them plentiful supplies of fish for demonstration cooking purposes.  If the younger people, in particular, are taught the various methods of preparing and cooking fish that would help to instil into them a taste for fish and a desire for fish in greater variety.  I merely put that forward as a suggestion.  The Parliamentary Secretary has the machinery at his disposal, and it is up to him and his office staff to work out a plan.</P>
    <P>Only the State can solve the problems that face the fishing industry. I am afraid that the powers that will be given to the Minister and his Department under this Bill may be abused, remembering what has happened in past years in the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture.  I think the Fisheries Branch deserves severe censure for its lackadaisical approach to this industry. <Col N="2102" /> Unless there is a great change in the mental make-up of the officialdom dealing with this industry, I fear that the increased powers will only react to the detriment of the industry as a whole.  I will not mention names or individuals in connection with this matter, but I believe we must have about the most reactionary and conservative bunch of officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to Deputy McQuillan's statement in relation to the officials of the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agriculture.  During the two years that I have been a representative here I have received the greatest courtesy, help and consideration that anyone could receive, not only from the Sea Fisheries Association but also from the <Col N="2103" /> Fisheries Branch of the Department. If there is anything wrong with the fishing industry, the fault certainly does not lie with the officials.</P>
      <P>If I had my way I would suggest that this Bill be dropped, because I believe it will be absolutely useless. It may be said that it was introduced by the former Minister for Agriculture but that makes no difference so far as my personal views are concerned.  I was born and I have lived all my life beside the sea.  I have seen the difficulties that fishermen must undergo in order to catch fish and make a living out of that industry.</P>
      <P>I remember a time when we had no boards, no Sea Fisheries Association&mdash; in fact, nothing at all.  At that time we had a plentiful supply of fish, not only along the coast, but also in the inland areas.  Possibly the fish have taken some other direction in recent years. Possibly our own native Government interfered so much that the fish turned tail and went elsewhere.  We must take the position as it exists and, while I feel certain that each successive native Government has done its best in its own way to improve the fishing industry, we are to-day no better off&mdash; in fact, we are much worse off&mdash;than we were before we ever had a Department of Fisheries.  I do not know where the blame lies, whether it is with the fish or the Government or the Fisheries Branch.</P>
      <P>In all seriousness, I would suggest that the question of developing the fishing industry should be considered from a non-political point of view. Both inside and outside the House people talk about the fishermen and what they would wish to do for them. I hope it is not because they wish to collect a few votes from fishermen. The fishermen have the most difficult and dangerous task of all the work that has to be done in order to provide us with fish.</P>
      <P>It should be the primary duty of the Government or the Department concerned to see that every possible facility and provision is made for the safety of the fishermen.  They should be provided with good boats and gear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> Look-out posts should be provided along the coast, which would be always manned and ready so that rescue would be immediately available when accidents occur.  It is also the duty of the Department to see that our territorial waters are properly protected.  Some people maintain that we should extend our territorial waters, as they have done in Norway, to the 12-mile limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nine miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is 12 or nine does not matter.  If we cannot protect three miles, I fail to see how we could protect nine or 12.  If we could properly protect the limit to which we are entitled we would be doing well.</P>
      <P>I do not know that the corvettes that are at present engaged in protecting our territorial waters were meant for that purpose.  They are not suited.  I am certain they were acquired for an entirely different object.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary the advisability of setting up some kind of inter-Departmental Committee, of setting his experts and advisers to see what can be done to protect the territorial waters.  Irrespective of the answers we may get to Parliamentary Questions about foreign trawlers coming within the territorial waters, we know that such raiders do come in.  I have seen them. They can remain as long as they like. We have no protection against them, no means of keeping them out.  It might be a good plan to have trawlers that would be engaged in fishing so equipped as to be able to arrest poachers for encroachment on our territorial waters.  The crew of the trawlers could be compensated for carrying out that duty.  There may be a better means of protecting the territorial waters but perhaps that would be the least expensive.  We should try to keep the cost as low as possible so that whatever moneys are voted for fisheries will be expended for the welfare of the fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fishermen find great difficulty in obtaining suitable boats.  Under present regulations they are required to pay a 10 per cent. deposit.  It may be possible for some fishermen to do that but in the main it is a part-time occupation. The inshore fishermen live in <Col N="2105" /> villages or on small farms.  It would be impossible for such men to pay a 10 per cent. deposit.  When it is put up to the Parliamentary Secretary, who has of course supreme power in that respect, or to the responsible body under this Bill that a fisherman has a good record and has met all his commitments in respect of boats and gear, he should not be refused even if he could not pay a 10 per cent. deposit.</P>
    <P>Sometimes there is a glut of fish, although that occurs very seldom now-adays. I have in mind fish landed at Reenard Pier in Cahirciveen.  There should be a canning station or refrigeration plant at all the important piers so that the fish could be preserved and used when fresh fish would be scarce.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of the board, my objection is on the ground that the members will be nominated by the Minister.  I cannot see how that will be an improvement on the present system in which we have the Sea Fisheries Association to which the fishermen nominate and elect directors to carry out the work.  That was the democratic way of doing it.  It is proposed now to have a board.  I cannot see what is the idea of dissolving the Irish Sea Fisheries Association.  They were doing good work so far as their resources would allow.  They were always available to look after the interests of fishermen.</P>
    <P>Whenever I went to that association on behalf of fishermen to try to redress their grievances, everything possible was done for the welfare of the fishermen.  In fact, they had solely in their minds something that would improve the lot of fishermen.  Now they are to be dissolved.  I do hope, however, that those officials who are in that Department will not suffer any loss in their position because of the setting up of this new board and this new arrangement.</P>
    <P>While we profess to be democrats and to have a democratic Government, we are moving gradually to a kind of state by which we are losing our liberty and placing too much entirely in the hands of Ministers and boards.  If this board is to be set up, it should be set up by the votes of the fishermen and no others.  Even a <Col N="2106" /> Minister with the best intentions may be inclined to set up that board to consist of civil servants and, mind you, there is a great temptation&mdash;and I do not mind what Party would be in office&mdash;to nominate and to appoint to that board political friends and associates.  We should always avoid that if we wish to see that the fishing industry would prosper in this country.</P>
    <P>There is really nothing else to which I would like to refer.  I certainly hope that during the Committee Stage, by the amendments that will certainly be proposed to make this board democratic and to take it out of the hands of the Minister, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will meet us a long way.  I would say again that this Bill really will not improve the lot of fishermen.  I cannot see how it will improve the fishing industry, nor can I see how it will act in such a way that it will bring to the people of this country a greater supply of fish than has hitherto been available, and that was very little.</P>
    <P>Something is entirely wrong with the fishing industry, and so far as I am concerned, I do not wish to blame anyone.  Perhaps no one is blame-worthy. I am sure that the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and officials of the Department responsible are doing their best.  Nevertheless, it would be just as well, if they kept out of it more.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that the fishermen, the people responsible for catching the fish, would have the best boats and gear and the best protection possible to carry out their dangerous task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion fishing in this country has not yet reached the status of an industry at all.  It has been carried on over a period of years in a very haphazard manner.  We cannot say we have a fishing industry in this country until we have a large number of fishermen engaged in fulltime employment and operating all the year round, having supplies of fish made available to all the towns in the country on all days of the week throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> I am hoping that the present Bill may go a long way towards establishing what should be a very important industry, what should be our major industry.  I am hopeful that this Bill will establish it as an industry on a sound footing.  Other countries have made great strides in protecting the fishing industry.  Norway is a country we should look to for example and for guidance.  They have got down to the matter in real earnest.  They have improved not alone the methods of taking fish but from that point they have developed the industry all down along the line until it reaches the family table as a food.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of catching fish that is of the utmost importance here. It is what should be done and what can be done with the quantities of fish that are landed, that is, providing markets and so on.  One branch of fishing which has not hitherto received the attention it deserves is deep-sea fishing.  Along our coasts there are vast stretches of very good fishing grounds which are going to waste, which are not being exploited due to the fact that the attention of Irish fishermen hitherto has been directed to inshore fishing.  As I mentioned in the beginning, even this inshore fishing has not yet the status of an industry. It is amazing when one thinks that these people may be working in the fields in the morning and word goes around that some fish are heading for the rocks.  They put on their coats and set out to sea.</P>
    <P>That is not as it should be.  It is not as it must be if the Irish fishing industry will reach the status where it can be regarded as one of our principal industries.  I remember seeing at a Donegal fishing port some years ago a trawler, one of the 50-foot fishing boats.  The skipper and owner of that boat was a university graduate, a Donegal man.  He and his crew landed a cargo of fish.  In speaking to me he said he had a great interest in fishing.  He did everything to improve the method of catching fish and generally he was the type of person that should be attracted into this industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> I am not saying that all men should be like that.  If we wish to attract in the future our young boys and men into this industry we must make facilities available for them and we must give them training.  We cannot expect them to operate under the conditions which satisfied their forefathers.  At the present time no young man is prepared to work under the outmoded conditions which operated in the fishing industry 20 or 30 years ago, and there is no reason why they should be asked to accept those conditions. Irishmen employed with some of the trawling companies and the fishing companies in other countries work under favourable conditions and have fixed hours and good wages.  It is not proper to expect our young fishermen to accept conditions of work carrying with them a risk in operating small boats which they cannot sometimes put to sea owing to bad weather.  On these occasions they have to sit in the house and forgo the opportunity of landing fish.  It is, to my mind, nonsensical to send the fish to Dublin immediately it is landed and then redistribute it to different parts of the country.  I feel that this Bill will in a way remedy that ridiculous situation.  In my view distributing depots should be set up in different parts of the country so that the various counties or districts would be in a position to get regular supplies of fish a reasonably short period after it is landed.  That is the only way in which the Irish public can develop a taste for fish.</P>
    <P>At one time England was known as the country of beef-eaters but I feel that we have beaten them as far as that reputation is concerned.  Per head we eat more meat in this country than is eaten in England.  One of the reasons for this is that even the people who relish fish and who would partake of it more often find that it is available only spasmodically.  When the fish-monger calls around the housewife may have a week's supply of meat in the larder.  Therefore the family do not get a chance of partaking of the fish.</P>
    <P>Students in domestic training colleges are taught how to do everything imaginable with the joint or a piece of meat.  One would hardly recognise a <Col N="2109" /> leg of rabbit when it is turned out by some of these people.  I feel, if more training were given to domestic students in the cooking of fish, that it would help to educate the public taste for this diet.  There are only two methods of cooking fish for any meal known to the Irish housewife&mdash;frying or boiling.  That is the sum total of the methods known to her.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the landing facilities along our coasts are not all that they should be.  I realise, of course, that large sums of money would be required to improve landing facilities in some cases, and to erect new landing facilities in other cases.  There is the further trouble of finding out the body which should carry out the work. There are three different bodies catering for the erection of slips and piers &mdash;the Fisheries Branch, the Office of Public Works and the county councils. When money is in short supply these three keep passing the buck from one to the other, and the result is that no serious effort is made to make landing facilities available.  I feel that the responsibility for the fishing industry should not be relegated to the tail-end of a Department but that a separate Ministry should be set up to tackle the problem.  It should be tackled in earnest and a good job should be done once and for all, even if it were necessary to borrow money for the purpose. After all these years it is time the matter were gone into in a proper manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the catching and handling of fish in this country is a very unsatisfactory one.  I wish to welcome this Bill because it deals with a very complicated and a very difficult subject. I feel, from what we have seen of this measure, that it does not hold the solution to the difficulties in the fishing industry.  Fishing is a very complicated subject, and I agree with the previous speakers who said that what we need is a large scale fishing industry.  Until we have trawlers equipped in the most up-to-date manner, we will not be on the road to developing a successful fishing industry. However, this Bill indicates that the Government and the country <Col N="2110" /> as a whole is waking up to the fact that something should be done to help this industry.  There is a particular point I would like to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary, which has been put to me.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware of this particular aspect of the Bill.  In Section 2 the definition given of sea fish is inclusive of salmon and sea trout.  Salmon and sea trout have always had a special legal code of their own, and the handling of salmon and trout has been kept entirely different from that of sea fish.  Hitherto, the control, supervision, distribution and sale of salmon and trout were not matters for the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is his intention under this Bill to alter the position which has obtained up to now? Unless the definition of sea fish in that section of the Bill is different from what some people consider it to be, the Bill will radically alter the present situation with regard to salmon and sea trout.  Apart from anything else, there is a danger of a conflict of laws on account of the special code to which I referred.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear that matter up.  If it is the intention of his Department to include salmon and sea trout under this Bill, I should be glad if he would say so in order that the various people interested in this matter would know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to make a long speech on this subject but I am very glad that something is being done concerning the fishing industry as a whole, but unless this Bill turns out to be more comprehensive I am not sure that anything can be done along these lines. At the present moment fishing has become a major industry and unless we provide for a major industry we will not have the fishing industry in the healthy state we would like to see it in.  It was all right in the past because small fishermen could somehow handle this matter of fish but, nowadays, the fish industry has got quite beyond individuals.  To become a major industry there is need for planning and supervision.  The capital and capital <Col N="2111" /> resources necessary for a major industry must be provided.</P>
    <P>I am glad that something is being done and in conclusion I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal, when replying, with the question I have raised in regard to salmon and sea trout.  Is it the Parliamentary Secretary's intention to include salmon and sea trout in the scope of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks that may be helpful.  It is a pleasure to see a Bill like this before the House.  While I might have to disagree with certain of its proposals, the Bill is a move in the right direction. Any Bill which proposes to take advantage of the rich harvest of fish that lies round our coasts, particularly along the western and southern coasts which are being raided by people outside this country, should be welcomed.  Any Bill that seeks to capture a portion of that rich harvest in order to use it for ourselves should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I want to bring home one thing to the Parliamentary Secretary and that is that the most urgent thing that will come before the board, as soon as it is set up, is the question of putting boats and gear in the hands of the few remaining expert fishermen we have left around our coasts.  Unfortunately, to my own personal knowledge, too many of the very best fishermen who know every trick of the weather and every fishing ground right round our coast have left.  Some of them, I am sorry to say, have got permanent employment abroad, never to come back, or, at least, their coming back is most unlikely.  I would urge that, as soon as this Bill becomes law and the board has been established, the board should not be hampered by any financial restrictions in regard to the giving of credit or the supplying of boats and gear in order to encourage those who are still with us to remain with us.  That is the most urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputies to stand up and say that there is a rich harvest around our coast and that we should gather it up.  We cannot do that without the aid of able men. <Col N="2112" /> There are no experts except those who have been born and reared in the vicinity of the coast and who take part in that industry.  I know that to be a fact.  The most urgent thing before the board is to give the necessary boats and tackle to these men before they, too, may be tempted to leave us.  The providing of these boats should not be bound up with many restrictions.</P>
    <P>Before and during the period of the inter-Party Government it was necessary that those getting a boat would put down 10 per cent. of the cost. From a financial point of view, I know that seems a very small amount and that if a man gets something from the State that is to be his own, a down-payment of 10 per cent. of the cost seems reasonable.  In actual fact, the most the type of people with whom we are dealing, small farmers with small holdings, can do is to eke out a doubtful existence.  This down-payment of 10 per cent. is very formidable. Ten per cent. of £5,000 is a big sum and the cost of a 50-foot boat would be more at the present time.  It would be sheer nonsense to expect these people to put down 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Discretion should be exercised under the powers conferred by Section 15 of this Bill if we decide to give a boat. If we trust the fishermen with 90 per cent. of the cost of the boat, we might as well trust them for the remainder. It might be argued that this is necessary in order to make the fishermen realise that those who get the boat will have to pay for it and take an interest in it.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that these fishermen would be only too proud to look upon that boat as almost a member of the family once they have a share in it.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us of one single instance where the boat has been taken back by the Department because it was not made a paying proposition by those to whom it was entrusted?  The Parliamentary Secretary may as well go the whole hog and trust these fishermen with the full 100 per cent.  A down-payment of 10 per cent. is equal to £500 on a £5,000 boat.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not get that.  One might as well try to get blood out of a turnip. The people would be only too delighted <Col N="2113" /> to give the money if they had it.  They will make a success of it between them if they get the boat, but it is no use offering them this boat with a down-payment of 10 per cent. It is like trying to feed a horse with a sheaf of oats tied to the roof of the stable which the horse cannot reach&mdash; it is there if he can get it.</P>
    <P>My second piece of advice is not to spare money on the provision of suitable shelters for the boats when they are not in use.  I am personally aware that great damage is often done because of inadequate shelter for boats which are lying idle in times of bad weather.  Good shelter for boats when they are not in use is as essential as good equipment or a good engine or a crew.  You might have a boat in perfect order all the year round and yet if a storm breaks out and the boat is inadequately sheltered for a couple of hours immense damage can be done not only to that particular boat, but also to two or three other boats which may be tied up with it.  If the board approaches these problems in a broad way, as I think they will, then a very prosperous industry can be built up around our coast.  I think that those Deputies who expect this industry to develop into a fully-fledged industry the day after this Bill becomes law are adopting a silly attitude.  It will take time to bring this industry to a high level.</P>
    <P>My principal suggestion is that the Minister should not hamper the board. While I am aware that they have a large amount of freedom under this Bill, I hope no restrictions will be placed on them in the discharge of their work.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies in this House have expressed the opinion that the departmental officials are cramping our style. We in this House should not seek to place blame for our own mistakes on the shoulders of officials in Departments. The members of this House were elected to come in here and if there are any flaws in existing legislation, or if it does not allow us as much scope as we might like, we should be men enough to accept any blame which may fall on us rather than say that the <Col N="2114" /> departmental officials are cramping our style.  They are not cramping our style because we are the free people and the officials are our servants.  I have heard of only one civil servant who refused to do what he was told and I am convinced that the vast bulk of them are only too glad to do what the Government and this House tells them to do.</P>

      <P>It might be uncharitable to say in this House too much about Civil Service officials and, apart from that, it is not regarded as being within the rules of order to do so.  However, anybody who says in this House that all civil servants are the servants of the Ministers must think that the rest of us in this House have had no experience of Civil Service departments. Unfortunately it is the other way round in every case.  Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries should be the masters in their own houses&mdash; should be.  How often are they truly the masters?</P>

That is the point I was going to make when I was so vulgarly interrupted.  I think that that fact alone to which I have adverted reflects in a very large measure the condition in which we find the fishing industry to-day.</P>
      <P>Having listened to speeches made from both sides of the House on this Bill I am forced to the conclusion that, in fact, very little thought or study is given to the problem of the fishing industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> Reference has been made to the way of life of the inshore fisherman cum small farmer, who inhabits the western and southern coasts.  To my surprise, one Deputy said that it would be amusing to see a man working in the fields in the morning and later in the afternoon fishing on the sea.  That is a pattern of life that is half as old as time.  It is not something which you can hope to modernise by any pious expressions of hope in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get rid of them.  An effort should be made to make it a better proposition for men of that type because it must be recognised that a great number of our people have sprung from that section of the population.  They are amongst the most energetic of our people because, coming from that section of the population, due to the hard nature of the life they were forced to lead, and of their being brought up as young children and adolescents in the hard way, they are fit to go out into the world and perhaps make greater headway than others who have not had such an apprenticeship in life.  That, however, is only one aspect of the problem of the fishing industry.  On the east coast and on the greater part of the south coast too, we have full-time inshore fishermen.  In my constituency we have ports which are known, I suppose, wherever sailors foregather&mdash;Howth, Loughshinny, Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush etc.  For the last 30 years these ports have been little more than a training ground for men who go deep-sea fishing at a later stage in their lives or, if not deep-sea fishing, at least deep-sea sailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> However, when we talk about Norway and such places throughout the world and of building here a fishing industry comparable with that of Norway, are we being realistic?  How can we do it?  The Norwegian people control world markets.  They have had a tradition of exporting fish for generations.  That trade has been built up over a long period of years, has been highly financed and has had a tremendous success because nations such as that have had advantages which we have not enjoyed.  First of all, long before we achieved any degree of independence, they had liberty of movement and liberty of development which was denied to this country.  So much was that the case that they succeeded in building up a huge trade in exporting fish.  It may be sanguinely suggested by Deputies that we could compare with them.  I do not believe we ever can, but I believe that we can get down to the job of creating for our own people who are engaged in this industry a better life, of giving them more security and of removing from their path some of the obstacles which now make inshore fishing such a hazardous and uncertain occupation.  This Bill, I take it, is an attempt to do that.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have expressed the view that we must proceed to develop as quickly as we can a deep-sea fishing fleet, but what are the facts?  In the first instance, the taste for fish in this country is anything but widespread. Has there ever been any real attempt to make the Irish people what is described as &ldquo;fish conscious&rdquo; in the sense of making them want to eat fish on as many days of the week as possible?  There has not been any such attempt to my knowledge, and, therefore, the markets which are available for fish are limited by that fact.  One of the first essentials is that we should try to popularise fish as an edible commodity, as a table delicacy, if you like. It is true that, on the one hand, there are complaints from inland towns and rural areas that people cannot get fish on Fridays.  I myself had the experience some three years ago of attending a meeting of fishermen in Westport on a Friday, and when we went to the local restaurant we could not get fish <Col N="2118" /> for our lunch.  That happened on Friday in Westport, a fishing town.</P>
    <P>While that may be so, while it is true that in inland towns complaints will be heard that fish is never or seldom seen, with all these facts present, there yet remains the outstanding fact that the people of the country have never been properly propagandised, if I might use the word, on the whole question of the consumption of fish.  If, therefore, we decide either to charter or to have built for ourselves a number of deep-sea trawlers what will the effect be? Is it not true that quite often at present we find the market glutted with fish and that inshore fishermen very often find that part of their catches are worthless?  We have had experience of it in County Dublin within recent years&mdash;of men spending a considerable time at sea and considering themselves lucky coming in with fair catches, of having them sent to market and of having either the fish returned as being unfit for consumption, for some reason beyond comprehension, or else of being returned as being unsaleable because of there being too much fish on the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the danger inherent in this Bill.  I would hate to suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary has any such intention in mind because he has lived amongst these people and, by dint of circumstances, he must have the interests of the inshore fishermen at heart and must be answerable to the people who sent him here.  I ask him, however, to consider the dangers inherent in this idea of deep-sea trawlers.  It is very easy to speak of the good they would bring or of the wealth that deep-sea trawling would bring to the country, but when such a policy was put into practice before, shortly after the establishment <Col N="2119" /> of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, what was the result?  My information is that some 20 years ago, perhaps longer, there were five trawlers chartered by the Sea Fisheries Association and operated by that association. They eventually had to be dispensed with, because the scheme resulted in a loss of some £50,000 in operating costs. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

The rate of interest to be borne by each series of land bonds is fixed with a view to securing that the market price of the bonds shall remain at or near par for a reasonable time after they have been created.  Of course all bonds are ultimately redeemable at par.  Any appreciable fluctuation that might occur within a reasonable time after the creation of bonds is due to exceptional and unforeseenable circumstances, and would not warrant a change in the present system of land finance which has given general satisfaction over the years.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the fact that samples of milk fail to passsome of the tests referred to in my reply to his question on 5th March <Col N="2131" /> does not show that the milk is actually dangerous for human consumption but indicates that the milk was not produced and handled in a manner conforming to the hygienic standards specified in the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>The herds, equipment and production methods of holders of licences to produce highest grade milk, and the premises and equipment of holders of licences to pasteurise milk, are subject to inspection by officers of my Department to ensure that the standards specified in the regulations are complied with.  The herds, premises, equipment and production methods of other registered milk producers are similarly subject to inspection by the veterinary officers of the local sanitary authorities.

Surely it is not proper that milk graded highest grade should continue to be foisted on the public under that heading?  We are now, in fact, in the position in which we should reverse the label and have loose milk labelled highest grade and highest grade labelled loose.  The traders who sell milk and collect money for selling highest grade are, in fact, perpetrating a fraud.  Surely the Minister must be justified in taking some steps to rectify the situation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that all the donkeys were subjected to the usual strict veterinary examination immediately prior to shipment from this country to Britain and that they were then in a fully fit condition.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that seed barley and oats are being sold to farmers by merchants at twice the price paid or that excessive profits are being taken by seed merchants generally. If we are to have sufficient seed grain of a proper standard of germination available for sowing requirements the merchants who undertake the assembly, cleaning, storage and distribution of seed grain must be allowed a reasonable profit in addition to the expense of handling.  It is therefore to be expected that the price of the cleaned seed when put on sale in the spring will be substantially higher than the price at which the freshly threshed grain was purchased in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He ended up in the company of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with whom he spent a considerable time and, according to his own report to us, gave comprehensive <Col N="2138" /> undertakings in reply to which he received the very dusty answer that the Chancellor would be glad to have them in writing.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer was in a position to announce in the British House of Commons that he got them in writing and was in the position to tell the members of this House what we did not know, and that was, that the Minister for Finance of Oireachtas Éireann was going to make a statement in the agreed terms &ldquo;to-morrow at 3 o'clock.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And remember there is not a single Deputy in this House who had any knowledge of that interesting fact until the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had to announce it in the British House of Commons that he had it in writing.  The Iron Chancellor from this country was doubtless gratified to read that a murmur of approval was heard throughout the Tory benches.  We have a poor fish of a Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I think it is right to say at this stage that there is no Deputy in this House more solicitous than I to see Great Britain survive any trials through which she may now be called upon to pass.  There is no Deputy more ready to concede and to proclaim that the future of all of us depends on the continued strength of Great Britain and the United States of America.  But it is right to add that even holding those views, Fianna Fáil Deputies and Ministers ought to learn this simple lesson, that the British make hard bargains and they expect those with whom they do business to insist on the bargains being as hard as circumstances may require.  You will get nothing from Whitehall by going there with your hat in your hand, and we have no occasion to go to Whitehall with our hats in our hand at the present time, for we are the creditors and we have put upon the common pool of the sterling area a lighter burden than any other participant in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to tell this House: Did he ask the British Chancellor of the Exchequer as our banker, to render an account to him, the Irish Minister for Finance, of what drawings have been made on the dollar resources <Col N="2139" /> of the sterling pool by the participants in it since June, 1948, so that their performance during the last four difficult years might be compared, when it was being determined what future access should be had to those resources, with the performance of this country which was in a position to say this: Since June, 1948, we never drew one single dollar effectively from the dollar resources of the sterling pool though every penny that was owing to us was owing to us on foot of goods sold and delivered to the British people when they could get them nowhere else; whereas the demands made by others on the dollar resources of the sterling pool were not infrequently made on foot of debts created by services rendered to the armed forces of Great Britain while they were defending the independence of those countries against the attack of the Nazi combination.</P>
    <P>We are in this astonishing position at the present time that we are told that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has warned our Minister for Finance that all he will get is 16,000,000 dollars for the second half of this year.  But the Minister that brings back that ultimatum is wholly unable to tell us what became of the thousands of millions of dollars that were in the sterling pool 12 months ago; who got them; and if all the other participants in this joint venture drew large sums in dollars during the past four years and we drew none, is there no account to be taken of that now in agreeing amongst ourselves as to the proportion of access to dollars which the participants in the sterling area shall have?  Is there a Fianna Fáil Deputy in this House who feels that in failing to put Oireachtas Éireann in possession of that information, our Minister for Finance has failed most deplorably, when you realise that every other Minister for Finance has reported faithfully to his Parliament whether it is in Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, or Egypt, as to what the future holds and why?  I want that information and I think I am entitled to have it and, unless this Parliament has lost all sense of responsibility, it should want <Col N="2140" /> that information and it should insist on having it.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, our Iron Chancellor's journey to London was not wholly in vain.  He learned one lesson and that was how to operate a Tory bluff in Ireland.  The only mistake he makes is that he has not got the technique to play the bluff out to its logical end.</P>
    <P>The whole world has rung for the past three months with the thunderous descriptions of the appalling confusion of public finance in Great Britain.  The whole world was led to believe that the foundations of Britain's economy were crumbling and that anyone associated with the sterling group stood in peril of their lives.  The whole world was told that nothing but the most revolutionary and ferocious austerity could conceivably pull Great Britain back from the brink of the catastrophe towards which she had been unwittingly led.  The whole world stood still when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer unfolded his Budget which everyone anticipated would be of a character unprecedented in British finance.</P>
    <P>This mountain having roared, rumbled, smoked and groaned for three months, gave birth to the British Budget, the net effect of which was to reduce taxation by £225,000,000 and raise the bank rate.  That is what the whole hullabaloo was designed to achieve, to raise the bank rate, and that is the lesson our Iron Chancellor was taught in London.  That is the fraud he is trying to put on our people, but the poor, silly little man did not understand that if you wanted to put that over you should not take a Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>He thought that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was making a magnificent gesture in setting the British Budget, for the first time in 70 years, before the end of the financial year.  It never dawned on him that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was an astute man who knew you could not get away with that kind of financial burden if you had to show your hand on the Vote on Account and be held up to public ridicule between that date and the date on which you introduced your Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> He increased the pensions.  He increased the family allowances.  He removed 2,000,000 citizens from the ambit of the income-tax.  He increased marriage allowances and children's allowances, and everyone so busily rejoicing that the threads and thongs were made of silken wool.  Nobody adverted to the fact that for the last six months we were told that unless everybody in Great Britain was stripped naked the British would not survive.  Our poor little performer flapped in here yesterday and thinks he is doing the devil in the bag when he repeats the lesson that he learned in Whitehall, and he is all bewildered because it does not seem to have clicked.  It has not dawned on him yet that the reason for that is that he did not go the right way about it.</P>
    <P>Can you imagine, Sir, I will not say in any civilised, but in any known country, a Minister for Finance coming into Parliament and proclaiming that he has in anticipation a revenue of £85,000,000 with a deficit of £50,000,000 sterling?  If the recently appointed Minister for Finance of the recently established State in West Africa had come in in a loin-cloth with a ring in his nose to introduce a Budget on those lines friends would have sympathetically shaken their heads and said that he must have misread his brief and that, perhaps, he would do better the next time.  When the Minister for Finance of this State holds this Parliament up to the ridicule of the world as a deliberative assembly into which the Chancellor could come with a revenue of £85,000,000 and a deficit of £50,000,000 nobody believes him here, but that is not what the world will say.</P>
    <P>People who talk in Dáil Éireann or in Strasbourg should remember that their audience does not know them as well as we do.  This Book of Estimates was designed to deceive.  It was designed to do more than that, and the pathetic effort of these silly men to conceal the nigger in the wood pile is contemptible.  Do not Deputies know why the double Budget has been dropped?</P>
    <P>When we introduced the principle of the double Budget we indicated on the <Col N="2142" /> Book of Estimates every year the items which this Government regarded as capital items eligible for financing by borrowing.  The moment we so certified, those items were brought within the grip of the appropriate section of the Finance Act, 1950, which imposes on the Government the duty of charging on the Central Fund forthwith a 30-year annuity for the amortisation of any money so borrowed.  Mix these items up in the Supply Services without distinguishing them in that way and the borrowing becomes a charge on the ordinary national debt, the amortisation provision of which extends to somewhere between 60 and 70 years.</P>
    <P>These performers described their predecessors as profligate and irresponsible. The difference between our procedure and their procedure is that, before the Vote on Account was submitted to this House, every Deputy was notified in black and white of every item in the Book of Estimates in respect of which we thought ourselves justified in borrowing.  Every Deputy in this House was notified in advance of the charge that would follow on the Central Fund for the ensuing 30 years in respect of the items set out and, in the light of that information, every Deputy in this House could discuss not only the Budget but the Vote on Account itself.  Is there a Deputy on either side of this House to-day who can tell me what items in that Book of Estimates it is proposed to finance by borrowing?</P>

That is what your own Minister says he has got to get&mdash;£50,000,000 over and above the revenue which is to be derived from the taxes at present in operation.  If you put back all the taxes that the Fianna Fáil Party put on four years ago, and which we took off, they will only yield you £10,000,000 a year.  If you remove all the food subsidies you will have only £25,000,000 a year. Where are you going to get the other half of the alleged deficit?  Will you <Col N="2143" /> not stand like fools at your own street corners?  Will you not have to confess to your own neighbours that you are treated like fools&mdash;that you are told to crawl into the Lobby in defence of a proposition that we should budget this year for a deficit of £50,000,000 which national solvency requires the Oireachtas to meet out of current taxation? Are the Deputies of Fianna Fáil not ashamed at being sent down to look like pantaloons throughout the country to sell that story to the people who were fools enough to vote for them? Will Deputy Burke tell me what he will say in Balbriggan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us pause a moment. Every country in Europe, including Great Britain, is at present faced with the obligation of employing from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of their national income in rearming.  Ireland, by her own decision, is not committed to the outlay of 1 per cent. of her national income for that end.  Now, if we do not choose to share those burdens, let us not go through the motions of making provision to do so. It is sheer masquerading to impose on yourself rigours and austerity appropriate to the expenditure of 15 per cent. of your national income on unproductive armaments when, in fact, you are not spending .5 of 1 per cent. on them.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's remedy for an in-balance of trade is to cut down imports.  It is the economic schizophrenia that I described in this House before.  The schizophrenic is a man whose first symptom is that he finds it disagreeable to walk abroad. His next stage is that he does not like to leave the parlour but he will still come downstairs.  The third stage is that he does not like to leave his bedroom. Then comes the time when he thinks it is safer to stay in bed.  The last stage is when he disappears under the bed-clothes and is seen no more except in his bed-jacket.  That is Fianna Fáil policy&mdash;to be comfortably and warmly clad and to give up buying clothes suitable for going abroad. Shortly we will be told that we ought to stop buying waistcoats and trousers and that we should stay upstairs in our dressing-gowns.  Thereafter we will be advised to jettison the dressing-gowns and stay in our pyjamas and keep in the warmth of the bed&mdash;and after that we will be told that once you go under the bed-clothes it does not matter what you have on or whether you have nothing on at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the inter-Party Government was very different.  It rejected the Fianna Fáil view that any standard of living, superior to that appropriate to a peasant, was too good for our people to aspire to.  We ventured to believe <Col N="2146" /> that our people, with the resources at the disposal of this nation, were entitled to a decent standard of living, subject to the certainty that they would never be rich, and we set out to get that for them in the full confidence that the safest place for us to invest the savings of this nation was in the land of Ireland and in the people who lived and got their living on it.  The Fianna Fáil philosophy was that the safest place for our people's savings was in the freezer of sterling assets.  The man who has been sitting on that store for the last 48 hours has a very wet seat to his pants, for our sterling assets&mdash;and there are nearly £450,000,000 of them &mdash; have lost in the last 48 hours very nearly enough to meet the deficit on Deputy MacEntee's Budget.</P>
      <P>I remember once describing Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance in a previous Administration, as reminding me of the elderly grocer in a rural village, who had passed his apotheosis, who had forgotten his salad dreams of enterprise and who determined to play safe.  There was a swarm of moribund bluebottles gathered in his shop window.  His respectable black coat and hard hat grew greener with the passing of every day but he rejoiced in the knowledge that he had his store of good bank notes in a jam-pot up the chimney.  He ultimately faded out and the fire burned the jam-pot and the store of notes and there was nothing left.</P>

I want to show the House now that, unless Fianna Fáil at this stage successfully wrecks what the inter-Party Government put under way, this <Col N="2147" /> country can continue to be, and in greater degree become, the most prosperous nation in Europe.  I want to go on record now as saying that at this moment Ireland is the most prosperous nation in Europe, with the greatest wealth potential of any agricultural country in the world, and nothing but the obscurantist folly of the Fianna Fáil Party, the disintegrating Fianna Fáil Party, can prevent this country realising that eminently desirable state.</P>

The remaining 6,000,000 dollars covered 16 other items&rdquo;&mdash;which he mentioned. The first of these items was peas and beans (dried).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it a disgrace that we should spend dollars, scarce as they are, in buying peas and beans dried, and sugar for conversion into fondant and sweetened fat for export to Britain to get sterling.  These allocations of dollars were made by the Minister for Finance.  He told us to-day or yesterday that this nation must steel itself for the severest austerity lest&mdash;mark this&mdash;in the words of the Minister for Justice we should all have to go on short commons and lest, in the words of my illuminated successor, the Minister for Agriculture, the people of Ireland should go hungry for want of food.  And we are exporting food to the value of £50,000,000 sterling per annum!</P>
      <P>The policy of the inter-Party Government was to balance the trade of this country by expanding our production and exports so that we could buy and pay for whatever our people require.  To that end we surveyed the Irish economic scene and came to the conclusion which every economist has come to who has ever studied Irish economics, and that was that, in the last analysis, this country has one natural resource and one only, and that is the land and the people who live on it.  The standard of living of our people, whether they live in town, city or country, is ultimately fixed by the standard of prosperity enjoyed by the agricultural community.  If the farmer is well off, everyone in Ireland will be well off, and if the farmer is poor everyone in Ireland will be poor, too, with this distinction: that no matter how poor the farmer gets on his holding he will never go hungry, but the city dweller or the town dweller, if he lets agriculture sink too low, will know hunger and destitution because the source of his livelihood will be gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of the livelihood of everyone, in every town and city in Ireland, <Col N="2149" /> is the profit earned on our land, and with that in mind we set out to do three things: (1) to undo the dereliction of the land of Ireland which had been brought about very largely by 15 disastrous years of Fianna Fáil government; (2) to re-equip our people with the machinery and buildings requisite profitably to work their lands, and (3) through the parish plan to make available to the smallest farmer in Ireland, as well as to the largest, the best expert advice on every agricultural problem that could be made available, no matter how rich or wealthy the seeker for knowledge might be, and to put within the reach of the smallest farmer in Ireland the best expert advice that money could purchase in any corner of the world. We had the men here, we had the knowledge, we had the resources and we had the means to put them in the honourable employment of their own labour, and those men would have gloried in the opportunity of serving as their neighbours' servants.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the land was undertaken under the land rehabilitation project.  Let me refer again to the kept newspaper of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fianna Fáil Pravda which describes itself, God save the mark, as the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Now, the controlling director of this paper is the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of the <i>Irish Press</i> does not come into this Vote on Account, and I cannot see that there should be any discussion about control of the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person reading the paper would expect that the information contained in it was of a <i>quasi</i> official kind.  It has ready access to many Deputies of this House to check whatever information it publishes. When our Government put its hand to the rehabilitation of the land, this is what the kept newspaper had to say about it in its edition of October 24th, 1951:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is pointed out, for example, that many of the public works undertaken did not promise a return that would compensate us for the <Col N="2150" /> income on the external assets which they used up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark these words &ldquo;a return that would compensate us for the income on the external assets which they used up.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This criticism seems to be particularly relevant to Mr. Dillon's &lsquo;land project&rsquo; under which as much as £500 an acre has been spent in reclaiming land which will scarcely yield an annual return of 1 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I know the body of disinterested public servants who devote their working life to the operation of that project, and who have made of it the splendid success it is.  The duty devolved on me, when their own Minister, Deputy Tom Walsh, would not go to their defence and insist on that rag recanting that lie, of raising the matter here.  I had to ask the Minister for Agriculture, on whose staff those public servants work, as to whether £500 had been spent per acre, and this was his generous rejoinder: &ldquo;The most that has yet been spent per acre is £100.&rdquo;  Now, that is the Minister for Agriculture speaking of his own Department.  I put down a further question to ask on how many, and where, was £100 per acre spent, and the answer was: &ldquo;On the first acre reclaimed in Connemara.&rdquo;  He had charged up to that acre reclaimed in Connemara the whole staff, the transfer of machinery and the establishment of the entire organisation to deal with the whole Connemara area, and he thought it becoming in an Irish Minister to come into this House with that rejoinder, that the most that has been spent to date is £100 per acre.</P>
    <P>I hope that his colleagues are proud of that performance.  The fact is that the money invested in the land rehabilitation project to date enables us to look on 200,000 acres of Irish land that was unproductive 18 months ago, and which is now producing crops or is in the actual process of being rehabilitated to that end.  Is the Fianna Fáil Party proud of that achievement?  They are not, for they did everything they could do to frustrate it, and Deputy Bartley was foremost in the mob that tried to denigrate the Connemara <Col N="2151" /> scheme.  I asked him a month ago to go down to Roundstone or Costello and repeat there what he had said here; and I have no news to date that he accepted the invitation.</P>

If that body wants to challenge that I will be glad to avail of any challenge they issue.</P>
      <P>There is no statistician in the world, outside O.E.E.C., who can tell what methods that body employs in order to arrive at the figures it produces.  One method is that a cow is a cow whereever she is.  The result of that is that a hairy ould warrior harnessed to a plough in Brittany is valued at the same money as a three-year-old heifer sold to a Dublin butcher for £60.  You would not take 60/- to cart the ould warrior harnessed to the plough and bury her for the price of the hide, and you would not sell the three-year-old heifer in Dublin for less than £60.  I venture to swear that the natty Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did not get his telegraphic mind properly around that statistic.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil say they have produced for our people an abundance of food from the soil of Ireland which compared favourably with anything that had been done since they left office, and that during the war years they had created a situation in which the Irish people made themselves self-sufficient in respect of cereals.  What are the facts?  Taking the seven-year period from 1939 to 1945, inclusive, the average annual imports of wheat were 4,252,000 cwt. Taking the years 1946, 1947, 1948, 1950, 1951, inclusive, the average annual imports of wheat during those years were 3,400,000 cwt., so that during the entire war period the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2155" /> Government brought into this country on an average 800,000 cwt. of wheat more per annum than were brought in in the six years afterwards.  Those figures were given to me by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann, but that is not half the story.</P>
      <P>If I can find them I would like to give Deputies the figures for oats and barley.  Remember the substance of the indictment against us is that we dissipated the national resources buying oats and barley that Fianna Fáil had got grown in Ireland and never had to seek outside.  I refer, Sir, to Volume 129, No. 10.  I asked the Taoiseach to tell me the average quantities in cwts. of barley (other than seed-barley) imported during the three-year period 1945-1947, inclusive, and during the four-year period 1948 to 1951.  The answer is that in the three Fianna Fáil years, 1945 to 1947, the annual average imports of barley were 720,788 cwt.  In the four years of inter-Party Government the average annual imports were 412,421 cwt., so that in each of the three years after the war, while Fianna Fáil was in office, they brought in 300,000 cwt. of barley more each year than was brought in by our people during the four years when we were in office.</P>

      <P>Is it not amazing what brazen effrontery will get away with? I have given the House the figures for gross agricultural production.  I warned the members of this House to beware of the figure for net agricultural production because they would want to inform themselves before they dwelt on that figure how it is arrived at.  Net agricultural production is the difference between what the farmer brings on to his farm and what the farmer sells from his farm, so that the way to get maximum net production for the farm is to sell all the live stock off it, all the implements, all the crops, all the fertility of the soil, pull the thatch off the house, and get out on the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And do Robinson Crusoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And you get the maximum net production which it is possible to derive from a farm of land in that particular year.  The gross agricultural production is the total production of the farm with nothing deducted for expenses.  There you will find in order to get the gross production a farmer must bring on to his land feeding stuffs and fertilisers, so that the manurial content of his land is maintained and improved.</P>
      <P>It is true there are no people in Ireland who have given a more exquisite demonstration of the technique of net agricultural production than some of the most prominent members of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They bought farms in Tipperary and took four crops of wheat out of them. Then they passed the land on to the Land Commission in exchange for a farm in County Meath.  They got seven crops out of that, sold it and bought another farm in North County Dublin.  In that way they had net agricultural production from Tipperary and from Meath for those 11 years that was the admiration of Deputy Cogan.  But it was lucky for Deputy Cogan that he was not allotted a parcel of land in County Meath on a farm the Land Commission acquired, which was a net production farm, for if he were, he would have died of starvation in the first two years he was left there, because the land he <Col N="2157" /> would have got would not grow weeds.  The man who sold it to the Land Commission was a rich man. His net production had been a dazzling performance, but the community to which he belonged was the poorer for his personal aggrandisement. I commend Deputy Cogan a careful study of the underlying factors of the statistical figures of which he is so fond, and I feel sure he will resolve that he will never go down to posterity as a net production farmer, for, if he should, he will come to be known as the locust of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in general terms, at least that is what I was told when I was speaking.  However, apparently Deputy Dillon is not speaking in general terms.  Is that in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we must conserve our dollars in order to bring in broken-down motor-cars from the United States, not to supply demand but to maintain employment. It is the Fianna Fáil doctrine that nothing should be made in this country that could be made better or cheaper some place else.  That was not the policy of the inter-Party Government. I would invite the Fianna Fáil Deputies to go down and have a look at a factory in Carrick-on-Suir and at other factories in this country which employ hundreds of people and whose entire products are profitably exported to the tune of over £4,000,000 per annum, having paid the farmers 3d. per gallon more for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies should also go down and have a look at the apple-packing station in Dungarvan which employs a large number of people at the present time and which can give to those who supply them with apples from Tipperary and the surrounding counties a higher price than they ever got before.  That is the kind of employment the Government <Col N="2158" /> of which I was a member was proud to provide for our people and up to the day we left office one of our problems was that we were short of labour in Ireland and were crying out for the men to come home, and they came home.  The last two men to whom I spoke before I left office and who were working on the land project had returned from foreign parts.  One of these men had been employed on the ground nuts scheme in North Africa, to which he had gone from County Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped the Parliamentary Secretary would do me the courtesy of listening to me again.  One of these men had gone from Mayo to the ground nuts scheme in North Africa and was glad to come home.  We were prepared to give employment to such people and the enduring problem with which we had to grapple was to try to get Irishmen to come back home and to use their skill to serve their own people.  We did not go in for shipping carpenters and plasterers to Liverpool on every boat because we were afraid to employ them in providing houses for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does nobody realise what this country is capable of doing if it only gets the chance?  Does nobody know what our exports of cattle were in the last 12 months if one combines those exported on the hoof with those exported as carcase meat?  When I came into office our annual exports of cattle were in the area of 440,000 head.  In 1950, combining fat cattle, store cattle and those processed and dressed, the figure amounted to 611,531.  The money paid for them was £29,500,000, while we had to spend £750,000 in 1949 and again in 1950 purchasing hides for the tanneries of Ireland.  To-day the problem with which the Fianna Fáil Government finds itself incapable of grappling is that we have in Ireland a surplus of hides for export to the most profitable market we can find for them. The capacity of our abattoirs has vastly expanded, but it is still grossly <Col N="2159" /> overtaxed.  The raw material of our tanneries is not only available in sufficient quantities, but we have an unmanageable surplus now ready for export to profitable markets.  The obligation to import is banished for all time.  Twenty-nine million pounds or £30,000,000 are coming in for a trade which, unless those lunatics across disrupt it, will rise from 600,000 head to 1,000,000 head in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We are told in this House that Irish agriculture is stagnant.  What other country in Europe will produce a record to compare with it?  Who could ever dream in Ireland that we would see before us, in a realisable time, the opportunity to supplant the Argentine in the British market, and that we would create a situation in which not a single carcase of beef would be brought to that country from the Argentine?  Let me sound this note of warning.  The carcase meat trade to the United States of America is a valuable one, which yielded us nearly £3,000,000 this year.  However, there is a dangerous snag in it, and I am warning those engaged in it to watch out.  There is a permanent remunerative market in the United States for all the manufactured meat which we may be in a position to send them, but there is no permanent trade there for prime beef carcase.  If one studies the history of the American meat trade there is a record there for over seven years that during a period of shortage the Americans are prepared to receive meat from any quarter of Europe. However, should their domestic resources approximate to their requirements they are ruthless in shutting off the markets.  However, circumstances are such at present that we can profitably supply them.</P>
    <P>That is a trade which can safely be extended and developed, but there is no permanent future in a United States market for prime beef.  There may be a useful profit to be picked up there now.  However, it is a consoling thought to have that if the United States market fails, under the 1948 Trade Agreement, until the Irish Government revokes that agreement, we shall get for every cwt. of meat <Col N="2160" /> exported to Great Britain from this country, on the hoof or on the hook, the price guaranteed to give the British farmer a profit that will please him, and we can leave it to the British farmer to fight our battles with the British consumer from this time onwards.</P>

      <P>It was from a report of the Prices Commission that I collected that information.  The Deputy will find it in the public proceedings before the commission during the last few weeks. Balbriggan is not so far away as all that.</P>

      <P>I think I can tell the Deputy.  We can do so if we cease being afraid to develop our own country and stop looking all round the world for some other place wherein to invest our wealth.  There is no safer place in the world to-day where the most conservative financier in Ireland can invest his money than in the land and the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a question&mdash;I expect I shall be called upon to move the adjournment in a few moments&mdash;but I am going to find out before I sit down what has become of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  I want to tell this House how and why we spent the Marshall Aid dollars and the great advantage that has accrued to our country and to this present wretched administration as a result of the prescience displayed by us in our outlay of those moneys when we had control of them.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19th March, 1952.</P>
