      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been directed to statements made by the Minister for Finance at a public meeting in Manor Street, Dublin, in reference to Mr. Eisenhower, President Elect of the United States of America; and, if so, whether he has any statement to make in this regard, and whether these statements correctly represent the views of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report attributing to the Minister for Finance a statement on a matter arising out of a speech by Mr. Eisenhower. The statement attributed to the Minister was merely a comment expressing a personal opinion, and the question whether or not it represents the views of the Government does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste think that this was a suitable opinion to express, that it was suitable to the people of this country that the President Elect of the United States should be held up as a war-monger and that, in that way, the good relations that exist between us and our friends in the United States should be strained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to a letter in a provincial newspaper of 24th October, 1952, from a leading tea merchant in Cork stating that tea could be sold at 1/6 per lb. less than the present price were it not for the restrictions imposed by him; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the letter to which the Deputy refers.  There is nothing which I can usefully add to the statements on the subject of tea prices which I made in Dáil Éireann in reply to questions on the 22nd October, 1952. The price at which tea can be sold varies with its quality.  There is no reason to believe that tea importers in this country cannot purchase teas in countries of origin as advantageously as importers in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate now that the Department of Industry and Commerce will be conducted sensibly, so that the Irish people can buy tea at a price 1/6 per lb. less than they are paying at the present time?  It was the question of hides yesterday, it is the question of tea to-day and, God only knows, what it will be to-morrow.  The best way to get out of the difficulty is to have common sense in the Department and let these people compete with each other in the open market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the high percentage of acceptances shown by the local and official canvass carried out in connection with the rural electrification scheme in the townlands of Windgap, Killongford and Glanmore, Dungarvan, he will request the Electricity Supply Board to link up these districts with the Shandon area, Dungarvan, to which they are convenient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Electricity Supply Board that it is investigating the possibility of supplying electricity to the townlands of Windgap, Killongford and Glanmore, by way of an extension to the Shandon area.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the most recent review of areas in the Tralee district for development under the <Col N="1273" /> rural electrification scheme revealed that the Lixnaw area had failed to qualify for selection in priority to other areas in the same district.  While the question of the development of the Lixnaw area in competition with other areas will be reconsidered from time to time by the Electricity Supply Board, the board is unable to state when development is likely to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the question of the selection of the Garristown area, which includes Kilmoon, and the Ardcath area, which includes Naul, for development under the rural electrification scheme has been considered on a number of occasions but has had to be postponed because of the unsatisfactory financial return.  I am also informed that a recanvass of the residents has recently been made and that the results will be taken into account when the areas will be reconsidered for selection towards the end of this year. It is not possible at this stage to say when the development of the areas is likely to take place.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been directed to a statement by the secretary of his Department which appeared in a daily newspaper on 4th November, 1952, to the effect that in the Budget for the current financial year revenue from tobacco duties has been estimated at £22,515,000 but had not reached £10,478,000 for the first six months of the year, that revenue from duties on spirits and on motor car parts which were expected to produce respectively in a full year £7,500,000 and £1,050,000 had produced only £2,679,000 and £453,000 in the half-year, and, further, that revenue from spirits showed no signs of recovery due to declining consumption which appeared to be permanent and that it was manifest that the point of diminishing returns on taxation rates had been reached; and, if so, if he will consider the introduction of proposals for legislation to repeal the increases in taxation contained in this year's Budget in order to improve the country's economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the statements referred to which were to the effect that, on the basis of experience for the first half of the financial year, it was feared that there would be a substantial shortfall in revenue as compared with budgetary expectations, while, on the other hand, current expenditure seemed likely to be considerably in excess of the Budget estimates. It was pointed out that predictions at this time of the year were necessarily fallible and that the prospective shortfall in revenue might be reduced by a recovery in consumption.  It was also pointed out, however, that, even on the unlikely assumption that both revenue and expenditure proved exactly to correspond with the Budget provisions, there would be no surplus in the Exchequer to meet additional payments.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to add to these statements except to say that they provide no basis for the general inference which Deputy Donnellan seeks to draw from them regarding taxation rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> I have already stated, in reply to a question by Deputy Briscoe on 30th October, 1952, that there is no intention of introducing a Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>In view of the position in regard to current revenue and expenditure, I trust that the Deputies who have asked these questions and their colleagues will now realise how unfounded were the allegations of the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy McGilligan who with others occupied hours of parliamentary time in contending that the Budget contained, in Deputy Costello's words&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;proposals which will, in effect, result in raising from the already overburdened taxpayers of this country a sum of from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 unnecessary taxation&rdquo; (Dáil Debates, Volume 130, No. 9, column 1269, 3rd April, 1952).</P>

Secondly, I want to refer him to Question No. 13 where the secretary of his Department is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that revenue from spirits showed no signs of recovery due to declining consumption which appeared to be permanent and that it was manifest that the point of diminishing returns from taxation rates had been reached.&rdquo;</P>

For example, under subhead (1)&mdash;lands offered to the forestry branch&mdash;the figure that could be given there might bear no resemblance or very little resemblance to the area which, in fact, is actually being offered.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand, I hope, that in order to get a proper view of all the types of cases which could arise it was necessary to examine all the correspondence and, indeed, it happened to be helpful to meet a number of people who were affected.  If an earlier decision had been conveyed it would not have been as comprehensive as the present decision.  While I was as anxious as any Deputy to have the matter cleared up I was also anxious to ensure that when a definite instruction was sent out it would cover the greatest possible number of all those who would be <Col N="1295" /> affected in all conceivable circumstances. I have done that as quickly as I could but if there should be any cases&mdash;I do not think that there can be many&mdash;outside the range I have mentioned these too can be considered. The instruction, however, will segregate the wheat from the chaff and allow local bodies to use their own judgment based on that instruction.  In reply to Deputy General Mulcahy, money will be made available at the rates of interest which prevailed prior to the 6th October, 1952.</P>

The turkey population has increased by from 20 to 25 per cent. as compared with last year and there is also an increase of 30 per cent. in the turkey population of England.  Last year we sent out over 4,000 tons of turkey and it is estimated that this year we will be sending out 5,000 tons. We have to take cognisance of the fact that we are putting the turkeys into a market that has much more turkeys this year than last year and the best price that we can hope to obtain there is the best price that is paid by the English consumer.  Our information is that that price will drop this year by at least 7d. per lb.  That is the reason why we have to fix a price of 3/6 a lb.</P>

Import licences are being granted by my Department to merchants who have arranged for the purchase of seed from British merchants who have been granted export licences.

It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, to ask the poultry keepers in the Gaeltacht areas to pay 5/- per dozen for their chicks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 1, sub-section (1), line 9, after &ldquo;pound&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, with the exception of persons whose main occupation or employment involves the driving of hackney and taxi cars, motor lorries, motor vans, or buses, in which cases the duty shall be ten shillings as heretofore.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At a time when already the workers employed in the transport industry are suffering from so many handicaps and finding it difficult to get employment, or to earn sufficient to keep them, I submit that the increase in drivers' licence fees is completely unjustified. In the majority of cases, those who will have to pay the increases will be the workers themselves.  This is an additional imposition upon them.  It will have the effect of reducing their real wages still further.  That is my purpose in moving this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 covers substantially the same point as that covered in Deputy MacBride's amendment. My amendment is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In page 1, sub-section (1) line 9, after &ldquo;pound&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that where a person is employed as a driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle or is the owner-driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle, which is regularly used for hire, he shall be entitled to a driving licence on payment of ten shillings per year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is grossly unfair of the Minister to seek to exact 100 per cent. increase in respect of driving licences on ordinary workers who follow the livelihood of driving mechanically-propelled vehicles.  One might understand the attitude of the Minister in saying that he was going to get the additional tax from those who used motor cars, that being <i>prima facie</i> evidence that they had some sources of wealth; but to tax the unfortunate driver and ask him to pay 100 per cent. increase is grossly unfair.  In fact, I have not been able to see why the ordinary driver should have to pay any licence fee at all.  It ought to be accepted as the right of every person following the livelihood of motor driver that he has a right to drive a vehicle, as it is the source of his employment. If the State, for any reason, wants to identify him as the driver, they ought to give him a certificate that he is So-and-so and is authorised to drive a vehicle.  To ask him to pay 10/- for it is an unfair imposition in any circumstances but when the 10/- becomes the subject of suitable taxation then it is going to be aimed at from time to time as a means of raising money for purposes completely unconnected with and of no benefit to the man who is actually engaged in driving a car.  If the money was to be used for improving his social status as a motor driver or conferring on him individually or on his class alone some particular benefits, one could understand his being required to pay 10/- or £1, but the £1 is to be levied from him and utilised for purposes completely unconnected with his position as a motor driver.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Fianna Fáil Party that it is inequitable to charge 100 per cent. increase in driving licences in the very same year as they remit £140,000 as a free gift to the dance-hall owners.  On <Col N="1312" /> the one hand you have persons driving motor cars or lorries for a livelihood and you ask them to pay another 10/- a year for their licences, while on the other hand, the State acts the generous uncle with a small group of dance-hall proprietors and hands them back £140,000.  I think that this tax on motor drivers and hackney owners is unfair and that in respect of these classes the Minister should leave the fee at 10/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little that I can add to what I have said already in the course of the long discussion we have had on this matter.  I do not mind the exaggerated description that is given to this proposition&mdash;I suppose it is only natural to expect it&mdash;but I must bring the minds of Deputies back again to the fact that the licence fee was fixed at 10/- in 1926.  It was actually fixed then, in the Resolution which passed through this House, at £1 but it was afterwards reduced to 10/- on amendment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Resolution is to build up the Road Fund and, small as an increase of this nature may appear to be, it represents a considerable sum of money, without imposing any real hardship on anybody.  No workman wants to have to give more for the spade, the shovel or the pick that he uses; nobody wants to pay more for any of the instruments or tools of his trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is part of it, it is the same as a man using a hay fork and a rake&mdash;the rake helps to complete the equipment.  If it were reasonable in 1926 to propose here that the licence fee should be £1, I think that, having regard to the changes that have taken place since then, having regard to the increased cost of road improvement and road maintenance, having regard to the increase in wages and the increased cost of materials, and in addition, having regard to the daily demands made upon us for increased grants of one kind or another for the improvement of our roads, this increase could not be properly described here as unreasonable. I do not think that those who are advancing these arguments are really serious.  They just seem to think that they have a duty as members of an opposition to paint this sort of picture.  It is a picture that nobody believes in outside, that nobody accepts outside.  It is carrying discussion and criticism to such a degree of extravagance that it almost reduces criticism to futility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surprised me by stating that the argument put forward by Deputies Norton and MacBride and by others was not accepted by anybody outside the House.  Surely the Minister himself has received a strong and detailed protest from the Hackney-Car Owners' Association on this matter.  As far as I am led to believe, that body represents about 300 persons who live in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>Apart from the attempt to increase it, the existing tax is one for a licence for an individual citizen in order to enable him to earn his livelihood. If the Minister wants more money for deserving purposes, such as improving the roads, there are other sections of the community who are in a much better position to provide it than those upon whom this additional tax is put. These people have to earn their livelihood driving hackney-cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister said that nobody outside the House accepts the point of view put forward by the previous speakers to-day and on other occasions proves that the Minister did <Col N="1314" /> not give this matter any consideration. It proves, in my opinion, that he did not read the protest which was sent to him and the officials of his Department by the Hackney-Car Owners' Association and by other persons interested in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I already raised this matter in the debate on the Second Stage.  The position in the country is that if a man is deaf, dumb and blind, he can get a driving licence.  I think that is scandalous.  I am quite willing to support any amendment which will ensure that before any licence is issued whether it costs £1 or 10/-, people applying for driving licences will have to undergo a test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the other two amendments, I was approached by several people who drive taxis and lorries.  I have not heard much criticism from them in connection with the increase in the charge for the driving licence but I have heard plenty with regard to the general increase in taxation for the vehicles.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with them in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I do not see, however, much reason for the two amendments because to my mind the House is seeking to separate all types of drivers under the amendments proposed by Deputies Norton and MacBride.  To my mind it is a question again of a means test. Under these amendments we are now going to segregate applicants according to their livelihood and make them ask: &ldquo;Please can I have a driver's licence for 10/- because I am driving a truck?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see all the drivers' <Col N="1316" /> licences cost 10/-.  I do not like to see exceptions being made in regard to sections of the community.  There should be the same treatment for all sections. If you are going to stand by a principle of equality for all our citizens, it is most unjust to try and seek a few votes from the minority by suggesting to them that they should be entitled to special privileges on the question of the issue of drivers' licences.  I do not think these amendments deserve much consideration from the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Part II of the Schedule, to delete paragraph 3 (a) (ii), lines 23 to 25, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(ii)  for the haulage of similar goods for other persons whose only or chief occupation is farming and whose valuation does not exceed £50, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  for the haulage of similar goods for other farmers provided that such goods are not hauled for reward, or</P>
      <P>(iv)  for the haulage of milk products to and from creameries, or</P>
      <P>(v)  for the haulage of turf for consumption on a farm or other rural premises.</P>
      <P>The amendments to Section 3 (a) of Part II of the Resolution are necessary for the purpose of adapting the motor tax code to modern conditions.  The Minister has so far not attempted to do so.  He has copied almost word for word the English Roads Act of 1920, which was drafted to meet English conditions in the 1920 period, and he has not seriously tried to consider present-day conditions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In his White Paper the Minister recognises the importance of the tractor.  He says, on page 8:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These vehicles are tending in <Col N="1321" /> many areas to replace the farmer's horse and cart.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an incomplete statement. Tractors are also a substitute for labour which is no longer available and an alternative to the drudgery which was part and parcel of the small farmer's life.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in Section 3 (a) (ii) and 3 (b), has attempted in a half-hearted manner to deal with this matter.  He fails, however, to make available to the numberless small farmers who cannot afford a tractor the cheap and ready transport provided by the tractor and trailer.  Under his scheme the rich and well-to-do farmer can bring his turf home from the bog, can bring his calves, etc., to the fair and his milk to the creamery, but the man without a tractor of his own is condemned to the old drudgery and labour.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (a) (i) reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, apart from this paragraph, sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 4 of Part I of this Schedule would apply to a vehicle, that sub-paragraph shall not apply to it (and sub-paragraph (d) of that paragraph shall apply to it accordingly) unless the person taking out the licence shows to the satisfaction of the licensing authority either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that his only or chief occupation is farming and that the vehicle is used only occasionally on public roads and then only&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  for the haulage of the produce of his farm and articles required for the farm, including the farmhouse and farm buildings, but excluding the haulage of fuel if being transported as a commodity for sale, or&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section is probably the most non-moral section ever inserted in any Government document.  It is a Government sponsored invitation to the public to evade the law.  The Minister knows and every Deputy in the House knows that the haulage contemplated in the section will not and in practice cannot be done without reward.  The reward may not always be cash, it may be in <Col N="1322" /> work or it may be in kind but to suggest that a man with a tractor should at his own expense bring home his neighbour's turf from the bog for nothing is nonsense.  There is an old saying in the country that money makes the mare go.</P>
    <P>This evasion of an unjust law may be all right until some unfortunate farmer is caught.  I can well picture a half-dozen Cavan farmers up at the local District Court.  What will their position be?  They and each of them will have the choice of seeing their friend the tractor owner fined £100 plus other penalties or go into the witness box and take a false oath.  They might even be fined themselves for aiding and abetting.  I do not believe that Satan could have designed a more inviting road to lies and perjury.  The Minister talks a lot about the Government's courage in facing financial facts.  Will they now face the moral facts for a change?</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister may say that he cannot accept my amendments as they involve a repeal of a section of the Road Transport Act. That may be so but it does not prevent him introducing such an amendment or undertaking to do so within a limited time and in the interval there is nothing to prevent the Government giving instruction to the Guards not to prosecute such infringements of the Act as may take place until the amending legislation has been passed.  The economic side of it should also be stressed.  If a man has a tractor and equipment together with a trailer for hire the more use he has of this equipment the cheaper he can do the job. If he has it idle for a great part of the year for the reason that he cannot use his trailer it will mean that he will have to charge all the more for using the other machinery.  This is sheer economic waste taking into account the vast number of tractors and trailers in the country.  How does the Minister reconcile this position with the demand made to the farmers for increased production?</P>
    <P>I do not want to embarrass the Minister in respect of this matter.  He is a man who is aware of agricultural conditions in this country.  I am not <Col N="1323" /> anxious to press this amendment to-day if I can get a guarantee from the Minister that he will bring in some amending Bill in the near future.  I can appreciate the difficulties involved in respect of the Road Transport Act and if the Minister will give me the undertaking which I seek I shall be satisfied to leave the matter over for the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am aiming at is clearly set out in Section 3 of Part II of the Schedule.  The section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, apart from this paragraph, sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 4 of Part I of this Schedule would apply to a vehicle, that sub-paragraph shall not apply to it (and sub-paragraph (d) of that paragraph shall apply to it accordingly) unless the person taking out the licence shows to the satisfaction of the licensing authority either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that his only or chief occupation is farming and that the vehicle is used only occasionally on public roads and then only&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  for the haulage of the produce of his farm and articles required for the farm, including the farmhouse and farm buildings but excluding the haulage of fuel if being transported as a commodity for sale, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  for the haulage of similar goods for another farmer, provided that such goods are not hauled for reward, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that he is a contractor engaged to do agricultural work on a farm and that the vehicle is used on public roads only for the haulage of articles required by him for the purpose of doing that work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this amendment seeks to achieve is to make it possible for the individual holding this licence to engage in all forms of haulage and to engage in all forms of haulage for reward.  It is not a question of this amendment being any embarrassment to me; this amendment aims at securing something <Col N="1324" /> which I could not concede.  I know it is always difficult to establish that one farmer is hauling goods for another farmer for reward.  I know, too, that the reward can take many forms and that there can be evasion, but I should like any Deputy in this House to tell me of anything, that is not covered by any Act of Parliament, in which there is not evasion of some kind.</P>
    <P>I admit that it is not possible for me to provide an instrument here that is incapable of being misinterpreted or misconstrued.  The Deputy who has moved the amendment is quite right in saying that I understand the problems that present themselves here.  I understood, and I understand, the confusion that has existed in the past and the different interpretations that have been placed on the law in this matter by district justices all over the country but I am here now speaking as Minister for Local Government.  I am here urging the House to adopt proposals designed to achieve a certain purpose. They are designed to amend the whole regulations governing the licensing of vehicles of all kinds and designed to bring into the Road Fund moneys that are required for the purposes I have mentioned&mdash;for the purpose of making more substantial grants to county councils and other such bodies to help them to achieve a purpose that is highly deserving.  It is all very well to suggest that in proposals such as these I should take steps to ensure the amendment of other legislation that would bring these tractors, which were designed and used for agricultural purposes, into open competition with merchandise vehicles and allow them to engage in the haulage of merchandise of all sorts and kinds at a rate of duty that was never intended to cover such activity.  I think it is asking me to do too much, asking me to do more than I am in a position to concede.</P>
    <P>As I say, my main purpose here is to introduce, and to induce the House to accept, a set of proposals which does not impose too much hardship on any particular class of the tractor or lorryowning sections of the community. These proposals are designed to ask all of them to make a reasonable contribution for the damage they do to the <Col N="1325" /> roads such as will enable us without, as I say, imposing undue hardships on anybody, to achieve the purpose that I, as Minister for Local Government, have in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to accept the remarks made by the Minister in his concluding statement, there is no reason in the world why the Minister should not put a tax on every horse-cart in the country or on every car, as these vehicles are called in the South of Ireland.  What Deputy O'Reilly has said is perfectly true.  The Minister may not be aware of it, but the fact remains that if agriculture and agricultural production is to make any progress in this country, the upkeep of a horse on the average small holding will become a luxury which the small farmer can no longer afford.  The tractor under modern conditions is taking the place of the horse.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the vast majority of tractors used for farming purposes do not inflict 5/- worth of damage in the year to the roads.  The ordinary horse and cart, the iron-shod horse and cart, are doing as much damage and I want to point out to the Minister that he is taking a very dangerous step in this regard.  He is, in effect, forcing some farmers to go back to primitive methods.  If that is the aim of the Government, they will not achieve it without being told all about it.  I stand over this amendment and I am in complete agreement with it.  I think the Minister is definitely taking a wrong step in what he is doing in regard to farm tractors.  Firstly, he increased the tax without any justification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Speak accurately when you are dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking accurately.  I know all about it.  I have practical experience of what I am speaking about.  I am not uttering words that have been put into my mouth by somebody else as the Minister is.  I spent long enough behind the wheel of a tractor to know what I am talking about.  If the Minister had my experience, he might view this matter in a different light.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, the tractor must replace the horse.  Some people have regrets over that for sentimental reasons but the march of progress makes it inevitable.  The Minister is deliberately clapping a tax on these tractors but he knows in his heart that 99 per cent. of them do not come out on the roads one day in the month. The work they do is confined strictly to the farms.  It is the precedent more than the actual amount by which the Minister is increasing the tax to which I object.</P>

      <P>What a concession!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They can come out on the roads at the minimum rate of duty.  Of course the Deputy has not even given himself the trouble to examine what these proposals are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined them and I know quite well what they are. I want to tell the Minister further that the 5/- tax which covers the agricultural tractor was quite sufficient to cover the average tractor.  I am sure it is within the competence of the Minister's officials to devise some means whereby a man who wanted to evade the tax of £21 under the cloak <Col N="1327" /> of the 5/- tax, could be brought to book.  I am sure it is quite within the competence of these officials to round up that type of person.  Therefore, the excuse that we must blister everybody in order to do that is absurd.  I think it is an absolutely daft proposal.  The average tractor is used for work within the holding or farm.</P>
      <P>On the roads they are used mostly for the haulage of turf in areas where turf is the principal fuel.  That is practically confined to Connaught.  The horse and car did that without any tax.  Will the Minister agree that that is true, or is he trying to bamboozle the House by saying that I have not examined that side of the problem?  Take the case of tractors which are hired for tillage purposes by people who cannot afford to have a tractor of their own.  These also are being clamped down on and their use discouraged even though we have the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance shouting all over the country asking for increased production.  At the same time, however, they tax the tools of the agricultural trade.  Can the Minister tell me of any case where the tools of any other industry here, or in neighbouring counties, are taxed in the way that he is proposing to tax the tractors?</P>
      <P>I repeat that it is no excuse for the Minister to say that he wants to prevent the fellow with the 5/- tax or the £6 tax taking advantage of it to do £21 or £31 worth of work.  In order to round up that type of person or prevent him from evading the law, it is not good enough to clamp an increased tax of £8 on every tractor.  The 5/- tax is not being availed of by one person out of 20 for the reason that it does not allow him to use a trailer. Suppose a road runs through a man's holding with land on one side of it and his house and out-offices and some more land on the other side.  If he is paying a 5/- tax for the tractor he cannot bring an empty trailer attached to it across that road.  If he is caught he will be prosecuted and there have been prosecutions in cases of that sort all over the country.  The position is that in such cases the Guards must prosecute because that is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Deputy O'Reilly, I think, suggested that the Minister could give an order to the Guards not to prosecute in certain cases.  No Minister has the power to do that.  The Guards must prosecute according to the law as it is laid down by this House, and no Minister and no Government could give an order to the Guards not to prosecute as long as the law is there.  In fact, if the Minister did give such an order, the Guard could tell him to mind his own business. Therefore, Deputies should not be labouring under the delusion that the Minister could do anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to wipe out the £6 tax as it stood, and also the £8 tax which is now proposed, and to tax all tractors at a flat rate of £1, and then impose a tax on their use for haulage purposes or for hire or reward. The Minister could put on a tax commensurate with the horse-power of the tractor and the damage it was likely to do to the roads in comparison with lorries.  It is just a farce to be talking about increased agricultural production while the Minister for Local Government who a few short years ago was Minister for Agriculture is doing what he is proposing to do under this Resolution. There is no justification for it. Therefore I fully support the different clauses in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There is no point in trying to put forward the argument that the tax on tractors has been reduced from £10 to £8 as against others where the tax has been increased from £6 to £8.  In the case of nine-tenths of the tractors, the tax has been increased from £6 to £8, while as regards possibly a tenth of them it is being reduced from £10 to £8.  Therefore, the balance against tractor users is in favour of the Minister for Finance, who under this Resolution is proposing to take a substantial sum of money from tractor owners in the form of a tax.  Many of these are petrol tractors.  Earlier this year the tax on petrol was increased, although a remission in tax for petrol driven tractors was given by the previous Minister for Finance.  That remission was not given in respect of the latest increase by the present Minister for <Col N="1329" /> Finance.  Therefore, the increased tax on petrol is being placed on these tractor owners.</P>

There are many farmers who hire these tractors to cultivate their land.  They have been asked to increase production but they are not being encouraged to do it.  In addition to using the tractors for the cultivation of land their owners could use them for the haulage of turf.  Previously, under the old system of taxation, they were allowed to use these tractors at a cost of £6 per year.  Many of those owners are very small farmers, and it is now proposed to put the tax up to £8.</P>

      <P>I think these amendments are very reasonable as this will be a hardship on the farming community. In the milk-producing areas there is a certain amount of milk being carried to creameries by tractors without any question of reward.  A farmer carries milk for his neighbour and there is no reward in these cases.  Now, if a farmer pays the £8 tax he will not be allowed to do that.  That will be a great hardship on the farming community. There has been an appeal made for increased milk production which is very necessary, and if the Minister puts something like this into force it will be a great hardship.  It will increase the cost to the farmer because he will not be able to get his milk carried as he has been getting milk carried.  Under the new £8 tax a farmer will be only allowed to carry his own milk.</P>

If three or four farmers in a district who were using horses and carts in taking turn about in bringing milk to the creamery have now got tractors, or if two farmers out of four or five or six have now got tractors, they will be entitled to continue that practice of taking their neighbours' cans on the day or days they would be supposed to carry the milk by arrangement with their neighbours. There is no impediment being placed in their way in that regard. They will be able to haul their own turf or the turf of their neighbours.  The only impediment is that they will not be allowed to engage in commercial haulage.  I do not mind these proposals being criticised intelligently on that basis, but I object to their being criticised by people who do not seem to know what is covered by this or what will be achieved as a result of it.</P>

      <P>And that of his neighbour if he is not doing it for reward.  In hundreds of cases six or eight or ten farmers agreed to take turn about in carrying milk to the creamery or taking pigs or cattle to the market or turf from the bog.  They co-operated with their neighbours.  I admit that it would be impossible to be sure that there would not be an exchange of payment of one kind or another.  But, short of giving a man paying an £8 tax the right to go out and haul merchandise of all kinds, he is perfectly free to engage in the sort of haulage in which he engaged with a horse and cart or to engage, in co-operation with his neighbours, in the pursuit of agriculture. If he has a tractor, he can engage in the haulage that is necessary to enable him to do his work.  There is no reason for all these ambiguities which are being built up about this. They are not real; they are only imaginary.</P>

      <P>It is not changed in any respect except to the extent that there seems to be some doubt, that the courts were in doubt.  Take the case of a tractor which was engaged commercially in hauling milk.  The owner of that tractor who was so engaged every day on the roads just the same as his neighbour who was using a lorry, would not be allowed so to engage on an £8 tax.  That is perfectly reasonable.</P>

There is not much danger of a man with that valuation going into competition with hauliers.</P>

      <P>He would only have a small tractor.  My idea in bringing in the amendment is that in an isolated rural district you may have a man with <Col N="1334" /> a tractor and another man who is anxious to get home a load of turf. The owner of the tractor would not be legally entitled to do that because he might be rewarded in some way, either in money or in kind.  If a farmer had to get his cattle to the fair there might be a reward of one kind or another.  It was in order to set these people's minds at rest that I brought in these amendments.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>6.  In page 8, Part II of the Schedule, to add at the end of paragraph 5 a new sub-paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6)  In the case of a vehicle to which paragraph 6 (d) of Part I of this Schedule applies which does not exceed 10 h.p. and was first registered six or more years before the first day of January, 1953, or any succeeding year, the rate of duty prescribed in paragraph 6 (d) already referred to shall be reduced by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>This amendment has been tabled to meet modern conditions in the motoring world.  Every Deputy knows how difficult and expensive old cars are to maintain.  After all, they are the cars used by people who cannot afford better.  If the Minister could see his way to accept this amendment it would help in no small way the people, especially in the rural areas, who cannot afford to have a better car. Those cars are used very extensively to further the particular business of the individuals concerned.  They never get an opportunity of going out on the main road unless they happen to travel to see an all-Ireland football final.  I would like to impress on the Minister the great necessity for the reduction in the tax and to say that it would help to alleviate the burden on those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputies are to be congratulated on the wide range of interests they represented in this House.  When different sections of the community are affected by any proposal like this they seem to make the same appeal to all Deputies, and especially to those Deputies who speak from the Opposition Benches.  I have a great deal of respect for old things but it would be impossible for me to accede to all the requests that were made to me since these proposals were introduced.  First I was asked to relieve the burden on the man who took out the driving licence; next came the hackney owners and the taxi owners.  The next plea was made on behalf of private lorry owners, the people who were represented to me as men who had come out of the Army and who had secured gratuities and invested those gratuities in the purchase of these vehicles.  The next class I was invited to remove from the scope of these proposals were the people referred to in the last amendment. Now I am asked to have sympathy and respect for the old cars. As I said, I may have a great deal of respect and sympathy for old cars and for a lot of other things that are old, but again I must emphasise that the people who own these old cars are ratepayers and taxpayers.  They use the roads and roads have to be made. They must be made from the two sources I have already mentioned&mdash; from the Road Fund and from rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly, as a member of this House and as a member of a county council, knows just how the rates stand in regard to this and other matters.  He knows that rates are high.  He knows that to mention increasing the rates in any particular county now would not produce a favourable response from the people who have to pay them.  He knows that in a general way motor taxation has been out of line with the general position all over the country for many years past, and I believe myself I am speaking truthfully and representing accurately the feeling in the <Col N="1337" /> country irrespective of what I am told by Deputies who say: &ldquo;I was approached on behalf of the hackney owners in order to secure a reduction in the proposed tax&rdquo;.  Another Deputy may say: &ldquo;I was approached by the people who take out driving licences&rdquo;. Another Deputy might say that he was approached by some other particular section such as the people who own the type of cars that are referred to in this amendment.  I, too, meet a lot of people who are the owners of lorries and motor-cars, and drivers of motor-cars and I would say I know the circumstances of all these classes as well as most people.  I know that none of these people likes increased taxes, but is it not a strange thing that while I have received quite a number of circulars from organised bodies of one kind or another protesting against these proposals, no individual has seriously come forward to me as an ordinary Deputy and complained of the effect, that they were unjust having regard to the needs of the moment, to the needs of the roads, to the needs of the ratepayers, to the problems of the ratepayers and to the problems of the State?  Although no person clapped me on the back and said he was very glad to pay it&mdash;nobody does that&mdash;no person who will be affected by this taxation came and said: &ldquo;It is a wonder you would do such a thing knowing, as you should, the circumstances in which we are&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the appeals of organised bodies and examined the contentions they advanced in support of the demands they made.  I have to listen to Deputies in this House representing proposals like this as outrageous, unjust and tyrannical, and I have to listen to Deputies saying: &ldquo;You will not give way on anything. You are a person who will not give way to reason.&rdquo;  I think the reason is all on my side.  If I were to give way on the proposals I am defending here I would be giving away to people who were unreasonable and who were refusing and are refusing to face the facts as I see them.</P>
    <P>As I said before, it is not that I love the task of having to come in here and <Col N="1338" /> justify increased payments from any section, whether they are road users as motorists or as owners of tractors, trailers, lorries or whatever other vehicle they make use of on the roads. I will emphasise again that I am quite satisfied that members of local bodies especially, who have this enormous task before them of making roads in order to satisfy the requirements of modern times&mdash;and mind you these demands will become greater&mdash;realise that instead of these proposals being designed, or being likely in any way, to hinder that development, there is not the slightest chance in the world that development will be impeded. These proposals are designed to enable local bodies to prepare the highways of the country for increased development in that direction.</P>
    <P>I say here with confidence that I would not mind if my task was facing all those people, those different classes together in one hall or public place because I would have no hesitation, and I have no doubt that I would have no difficulty in convincing the majority of them&mdash;and I take it they are mostly reasonable persons&mdash;as to the necessity for these proposals, as to the urgency for doing something along the lines at which I am aiming and as to the justice of the methods we have decided upon here.</P>
    <P>The old cars are a problem and perhaps a case could be made along the lines that Deputy O'Reilly has made and maybe even a stronger case, but I was not in a position to give way to any of the requests that came from any of the classes affected by these proposals, because I had to aim at securing a certain sum of money.  The amount I would like to get as Minister for Local Government by these proposals is less than what we would in justice require.  Therefore, I must take up the same attitude in regard to this matter as I have taken in relation to all the others we have discussed to-day for so long.</P>

      <P>What is wrong with the machinery of the Fianna Fáil Government or the Department of Agriculture since the Government came into power? It is quite evident that the Minister had the clear-cut terms of a Bill in mind.  He was appointed Minister on the 13th June, 1951, but we are only now dealing with a Bill with which he said he agreed in principle and in every other respect so long ago.  Will he explain that or give the cause of the hold-up of this measure?  I am anxious to know whether Deputy Cogan had a finger in the pie, but now that he has made amendment for his past sins I welcome his conversion.  As I think it can be reasonably and rightly assumed that we all agree with the principle of this Bill, I appeal to Deputies and to the Minister and his colleagues in particular to make this Bill one that can be worked with the least possible difficulty <Col N="1343" /> in its application.  Like the Minister himself, I, too, represent a rural constituency.  The farmers in both our constituencies are very much alike in outlook and in the treatment of their agricultural labourers generally. The majority of the decent farmers&mdash;that is the overwhelming majority of the farmers of the constituency of Leix-Offaly and I would say also of Carlow-Kilkenny from my knowledge of them as neighbours&mdash;are anxious to treat their workers in a decent Christian-like way.</P>
      <P>The people who oppose this progressive type of legislation in my constituency are the big landlord type of farmers.  These are the people who have got to have political common sense hammered into their heads.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister and every Deputy in this House to see that as few loopholes as possible are left in this Bill and that the Bill will operate with the least possible difficulty and hardship.</P>
      <P>We are all anxious to increase agricultural production.  One of the best means of making that contribution no matter on what side of the House we may sit or what Government or Minister occupies the benches is to try to get the most friendly relations possible between the farmer and his agricultural labourer.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the conditions operating in the Six Counties.  We are all anxious to get rid of the Border and one of the best ways in which we can make a contribution in that direction is to level up the conditions of our working class people, the wage earning section of the population, and the people generally in the Republic, with the conditions prevailing in industry and agriculture in the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister has read the Agricultural Wages Regulation Act of 1939 which operates <Col N="1344" /> in Northern Ireland or the Six Counties as we call them.  If he has not I would invite him to do so.  In particular I would invite him to compare the proposals contained in this Bill with similar proposals contained in the 1939 Act so far as representation on the machinery of the board is concerned. This Bill proposes to extend the powers of the Agricultural Wages Board so as to give them full authority to administer this Bill in whatever final form it may emerge when passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I would invite the Minister to study Section 1 of the Agricultural Wages Regulation Act, 1939, which applies to Northern Ireland and say at a later stage, if he is not in a position to say it when concluding, whether he is prepared to copy what I regard as a model method for the board that will administer a measure of this kind as well as administering the powers already conferred upon them under previous Acts, under the powers that set up the Agricultural Wages Board which was established in 1936.</P>
      <P>Neither I, nor my colleagues, regard the machinery of the Agricultural Wages Board as acceptable.  In other words, we think that the machinery has not worked in the way it should and I think we made representations to the Minister since he came into office.  We certainly made representations to Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hopeful that the present Minister will take advantage of the terms of this measure to improve the machinery that will operate and also the powers previously conferred on him.  There is a great difference between the wages and working conditions of the agricultural labourer employed by farmers in the Six Counties, provided for under the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act, 1939, and the wages and conditions that operate in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as anxious as anyone to make a contribution to the removal of the Border.  This is one of the ways in <Col N="1345" /> which we can do that.  We ought to see that conditions for the farmers as well as for the agricultural labourers are levelled up at least to the level of conditions which prevail in the Six-County area.  I hope the Minister will accept that point of view and study the terms of the section of the Act to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I wish to make suggestions to the Minister as to how some of the sections of the Bill might be improved.  I do not expect that the Minister will give a reply to these suggestions here and now but I am asking that between now and the Committee Stage the Minister will give them sympathetic consideration as far as he can possibly do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 1, the Bill might be improved by the insertion of an amendment making its effects retrospective to the 3rd July, 1951, on which date the Act which is to be repealed by this Bill came into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is rather an important definition section but if the Minister agrees to accept my suggestion it would remove doubts in administration of the legislation when the Bill comes into operation.  It is suggested that the term &ldquo;week-day&rdquo; should be defined as a day which does not mean Sunday.  It may appear to be a trivial matter to make that suggestion but any suggestion that would be likely to remove misunderstanding or trouble in the administration of the Act when it becomes law is, I take it, acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 could be improved by adding a new sentence stating that in the event of the employer failing to fix the week-day on which the half-holiday is to be taken, Saturday should be stipulated as the half-holiday.  I think that suggestion would be generally acceptable in the country.  I do not claim to boast of any more knowledge on this matter than other Deputies but, as far as I know, the half-holiday would be more acceptable to the farmer employer on that day than on any other day during the week, I will leave it to the farmer Deputies to say whether that is so or not.  In any case, where there is a difference between them I hope that it will be limited to a small number of <Col N="1346" /> cases.  That suggestion might help to make the farmer employer and the agricultural labourer know where they stand in the case of a dispute or a difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>According to Section 7 if a worker is allowed a Church or a public holiday with pay under the Act of 1950 he is not entitled to claim a half-holiday for that week.  The section also means that if it is the custom in a district for workers to abstain from work on a Church holiday in respect of which they are not paid&mdash;that would apply to Deputy Allen's constituency&mdash;such workers do not qualify for the half-holiday in respect of that week.  The section could be improved by stipulating that only when the worker has been paid for a Church or bank holiday in the week then and only then shall the employer be entitled to exclude the worker from the benefits of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 6, the qualifying period of 45 hours is rather severe in our view and in that of those who advise us on matters of this kind.  We suggest that a qualifying period of, say, 40 hours might be more appropriate.</P>

      <P>I suppose we are living in a progressive period.  Deputy Allen will admit that and I ask him, when speaking on these matters, to relate his outlook on this particular aspect of legislation to what is taking place in industry so far as industrial workers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 deal with offences under the Act and prescribe regulations for the recovery of moneys due to a worker in cases where the half-holiday has not been granted.  The Minister should note that an officer of the Agricultural Wages Board has not power under the proposed Bill, or under the Holidays Acts, 1950, to enter an employer's premises for the purpose of investigating complaints regarding the enforcement of the Act.  Any authority the inspectors have is vested in them under the Agricultural Wages Acts, 1936 and 1945, concerning cases where an under-payment of wages has been alleged.  The inspectors cannot <Col N="1347" /> enter an employer's premises to investigate a case involving the non-payment of holiday pay, unless there is also a case concerning the non-payment of arrears of wages.  The section should be amended in order to clarify the powers of wage board inspectors and to ensure that they will have adequate powers to investigate complaints made pursuant to the proposed Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to confer additional powers on the Agricultural Wages Board.  This board has been in existence since 1937, and, unlike other statutory bodies dealing with wages, the trade unions having members in agriculture have not the right to nominate the personnel representing agricultural workers on the board.  I was previously endeavouring to point out that the trade unions catering for agricultural labourers in the Six Counties are given that right by the Act I have already mentioned.  In 1937, there were no trade unions catering for agricultural workers, but the position is different now.  The Agricultural Wages Act of 1939, which operates in Northern Ireland, confers on trade unions having members in agriculture the right to nominate the workers' representatives on the Northern Ireland Agricultural Wages Board.  In view of the extensive powers about to be conferred on the Agricultural Wages Board, the Minister should consider modernising the Agricultural Wages Acts.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that numbers of agricultural labourers have unfortunately been dismissed by the dictatorial type of employer because they pressed for what they thought was their right to a half-holiday.  They were dismissed from their employment in many cases and in many places.  I am glad to say that I do not know of one in my own constituency, but Deputy Cogan will not deny that the Federation of Rural Workers is a strong organisation in many constituencies and consists mainly of agricultural labourers.  My authority for making this statement is this body which caters for agricultural labourers, a body which is very highly organised in many counties.  Will the Minister consider the advisability of taking steps to insert a provision in the Bill to prevent that happening in the future?</P>
      <P>It is my hope and, I believe, the hope of Deputy Cogan, who voted against the principle of the Bill on previous occasions and of other Deputies who might have done otherwise, that, when the Bill comes into operation, whether in its present form or with the improvements that can be made with the consent of all Parties and the consent of the Minister, its machinery will be brought into operation with our goodwill and particularly with the goodwill of all the farmer employees in the country.  It is for that purpose that I have put forward these suggestions for what we consider would be the improvement of the Bill and I hope that the Minister will give favourable and sympathetic consideration to them between now and the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I come from a very big dairy area and I am happy to say that, so far as wages are concerned, there was never any trouble there, but there are certain farmers, farmers who find it very hard to break away from tradition&mdash;I do not like to call them reactionaries, but I may describe them as being conservative in their outlook&mdash;who said that this would interfere greatly with dairy farming.  I cannot see how it will.  It was argued that the week's holiday would interfere with the dairying farmers.  We heard the same pitiable story at the time of the introduction of the Bill providing for a week's holiday and a half-holiday per week for those engaged in industry and in the commercial life of the country. Industry and commerce are still operating satisfactorily.  The wheels of industry keep turning.  I have no doubt the Minister will be able to convince the farmers, in the same way as the industrialists were convinced, that this Bill will not interfere with production one way or the other.</P>

      <P>The Minister has an opportunity now of profiting by mistakes. I do not know anything about the mechanics of the last Bill.  I do not know whether any arrangement had to be made for financing it.  At any rate, the Minister can now benefit as a result of that Bill and I hope there will be no necessity for farm workers in the future looking to the courts for redress.  This Bill should be such as to be capable of interpretation to the mutual benefit of both employer and employee.  I suggest that the hours put forward by Deputy Davin would be better from the point of view of the operation of the Bill rather than those suggested by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no reason for any difficulty.  The farmers have a duty to their workers.  When the Agricultural Wages Board made an award of 5/- per week Deputy Cogan stated that that 5/- extra would make the farmers bankrupt.  None of Deputy Cogan's prognostications proved to be correct in that respect.  I see no reason why this Bill should cause any animosity between the farmer and his workers.  There was no animosity <Col N="1352" /> created between the industrial workers and their employer or between the shopkeeper and his assistants when they were granted somewhat similar privileges.  The Minister is a farmer himself.  He knows the men's point of view.  He should have a pretty shrewd idea of the most practical way in which to operate this Bill.  I do not think this measure will upset the happy relationship that exists between the farmer and his worker at the present time. I hope the Minister will be ruthless in dealing with those people who try to override progressive social legislation. I suggest that Saturday would be the best day for the half-holiday. I think it would be the most acceptable day from the point of view of the farmer and his workers.  It is a pity that Deputy Corry is not present in the House now to make some suggestion in that connection.  The reason why I make that statement is that it would appear from some discussion which took place in this House that, as a result of fast drinking on Sunday nights, the agricultural workers in Deputy Corry's area used to have a hangover on Monday mornings. Seriously, however, I suggest that the Minister should empower his inspectors, where there is not an agreement between employer and employee, to insist on Saturday as the day on which the half-day be given.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will see to it that the agricultural labourer will be protected so far as his hours of work are concerned.  We know what happened in some cases under the Wet-time Order.  Some agricultural workers who were not operating on a contractual basis were victimised by their employers.  Whenever the employers got a chance of availing of the Wet-time Order they immediately victimised the worker and cut down his wages.  As I say, I hope the Minister will look after the interests of the agricultural labourers and I hope that, in turn, the agricultural labourers will give good service to their employers.  I trust that the farmers will carry out their part of the transaction.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers are the most important section of the community <Col N="1353" /> because every other industry hinges on the agricultural industry.  I sincerely trust that both the worker and the farmer will make use of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the community in general.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will be any great objection to this measure though, for a while, it is possible that the timing of the machinery may be upset somewhat.  However, I feel that after a short while everything should work out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that workers may&mdash;I say &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;be victimised in the matter of submitting a report to the inspector or to the Agricultural Wages Board.  I should prefer the Minister to consider ways and means by which the onus of responsibility in respect of the submission of reports to the inspector or to the Agricultural Wages Board will not be laid on the worker.  I am anxious to avoid any abuse in that connection. Like what happened during the time of the French Revolution, it may so happen that this measure will not operate for the benefit either of the farmer or of the worker.  I hope the Minister, with the help of his officials, will be able to hammer out some satisfactory method whereby the onus of submitting reports will not be placed on individuals.  Just consider the position of town workers in relation to their half-holiday.  If the law is not carried out, action is taken immediately by the Garda authorities. Similarly with regard to the closing of shops at certain specified hours, and so forth.  I realise that it would be impossible to carry out the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, in exactly the same way as the principle of the half-holiday for industrial workers is operated, but I feel that the Minister should make a very determined effort to relieve the worker of the responsibility of reporting his employer.</P>
    <P>I desire to conclude by congratulating Deputy Cogan.  A lot of people have been under the impression that miracles have ceased, but since Moses struck the rock there has not been such a miracle as Deputy Cogan's <Col N="1354" /> silence in this House for more than 12 months on the subject of agriculture.</P>

      <P>I feel it would be a waste of time to debate this measure in detail in view of the fact that the Government are committed to the Bill, that the Fine Gael Party are committed to the Bill, having voted for the principle of it some time ago, and that the Labour Party are committed to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Personally I think it is unfortunate that we have to legislate in this connection and that people in this House who are not really <i>au fait</i> with agricultural conditions should decide how things should be done in that industry, of which they do not know a great deal.  I believe and I have always believed that the agricultural worker is the country's greatest asset.  I am satisfied that he has not got his fair share, having regard to the important nature of his work and of its contribution to the nation's economy.  I believe that it would be much better to let the farm worker and the farmer decide amongst themselves how best to settle the particular problems that confront them.  At present, agricultural workers are scarce and a good agricultural worker can demand fair and reasonable treatment for his work. That being so, I think it would be better to let the farmer and the farm worker come to their own particular agreements.</P>
      <P>The agricultural industry is different from any other industry.  You can tell an industrial worker in a factory that he must put so many nuts on a bolt in a certain time and that he must achieve a certain output in a certain period.  The industrial worker can stop the machine when he wants to do so and his only responsibility is to achieve a certain output in a certain period of time.  In agriculture, on the other hand, you are dealing with nature.  You are depending on various factors such as the weather, the health of the stock and 101 different things which you cannot control.  It must be admitted, therefore, that you cannot apply the same rigid rules to agriculture that you can apply to other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of this Bill which may <Col N="1355" /> affect the dairying industry is that, so far, we have not succeeded in producing the type of cow which can be milked on 5½ days only per week.  In certain areas it has become necessary to reduce the size of herds to the extent of the family labour that is available and in certain areas it is impossible to keep more cows than can be milked on Saturday and Sunday evenings by the farmer and his family. The half-day may aggravate that particular problem.  The half-day will, of course, also increase costs of production.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should give a guarantee that any increased costs of production imposed on the farmer by this legislation will be compensated for in some other way.  We have had the experience in the past where various costs, resulting from increased facilities for other sections of the community, were put on agriculture and the only thing the farmer got in return for that was a request to take 2d.  a gallon less for his milk.  We cannot expect to have increased costs piled on the industry while at the same time we are asked to produce more cheaply.  The Labour Party I think are rather inconsistent.  They are advocating increased costs in every direction&mdash;in rates, wages and amenities&mdash;and at the same time with the other side of their mouths they are agitating for reduced prices and cheaper commodities.  This Bill, which I believe must be passed by the House having regard to the attitude of the Government and the Opposition in the past, is I think a little bit better, or possibly I should say a little more workable, than the Bill introduced by the Labour Party in the last Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time I spoke in this House was in a debate connected with problems affecting dairy farming.  I again find myself having to refer to that particular industry in so far as it will be affected by this Bill. We all admit the justice of the claims of the agricultural worker to a living wage and his right to a half-holiday. We admit that he should be put on the same footing as the industrial worker, while I entirely agree with the statement <Col N="1356" /> of Deputy Lehane that the conditions under which industrial workers operate are not entirely analogous to those of the agricultural worker.  The industrial worker can take his half-holiday at any time he wishes, and there will be others in a position to continue that work just as efficiently as if he were there all the time.  Take the case of the dairy farmer.  The absence of the hired worker at certain times will seriously impair the continuity of his work.  In a very limited area, I know about 11 widows with young families, and these widows are completely dependent upon the agricultural worker to look after the milking of their cows in the morning and in the evening.  It is suggested that there should be a specified half-holiday, say on a Saturday, but I hope that such an arrangement will not be rigidly adhered to.  I would much prefer to see a feeling of <i>esprit de corps</i> between the farmer and his man as a result of which, by some sympathetic exchange, they could arrange the most suitable day on which the worker could take his half-holiday.  I admit, as I say, the justice and the equity of the agricultural worker's claim to a half-holiday, but unless there is a clear and definite understanding, and unless the farmer gets such protection in clear and specified terms in the Bill, that the half-holiday can be granted and taken on the most suitable day by mutual arrangement between the farmer and his man, this concession to the worker will react unfavourably on the industry.  I think it should be left to the farmer and his employees to determine the best way in which these holidays can be taken, so as not to impair the efficiency and continuity of the work on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take an unfortunate widow, and I have two or three such cases clearly before my mind.  The evening may be wet and she is running from the hearth to the door awaiting the return of her three or four little ones from school. That particular day may happen to be the very day which the legislation provides as the day on which the worker must take his half-holiday. There may be 12 or more cows to be milked.  You know the very definite way in which cows call to be milked <Col N="1357" /> when the time comes.  That poor widow, waiting to receive her little ones as they come in, would find it utterly impossible to go out to get somebody to take the place of the man whom she has hired for that definite purpose and whom she is paying reasonably well.  What is she going to do in that case?  That is a particular case of hardship, a common and recurring condition of things amongst the agricultural community.  Should there not be some arrangement whereby the justice of the claim of the worker to his half-holidays would be protected and the interests of the farmer equally protected?</P>
    <P>Then take the case of people who farm in a different way, for instance myself.  Some years ago I had a good dairy herd, but, owing to difficulties in getting my children away to school and a couple of them to the universities, I abandoned the dairying end and I went in for the raising of store cattle.  My quota of tillage had also to be looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that the afternoon of Saturday should be specified as the half-holiday, but take a week in which there has been a downpour of rain on every day, except Saturday.  It may be during the harvest period, and you may have ten or 12 acres of hay on hand.  It may be in a very bad condition. Somebody has suggested that the law should specifically provide that the agricultural labourer should go away on the Saturday morning or on the Saturday afternoon after lunch.  On that Saturday afternoon, you may have a beautiful sun and wind to dry the hay.  If the worker chooses to take his half-holiday on such an afternoon, consider the plight of the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke here on the last occasion it was admitted by Ministers and others that agriculture is the basis of our whole economy, that the dairy farmer is a fundamental and integral part of that economy, and that every encouragement should be given to him. I pointed out last July that the dairy industry was in a precarious position because of emigration amongst <Col N="1358" /> workers and because of many other adverse factors.  A further spanner will be thrown into the wheels of that industry unless an arrangement can be entered into, and recognised by law, between the agricultural worker and his employer under which the half-holiday can be taken at a period which is least harmful to the industry.  Could we not provide that the farmer would be at liberty to say to his worker: &ldquo;Look here, can we make an arrangement under which you will get extra time off at a period of the year when the cows have less milk and there is less work to be done?&rdquo;  Supposing at the end of October, or even the middle of October, the farmer said to his boy and the boy accepted the arrangement: &ldquo;Look here, I will give you an extra week more than the holidays you are entitled to, if you agree to forgo your half-holiday at rush periods,&rdquo; could there not be a legal basis for such an arrangement?  The farmer might say to his worker: &ldquo;If you consider that a week would not be sufficient I will give you ten days more with the usual holiday if you will continue to work the whole week during the summer months and the early spring.&rdquo;  If such an arrangement could be arrived at between the farmer and the agricultural worker, it would be greatly to the interest of the industry.</P>
    <P>When the original Bill was introduced, I found myself in the Lobby voting against it.  I appreciate very much that the agricultural workers are entitled to just and legitimate consideration: that they are entitled, even though the cases are not quite analogous, in justice and charity to their holidays in the same way as men working in factories or with Messrs. Guinness.  I voted against that Bill because of the adverse situation it would create in four or five of the primary counties in the South which depend, almost entirely, on the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are 44 proprietary creameries in my county, and that the incidence of their labour content is very great.  I think myself that the introduction of this half-holiday, so far as dairy farmers are concerned and without some alternative arrangement such as I have suggested <Col N="1359" /> to overcome the difficulties which must undoubtedly arise, would have a deleterious influence on the dairying industry.  I have spoken to quite a number of farmers, particularly those in the dairying industry, about this. The proposal in the Bill, I agree, will not have and could not have such disastrous consequences on other forms of farming as it would necessarily have in the case of the dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>I wish to support the Bill.  If some such arrangement as I have suggested could be arrived at, it would make things more amicable and would obviate greatly the results which, otherwise, are bound to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been rather interesting to hear all the comments which have been made by the Opposition about giving the agricultural worker a weekly half-holiday.  Deputy Lehane has suggested that he is our greatest national asset.  Yet, in this year of 1952, all we can pay him is £3 12s. per week.  Every place I go I listen to people speaking about agriculture and complaining that there is no labour on the land.  Deputy Madden, in his speech, which was so full of sentiment, made the same complaint. What I want to ask is, how are we going to keep the workers on the land? Is it by treating them in a manner different from that in which we treat every other class of worker?  The office man can get a month's holidays with pay.  The industrial worker can get a fortnight's holiday with pay, plus the bank holidays with pay.  Will any Deputy tell me why the man who produces the food for the nation cannot get the same treatment as those other workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lehane says that the Labour Party is quite illogical because we advocate a reduction in the cost of living.  We have always advocated that the farmer should get such a price for what he produces as to enable him to pay his workers a decent wage.  It is very disheartening to be listening to all this sob stuff about the agricultural worker&mdash;that he is our greatest national asset and so on&mdash;while at the same time we treat him in the way that he is being treated, and cannot <Col N="1360" /> see our way to give him what he is looking for.  Deputy Madden talked about the position of widows.  I have yet to be told of any agricultural worker who, in an emergency, ever let down a farmer or a widow.  I was reared on the land myself though it is a long time now since I left it.  I can well understand what is happening. I realise that, within the last eight or nine months, over 6,000 agricultural workers have left the land.  If these men have not gone into our cities or large towns, then they have gone to work for English farmers at £4 10s. or £4 15s. for a 48-hour week.</P>

      <P>That is so.  As regards agricultural workers, I am afraid we are not prepared to face up to the actual position that is confronting the country.  The Minister himself is a farmer.  I think it is about time that we had someone to deal with the position of the agricultural worker in a much bigger way than is the case at the moment.  Deputy Blowick brought in a red herring when he spoke of the small farmers with valuations of £5 or £6, and said that they had no half-holiday. I know that as well as he does.  I am prepared to admit that they are the hardest working people in the whole nation, those small farmers, their wives and their families.  We have to admit they work on the 365 days of the year.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I do not want to see these red herrings brought into a debate in which we are dealing with such a serious matter as keeping our agricultural workers on the land.

      <P>I suggest to Deputy Davin that we should try and deal with these matters in a serious way rather than by using catch words and phrases across the House.  The time has come for the Minister for Agriculture and the House to make up their minds that the man working on the land and producing food for the nation is as much entitled to a fortnight's holidays, and the other amenities, as any other worker in the nation.  It may seem strange that this statement should come from me in view of the fact that I have been living in a city for the past 39 years.  We all know that we have men enjoying a month's holidays as well as bank holidays with pay, and yet the most that we are able to give to the man who produces food for the nation is £3 12s. a week in the County Cork.  I wonder does the Minister think, in view of that situation, that the Agricultural Wages Board is properly constituted as it is.  Neither the present Minister nor his predecessor was big enough to give the workers the right to representation on that board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that to lay down the condition that a man must work for a full week before he can get the half-holiday is unworthy of any Minister and of this House.  The proposal is that, if a man works only four or five days in the week, he will not get any half-day for that week. Suppose a man is sick for two days, is he not entitled to be paid for the half day if he works it?  I should like the Minister to deal with that when he is replying.  I want to see the system of holidays applied to agricultural workers in the same way as it is to industrial workers.  They, too, are industrial workers and important ones. There is no need for any Deputy to tell me that small farmers do not get holidays.  I know they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in using that argument to the detriment of the man who is a paid worker.  There has been a lot of talk about the understanding that there is between the farmer and his man.  I know, as well as the Deputies <Col N="1362" /> who have spoken, what the relations are that exist between the farmer and his workers.  I know that in many cases, where there are only one or two men employed, the farmer and his men sit at the same table.  He will treat them with respect.  Let us not, however, blind ourselves to the fact that in many other places the agricultural worker is not treated as a man should be treated by the people who employ him.  We should not mix up the decent farmer who respects his worker with other people who employ six or seven workers.  We have to make up our minds that the agricultural worker, if he is to be kept on the land, will have to get the same amenities and the same status as the industrial or the clerical worker in the cities.</P>

      <P>I am glad to know that the House has indicated its acceptance of the Bill.  The only arguments that have been used in opposition to the Bill are face-saving arguments.  Deputy Dunne, Deputy Corish, and I might say every member of the Labour Party, got up in order to save their faces and nothing else.  That is about all they have been doing.  The Bill which was introduced by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Hickey two years ago may have been the best effort they could have made.  However, we on this side of the House have been accused of not supporting that Bill. We did support the Bill.  It was only after discovering that the Fine Gael Party and the Coalition would not support it on its Second Reading that we did not support it, because we asked what was the attitude of the Government towards it.  As is usual in cases like this where a Bill is introduced by a private Deputy, if it gets a Second Reading it is then adopted by the Minister responsible.  But in this case the Minister refused to adopt the Bill and by refusing to do so he made Deputy Dunne's Bill inoperative.  Is not that quite true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Deputies who have spoken already this evening have not read the Bill.  Deputy Madden, for instance, has made statements and it appears to me that he has not even read the Bill.  There is no special day on which the half-holiday is to be granted.  That can be arrived at by mutual agreement between the employer and the employee.  Neither would I say that this is a compulsory Bill.  If there is agreement between the employer and the employee that there is to be no half-day then the Agricultural Wages Board will fix a sum of money in lieu of the half-holiday for the agricultural worker.  This is a simple Bill and because of its simplicity I believe it is workable.  There is no compulsion and that is one thing which we wish to get away from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> If some of the Deputies speaking on behalf of Labour had any knowledge of rural Ireland they would not have spoken as they did this evening.  Do they know the conditions that obtain in rural Ireland, the difficulties with which both the agricultural worker and the farmer must contend?  They are at the mercy of the weather.  You have not the same conditions in that industry as you have in cities and towns. In factories, work is started by the pressing of a button.  Not so in the country; you must depend on the weather.  You must have regard to all these things as they affect both the agricultural worker and the farmer before you start to make regulations and laws for them to carry out.  For this reason I have put into the Bill a clause whereby the farmer and the worker may agree that there will be no half-holiday at all and that it will be a question of payment for the four hours to which the worker is legitimately entitled under the Bill.</P>
    <P>To hear Deputy Dunne speaking one would imagine that a farm was something like a factory or that workers on a farm were something like city workers, that they just walked in and turned a machine.  There is something more than that.  If we are to preserve rural Ireland as it is and as we would all like it to be, we should not pass any legislation which would cause trouble between the employer and employee in agriculture.  This Bill&mdash;and if Deputy Hickey threw his mind back to the time before he left the land he would have known this&mdash;might have a more serious effect on unmarried agricultural workers than on farmers.  There are unmarried agricultural labourers who do not want the Bill to be enacted as it would not suit them.  There are unmarried agricultural labourers who have not taken the holidays they are entitled to get because it would not pay them.</P>
    <P>Even by taking the £3 12s. or whatever their wage is, they would be at a loss by taking them, and, consequently, they take the money instead.  The same thing will happen under this Bill as well.  The Bill enables the man who wants a half-holiday to get it, but that is about all it does.  That is the only way such <Col N="1369" /> a Bill could be worked in this country at the present time.  If we were to set out a compulsory half-holiday, I believe that we would drive agricultural workers out of the country, because you would have exactly the same conditions about which Deputy Keane spoke when he mentioned the farmer who was taken into court because he did not give the holiday, and, a decree having been given, on the following Saturday dismissed the men who were working for him.  We do not want those things to happen. We want the goodwill and harmony which have existed between agricultural workers and farmers over the years to continue, one dependent on the other, one man's interest the other man's interest.  The agricultural worker and the farmer were born in the same district, the same parish; they went to the same schools, played the same games; they live the same life, and eventually they will find themselves in the same graveyard.  It is not the same in industries in cities and towns.  There is none of that harmony which exists in rural life, that importance of one to the other and that friendship.  We do not want to disturb that state of affairs.  A person who stands up in this House and disturbs it does a bad thing.  Particularly when we hear so much about the flight from the land, anyone who causes that harmonious relation which exists to-day to be broken is doing a bad day's work for the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the House has agreed to accept the Bill in principle.  I thought, when introducing it, that there would not be any debate, that it would have been acceptable in its entirety to all Parties.  I have been criticised by Deputy Mac Fheórais for not bringing it in long before, but the Bill is here now, and I hope that Deputies will give me all stages here and now.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;Report. - Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the course of pointing out when the debate was interrupted that what will be regarded as restrictive trade practices under this Bill will be decided by the <Col N="1371" /> commission.  That commission has yet to be set up and the Minister has not given us any details concerning it except that it is to consist of not more than four or less than two members. The House will agree with me that the work to be carried out by that commission is of vital importance to the commercial and industrial community and yet, as I say, we have had so far no details concerning the composition of that commission or what interests, if any interests as such, will be represented on it.</P>
      <P>I notice also that the quorum of that commission shall be two.  That does seem a rather small and perhaps intimate number of persons to decide matters of such importance as those with which that commission will undoubtedly deal.  The commission will examine various trades and the conditions under which they work and make a report to the Minister.  Under Section 8 of this Bill, the Minister, having considered that report, may make an Order and he may prohibit various arrangements; in fact there is a whole range of prohibitions which he can make.  Under the same section, sub-section (1), paragraph (f), he may make such other provisions in regard to the supply and distribution of goods as he thinks fit.  I do not think a Minister of this House has ever been given wider powers than that.</P>
      <P>Under the last sub-section of the Bill, the Minister has to bring that Order to this House but I am nervous, and many other people are nervous, in this regard.  I am not referring personally to the Minister in any way but there will be other Ministers sitting in that position after the present Minister and we may have a Government here which is hostile to certain trade interests in this country or, indeed, perhaps hostile to very many of them.  It would be a very easy thing for such a Minister, followed by a subservient Party, to make an Order which might be entirely inimical to the interests of the commercial community and, therefore, to the interests of the whole country.  That is one of the objections I see to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we turn to Section 13, which <Col N="1372" /> provides the penalties, we find that certain financial penalties are laid down.  In one case, on summary conviction, a person is liable to a fine not exceeding £500, and on conviction on indictment, the fine can be up to £5,000.  In commercial matters one could not object to fines.  I suppose it is fair enough that, if a Bill passes through this House dealing with commercial matters, financial penalties should be invoked.  Perhaps £5,000 is a rather large amount and is rather harsh treatment, but still an argument can be made out that a big company might laugh at a small fine.</P>
    <P>However, when you come to the sub-section which says that a person shall be liable to not more than ten years' penal servitude, I think that is a most extraordinary provision to put into a Bill of this nature.  I cannot think of any commercial misdemeanour which would entitle a person to ten years' penal servitude.  Indeed, murder, and certainly manslaughter, might not be treated as harshly as that.  The Minister has not given us any grounds for thinking that there are any practices at the present moment which would warrant such a very severe penalty.  If there are such practices going on at the present moment which would warrant that, I think the Minister has ample powers to deal with such offenders under the various legal remedies which exist for the restraint of trade, or offences which would warrant such a severe penalty might even be dealt with under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In short, I do not think the Minister has shown any justification for such a harsh penalty as ten years' penal servitude. I would remind the Minister that in commercial or trade matters, it is possible for people, to whom the full extent of the crime is not perhaps apparent, unwittingly to break the law. It might be that some innocent person could be condemned to a very heavy sentence of penal servitude for doing something which, in effect, he did not know was contrary to the law.  We should hear from the Minister as to what are the reasons for putting such a very heavy penal clause in this Bill. I would like the Minister, when replying, to give us the real reasons why he <Col N="1373" /> considers this Bill and the very heavy penalties under Section 13 necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss at this stage certain aspects of the commercial life of this country.  Trade and commerce are not carried on in as simple a fashion as many people imagine.  There exists in this country, in common with every civilised country and to a greater extent in more highly industrialised countries, a complicated system of price structure.  That price structure has been built up over generations. The various structures of trades and industries have been evolved for the benefit of the particular industries, not indeed for the benefit of the persons concerned in them.  While it may appear, sometimes, that a certain individual or a certain section in a trade is doing very little for the place they occupy in the structure, I would assure the House that, on examination of that particular trade and its general set-up, it will be found that that particular individual or class is contributing something to that trade, and is therefore entitled to remuneration for services.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an idea in the minds of many people that certain sections of industry operate like pirates or brigands and that certain persons in them get a rake-off.  I would like to disabuse the minds of people in this House and outside of that idea.  If they think that the general trade and industry of this country is carried on in such a fashion, I tell them that it is not.  There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Very probably there are cases that will have to be dealt with, but I am quite certain that they do not exist to anything like the extent that a lot of people imagine.  In the business community, any section of trade that is battening on a particular industry or on trade in general gets very short shrift unless there are certain factors preventing the ordinary flow of business.</P>
    <P>In the past 25 to 30 years we have been building up an industrial arm, and a great deal has been said in this House for and against the industrial policy which we have been pursuing. Personally, I believe that an industrial <Col N="1374" /> policy is vitally necessary to this country.  I also believe that behind tariffs and so on, which are and which have been necessary for the building up of that industrial arm and that industrial life, you may get certain individuals acting not in the general interests of trade.  At the present moment we have quotas in addition to, and sometimes instead of, the tariff system.  Deputies have referred to the actions of individuals in connection with quotas.  Undoubtedly, there are individuals preying on certain industries, but I do not believe that that happens to any large extent.  The Minister, through his wideawake Department of Industry and Commerce, could very well deal with such individuals in special cases, and a Bill of this sort is not necessary to rid a trade of such persons.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, by and large, the persons engaged in industry in this country are in it because they are necessary to the particular trade and because they are giving a service and carrying out some special function which requires their specialised knowledge.</P>
    <P>I want to rid people's minds of the idea that the industry of this country is a vast conspiracy ranging from the manufacturers to the small shopkeepers and that that vast conspiracy works to defraud the public.  That is not the case.  That is the greatest nonsense. It is time somebody pointed out that industry in this country does not carry on in that fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred, somewhat darkly I thought, to letters reaching the Department complaining about restrictive practices.  I am sure a number of letters have come into the Department but I would imagine that a great number of them are from people looking for terms to which they are not entitled.  Many people want to buy at the same rate as shopkeepers. One of the things which the commission, which it is proposed to set up under this Bill, will realise is that fixed prices in themselves are not necessarily a bad thing.  There are many people who seem to think that that is so.  I shall develop that argument later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> Deputy McGrath referred to a wireless set which was bought by a local authority hospital in County Cork and said that the same week a wireless set of the same make was also bought by a voluntary hospital in Cork.  He said that the two sets cost £18 each.  In the first case the local authority was quoted a price less 33? and the Deputy seemed to think that in order to be able to quote less 33? that wireless dealer must have had a very large profit and that, therefore, when a few days later the voluntary hospital was quoted £18 his profit must have been enormous.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that when the dealer quoted the local authority less 33? for that wireless set his maximum profit was something in the nature of 5 per cent.  The highest it could have been was 6½ per cent., and it quite likely was 2½ per cent., so that makes the transaction far from being one which was unfair.  It makes it that actually the local authority hospital got a wireless set at a very cheap price.  I would imagine&mdash;I do not know precisely&mdash;the reason the local authority hospital was quoted a very cheap price like that had something to do with the bulk buying of the Department of Local Government and that that particular dealer felt that he was dealing with a hospital which might buy many of his sets. Therefore, in fact, there is no proof of any overcharging at all; there is merely proof of one hospital getting a wireless set at a very cheap price and another hospital, not so fortunate, having to pay the ordinary retail price. That is the only conclusion that can be come to from that particular transaction.</P>

      <P>Yes.  If any individual in that hospital did anything to that particular wireless which would <Col N="1376" /> require immediate servicing, that man would have to send out and examine the set&mdash;and, these things occur.  By the time that wireless dealer maintained a warehouse, paid his assistants the recognised wages, paid rent and rates, and at the end of it paid taxes to the State on whatever profits he made, I do not think that even 40 per cent. would give him any great profit&mdash;and we have no proof that he would get 40 per cent. on every set he sold.</P>

      <P>He could only have got 6 per cent. on that particular transaction, that is the maximum he could have got.  In fact, I do not know whether he only got his 2½ per cent. discount.  On the general question of trade structure in this country, that structure with its various price differentiations was set up, not to encourage parasites but in order that the particular trade may exist and run to the best advantage, both for those engaged in it and for the community at large.  There is talk sometimes about commodities that are imported and processed.  I am thinking of a particular commodity which comes in at the ports and is sent all over the country and is in universal use&mdash;I am referring to timber.  It goes to inland towns, where undoubtedly there will be a merchant, builders and the general public.  I want Deputies to consider the case of a merchant in an inland town who holds timber stocks. He gives employment by virtue of his assistants and men who handle the timber.  He also, like the wireless dealer, pays rates and taxes.  Is there anything wrong in there being different rates for those three individuals? Is it right that a person who holds perhaps thousands of pounds worth of stock, as even a small merchant would in an inland town, should find that every other section of the community is able to buy from him?  Certain individuals seem to think that this <Col N="1377" /> Bill is going to attack price differentiation like that.  I maintain that it cannot do such a thing, that if it does it will tear down the delicate structure of trade which we have in this country in common with all civilised countries. If that is done, this Bill will be the Brass-Plate Merchants' Charter. That is one of the big matters which has to be decided and it has not been made at all clear in this Bill.</P>
      <P>A lot of people were frightened that, under this Bill, they as merchants, carrying on business decently, giving employment of a high-class character, paying top prices, would be reduced to beggary because the Government was going to come along and say: &ldquo;No, any man in the street can buy in the future as you can.&rdquo; I believe that to be absolute nonsense.  I think it is a pity that the Minister was not more clear in his opening speech to allay the very unnecessary alarm which many sections of the commercial community have felt.</P>
      <P>One of the matters about which there has been some talk is the motor trade. I really do not know anything more about the motor trade than an ordinary, commercial individual knows.  I know, however, that it has a complicated structure.  It is a vast trade.  It employs highly-paid men, salesmen, travellers and skilled mechanics.  The motor dealers have big showrooms. Behind or at the side of those show-rooms they maintain, in many cases, repair shops as ancillaries to their business of selling motor cars.  Certain individuals seem to think that there is something awful about motor dealers making a profit of whatever sum they may make on a car.</P>
      <P>Again, I do not think there is anything wrong.  The question is, are they making too much?  I think that somebody in this House talked about the profit made on selling a car.  It seems a terrific thing to go out and sell a car and make £200 profit, but if a man has to maintain all the complicated machinery of highly-paid labour personnel he needs that to keep those people going and to make a profit out of his business.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be travelling away <Col N="1378" /> from the Bill which deals with restrictive trade practices.  The Deputy is talking about profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, no. Perhaps I have not made myself clear. Certain people thought that because there was a certain profit to be made on selling a motor car the motor dealers had banded themselves together in a group whose activities were restrictive.  I maintain that is not so, that it would be very wrong for me or any other private individual to be able to buy a motor car and sell it at the street corner and make the same profit as people who maintain show-rooms and keep a large labour force going.</P>
      <P>This House will have to make up its mind as to how far it is prepared to agree with price structures and price maintenance which are carried out for the purpose of maintaining industry. Indeed, in this connection, I have seen no sign of there being a discussion so far.  It would be a very easy thing under this Bill for the whole complicated structure of prices to come down and this House will have to make up its mind as to how far it is prepared to run that risk.</P>
      <P>A trader who is working with fixed prices, such a man who is working as part of an association, gives employment, maintains staffs, pays rates and taxes and makes a profit.  That man is, I maintain, playing a very big part in keeping the industrial and commercial life of this country going.  Is it wrong or reprehensible for that man to feel aggrieved, when he is selling at a price which is a fair price in the opinion of the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the opinion of such bodies as this House has set up, at a man who sells at a cut-throat price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does this House think that the man who sells at a cut-throat price does so for the good of the community?  Does it think that any man slashes his stock in order to bring down the price of a commodity?  No, he does it to suit himself.  It may suit himself but it has never been proved and, indeed, never maintained in any responsible quarters that bankruptcy and trade <Col N="1379" /> difficulties did any good to a country or to the community in that country.</P>
    <P>If it is maintained that legitimate prices exist very largely to pay the rates of pay which organised labour gets and which we are all glad to see organised labour getting, is it in the national interest that somebody who slashes prices for his own personal reasons should be held up, perhaps, as a public benefactor or that the men who seek to prevent him doing that should be held up as public enemies? Again, this House will have to decide just what its thoughts on that matter are.</P>
    <P>I think that restrictive practices probably exist.  Personally, I am not aware of them, but there are probably some.  I do not imagine, however, that they exist to anything like the extent a number of people and Deputies think. I am certain that a lot of the complaints against so-called restrictive practices are complaints by somebody who wants to get a better discount or supplies of some line which he thinks he should carry.  It is a delicate matter. Trade and industry are very subtle matters which have to be carefully handled and we have to be very careful in dealing with them.  We are not a commercial nation and we have not been so in the past.  I referred to the industrial arm which was being built up here.  Just as we have not been an industrial and commercial nation as such, it is reasonable to say that we are new to some of the difficulties and complexities of commercial and industrial life and so we should proceed very carefully in dealing with them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to a very vexed question in connection with this Bill. The Minister in his opening speech made reference to the trade unions and said he was not dealing with them because they were restrictive in essence and recognised as such by the House and therefore he would not deal with them under the Bill.  I think that is a very beautiful piece of sophistry. He could have given other and more cogent reasons for leaving them out. I say this in no sense against the trade <Col N="1380" /> unions.  Far from it&mdash;I personally am a believer in trade unions and trade unionism.  I have seen the benefits which trade unions can bring to the industrial life of the community when they are working as smoothly as we and they would like, and I think the right of collective bargaining which is enshrined in their constitutions is something which all civilised countries concede willingly and gladly, but I would say to the Minister that when one half of the industrial field is being brought under review and is being radically altered, as it can be under this Bill, it is not wise to leave the other half out.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we can consider the complex and delicate structure which is being built up in this modern society without also considering one of the contributory factors to that structure. The trade unions have played their part, for better or worse, in making the commercial and industrial life of this country what it is.  They have played their part in the various sections in the nation's commercial life and they have also played their part in the price structure.  Therefore, for the Minister to bring in a Bill and not to discuss or work out the question of restrictive practices in relation to trade unions is something which, I think, maims the Bill and maims it from the point of view of trade unions themselves and the community as a whole. I consider this such a very big question that it might have been dealt with by means of a commission to examine the whole matter.  I know that our experience of commissions is not always as happy as we would like.  Sometimes they are rather dilatory, but nevertheless a commission is one of the ways in a modern world of getting expert advice on a matter which would be unsuitable for contentious discussion across the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>I have tried to point out to the House the very complicated structure of modern commerce and business.  It is really too big a subject to go into to the extent to which I should like to go into it, but I hope I have shown the House that there is always the other man's point of view and that the industrial community are carrying out their work in a way which they believe <Col N="1381" /> to be in the best interests of the trade itself, which carries, in most cases, the best interests of the community at large.  There are undoubtedly restrictive practices of certain types, but I do not think they warrant a Bill of this type.  I do not think it is wise for the Minister to take such dictatatorial powers and hand them over to an unknown commission.  We especially do not know what lies in the future.  We are a country which believes in private enterprise&mdash;I take it we do&mdash;but I do not believe in unrestricted private enterprise.  I do not think that private enterprise should be allowed to do all it wants to do in a whole lot of ways, but the power being given to a Minister in the future to come in here and to use the last paragraph of sub-section (1) of Section 8 to do what he likes to the industrial life of this country is too dangerous a power to hand over.  We live in a world in which many business interests have already felt the lash of Governments which are entirely and completely hostile to them.  I regret that I must oppose this Bill.  I must oppose it on the ground that it is unnecessarily harsh and on the ground that the Minister has not made a case for the introduction at this stage of such a very drastic measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on the Estimate for his Department, the Minister stated that industry here is now in its second phase.  Over 20 years ago an effort was made to foster and develop Irish industries.  In the initial and primary stages of that development many regulations were made, many Orders were given and many Acts were passed through this House with a view to strengthening these young industries, and these Orders, regulations and Acts had the effect of more or less lending themselves to use as restrictive measures. There is always that danger when a Government begins to foster industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now reached the second phase.  We have built up a large number of new industries and it is time for these industries to enter on that second phase wherein there must be competition and wherein our industrialists must produce for export and the <Col N="1382" /> restrictive practices which operated must be done away with.  It is only by keen competition and efficiency that our industrial drive will be able to cater for the export market.  It is for that reason that I am so much in favour of this measure.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here by some speakers that the industrialists and the business people are not afraid of the Bill.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who said that these people thought that Fianna Fáil did not mean anything in putting this Bill before the House and that they were not afraid of it.  That is not so.  Every Deputy must have received dozens of letters from associations, federations and groups of one kind or another.  Every mail brings circulars advising Deputies to vote against the Bill.  That goes to show that many people are afraid of the Bill.  These people should be asked: &ldquo;If there is nothing to hide, why be afraid of the Bill?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The penalties laid down are harsh. The discussions which have taken place in the Press and elsewhere have had a salutary effect.  The ordinary man in the street is becoming interested in this matter.  He is beginning to discuss these questions.  The feeling is abroad that people should not regard excess profits, rings and so forth as matters that ought not to be talked about. People have begun to talk about these things.  That is a healthy sign.</P>
    <P>A statement made by a businessman sums up the situation correctly.  He said that if 5 per cent. of the business interests of this country tie up the other 95 per cent. we will have chaos. That is quite true and any measure which aims at counteracting that should have the support of this House. Competition is very necessary right through each phase of our industrial arm because competition produces efficiency since manufacturer will compete against manufacturer in an effort to produce a better quality article at possibly a lower price.  Competition will induce the wholesaler to use better methods of distribution and so on.</P>
    <P>It is not right that a particular agent should have a complete monopoly of any particular commodity in general use.  If an individual or a group of <Col N="1383" /> persons has a complete monopoly of the sale and distribution of a particular article that inevitably leads to practices which are not beneficial to the consuming public.  The farming community suffers heavily from the activities of business people and others who purchase the products of the farm. The millers purchase farm produce. Throughout all the different processes very large profits are made.  The hide buyers have a monopoly of the hide and skin business.  They can offer any price they like to the farmer and he must either accept a bad price or not sell his hides at all.  There are rings in other spheres of trade also.  Take, for instance, petrol.  Petrol is not readily available to prospective retailers, no matter what the distance may be between two petrol pumps.  If a village has a petrol pump, and if the next village is ten or 15 miles away, a person between those two villages who wishes to erect a petrol pump for the benefit, possibly, of the farming community in that area is not allowed to do so.  That is one of the many things that should receive attention, and that will, I am sure, when the fair trade commission is set up.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said that the Minister should have included in this Bill the matter of the practices adopted by some trade unions.  As everybody knows, there are restrictive practices pertaining to some of the unions inasmuch as everyone who wishes to become a union member cannot do so, and that the restrictions are very tight in certain trades.  In a large organisation such as the trade union movement &mdash;an organisation which has rules and regulations and which can look after its own affairs&mdash;I think it would be a matter for the unions to set their own house in order, and I may say that many of them are doing that.  If, eventually, the trade union movement does not tackle the matter in earnest, then it will be up to the Government to take some measures to do away with any restrictions which may exist.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in this House that a member of the Garda or other persons have the right under this Bill to enter business premises, to ask questions, <Col N="1384" /> and so on, and it was stated that that is unfair.  Some Deputies asked why should a businessman or a manufacturer be subject to such a scrutiny. Very many people in this country are subjected to queries and scrutinies of that kind.  The Revenue Commissioners scrutinise the business of an individual.  When a person is looking for an old age pension or for benefits under the social welfare schemes he has to submit a statement as to his income, and an inspector interviews him and queries him on many matters. I do not think that the manufacturers or business people of this country should be in a privileged position. They should be subject to questioning, to inquiry and to scrutiny as much as the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a matter which I hope will receive attention.  It may not come under the scope of this Bill, but it refers to a vast number of fairly cheap or small articles which are in everyday demand in every household in the country.  One shop sells such an article at 2d.; another shop sells the same article at 3d., and the third shop sells the same article at 2½d.  Where there is a difference of 1d. in an article costing a few pence it means that the percentage of profit must be very high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid it might not so arise but I feel that it is a matter which should receive attention. Deputy Dockrell did not seem to think that motor sales people make huge profits.  He said that they have to maintain showrooms, to employ staff, travellers, and so forth.  I have often wondered why it is that in this State cars are sold at a price which, in many cases, is lower than the price charged in Britain, and in some cases not much higher than the British price.  We must bear in mind that the British Government rake off 33? per cent. purchase tax and that the motor sales people there have garages, show-rooms and have to employ staff just as much as the motor sales people here. Yet, after paying 33? per cent. purchase tax&mdash;I think it is even higher in <Col N="1385" /> some cases&mdash;they are able to sell their cars, retail, at a price which, in some instances, is lower than the price charged here.</P>
      <P>The general opinion throughout the country in regard to this Bill is that it is a good Bill and that it is necessary. From the speeches I have heard in this debate it would appear that that is also the feeling of this House. I hope that, when the commission is set up, the ordinary person will benefit by any regulations which are made to help to bring down prices and to do away with restrictions which&mdash;in some cases, of necessity&mdash;have grown up in a period when our industry was growing up.</P>

      <P>As there appears to be a pretty fair measure of agreement amongst all Parties in the House that there exists in our economy an evil comprehensively described as a &ldquo;restrictive practice&rdquo; which requires to be treated, I propose this evening to devote myself practically entirely to the consideration of whether the measures adopted in this Bill are adequate for the purpose for which they were designed, namely, to extirpate that evil from our economy. Before I criticise the specific proposals for dealing with that evil, there are certain general comments which I should like to make because I feel that it may be misrepresented hereafter, from the criticism that I have to offer, that I or those with whom I am associated are in favour in some way of the restrictive trade practices which this Bill is designed to eradicate from our economy.</P>
      <P>I should like to recall the fact, because it is a fact, that the trail which the Minister is now treading, was one that was blazed for him by his predecessor. I think I can claim, I hope correctly, that I was the first Deputy in this House to raise in this House this question of restrictive trade practices. Speaking on the Budget Resolutions of the year 1947 on the 13th May, 1947, as reported at column 78, Volume 106 of the Dáil Debates, I made use of the following expression:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;When businessmen and industrialists ask trade unions to give up <Col N="1386" /> their restrictive rules, to allow a greater flow of apprentices into the various crafts and trades, industrialists who get the benefit of State assistance should be asked themselves to do their part in connection with the abolition of these combines and trusts of protective associations which exist for the purpose of restricting entry into particular classes of trade, industry and commerce and also for the purpose of keeping up prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign of 1948, I stated that the abolition of these restrictive trade practices was one of the aims of the Party which I was representing.  Therefore I think I can say that, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we are as much against these restrictive practices, cartels, monopolies, rings and associations, whose aims are the maintenance of prices for the sole or main purpose of enriching their members, as any other section in this House or outside the House.  But when we set out to abolish an evil we must know our objective and we must know the particular type of objectionable practices which we wish to extirpate.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of this Bill is that while it uses in two or three places and in the title the phrase, &ldquo;restrictive trade practices&rdquo; and also speaks of &ldquo;fair trading rules&rdquo;, nowhere in the Bill is there any definition or description of what are restrictive trade practices, nor is there any guide to the commission that is proposed to be set up under the Bill as to what are fair trading rules. I appreciate fully the difficulty of defining restrictive trade practices or laying down with precision guides or rules to direct this commission in the task which is proposed to be given to it by this Bill to lay down fair trading rules.  But the difficulty of description or definition, in my opinion, at all events, ought not to prevent an attempt being made to define those practices.  I was personally impressed with the argument at first that it would be better not to lay down any definition or attempt to define restrictive trade practices because of the difficulties of doing so, and because of the possibilities of evasion, or misinterpretation, <Col N="1387" /> due to faulty draftsmanship, but, after full consideration, I have come to the conclusion that, unless there are some definitions or descriptions of the practices which we wish to eradicate, then this Bill will fall very far short of the objective at which it is aimed.</P>
    <P>We regard these malpractices, which are comprehensively described as restrictive trade practices, as something which are very ugly indeed.  They are something operated by the possessors of wealth, property and influence in order merely to levy a toll on the general community, something operated in their own selfish interest, and they achieve their objectives by means of cartels, monopolies, rings and the other means that have been referred to in the course of the debate.  I believe that these practices are unjust. I believe they are unjust, because they represent an interference with liberty, inasmuch as they preclude our people in general from free dealing in the products of human labour and, at the same time, deny the right of the public to enjoy the full play of free competition.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to follow, while realising the difficulties to which I have adverted of defining restrictive trade practices, how we can really achieve what we apparently wish to achieve, unless we can ourselves define for ourselves, or at least adequately describe, the restrictive trade practices which we are aiming at eradicating.  I therefore think, and I shall in the course of the remarks I have to make urge upon the Minister that he should take a different course from what he has taken in the Bill.  While, as I have stated, I fully agree that there are difficulties in definition, I think that a greater measure of success would be achieved if the attempt is made.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the fact that there were numerous criticisms of this Bill.  I must disagree with him. What struck me about this Bill, when it was first published, was the extraordinary silence of those people and associations from whom you would have expected&mdash;certainly I would have expected&mdash;more clamant protests than <Col N="1388" /> have been made.  This Bill was ordered to be printed by Dáil Éireann on the 26th June, 1952.  I had expected, and indeed had prepared some remarks for a speech at that stage, that the Second Reading of this Bill would be taken some time in July.  The Second Reading was not reached last July, and up to the time of the adjournment of the Dáil, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there was not a single public protest from any association, group, cartel or monopoly whose interests might appear to be affected prejudicially by this Bill.  It was only within the last fortnight or three weeks that the Federation of Irish Industries and the Associated Chambers of Commerce have been publicly vocal upon this measure.  Again, to me at least, the remarkable feature about these so-called protests is their apparently extraordinary reasonableness.  I must say that these facts to which I have adverted raise suspicions in my mind as to the effectiveness of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Everyone knows that they exist and, possibly, the Parliamentary Secretary may be right that it is better for them to scuttle in the hope that they may not be noticed. One of my objections to the machinery established by the Bill is that those classes of people, in fact, may not be noticed, at least for very many years. The Parliamentary Secretary may, therefore, be right, that it might be better tactics to take cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, I think we must know what particular restrictive practices we are aiming at.  The Minister, in the course of his remarks, spoke about delays in court.  I will have occasion, in the course of the observations which I have to make on the machinery it is proposed to establish by this Bill, to comment upon the fact which, I <Col N="1389" /> believe, will be a fact, that whatever may be said about delays in court they will be nothing to the delays which will occur under this machinery.</P>
    <P>There was one matter, I think, mentioned by the Minister in the course of his opening remarks with which I certainly do not agree.  He said that he did not think there were as many of these restrictive practices in existence in this country as elsewhere. I, personally, think that there are more, relatively speaking, in this country than elsewhere.  I think, as has already been pointed out and, indeed, partially or impliedly admitted by the Minister himself, that many of these restrictive practices have been bred in the atmosphere of restrictionism which has unfortunately been associated with the national policy of industrial development.</P>
    <P>The last speaker also referred to the fact that, some time within the last 20 years, an effort was made to encourage Irish industry.  That is a remark which I certainly could not allow to pass without comment.  It was not protection, I assume, which the Deputy was referring to, but the intensified campaign or policy of protectionism which was inaugurated in 1932.  It was not protectionism which established the Shannon scheme, the greatest industrial achievement since the establishment of the State.  Irish industry was protected and encouraged long before 1932.</P>

      <P>Now, while, as I said earlier in my remarks, I believe that the real basis of our objection to these restrictive practices is that they are unjust, what we have set out here to do is not to do an injustice but to do justice.  Deputy Dockrell, I think, stated that we were in favour of the principle of private enterprise. Certainly, the Party that I belong to stands for the principle of private enterprise, regulated private enterprise if you like.  What we want to do, and what I believe the real, genuine businessmen, manufacturers and industrialists also want to do is to eradicate these particularly obnoxious trade restrictions and practices which, <Col N="1390" /> in fact, are the enemies of the free enterprise system and threaten its continuance, so that, those practices having been got rid of, private enterprise may operate freely within our economic system.  That is our justification for standing for something like this Bill, and certainly for the principle of eradicating restrictive practices from our economy: that it is good and necessary for the proper functioning of the free enterprise system in a free economy that these restrictive practices should, in the public interest, be eradicated.</P>
      <P>The question which we have to determine is whether or not this Bill does effectively or will, if brought into operation in the form in which it now stands, do effectively what all sections in this House desire to be done&mdash;that is do what I have described, eradicate this evil of restrictive trade practices from the free enterprise system in order that that free enterprise system may operate freely in an atmosphere of freedom.  We must not do an injustice to other persons.</P>
      <P>There have been critics of this Bill. There have been two types of critics of the Bill.  Of one of those types of critics, I think probably the least said of them the better.  We have the critic of the Bill who will raise all sorts of points on the Bill because his own private wealth is being attacked, and because his method of scooping the pool at the expense of the public is in danger.  With that particular type of critic, I have no sympathy whatever.</P>
      <P>There have been other types of criticism of this Bill, and the controversy which has taken place about the Bill has not been altogether fair to at least some of those critics.  I say that because those particular types of critics, the chief spokesman of whom is Senator McGuire&mdash;he and those for whom he stands&mdash;are as critical of these restrictive practices as any of us, but they are very deeply concerned about the methods employed to deal with them and of the possible evil effects or consequences that may ensure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not think that you can solve one problem by creating another problem or problems.  I think that is what the machinery devised by this Bill is going to do.  I have made it my <Col N="1391" /> invariable practice in this House never to express legal opinions, or opinions on constitutional matters, but I do deem it proper that I should ask the Minister if he has had it considered whether or not this Bill, and the machinery provided by it, in any way infringes the provisions of the Constitution.  I presume that I will be misrepresented for having raised that point.  I do not raise that point for the purpose of putting any impediment in the way of the Minister in dealing with these restrictive practices. I raise it for the reason that I believe there are certain interested groups who may be affected in their personal interests adversely by the provisions of this or some other Bill, or perhaps a better Bill that may be devised to deal with these restrictive practices, and that they will find ways of frustrating the effort to deal with these practices, one of which may be to attack the constitutionality of these provisions.  Therefore, I think that this House is entitled to know whether or not that aspect of the matter has been given the consideration to which it is entitled.</P>
    <P>I recall a case which came ultimately to the Supreme Court in which part of an Act passed by the Oireachtas was declared to be unconstitutional.  It was a trade union Act and was sponsored, I think, by the present Minister during the régime of the Fianna Fáil Party prior to the change of Government in 1948.  The representative of the Attorney-General in that case argued both before the late Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy and before the Supreme Court that the Constitution gave power in the public interest to regulate the right of forming associations and trade unions which is guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution, and that that power conferred upon the Oireachtas, the Parliament, the right to abrogate and take away the right to form associations or trade unions.</P>
    <P>We have to face this situation as it stands at the moment, that business people under the law as it has been declared in our own courts are entitled to form what we would regard as price maintenance rings, provided only that they do so for the protection of their <Col N="1392" /> own trade and personal interests and not with the idea of injuring any other person.  There is, therefore, a private right established by our courts, and what we have to do in this Bill is to ensure that we will be able so to frame a law that the public interest may be reconciled with private right and that, while fair play should be given to the public and the consumer, justice must also be given to the trader and the manufacturer.</P>
    <P>Under Article 40 there is a right to form these associations, but in the same Article Oireachtas Éireann is authorised to enact laws for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of that right. Under Article 43, the right of private property is guaranteed, but the same Article recognises that the exercise of the rights appertaining to private property must be regulated by the principles of social justice, and that a law may be enacted to see that these rights are exercised in accordance with social justice.</P>
    <P>Now I think it is incumbent on the Government, and the Minister in particular, to assure this House that the machinery recommended for adoption in this House is in strict accordance with the powers conferred by the Constitution on Oireachtas Éireann to regulate in the public interest the right of forming associations and the exercising of those rights appertaining to private property which are guaranteed by the Constitution.  Unless care is taken in that respect damage will be done to the particular desires that all sections apparently have, namely, to eradicate the exercise of rights by private individuals acting in association or conspiracy contrary to the public good.</P>
    <P>There ought not to be any great difficulty in so framing a law as to come within those Articles of the Constitution. But, acting as I was on that occasion for a trade union, I refused to follow the line adopted by the counsel for the Minister when he said that this Parliament was entitled to abrogate the right of forming associations and trade unions, and I confined myself merely to suggesting and arguing that the particular law which was being attacked was one exercising the <Col N="1393" /> right conferred on Parliament by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am expressing no opinion on whether or not these powers would be regarded as powers regulating in the public interest the exercise of the rights of free association and the exercise of rights appertaining to private property. But, unless that problem is tackled, a more difficult problem may be presented to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    <P>Having raised that point, which I think is rather a fundamental point, I want to examine some of the provisions of the Bill.  I have already directed the attention of the House to the fact that there is no definition or even description of what are restrictive trade practices or what can be regarded as fair trading conditions.  I entirely object to Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.  The reason that I object to them is that I formed the view shortly after getting this Bill last June, when I awaited the storm of criticism which I expected and which did not arise, that the effect of Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill would be, not to result in a set of conditions being conceived, designed and codified which would be fair trading conditions, but to give legality and the full force of law to what, in fact, we know as restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>I note here that there is no power in anybody except an association representing persons engaged in the supply and distribution of any kind of goods to apply to have fair trading conditions with regard to the supply and distribution of goods formulated by this commission.  I asked myself what was the point of that; why was it given to the very associations, or some of them, to which objection is taken to have the sole right and privilege of applying to this commission to have fair trading rules established?  I must say that I approached these sections, therefore, with very considerable suspicion and I formed the conviction, a conviction from which I see no reason to depart, that the effect of these sections, if they have any effect at all, will be to enable these associations to get the force of law for rules and <Col N="1394" /> practices to which many would object. I think the Minister will be well advised to leave out Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate that they do not have the force of law as such, but the fact that they have been given by the commission as fair trading rules will give them a sanction which these rules would not otherwise have, and that sanction in my opinion would eventually be such as to operate to give them in fact, not the force of a Statute, but the force of law outside a Statute.</P>

    <P>2.  That the Governor and Directors of the Central Bank exceeded the functions assigned to them by Section 36 (1) of the Currency Act, 1927 (No. 32 of 1927), by embodying political and other views in the said report.</P>
    <P>3.  That the said report failed to disclose information which it ought to have disclosed.</P>
    <P>4.  That in so far as the said report directs or urges:&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on the last day I was trying to deal with the background of this motion and this problem.  I would like to make the general summarising remark that, whether we like it or whether we do not, whether a change is desirable or whether it is not, this problem is conditioned by a particular background and by the existing state of the facts which must be taken into account.  In particular, there is a certain financial structure, both internal and related to the sterling area, <Col N="1396" /> and its mechanics, as a whole, that simply must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>To take the content of this motion, in the first place the report itself comes under fire, and I hasten to add that there are many things in that report with which I personally might not agree.  We must have regard to the fact, however, that this is a body set up with a duty to report, and that this is its report.</P>

      <P>It is a very valuable thing to have a body which can report on such matters and report objectively.  I was going to keep to the finances, but there is the point that when you have a body which is required to report&mdash;and I think it is a very important thing that such a report should be available&mdash;it is better to have that body in the position of reporting freely.</P>

      <P>We should not want to have that body apparently presenting a report when it is in fact producing something under duress.

      <P>It is better that they should have power to do it openly without hidden pressures so that we know that we are getting that report from a known source and that it is the genuine product of that source, not an emanation from a hidden source.  I am not going to tie myself, no Government could tie themselves, to such a report. In many cases Governments in the past have not accepted similar reports.  But I think it is hardly fair or right to pillory the people responsible for a report like this in the way they have been pilloried here.</P>
      <P>To come to the terms of the motion. I do not want Deputy MacBride to take this in any personal sense but this motion is drafted as a case.  It is drafted in a way that deprives us of almost all opportunity of objective discussion.  Look at the words of 4:</P>
      <P>That in so far as the said report directs or orders.</P>
      <P>Then follows (a), (b), (c) etc.  I know of no better way of conveying an innuendo.  We have had plenty of experience of innuendoes in the courts. Deputy MacBride and myself have come across that word.  I take exception to the form of the drafting because it contains a series of innuendoes which are not justified, or if they are, why not put down straight, in black and white, what you are objecting to instead of hinting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take a couple of the concrete points to which the Deputy referred on Friday.  He was agitated about the investments of the moneys that are shown in the balance sheet or statement of accounts of the Central Bank of Ireland for the year ended 31st March, 1951.  In the particular document to which I refer the sum shown to be invested in British securities is £55,000,000 odd.  Deputy MacBride asks why, and certainly it is no harm to query it.  I have no quarrel with Deputy MacBride for raising the matter.  I think it is a question to answer.  He also has a question mark about the return on that sum of money. I think I am putting it fairly: the Deputy asked why it should be invested there, and queried the return on that investment.  There are two <Col N="1398" /> answers to the first question why it is entered there.  One is, if you like, a legal answer.  The simple answer is that under our currency law as it is it is mandatory to invest these assets in that way.  On the question of the bulk that is invested in British securities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct the Deputy?  It was originally under the 1927 Act mandatory but that was amended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, by Section 3 of the Act of 1930 and by Section 64 of the Central Bank Act of 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with those points.  I will make my points in advance so that you can knock me down as I develop them.  As the law stands at the moment&mdash;and that situation can be changed only by a legal process in this House in one form or another&mdash;it is mandatory to invest there.  If you say: &ldquo;Why do you not do something about it?&rdquo; my answer is that you had three and a half years.  Probably since neither Government has done so they had very good reasons.  There is the summary of my argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not mandatory on them to invest.  They have power to invest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Under Section 61 of the Currency Act of 1927 it was mandatory to invest under those heads and in fact it was at that time mandatory to invest in British securities &ldquo;maturable in 12 months.&rdquo; I want the House to note that point, &ldquo;maturable in 12 months.&rdquo; Now that Act was amended by the 1950 Act and a section of that Act deleted the &ldquo;maturing in 12 months.&rdquo; That left the situation under the amendment in Section 3 that by the unanimous request or representation of the Currency <Col N="1399" /> Commission, the Minister, by a process of legislation by Order&mdash;there is no need to go into the actual details &mdash;could alter that situation, but until that situation, mandatory under the Act of 1927, was altered by the appropriate action, the 1927 law remained.</P>
      <P>Let me pause to consider the effect of the 1930 Act before I go on to the 1942 Act.  Without going into a legal argument with Deputy MacBride upon the content of the words &ldquo;unanimous request of the commission&rdquo;&mdash;I know it could be claimed that if you made the suggestion to those fellows you would be able to make them come and tell you to do it&mdash;the legal position is that the Minister could not do anything under the 1930 Act without a unanimous approach from the commission. I think that is a fair statement of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we come to the Act of 1942.  The Central Bank Act of 1942 contains Section 64 which is an emendation by reference to previous relevant legislation as the Deputy knows.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that emendation by reference is not always very satisfactory, but in this particular case the amendment amounts to the deletion of the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo; and its effect. I think that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It was replaced by &ldquo;a simple majority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  In other words the position after 1942 was that upon the request of a simple majority, to use Deputy MacBride's words&mdash; frankly I was not going to commit myself to that because it was drawing an inference, but if the Deputy wishes I agree&mdash;the Currency Commission could approach the Minister and, upon the Minister being approached in that way by a majority of the commission, he could take the necessary action.  Then there is a further complication of the machinery which I need not go into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided for.</P>

    <Col N="1400" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I forget exactly, but there are two separate considerations to be dealt with.  However, that is merely a question of machinery.  The net position we have arrived at to-day&mdash;and let us note the identically same position existed in 1948 when Deputy MacBride and his colleagues were in the Government&mdash;is that Section 61, which prescribes for the investment of the assets of the legal tender note fund under those headings, one of which is British Government securities, remained mandatory with the deletion of the words &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; I referred to above. With that one amendment Section 61 of the 1927 Act remained mandatory until amended in the particular way provided for by the two Acts we traced.  That was the position, and the Minister for Finance to-day, no more than Deputy McGilligan as the Minister for Finance in Deputy MacBride's Government, could not amend that position except in that particular way, or by bringing in new legislation into this House.  Let me summarise that by saying that legislative action of some form or other was necessary in this House before that situation could be altered.  I know that is a lawyer's answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is surely not so.  A majority request&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A majority request to the Minister would still involve legislative action, and I am accurate in law and in fact in stating that the mandatory situation, with the amendment in regard to 12 months I have mentioned, under the 1927 Act, could be altered only by legislative action as provided by the subsequent amendment in the form we have discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not legislative action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the long run.  The Deputy is begging the question.  Does not all legislative action depend on the Minister?  If Deputy MacBride will let me go on I will make it a bit clearer.  I am talking as a lawyer, but I realise what the simple answer to me is.  That is all right for a lawyer, but the fact is <Col N="1401" /> there is no difficulty in changing that situation.  Is that not the fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as law goes, the answer is that.  There are a great number of problems that arise in changing that, with which I will deal in a moment.  I think I am entitled to reiterate that the situation on the 19th February, or whatever date it was in 1948, was identically the same as it is to-day.  Why did the Coalition Government not do it?  There must have been some very good reasons.  I know Deputy MacBride would certainly do it if it were a practical proposition. I think I can pay him that tribute. Why, because there is, when you clinch with the problem, a very difficult situation there.  It is not easy of solution.  I am giving the Deputy that answer in the same spirit in which I gave him the answer on the question of breaking the link with sterling. There are many of us who would sympathise with some of the fundamental ideas in that approach, but when you clinch with the problem you find the insuperable difficulties.  I am also certain that this served, when Deputy MacBride was in office, to prevent him and his colleagues from taking action, and I am sure that is the reason why to-day we are no further advanced in that regard than we were then.  I am saying that in an exculpatory way for Deputy MacBride.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at it from another point of view.  You have so many million pounds in the sterling invested in British Government securities. Why do we not take them back and invest them here?  Is that not point No. 1 with Deputy MacBride?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that point No. 1?  Do you not want them invested here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I want them invested here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very <Col N="1402" /> laudable aim when it is put as neatly as that but let us look at the problem. These assets, looked at from one point of view, are claims in the sterling area outside this country.  They are claims on goods and services which in the last analysis are to be equated against goods or services at one time or another furnished by this country.  In other words, whether we look at it generally or from the point of view of the individual, a sum of money held like that in the sterling area is a claim.</P>
      <P>Let us see what the processes of repatriation would be and let us get down to a single unit.  I own £1 sterling.  That is a claim abroad for £1 worth of goods or services.  I can certainly repatriate my asset if I buy something with that £.  If I buy, say, so many packets of cigarettes or if I buy an essential part for a machine which I am working at home, and bring those cigarettes or that machinery home, I repatriate those assets, with the distinction that if I bring in machinery and it is productive machinery, I will be conserving my asset as well and, in the case of cigarettes, I blow it up in smoke, in which case I have simply blown my asset.</P>
      <P>Supposing I do not choose to do either of these things, supposing I want to repatriate the money, what is the only thing open to me?  I have to sell it to someone for an Irish £. Is not that so?  I transfer it for an Irish £, that is, a claim for goods or services at home, for the person who gave me that, if I bring it home in that way, has taken over this sterling claim and, if it is an Irish person, all I have succeeded in doing is transferring the sterling claim.  I have not repatriated anything.  I have merely transferred it.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious, therefore, that in regard to actually repatriating the assets, as Deputy MacBride admitted on Friday, if I read the report aright, I can only do it by importing goods or services and, obviously, it is no very great economy to import consumable goods of a non-essential type, like the cigarettes I spoke of, in the long run, to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you consider the thing in reverse, somebody has a claim on us here, has <Col N="1403" /> Irish assets, which would be a debt for us, the reverse position holds and, granted&mdash;I think this is where the confusion arises&mdash;you can then apply the national transfer in both of these cases to cancel out, but you cannot go beyond the cancelling-out process. So that your position is, except in so far as claims on both sides cancel out, your net balance, if it is a positive one or even if it is a negative one, I think, is not repatriable.  So there it is.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has so many millions there.  If it were to invest that number of millions here, as the Deputy is talking about, that in effect means giving credit to that extent here at a particular rate of interest, and that will not in any way affect the net holding of sterling, as I tried to argue.  It is rather difficult to go into a rather arithmetical argument here without a blackboard.  I think I have indicated a general line from which it will appear that it is just not feasible to take these assets as such, being sterling claims, and just import them back.</P>
    <P>That argument becomes reinforced when you consider what they are there for&mdash;as a backing for your currency and its relation to the banking system. I can summarise the whole thing by saying that, short of a very radical overhaul and complete change of your banking and currency system, it is not possible to take that sum there as it stands and invest it in Irish securities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Your main problem would be to find investments for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  If Deputy MacBride says that the thing is so rotten that we have to face up to complete revolution in our financial system, if he says that we have to scrap our relation with London, that we have to set up a completely new monetary system, I would say: &ldquo;Very well; now we are on a talking basis.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you agree with me then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If you say that, I <Col N="1404" /> have one very simple question to ask you: &ldquo;You might have something there, but will you put it down in black and white and let us see what it is? Give it to us in a form that we can criticise.  Give us forms A, B, C and D and let us see what concretely you propose to do.  It will be a very big revolution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Secondly, there are certain problems that have come up in this discussion before and I am not going to refer to them&mdash;the transition problems.  What are you going to do with regard to these?  Put up your blue print of what you are going to do.  It is not enough to say: &ldquo;Break the link with sterling.&rdquo; You might as well say: &ldquo;Fly to the moon.&rdquo;  I will talk about flying to the moon with you when you give me the design of your rocket.  If you come along with your rocket and tell me: &ldquo;My mass ratio is such and such and my fuel load is this, and so forth,&rdquo; then I can talk to you in concrete detail and decide whether I will travel with you in your rocket attempt at the moon or not.  If you come along and say simply: &ldquo;We will go to the moon,&rdquo; I will say: &ldquo;You will go alone.&rdquo; In the same way, with regard to this problem, if you are serious about it, give us a set of concrete proposals upon which we can argue and then we can join issue on a lot of practical details as well.</P>
      <P>As the banking situation is, as the whole monetary machine is, for the general reasons I gave, reinforced by considerations of what that legal tender note is there for at all, it is not possible to do what Deputy MacBride has suggested should be done.</P>
      <P>Now let us come to the question of industry.  It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Invest that at a higher rate of interest&rdquo;, but Deputy MacBride, I am sure, has gone to the trouble to read a little bit about this subject at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy has not.  It is only my way of stressing the point that the Deputy has read all that is available <Col N="1405" /> and knows as well as I do that one of the conflicting things in banking as it developed is the balance between liquidity and return on a bank's asset. That is always the problem, is it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank needs its cash liquid in a very peculiar way which I am not going into now. The fact is that if it is not liquid you upset the whole mechanism that is there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get into it <Col N="1406" /> another way.  Take the case of a firm that invests in an Irish industry.  I do not like to go into this because it seems to be rather decrying Irish investment.  I do not want to get into detail here for reasons Deputy MacBride can appreciate as well as I do. He knows the great difficulty of getting investment in a restricted area where that money is going to be tied up indefinitely and may suffer a big loss. We have had examples of it here in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we not lost equally by investing in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, except in so far as the actual value of the monetary unit is concerned, you are always equivalent to that, but not in the sense that you would lose on the long-term investment.  I do not want to go into questions affecting Irish securities here for a very obvious reason, but I would put it this way, that one of the big advantages of having the whole sterling area is this&mdash;the whole sterling area is a big pool and if I invest in that, even on long-term, a sizeable sum of money I can withdraw it rapidly because even though it is a sizeable sum of money it is only a drop in the pool and I do not affect the balance. However, although I am only a few drops, if the pool is much smaller and the ratio of the withdrawal is much bigger, then of course I am only able to liquidate quickly at the expense of changing the whole complexion of the pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mind if I interject like this or does it put him off his track?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Where you invest in British Government securities it has nothing to do with the sterling area pool or reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Then my argument is easier.  I thought I was answering or up against the question why not invest it here at home?  I have given the first part of that answer, which was the impossibility of repatriation except in a particular way, <Col N="1407" /> and secondly, the banking system. Now, if that is not the issue, it is easy.</P>
      <P>Why is it invested in British Government securities?  Are not these the safest and surest investments in the sterling area?  They have the advantage of liquidity and, as a matter of fact&mdash;it is a pertinent question to Deputy MacBride&mdash;when certain large funds came into the hands of the Coalition, why were they invested just precisely in that type of investment? I think the answer will be found to be that it was because it was necessary to have them liquid and able to be drawn upon.  I would like just to follow that out.  I take it now that Deputy MacBride is withdrawing from the position that they should be invested at home as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You are allowing them to invest in the sterling area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I was pointing out to the Deputy that he was mistaken in thinking that they were at the moment invested in the sterling area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They are&mdash;and specifically in British Government securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The sterling area reserve or pool, therefore, has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure of that.  The sterling area reserve and pool has a good deal to do with it if you follow it up, but I want to get clear the basis on which I am arguing with Deputy MacBride.  I joined issue with him first when he naïvely suggested that you could lift that £55,000,000 worth of sterling assets and take them over and seek to invest them at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You could invest at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I said you could not do it and I tried to trace out how. I am not going over that again.  I asked Deputy MacBride first to analyse the process of dealing with claims and to look at it from the point <Col N="1408" /> of view of the claim of a citizen here on an asset externally and a reverse claim.  I agree that you could have a cancellation, but short of that, cancellation being equivalent notionally to an equal double transfer of goods and services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Creating credit here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on that basis I said that it is not feasible just to repatriate them in that sense.  Right; now, there is one thing you could do, you could go on issuing more notes and say you have that security there, but that is going to upset the balance.  If you look at the balance sheet, you see that they are already equated against the note issue and if you were to go through a form of that nature I think it is a type of inflation that would not be very beneficial to anybody.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I mentioned the complexity of the machine, the whole disjointing of an economy and monetary machine. On these three grounds, I say that it is not feasible to repatriate them in the sense that Deputy MacBride is talking about.  We then come to the question of a return on these investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing we ordered England to-morrow morning to build us two ships and that they cost us £1,000,000 each, would that not be £2,000,000 repatriated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And we got the ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all with you if you can do it.  If you can get goods or materials, as far as external assets are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an answer regarding external assets.  Do not let us get confused. I am all with the Deputy as regards our external assets.  Our quarrel with the Coalition Government was that they were scrapping factories in Inchicore and elsewhere when they should have been buying machinery, building factories and spending our external assets in that manner.  I would have been delighted to clap my hands and <Col N="1409" /> say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; if they had done that, but they spent them on consumer goods.  That is what they did.  I am in agreement with the Deputy, but do not let us get the question of external assets in the broad tied up with our banking.  The Central Bank cannot repatriate its assets in that form.  I have not gone into it in any detail in regard to the mechanism of backing the currency.  The money is already balanced against notes outstanding, against currency.  It is already balanced, and to issue any further credit&mdash;that is what investment would mean&mdash;would be unbalancing that situation and would be inflation unless there was some other corrective mechanism involved or brought into play, but Deputy MacBride has not worked that out or made any suggestion.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in that tortuous way, I have got to the point where I say that these sterling assets in the net cannot be repatriated.  These assets are necessary as a backing for the currency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>All of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to ask the Deputy a question?  Could the Deputy give an instance of any other country in the world that backs its currency 100 per cent. by foreign securities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer anything.  What I am trying to impress upon Deputy MacBride is that we are dealing with a particular situation here.  We have got to take our trade situation into account and think of the very ordinary commodities such as wheat, tea and all sorts of machinery which are involved in trade. There is a very particular advantage in this one-to-one relation between the Irish £ and the £ sterling.  That relation depends very intimately upon the set up of our currency and banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride more or less put me off the logic of my argument. Having disposed of the contention that you could just take that money as a sum on paper, transfer it home and forget about it, we are back to where we were a moment ago.  If we are at <Col N="1410" /> the point where those assets are to be invested in the sterling area, where are you going to invest them better than in the British Treasury which is really the Central Bank of the sterling area? That is very roughly the situation. That may not be scientifically accurate but that is the case.  Will you invest, as Deputy MacBride suggests, our money and assets which are at the moment, under existing conditions, the back-bone or the backing of our monetary system here in speculations in the sterling area?  Will the Central Bank for instance put that money into speculative undertakings at 4, 5 or 6 per cent.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Which would be most beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>These are claims on the sterling area.  Short of cancellation by equivalent imports and exports there is no way that you can repatriate that credit balance.  On that premises they are claims on the sterling area. Under the monetary system that obtains in the sterling area those claims can be set to work and earn more interest.  You have the choice of having them completely liquidated as cash.  You can buy gold and hold it. In that case the claims are dormant. They are not working.  They are asleep.  You could set them working at a highly speculative rate but if you do that you are up against the balance of liquidity and security as against return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy MacBride a question.  If those assets are not invested in the safest place in the sterling area, where you have the advantage of liquidity and where those claims can be realised at any moment, where will you put them in the sterling area?  Will you put them into some big industrial undertaking in the sterling area?  How liquid will it be?  If you are going to sacrifice liquidity will you be satisfied with such security and will you tie up this money for a long time in such an undertaking having regard to the economic conditions of the present day?  Will you specifically give credit or money to specific undertakings instead of to the sterling area at large?  You have an advantage and an interest in the sterling area at large.  I do not <Col N="1411" /> think that the Government or the Central Bank would be justified in limiting its interests to some particular things in the sterling area.  The Central Bank would have to do the same as a big firm.  They would have to look out for a list of investments. It could get them.  I could rattle off a list but, perhaps, it is just as well not to.  If one procures a copy of the <i>Financial Times</i> one will see therein a list of places where the money can be put but what would be the consequences of doing that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not some of those firms on the other side compete unfavourably with our industrialists here in that they had the £55 million at a little over 1 per cent. as against the 5 per cent. we paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If one went very deeply into the matter the Deputy would have something in that point, but one is up against the whole system in that.  Once we have granted the point that that money represents claims in the sterling area, they are going to stay in the sterling area external to this country.  Once we have got to that common point of agreement &mdash;we are in agreement as to the methods by which we could repatriate our assets and that they could not be effectively repatriated in any other way&mdash;the complaint of Deputy MacBride why it should ever be done that way is inherent in the whole banking system, not only for here but for the sterling area at large and what is involved is not such a simple transaction as Deputy Hickey suggests. What is involved is a revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to. I am trying to argue reasonably and I think the Deputy is trying to argue reasonably with me.  We agree that there is a way of repatriating assets, but only by bringing in worthwhile goods.  You can do it by bringing in any kind of goods, but we are agreed that it should be done in an economic and profitable manner, so the Deputy and I would agree that the best form <Col N="1412" /> would be capital goods.  I am going a little further and I do not know whether the Deputy completely grasps the point.  I have tried without the aid of a blackboard to bring out that you cannot effect a repatriation&mdash;I think Deputy MacBride agreed with me on Saturday last and I can give him the quotation if he wants it&mdash;in any other way but the way the Deputy said.  If you cannot effect a repatriation in any other way, these existing assets on this day represent claims that cannot be repatriated in any other way.  They are there at the moment to back currency.  Assume that the Central Bank took Deputy McBride's advice and set about repatriating. The only way would be by buying, say, the ships you mention. The Central Bank would have to buy 55 ships, and is it the suggestion, then, that our currency should be backed by 55 ships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not by 55 ships.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite serious. I am not trying to make fun of the Deputy.  There was a time when that kind of idea was afoot.  After the 1914-1918 War, the Germans issued something, backed by the land of the country, which merely boiled down to one big bluff, and, on the same principle, although it sounds funny, you could back your currency with 55 ships, but it is not sound finance in the system we have got.  When I talk of sound finance, I am talking of it specifically in relation to the system that is there.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Davin or Deputy MacBride will produce their blue-print for this revolution and deal with the transitional problems surmounting very serious economic repercussions such as I dealt with on another occasion, he might have some unexpected recruits to follow him. <Col N="1413" /> But we have to deal with the system as it is to-day, and you cannot do these one-sided, isolated things without upsetting the whole concept.</P>
      <P>With regard to this sum of £55,000,000 which Deputy MacBride talked about, I say that, as the monetary machine, the monetary system, is, we cannot repatriate these £55,000,000 in the way so naïvely suggested.  If you cannot&mdash;I am repeating myself, I know, but I am afraid this friendly argument lends itself to repetition&mdash;then the money which represents claims in the sterling area can be dealt with in two ways outside as it lies outside.  It can be held dead by buying gold, for instance, or it can be set to work for return.  The return would be sterling, which must be remembered, but then you are up against the question put by Deputy MacBride: Why British securities?  My simple answer to that is: Where else?  Let us follow up the consequences of &ldquo;where else?&rdquo;  Is the money to be invested in some British colonial development, in armaments or something like that? If that is the idea, I should say that it is not a very safe security.</P>

      <P>We live and learn. I think I have shown that, short of the actual importation of goods and services, it is impossible to repatriate assets of this nature.  May I quote from Friday's debate?  I admit that on Friday I was more tentative on the point because I came in more or less impromptu. I said on Friday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Short of the importation of equivalent goods or services, I wonder can we actually, by monetary transaction alone, effect any repatriation of assets.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We are agreed on that.  I want to go a little further to-night. I think I have shown that it is not feasible, short of that or a cancellation of claims, which really boils down to a notional double transfer, to repatriate these external assets by monetary transaction alone, to use the phrase with which Deputy MacBride agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, what are your external assets unless they happen to be real assets?  I do not know that we have any real external assets.  What are they?  They are claims on goods and services.  That is what money is in this sense.  Deputy MacBride and I seem to be agreed on that.  I was going on to argue then on the particular form of investment, treating it as a monetary transaction in the sterling area.  Deputy MacBride challenges me and I ask him a very simple question: &ldquo;How can you invest these assets at home?  How will you do it?&rsquo;  That is a very simple question.  Deputy MacBride says in reply to that question: &ldquo;The first thing I would do is prevent them from increasing.&rdquo;  I take it from that that Deputy MacBride thinks it just is not possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One can look at it from two points of view.  One can come back again to this national idea that was invoked&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;as a confidence trick in Germany after the first world war.  It worked there for a while.  Alternatively, one comes back to a change in the whole monetary <Col N="1417" /> system here, including breaking the link with sterling.  Again, I am compelled to ask the Deputy: &ldquo;In what way can we do that?  How can we do it in concrete form?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Because over and above all that there is all the machinery of claims.  The whole banking system is involved in this.  That is what I am trying to hammer home. All that must be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to join issue now with Deputy MacBride in connection with another matter.  Deputy MacBride talked about stock increasing.  How does the Central Bank increase its holding?  How does it come about that the Central Bank has increased its stock?  What happened?  I ask the Deputy that question so that we may find out the practical way in which to do what the Deputy suggests should be done in order to stop stocks increasing. It is very easy to say: &ldquo;Stop something&rdquo;, but if you intend to stop something you must first find out the best way in which to bring about the desired cessation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thing I can do is read a paragraph from an answer given to Deputy MacBride on the 28th November, 1951. It may throw some light on the matter.  It will be found at column 1664 of the Official Report, Volume 127:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A little reflection, coupled with a knowledge of finance, will enable it to be seen that some Irish residents, or Irish institutions, must hold the foreign exchange reserve of the Irish community, so long as they are fortunate enough to have any.  When one Irish holder transforms his holdings of foreign assets, i.e., claims upon foreign goods or services, into Irish currency or bank deposits within Ireland the first effect is to increase by an equal amount the holdings of other Irish institutions or individuals.  If Irish commercial banks, for instance, transform their foreign holdings into Irish currency, the foreign holdings of the Central Bank would be increased accordingly.  If the Central Bank were compelled by law to hold part of its funds in the form of Irish securities the external holdings of the commercial banks would be increased to an equal amount.  If an Irish individual translated his personal holdings of foreign assets into Irish pounds or a deposit in an Irish bank the foreign holdings of the Central Bank and/or the commercial banks would be increased in the same amount.  In short, we can only repatriate or liquidate the holdings of foreign assets in the hands of Irish <Col N="1419" /> citizens and institutions by using them to claim foreign goods and services, that is, by importing foreign goods and services in excess of our current foreign earnings from exports of goods and services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is more than that to the answer, but I think the relevant information for our purpose to-night is contained in that paragraph.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  We have heard Deputy MacBride for a pretty long period.  We have heard Deputy Major de Valera for a long and interesting period.  Perhaps, before Deputy MacBride concludes, it would be a good thing for the House to hear a third point of view. If Deputy Major de Valera continues to talk until 10.30 to-night it may be impossible to hear the third viewpoint.</P>

      <P>I will give way now.  I just want to make this one point in conclusion.  If I export 50 cattle to Liverpool and the cattle are sold there and I get so many pounds sterling in return for them, what happens? Do I not want that money here? As I have already said, and as Deputy MacBride has agreed with me, the only way to do it is to give the Central Bank my 50 English pounds sterling and to get in return the equivalent value in Irish pounds.  I know that that transaction may be masked in view of the fact that the actual English pound note sterling will circulate here also but, fundamentally, that is what happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What you are up against there is a trading matter.  Some Deputy on the <Col N="1422" /> Labour Benches wants to talk and I think that would be unfair to prevent him from doing so.  I want to summarise like this.  I put the question to Deputy MacBride and he is not able to tell me concretely how he will repatriate those assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest that Deputy MacBride got to answering my question was to say that we should stop increasing it.  Time is against my following up that point now but perhaps I shall get an opportunity of doing so on another occasion.  That, then, is my first point.  My second point is of interest.  That is tied up with where you invest it and particularly with liquidity.  I asked Deputy MacBride if, having those claims and that money there in the sterling area and externally and at large, you do not invest at the central point in British Government securities, where else are you going to invest it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get an answer from him.  My third point is the legal point.  Anyway it is mandatory, short of Government action&mdash;and it is very significant that we had no Government action during three years of another Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member.  I am not throwing that in his face as there is his promise and there is what he did. I am giving it as a very cogent reason why the situation remains as it is.  I am giving it also in connection with Deputy McGilligan's insistence, as Minister for Finance&mdash;and I am sure, again, only under the compulsion of circumstances&mdash;in investing certain moneys that came into his disposal in the same channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these words I will, I think, say that this criticism of this report is unfounded and I finally take objection to the innuendo method of presentation. I take objection to that particularly as, in reading Deputy <Col N="1423" /> MacBride's opening speech, he did very little, if anything, to substantiate his charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the debate on the motion has somewhat changed its facets.  Following upon Deputy MacBride's introductory speech&mdash;which, to some extent, ran into a confined channel&mdash;and the opening remarks by Deputy Major de Valera, we were then getting on to the question, not of economic and fiscal policy but rather of the economic background which, he alleged, had been created by the inter-Party Government, and then, again, we got back to the question of policy.  Like many other members of the House, I feel anxious to have the question of policy pursued, but I am somewhat nervous of getting between the two protagonists who have been arguing here for the past one and a half hours, not on policy but on mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera has gone to great lengths to explain all the difficulties and obstacles in the way of his trying to do certain things&mdash;on which, apparently, we all agree in principle. I take it that Deputies on practically every side of the House agree that <Col N="1424" /> within certain limits it is desirable that such assets as we have should&mdash; as I say, within certain limits&mdash;be invested in our own economy.  We recognise that we are bound by certain fiscal handicaps in that sense, to the extent that portion of our assets, in the form of external assets, cannot quite clearly be readily realised and repatriated in the way we want.  We recognise that we have a currency tied to the British £ and we also have a certain balance in relation to our external trade.</P>
    <P>All these factors go to make up the general atmosphere in which you have to try to deal with this problem.  My objection to the line of argument which Deputy de Valera has pursued is that instead of trying to seek a solution to the problem with which we are all concerned, he has spent an hour and a half explaining, not the difficulties from the point of view of removing these difficulties, but the difficulties from the point of view of getting a solution to the problem.  I do not follow Deputy MacBride all the way in his attitude on many of these questions, but I am inclined to go a good deal of the way with him.  I think that very often a solution of such problems may be found in probably the simplest statement, and the simplest statement in regard to the solution of this problem has been, I think, that of Deputy Hickey.  Speaking of our external assets he quite clearly said that a very simple way of repatriating these assets was to buy two ships, say at £1,000,000 each.  In that way we could get £2,000,000 worth of our assets home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed on that.  That is the point I am coming to.  While we are all agreed on that as one means by which we could repatriate our external assets for the purpose of using these assets in our domestic economy, the difficulty I see is that the whole question of our financial policy&mdash; and now it appears, also, of our economic policy&mdash;is largely not being determined by members of this House who are charged with that duty, but by bodies external to this House.  I <Col N="1425" /> agree with Deputy de Valera that if we are going to make any progress on any line on which we have broad agreement, it is going to involve a revolution, not in the usual popular sense in which that term is used, but in the sense of a complete change-about of our financial and banking policy&mdash;not of our economic policy because that is something on which we have broad agreement.</P>
      <P>What I am concerned with in regard to the motion is that we are debating it now 12 months after it was set down on the Order Paper and that very many of the things we were fearful of 12 months ago have now come to pass. They have come to pass, not alone from the point of view of the Opposition and of those who took part in the debate, but they have come to pass even in the words of the spokesmen of the Government Party.  That is a most serious situation.  These developments seem to me at least indicative of the fact that, whether it be a Fianna Fáil Government or an inter-Party Government that is in power, both Governments, in so far as existing conditions are concerned, are largely the servant of those forces which are external to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, as between the Fianna Fáil Party and members of the Opposition Party, there may be fairly wide differences of opinion on the mechanism and the methods which should be adopted to repatriate our external assets, to change or amend the dependence of our currency on sterling and on the question of how to deal with the problem of our balance of trade in regard to other trading areas of the world, but I think there is agreement amongst us all that, whatever be the policy we should pursue in the interests of the nation, it should be a policy that would emanate from this House and from nowhere else.  That is a matter on which I have grave doubts.  The mechanism of finance and banking is so complicated, so difficult, and so delicate that the ordinary man in the street, a class to which most of us here belong, finds great difficulty in approaching that self-defensive <Col N="1426" /> mechanism built up by the banks themselves so that they can preserve their own little sphere in which they have their own authority which nobody can challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might perhaps give us a statement of the historical build-up of that situation and the way in which it originated.  It was built up by the banks and now they are faced with their own Frankenstein which is not completely amenable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the position we could easily determine by agreement on both sides of the House the steps that should be taken to deal with it.  If we now get the admission that that is the position, that the banks are in control, then we know where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Historically the banks built up the system, but the system has grown up with all its ramifications and it is so delicately balanced that it is very difficult to change anything.  Nothing short of the revolution of which I spoke could achieve it.</P>

      <P>You are not interrupting me.  I would interrupt the Deputy if necessary.  If we agree that is the present situation, if we agree with Deputy de Valera that it has been an historical growth which has now reached a point so delicately balanced that any attempt to change that balance may bring consequences to us, in respect of which we are not clear but which may be very serious in their effects on the country; if from that we then proceed to the conclusion that in fact we can make no change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at least it would be an advantage and we would have a clear position to deal with, but our <Col N="1427" /> difficulty at the moment is that we all know we have got certain conditions in the country that we should like to see changed.  We have got underdevelopment of agriculture.  We have got an insufficiently developed industrial economy.  We have got between 60,000 and 70,000 men and women unemployed. Men and women for whom we have, not alone a sentimental regard but who represent an important factor in the country's economy are leaving the country.  That is an important fact in respect of which all Parties in this House have got certain viewpoints.  They want to see changes and the ordinary people in the country look to each other and every one of us to bring about the changes we all desire. Now it is one thing to say that there are difficulties in the way of bringing about these changes and that these difficulties can be tackled along certain lines&mdash;A, B, C, D, etc.&mdash;and that if we are going to tackle these difficulties we have got to get agreement on certain principles.  It is an entirely different thing to turn to the people and say: &ldquo;The difficulties are there; we would like to tackle them but we have not got the power to tackle them, and if we had the power we dare not use it.&rdquo;  Then the people would know where they are.</P>
      <P>There is no sense if that is the situation&mdash;and I am not saying that we agree upon it&mdash;in any of us going outside this House, going on election platforms and holding out, as we all have held out, that it is possible for us to provide for our people a more secure life, higher standards and conditions within the country which will enable our people to obtain work at reasonable wages and on reasonable conditions and to enjoy the ordinary amenities of civilised life without being faced with the prospect of their children having to emigrate to seek work in other countries.  That seems to me the problem with which we are all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the motion before the House is concerned, the important fact to consider is not whether the Central Bank made a mess of their forecast or whether they gave good or bad advice upon which the Government acted.  The <Col N="1428" /> important thing which we have now to decide amongst ourselves is whether we can agree on the objective and, secondly, whether it is possible to start to bring about, even in a small way, the revolution of which the Deputy spoke.  We have got one point of agreement at least, that it is possible to repatriate some of our external assets.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick gave notice that, on the motion for the Adjournment, he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 21 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, at Question Time, I asked the Minister for Finance &ldquo;if it was with his sanction and knowledge that a three feet high barrier was erected across the Keel River (Lough Carra to Lough Mask), and if he is aware of the extensive damage to over 130 farmers due to flooding caused by the barrier; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to have it removed or compel those who erected it to remove it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance was that he had given no sanction or authority to anyone to erect the barrier across the Keel River, and said that if I would bring the facts to his notice he would have them investigated.  He did not say that he would try to have the barrier removed. The first implication in that answer is that he knew nothing about it, and, secondly, that my question may have been a purely fictitious one, or that it may have been incorrect.  I want to assure the House and the Parliamentary Secretary that I did not put down the question for fun or for the purpose of misleading him or his Department.  I think he could have taken it that, when I put down the question, there was at least some cause for complaint and that otherwise I would not have put down the question. <Col N="1429" /> He seemed to treat this very important matter in a most frivolous manner.  I gave notice of the question on Thursday last so that the Parliamentary Secretary had six clear days in which to make an investigation.  Yet, he walked into the House to-day with an unprepared reply, obviously given to him by somebody else who did not take the trouble to investigate whether or not there was any substance in the complaint contained in the question.</P>
    <P>The fact is that a group of men spent almost a fortnight erecting a barrier across the Keel river, the only outlet from Lough Carra into Lough Mask. Lough Carra itself has three principal rivers flowing into it.  One is a fairly large river, and the others are two minor ones.  The surrounding area is split up into the usual average sized holdings of land so typical of the West of Ireland.  Owing to the fairly flat nature of the country surrounding the lake and that part of the country which forms the watershed of the rivers flowing into Lough Carra, any rise or fall in the river, particularly when it is artificially created by the erection of a barrier, is bound to have a very detrimental effect on the livelihood of vast numbers of farmers.  I have been told that 132 farmers are affected.  I believe it would be true to say that double that number is affected.  The fact is that a group of men set to work and built a barrier which is approximately three feet high. It is a stone barrier&mdash;not a porous one. It is fairly well constructed across the river, leaving only a small gap right in the middle of the barrier.</P>
    <P>During the last few years, particularly since the Clann na Talmhan Party came into the Dáil, a great deal of public attention has been focussed on the question of drainage.  Shortly after we came into the Dáil, the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was passed, and during the period of the inter-Party Government the Local Authorities (Works) Act was passed. It also had a lot to do with drainage. In my opinion, these were two of the most useful measures passed by this House since it was established. Despite the passing of these two Acts, we have this situation in County <Col N="1430" /> Mayo.  We have this interference with the Keel River which affects quite a large area.  Some time ago Deputy O'Hara of North Mayo raised a question in connection with the Moy River.  The building of these barriers by certain people across a number of the rivers there is causing flooding at a time when we are engaged in the effort, or at least should be, of effecting drainage in these areas.</P>
    <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me whether, since Question Time to-day, he has made any inquiries in regard to the points I raised in connection with the erection of this barrier.  I have seen it myself.  Does he doubt my word, or is the position this, that perhaps the word of an official will carry more weight than that of a Deputy?  The barrier can be seen even from the main road between Castlebar and Ballinrobe.  One can see it from the road without leaving one's car.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary by what authority anybody enters a watercourse and tampers with it, thereby affecting adversely the livelihood of hundreds of people.  By what authority and under what statute does anybody go into a watercourse and deliberately proceed to impede the flow of water in it, or are there a few specially privileged people in each county who can do that?  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there are some people who have the right to interfere with a watercourse in that way; have the people whose livelihood is threatened by the placing of an impediment to the flow of water the right to pull it down?</P>
    <P>Have they the right to take the law into their own hands and simply pitch those engaged in the building of the barrier into the river and give them a free dip?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary, by the callous indifference which he has displayed, want to create a situation so that people will be forced to take the law into their own hands in order to have their grievances brought to light?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and one that cannot be treated as lightly as the Parliamentary Secretary treated <Col N="1431" /> it to-day.  Now that he has knowledge that the barrier is there, I should like to hear him explain to me what steps he proposes to take to have it removed.  Lough Carra, Lough Mask and Lough Corrib form a network of lakes which are the subject of an arterial drainage survey at the present time.  On Lough Ayle, tributary of Lough Mask, a hut has been erected to enable the engineers of the Board of Works to estimate the volume of the water which passes there during a given period and get some idea of the cubic yardage of excavation work required so that a good arterial drainage job may be carried out there. These men are there within a few hundred yards of the place I speak of. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would not have put him out very much if he had to ask his officials who are there on the spot to let him know all about this barrier, especially in view of the fact that he got notice of this question six days ago.  Even if no official of his Department was in Connacht it is the duty of these officials to investigate the matter&mdash;I am sure if the Parliamentary Secretary asked them they would have done it&mdash;to see if Deputy Blowick was putting down a question on the Order Paper for the sake of causing mischief or wasting the time of the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary on a previous occasion tried to treat Deputy O'Hara when the question of the barriers on the Moy was raised, in the same rather indifferent flippant way he has treated me to-day.</P>
    <P>Is this the attitude of the Government towards the whole drainage problem? It seems to be in keeping with the cutting down of arterial drainage and of drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I am at a loss to understand the attitude of the Government. Perhaps it is that I and other members of the Clann na Talmhan Party are just being foolish in thinking that drainage is a major problem in this country.  Perhaps the Government think otherwise.  Judging by their actions, it would appear to be so, because they have cut down most of the drainage work.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that since they <Col N="1432" /> came into office this wall building across rivers in Mayo has been developed and permitted, and the Parliamentary Secretary takes very little cognisance of it.  Seemingly it does not matter a whole lot.  Perhaps it will improve the fishing prospects, and that fishing is considered more valuable than the livelihood of these farmers.  If this is allowed to continue in that area some of the best arable land which these people have will be completely useless in the coming spring.  It is a shocking state of affairs that a group of paid men with stones and cement can build a very substantial barrier three feet high across a principal watercourse.  The Keel river, across which this barrier has been built, is the outlet from Lough Carra and the rivers that flow into it.  The Lough Carra catchment area is a pretty wide one.  It is not a mountainous area.  The land around it is flat, and a rise of one foot in the river creates a very serious situation for nearly 200 farmers.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what he has found out about this or if he has found out anything?  Will he take steps to have the barrier removed?  I ask him to go further and to make an example of whoever has been responsible for erecting this barrier so that it will act as a deterrent against those who think that it is all right to put up barriers on a watercourse. A watercourse is considered much more valuable by some people than roads or entrances to their houses. They have to live on the land and if the land is flooded it is no use to them. They might put up with a bad road for a period of time, but if the land is flooded they have to clear out.  I should like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick has been a member of this House for almost a decade, for three years of which he was Minister in charge of a State Department. Therefore he cannot be regarded as a notice in the game of politics.  He has long since passed that stage.  The tactics he has employed in regard to <Col N="1433" /> this question are a clear indication&mdash;and I would not expect it from him&mdash;that he is prepared to play cheap politics for the sake of publicity.  I can come to no other conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says that I received this question six or seven days ago.  The first intimation we had of the erection of any barrier was when the question reached my office last Friday afternoon. I did not see the question until last Monday evening.  One would imagine that a Deputy with the experience of a Minister for three years in charge of a Department would at least, in the first instance, write to the Commissioners of Public Works and give a few relevant particulars regarding this matter.  The Deputy did not do so, however.  If the Deputy had done so the commissioners could have made an investigation.  In that way the investigation could have been made much more quickly than by the roundabout method which the Deputy has adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Deputy put down this question in order to gain some notoriety.  When the question came up to-day I gave the Deputy the only reply it was possible for me to give him in the circumstances.  I think I made a very modest request when I asked him to give me the exact location of this barrier and the date on which it was erected.  That was a reasonable request.  If the Deputy knows as much about it as he claims, that would not take him five minutes. A man as well versed as he is in instructing people how to make applications for such things as rural improvement schemes and minor employment schemes could put that in a telegram or he could convey it over the telephone to the secretary of the commissioners and there would be no trouble about it, but he did not do that.  Of course, he stated at the end of the supplementary questions, although it may not appear in the Official Report, that he would give the particulars to the Parliamentary Secretary.  At that time he did not even intimate that he was raising the matter on the Adjournment. It was only at 5 o'clock this evening that I was notified that he intended to raise it on the Adjournment. <Col N="1434" /> I do not mind that because I am fairly conversant with this kind of playacting. It does not surprise me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick sent in another question on the same day last week which would have some relevant bearing on this problem, but for reasons best known to himself he withdrew that particular question.  I suppose he had the feeling that the reply I might give to it would not redound to his political credit amongst his supporters in South Mayo.  I can come to no other conclusion or no other assumption.  As I have pointed out, we have had no objection from any of the 130 people whom Deputy Blowick says are injured as a result of the erection of this barrier of which we know nothing at the moment beyond what was brought forward here in this vague publicity question of Deputy Blowick's.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick is pretty conversant with Acts of Parliament, and I am sure he has studied the Arterial Drainage Act from beginning to end. He knows quite well that the Commissioners of Public Works have, under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act, certain powers in certain circumstances, and that it is only when a case is investigated that they can decide whether such powers should or should not be invoked.  Deputy Blowick has asked me a number of questions here to-night. I pointed out to him in reply that this barrier was not erected with the sanction of my office or with my sanction and I repeat that reply.  I have asked him for two simple particulars, very simple indeed.  Further, if these particulars are supplied to me, I give him my assurance that the matter will be very quickly investigated and I think that that is quite reasonable, but I will not assure him or anybody else that after the investigation is made the obstruction will be removed.  It can be removed by the commissioners only if a particular set of circumstances exists as a result of the erection of the barrier.</P>
    <P>He knows that Section 47 of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 covers all that.  What more does he want? Nothing except to go the roundabout way and get publicity for this.  That is the only thing.  I believe that what <Col N="1435" /> he should have done in the first instance was, as I have pointed out, to write to the commissioners.  If he did not get satisfaction, then of course it would have been his responsibility and his duty to come into this House and raise the question in a very vehement manner.  If he gets the particulars I have mentioned&mdash;they are very simple, very short&mdash;I assure Deputy Blowick that the matter he has raised will be investigated very soon, but, in the absence of these particulars, I do not think it would be fair to ask for this investigation.</P>

      <P>My reason for putting down the question was to short-circuit red tape.  When I say that, I am casting no reflection on anybody in the Parliamentary Secretary's office but if I wrote in to the commissioners, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, the matter would not be attended to as quickly as it will now.</P>
