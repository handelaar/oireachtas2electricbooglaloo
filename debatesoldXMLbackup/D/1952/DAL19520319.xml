      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the amount of money that would be required to buy, at the latest available date, the same amount of goods as could be purchased for £1 in July, 1945, or the nearest available date, measuring prices by the official cost-of-living index figure but excluding any change in the rate of subsidy since July, 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>The computation asked for by the Deputy can be made only very approximately in view of the fact that the rates of subsidy, per unit quantity of the various foodstuffs, can be obtained only as annual averages.  However, it is estimated approximately that, adjusting retail prices to what they would be if the rates of subsidy paid by the Exchequer per unit quantity were unchanged since 1945, £1 would have purchased the same quantum of goods (including rent) at retail prices in mid-August, 1945, as would 25/9 at the adjusted retail prices in mid-February, 1952.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his Department have yet any definite period envisaged for carrying out the original programme of extension laid down by Irish Steel, Limited, at its inception and approved by him in 1938, namely, the construction of a rolling mill, a blooming mill, a sheet mill and a tin plate mill; and, if so, if he will state the approximate month and year when it is expected that (1) the sheet mill, (2) the tin plate mill, and (3) the blooming mill will be in production and if he can now fix any approximate year when the full plant will be in production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of Irish Steel Holdings, Limited, has had under consideration various extensions of its activities.  Owing to current difficulties <Col N="2167" /> in securing adequate supplies of raw materials to keep the existing rolling mill in full production, and the probability of considerable delay in securing delivery of new equipment it is not possible to say when such extensions may prove to be practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he has considered any long-term scheme for ensuring that the raw materials required by Irish Steel, Limited, particularly scrap iron and steel, will be provided so that the industry may fulfil its function of keeping this country supplied with essential iron and steel in any emergency; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he yet has received any report from the inter-departmental committee set up to consider proposals for the extension of the deep-water quay at Cobh Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals in regard to the deep-water quay at Cobh Harbour which were submitted in 1947 had reached the stage early in 1948 when they were ready for consideration by the inter-departmental committee, but these proposals were not examined by the committee because of a decision taken in 1948 by the then Government that the consideration of all applications for expenditure on harbour improvements should be postponed. Subsequently, other proposals for the improvement of the passenger handling facilities at Cobh and for the deepening of the liner anchorage in the harbour were put forward.  A grant towards the cost of the scheme for the improvement of the passenger handling facilities has been made and, at the present time, a decision which has been made by the Government in regard to the project for the deepening of the liner anchorage is the subject of correspondence with the Cork Harbour Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that the Kilcommon rural area which includes the district of Rear Cross has been considered by the board on a number of occasions for development under the rural electrification scheme.  It has not yet been selected owing mainly to the low density of population and the hilly nature of the country.</P>

      <P>Apart from a proposal to utilise £50,000 of the Grant Counterpart Fund for the financing of approved technical assistance projects, which was approved by the E.C.A. on the 8th May, 1950, no formal proposals have so far been submitted to the United States authorities for the utilisation of this fund.  The matter has, however, been under active consideration for a considerable time past and exploratory discussions have been held on the subject with representatives of the E.C.A. mission.  Detailed proposals for the utilisation of the entire fund are now almost completed, and I expect to submit them formally to the United States authorities within the next week or two.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that following discussions last year between my Department and representatives of health inspectors, agreement was <Col N="2179" /> reached on a revised uniform scale of remuneration for health inspectors to be recommended to health authorities for adoption.  On the 12th July, 1951, a circular containing particulars of the new scale together with a recommendation for its adoption with effect from 1st April, 1951, was issued to health authorities by my Department.  It is, of course, a matter for the health authorities to decide whether they will put my recommendation into effect. The recommendation made was quite clear and unequivocal, and in the circumstances I do not think it necessary to repeat it.  So far as the Local Appointments Commissioners are concerned, their responsibility is to arrange for the filling of posts of health inspector referred to them by the local authorities concerned.  They have no function in relation to the determination of the salaries.</P>

    <P>The areas mentioned do not include some 45,000 acres being the remnants of estates taken over from the former Congested Districts Board.  This area comprises 20,000 acres of bog, mountain and waste and 25,000 acres of agricultural land which has been let for many years to tenants in whom the lands will probably be eventually vested.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the additional pay and the amount thereof which is payable to officers of (a) the corps of engineers; (b) the ordnance corps; (c) the medical corps; (d) the signal corps, and (e) the legal branch; and, further, the reasons why such additional pay is payable and whether such pay is reckonable for pension purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the regimental pay appropriate to their ranks and service therein, pay at the following rates is issuable to medical, dental, legal, engineer, ordnance and signal officers holding the necessary academic qualifications:&mdash;Medical and dental officers, £198 per annum; legal, engineer, ordnance and signal officers, £132 per annum.  There is one other class&mdash; veterinary officers&mdash;for whom the rate is £165 per annum.  The additional pay is issued in respect of the officers' professional qualifications, and affords the officers concerned a measure of compensation for their expenses in obtaining these qualifications, the benefit of which is given to the Army.</P>
      <P>With regard to pension, additional pay is reckonable as pay for the purpose of the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>As regards retired pay, officers of the classes mentioned may opt for assessment on one or other of two bases, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)retired pay appropriate to a regimental officer of the same rank plus, in the case of army medical corps and legal officers, 20 per cent., and, in the case of others, 10 per cent.  (A retirement gratuity is payable to married officers in addition to retired pay calculated on this basis.)</P>
      <P>(b)retired pay calculated on the basis of length of service and pay on retirement.  (No retirement gratuity is payable in addition to retired pay calculated on this basis, but additional pay, provided that the officer has been in receipt of it for not less than five years, is reckonable as pay for the purpose.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> It may be mentioned that, apart from officers of the classes in question who receive additional pay, there are certain medical, dental and legal officers who were in service prior to December, 1938, and who receive special inclusive rates of pay which are higher than the combined regimental rates and additional pay rates which I have quoted.  As regards pensions and retired pay, the conditions which I have already outlined also apply to these officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in reviewing the matters arising out of this Vote on Account, have the immense advantage that every Minister feels himself quite free to tell a different story, and they maintain outside this <Col N="2201" /> House another organ of expression which enjoys the additional freedom of offering an entirely independent version.  That is bad enough, but when you find the fundamental figures on which his whole fraudulent edifice of panic has been built are themselves defective as a result of the defective arithmetic of the Minister for Finance the difficulties of resolving our problems grow greater every day.</P>
      <P>I would refer the House to Volume 129, column 1936 of the Official Report at which the Minister for Finance purported to give us the figures which constituted the Budget problem that confronted him.  He said the Supply Services will cost £95,000,000; the Central Fund will cost £13,000,000 and below-the-line outlay will cost £26,000,000. &ldquo;The House will, therefore, see,&rdquo; said the Minister for Finance cheerfully, &ldquo;that if I have a revenue of £85,000,000 I shall have a deficit of £50,000,000 because my burden is of the order of £135,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the times in which we live I suppose £1,000,000 has come to be looked on as an insignificant figure here.  In the financial madhouse set up by the present Government that is perhaps a legitimate assumption but I will direct the attention of the Minister for Finance to the interesting fact that 95 and 13 and 26 add up to 134 and not to 135.  If the Minister gets out a stump of pencil and works that one out it may help him to get the rest of his problems resolved in a saner way than he shows signs of attempting at present.</P>
      <P>I said before that for any rational Minister to have the impudence to come here and announce that he, as Minister for Finance, had advised the Government to submit a Book of Estimates to Dáil Éireann founded on a prospective revenue of £85,000,000 and calling for a deficit of £50,000,000 is making a public show of himself and of this Parliament.  It is important to go on record at an early stage in saying that the allegation is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to be the fashion for the Minister for Finance persistently to absent himself from the House during discussions.  He did not attend for one <Col N="2202" /> single hour on Thursday and he now vacates the Front Bench again and leaves it in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.  I submit that is discourteous to the House and quite without precedent in the experience of this Assembly.  However, if that is the way the Fianna Fáil Government want to carry on nobody can stop them.  But it is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is especially wrong when, I regret to say, I have to bring to the attention of the House a deplorable and to my mind very regrettable sequence of events which has transpired in Manchester.  I attended a gathering of Irish people in Manchester on St. Patrick's Day&mdash;the day before yesterday &mdash; and subsequently a great many of them came to me privately and said they were much concerned as a result of a visit paid to Manchester by the Irish Ambassador about three weeks ago during which he addressed them and told them that the output of the agricultural industry was dwindling and was a matter of very grave concern to the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The fact is the direct opposite. What shocks me is that a campaign appears to be emerging to represent this country, not only in this Parliament but abroad, as being unable to meet its commitments, with a reckless disregard of the truth.  Whatever Fianna Fáil Ministers may want to do here at home amongst ourselves, surely there is no conceivable justification for propagating falsehoods in foreign countries, where such statements can do the economic life of our country very material damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to try to offset that deplorable form of publicity here in Dáil Éireann where, if there is any mistake made, it can be challenged on the spot.  What is the value of our agricultural exports?  I shall deliberately refrain from taking our total exports.  In 1939 our agricultural exports were £22.3 million.  In 1944 they were £24,000,000; in 1945 they were £27.5 million; in 1946 they were £30.5 million; in 1947 they were £30.9 million; <Col N="2203" /> in 1948 they were £36.4 million; in 1949 they were £46.4 million; in 1950 they were £51.4 million, and in 1951 they were £51.7 million.  Although, as a result of the British Ministry of Food cutting the price of eggs, we had reduced our exports of eggs by £2.5 million, we still made all that and increased by £.3 million in 1951.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances what conceivable justification is there for trying to make the case before the world that our capacity to export and to pay for what we require to bring in is dwindling? Our total exports in 1951 amounted to £81,000,000 sterling.  Our total exports in January, 1952, are 44 per cent. higher than they were in January, 1951.  I cannot get the figures for February or the details for January because there is some problem in the Central Statistics Office due to a change over to a new system and the installing of new machinery.  The last figure I have is for January, 1952, and in January, 1952, our exports were up by 44 per cent. on January, 1951.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned to see that this country in not injured internationally by the tripe that is talked by some people in this House.  It is very difficult to get people to understand statistics.  I have tried before to explain to the House that net agricultural production is a most dangerous figure because it represents the product of the land less the raw materials that had been used to get them so that, if you put out no fertiliser, if you make no improvements, but get everything you can out of the land, your net agricultural production will rise.  That is mining land.  That is the agricultural policy of locusts.  Nobody can get a net agricultural output from land so efficiently as a locust.  When a swarm of locusts have passed across an area of country and have left nothing behind them but a sandy desert, they have extracted from that land the maximum possible net agricultural production. Gross agricultural production taken over a period of years is the product of land without making any allowance for fertilisers or feeding stuffs, both of which ultimately manure the soil.  If you do not manure the soil to maintain <Col N="2204" /> it in good heart, over a period the law of diminishing returns will begin to show your gross agricultural production going down.</P>
    <P>I think a reasonable thing to do when looking at gross agricultural production, to try and get it into relation with the years that have gone before and the years that have happened since, is to take, not arbitrarily 1938 as 100, but to take as your base year the lowest point we reached in gross agricultural production.  If you do that, the increase in the volume of our agricultural production since 1947 is the largest of any country in Europe.</P>
    <P>Here are the figures: If you take 1947 as base year 100, in 1944 the volume was 109; in 1945, 114; in 1946, 109; in 1947, 100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to bring home to people who look at our industry is this, that the allegation made in this House that the Irish farmer is an inefficient, lazy crompán, is not true and that is the case that is being made before the world, that our agricultural community are a lousy lot of bowsies on the land, that they have let the agricultural industry go down and that they are not making any effort to retrieve it.  My case is that our farmers have done better than any other farming community in Europe. Why should we be the people to slander them and denigrate them before the world?  There are enough people anxious to run our people down without getting their cue from us in Ireland. The figure I was quoting are: 1944, 109; 1945, 114; 1946, 109; 1947, 100; 1948, 111; 1949, 122, and 1950, 116&mdash;I am trying to find out what that decline of six points between 1949 and 1950 is due to.  It may be the deliberate policy of reducing eggs rather than produce them at a loss for sale to Great Britain. But, from 1947 on, that volume of increased production is better than can be produced by any other country in Europe.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned about what the neighbours think about our people. All I am concerned with is that we will not go out and belie our farmers before the world and make out the case that, although they have got extra machinery, although they had extra facilities provided for them, they have miserably failed.  I was responsible for agriculture during those two years and I want to go on record as saying that I think they triumphantly succeeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to it.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs intervened <Col N="2207" /> in this debate to say that one of the economic matters which he felt should be examined very closely was the cattle population.  He was quite right.  The live-stock population of this country is the sheet anchor of our economic life.  I want to direct the attention of the House to the most revolutionary development in the live-stock industry that has been recorded in the last century, which represents to our people an additional income of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000 sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies will look at the statistics of live stock as on June 1st for the last 20 years, that is, from 1931 down to to-day they will find that there is one category of cattle recorded, cattle under one year old, and the next category is cattle one year old but under two.  If Deputies will compare the number of cattle over one year old and under two in any given year, say 1950, with the cattle under one year for the previous year, which would be 1949, they will get a rough guide&mdash;and I emphasise the words &ldquo;rough guide&rdquo;&mdash;to the calf yearling mortality experienced because, while we send calves and yearling cattle to and fro between one farm and another in Ireland, virtually no cattle in that age group are exported.  They may be slaughtered for consumption or they may die.  I believe that the bulk of them die from various diseases.  That view is not held by others, who believe that slaughter for consumption contributes substantially, but whatever the cause there is an annual disappearance in that age group.  Going over the last 20 years you will find that the annual average was 83,000.  You know, a Chinn Chomhairle, what that has been reduced to in the last recorded year? Nine thousand.  Should that record be maintained, and I have good reason to believe it will, we save approximately 70,000 cattle per annum, which we may reasonably anticipate will be related to three year olds, at which age they will be worth about £40 a piece, and that represents £2,800,000.  Knock off £800,000 to provide against the possibility of over-estimation.  You have an <Col N="2208" /> annual accretion to the income of the live-stock industry of this country of £2,000,000 annually as a result of the reduction in calf mortality, calves and cattle under one year of age, which is shown by the returns going back over 20 years.  That, if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants a vital statistic regarding the live-stock industry, is the most significant and most important fact that has emerged to my knowledge in the live-stock industry in this country in the past century.</P>
    <P>I know what is worrying or giving hope to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and that is the figure appearing on page 283 of the <i>Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> for December, 1951, relating to milch cows and heifers in-calf.  His soul rejoices that this shows a reduction of 29.6 per cent.  In heifers in-calf, but like all other statistics that requires examination because, when you take the figures for heifers in-calf and milch cows, the total reduction in numbers amounts to 2.5 per cent. and if you look at the total number of cattle you will discover the comforting fact that it has gone up by 1.3 per cent. and will continue to go up.  I can reassure the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, if he can restrain his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, and just persuade him to remain absolutely quiescent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that it is time he told the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he has no business addressing county committees of agriculture because his opinions on agriculture and on matters relating thereto are not worth the straw that he sticks in his hair to make himself incognito when he goes to such rendezvous.</P>

      <P>If anybody bothers to look at the trade returns they will see what our exports to hard currency countries are to-day as compared with the days that went before.  I take as hard currency countries the United States, Canada, Belgium and Switzerland. In 1945 our total exports to these countries amounted to £560,000; in 1946, £1,117,000; in 1947, £2,275,000; in 1948 £2,281,000.  In 1949 it was £1,918,000.  In 1950 it was £2,243,000. In 1951 it was £4,267,000.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with it but the Minister for Finance is not here and I am grappling with the Minister for Agriculture, who does not know B from a bull's foot about the Vote on Account.  I am asking what is the national debt.  He says it has increased vastly.  I asked him by how much&mdash;to put a figure on it.  He did not venture a reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He now has the assistance of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The fact is that the net national debt in 1947 was £47.4 million.  In 1948 it was £47.2 millon. In 1949 it was £48.4 millon and in 1950 it was £57.5 million.  To that must be added the capital liability in respect of housing loans, the charge for which is estimated to be in the order of £11.8 million.  I venture to swear that the Minister for Agriculture was led by the nose into the belief <Col N="2211" /> that the national debt had gone skyhigh. My figures are facts.  I told him where he could get that information.</P>
      <P>I do not know what use there is in my asking the Minister for Agriculture what has become of the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund.  He does not know.  I do not know if he knows what the Marshall Aid Grant Counterpart Fund is, never mind what has become of it&mdash;but I want to know what has become of it, and I want to know why the Minister for Finance thought fit to tell us that our availability of dollars from the sterling pool in the second part of this year would be no more than 16,000,000 dollars, without giving us any indication of what discussions led up to that agreement.  I asked him to tell us what has become of the thousands of millions of dollars that were in the sterling area pool, and of which we did not ask for a single one.  I think the House ought to know the facts.  In June, 1951, the dollar reserves of the sterling area pool were 3,770,000,000 dollars.  In February, 1952, that reserve had dwindled to 1,770,000,000 dollars.  Those reserves had declined by 299,000,000 dollars by January, 1952 and by a further 266,000,000 dollars by February, 1952. In the third quarter of 1951 the reserve declined by 598,000,000 dollars.  In the fourth quarter of 1951 the reserve declined by a further 934,000,000 dollars.  What has become of them? Who got them?  Are those nations who participated in the sterling area pool with us, and who got all the 2,000,000,000 dollars that have gone from the reserve in the last 12 months, acknowledged to have an identical claim with us on whatever dollars are now in the reserve while we are carrying on without Marshall Aid of any kind and they are still in receipt of substantial aid under the mutual security scheme?  We have not drawn a single dollar from the sterling pool during the past four years, while they, between them, have drawn 2,000,000,000. We are asking for dollars now in so far as we may require them, to convert funds due to us by Great Britain&mdash; every £ of them is due in respect of goods sold and delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2212" /> Our Minister for Finance does not think it necessary to deal with that in Dáil Éireann.  I invite him to do so and to tell us what account he has with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the disposition of those funds which are of vital interest to us. I am told that the deficit in the balance of payments amounts, according to the Government's estimate, to £66,000,000.  We have not seen it yet and we do not know how it is made up. So far, it is a confidential document that they will not show although it was prepared in the Central Statistics Office.  We are told that that spells impending ruin.  They allege that our sterling assets will be consumed in a year.  We have about £450,000,000 of sterling assets.  Their arithmetic is not very good and their profound respect, their deferential respect, for the rights and claims of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer compare strangely with their gracious acquiescence with the same Chancellor who seems to suggest that this country has no right at all but should be grateful for what it gets.  Great Britain had an overall surplus on balance of payments in 1950 of £238,000,000 and in 1951 Great Britain had an overall deficit on the balance of payments of £516,000,000.  Great Britain's deficit in the balance of payments with nonsterling countries rose from an annual rate of £325,000,000 in the first half of 1951, to an annual rate of £1,200,000,000 in the second half of 1951, and let us not forget that the backing of our currency is sterling.</P>
    <P>Will the Government still contend it was reckless folly to stockpile, that it was reckless folly to reclaim land, that it was reckless folly to build houses for our people?  Let them make the case if they dare.  I would sooner have 200,000 acres reclaimed than £2,000,000 sterling on deposit in the Bank of England.  Let us hear from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he gets under way, where his preference lies, because there are interesting views on record, which I have tabulated, by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs last November, on the proper uses to which money should be put, and on the essential <Col N="2213" /> desirability of taxing for capital investment. I wonder is he going to recapitulate these views to-day, or did his incognito travels through the Netherlands alter his outlook?  He was talking to four trade unionists in Belgium. These were the gentlemen who said: &ldquo;Monsieur, nous travaillons.&rdquo;  I wonder if he met them now could they say &ldquo;Nous travaillons.&rdquo;?  Two out of the four would have to tell him: &ldquo;Non, nous ne travaillons plus,&rdquo; for there is no work for them to-day.  Belgium is rich in gold and rich in foreign balances, but she has to use up her charitable funds to sustain a large part of her population for whom there is no work, no employment.  It is true that there is a higher standard of living in some of the fashionable seaside resorts of Belgium than in almost any other part of Europe, but the gold and uranium which provides them with the currency to buy motor cars, caviare or anything else exotic they want, has a queer defect which prevents it filtering down to the simple homes of Belgium, so that of the four optimists he met, the Minister will, if he cowers behind his whiskers in disguise and glory in the fact that they can tell the dirty Irish how to prosper if they would only learn to work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to dwell at reasonable length on the Minister's statement and I am entitled to compare the favourable action and policy of the unsophisticated yokels who administered the Irish Government with those of the wise and sophisticated optimists chosen by the four anonymous trade unionists in Belgium.  The yokels in Ireland may not have produced gold and foreign credits for the goldenhaired ladies of Ghent but they did produce something very like total employment for the people of Portarlington and if I have got to choose between everybody in this country being reasonably well off and nobody rich, and the Belgian example of certain sections of the country having an <i>embarras de richesses</i> with a large section of the community living on the dole, I am all for the unsophisticated Irish approach.  I would recommend the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to take off his whiskers and eye badge and come here to study economics in Ireland where he will find a very much better school of sociology is maintained, and sociology should play some part in the economic studies of a prudent student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund?  I gather from the carryings on of these silly billies who constitute the Ministers of this Government that they missed the bus. They should have had their papers in before the 8th January but they forgot about them.  Then they went around begging and imploring the E.C.A. to let them put them in and they would not be let.  The Mutual Security Act was passed, and they then found themselves out in the cold.  Now the American Ambassador is, I believe, striving might and main to salvage for them the Counterpart Fund.  He is a good friend of Ireland.  He is a great and influential public servant of the <Col N="2215" /> United States.  I can only hope that, with his great prestige and the high office he holds, he will prove sufficient to salvage for our people the millions of money that our own poor silly billies very nearly lost.  If goodwill can bring that about, I have no doubt he will succeed and, should he fail, I have no doubt it will not be for want of trying.</P>
    <P>How often has it been repeated for the edification of their blockhead colleagues that Marshall Aid was spent on maize, wheat and commodities of that kind?  What the heck else could you spend it on?  Let the truth now be told, for it is time to tell the truth. Do Deputies of this House know what our principal problem was in the years of Marshall Aid?  To get the dollars spent.  You got your allocation of dollars at the beginning of the Marshall Aid year, and, if these were not spent at the end of the year, they were no longer available to you, and, what is more, your allocation for the following year would be cut.  Our problem was to get them spent.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs shakes his sophisticated head.  That was the problem.  There was not a single application for dollars, in respect of any project remotely related to development here originating from any source in Ireland which was not granted.  I defy the whole of the Fianna Fáil Party to produce one single citizen of Ireland who, during the three years of Marshall Aid, had in mind any project of a capital character, designed to develop our resources here in Ireland, and who applied for dollars and did not get them.  But the plain truth is that, at the end of the year, the urgent problem not infrequently was to get your dollars spent inside the financial year laid down by the Marshall Aid plan.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are poor Fianna Fáil Deputies who will regard that statement with amazement and say that it cannot be true.  That is true, but the poor unfortunate dupes on the Fianna Fáil Benches have been sent around the country to wring their hands about the awful outlay of American dollars, and was it not terrible.  Perhaps <Col N="2216" /> it would be expedient in certain circumstances not to dwell on this matter, but frankly I am of the opinion that our people have a right to know the truth and I am telling the truth.  The problem of the Irish Government not infrequently was to get the dollars spent.  The alternative was to forgo them.</P>
    <P>Now a lot of Deputies in this House, because, God help them, they are innocent, think that when we borrowed dollars under the Marshall Aid plan the Irish public fell into debt.  That is a good enough yarn with which to fool Fianna Fáil Deputies, but it is pure cod.  Nobody would tell it to any but Fianna Fáil Deputies and expect them to believe it.  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies not know what happened?  The Marshall Aid scheme, so far as it applied to Ireland, was purely an exchange transaction.  I say this&mdash;maybe it is not discreet to say it, but it is time I think to say it&mdash;that we told the American authorities, in regard to Marshall Aid, that there was not the slightest prospect of our paying it back in dollars, but that we would have sterling pound for pound on the due date, and that that was a matter for them and for Great Britain to arrange in regard to sterling and dollars.  That meant they were going to have to restore the convertibility of sterling. They made no comment on that except to say that was their headache, and that if they were prepared to go on with that headache why could not we. We replied that we would.  At this moment, there is a pound in the Central Bank for every pound that we borrowed from the United States.</P>
    <P>When we got a loan of say 10,000,000 dollars, what do Deputies think happened? What happened was that a flour miller bought through Grain Importers a cargo of wheat.  The cargo of wheat cost him £40,000, but he had to pay for it in dollars, and he had no dollars.  He came to the Department of Finance and said: &ldquo;Give me £40,000 in Marshall Aid dollars to pay for my wheat.&rdquo;  The Government applied to Marshall Aid, got the £40,000 in dollars and lent it to the miller.  The miller lodged his order through Grain Importers in Baltimore for the cargo <Col N="2217" /> of wheat.  The cargo was shipped from Baltimore to the miller.  The miller paid the grain growers in America in dollars.  When he brought in that cargo of grain he milled it into flour and he sold the flour.  He then went back to the Irish Government and said: &ldquo;There is the £40,000 that you lent me in dollars when buying the grain.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance took the £40,000 and lodged it in the Central Bank in the Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart Fund.  So that for every dollar we borrowed from the United States we put £1 in the Central Bank.  At this moment, for every single dollar that is owing to the United States by the Government of Ireland, there is £1 sitting in the bank on which the present Minister for Finance can draw a cheque and pay the first instalment when it falls due.  There is the amount in sterling and I assert there was never any disguise of that fact.</P>
    <P>If anybody wanted to stand on the letter of the agreement that the repayment was to be made in dollars, the attitude of the Government was: &ldquo;We are in no position to give any such firm undertaking,&rdquo; and the reply of the American Government was: &ldquo;Look here, is not that our headache and if we are prepared to go to bed with that headache why the hell can you not do the same?&rdquo;  I venture to swear there is not a single Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches who is not to-day feeling bewildered on discovering that we do not owe America £18,000,000 with nothing to pay it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You have your own Party and it is not my business to pry into your interior &ldquo;carryings on&rdquo;.  That poor crowd over there has a Party but they are never told anything.  In fact, they are told nothing until I tell them and it is very often difficult to make them understand even what I do tell them.  They all go off with a different story.  However, I hope they understand this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to what the United States Government lent us, they made us one grant of £2,000,000 sterling <Col N="2218" /> in dollars and the second year they went through the motions of making us a grant of £1,300,000 in dollars.  It was not a grant at all.  It was a refund of excess freight that the United States Mercantile Marine succeeded in levying on shipments to this country purchased with United States dollars by getting an amendment to the Marshall Aid Act requiring us to carry 50 per cent. of all we bought with American aid in American bottoms and then jacking up the price of freight and robbing our people.  The Administration could not stop that because the maritime Lobby was too strong but, for shame sake&mdash; and decent Americans were ashamed of that transaction&mdash;they availed of the procedure of giving us a grant in the third year of Marshall Aid of £1,200,000, which approximately recouped what the United States Mercantile Marine had robbed from our people through constraining them to carry in American bottoms purchases made, not with gift money but with borrowed money on which we were paying interest.  That is what we did with American money.</P>
    <P>We were reviled.  We were blamed. We were threatened.  Why is it that our Minister for Finance, the Iron Chancellor, can go over now and tell the British Chancellor of the Exchequer that he openly undertakes to limit our purchases to 16,000,000 dollars in the second half of the year? We had in stock 34.3 million lb. of tobacco and that represents a two and a half years' supply of that commodity. The Government need not buy £1 worth of tobacco for the next two years and still collect all the annual revenue without which the Exchequer could not carry on because their predecessors bought with Marshall Aid dollars all the tobacco they could get and put it in store for their successors in order that that source of revenue would not be closed for want of money to buy tobacco.</P>
    <P>Do not forget what tobacco represents to the Government as a means of revenue.  No Government in Europe could carry on without it.  You cannot collect revenue on tobacco if you have not got the tobacco on which to collect it.  We left a two and a half years' <Col N="2219" /> supply and our successors can now economise on purchases abroad chewing on the stocks that we assembled for them.  We also spent it on the supplies which the Minister for Finance recently said had converted the Forestry Department into something like a hardware shop.  Ask any forester in the world what he requires to develop forestry and he will tell you &ldquo;wire.&rdquo;  Everything else is easy to come by but there is one thing without which nobody can develop forest lands, and that is wire.  The Minister for Finance complains that he has too much of it.  We spent dollars on it.</P>
    <P>We spent dollars on maize.  I spent 5,000,000 dollars on wheat in one afternoon. It is a long list but I will give it all and if Deputies opposite do not like listening to it they can lump it. I bought 300,000 cwt. of soft Pacific wheat with Marshall Aid dollars for 1.80 dollars when maize was costing 2.50 dollars.  I was in a position to make them deliver it under the international wheat agreement and it is the presence of that abundance here to-day which guaranteed in the bad winter of 1950 enough feed for our cattle, for I anticipated the arrival of this soft wheat; secondly, it puts our Government to-day in the position that they need not buy any dollar wheat at all because when I left office there was more wheat afloat and in store here than there had ever been before.  I had bought all the soft wheat this country required from Australia plus what we have to buy every year from Canada on sterling contract, for the following year.</P>
    <P>Would we have been right to reject 300,000 tons of soft Pacific wheat, which was available at 1.80 dollars and surrender the dollars requested to pay for it back to Marshall Aid?  Were we right to buy it for our people and let them convert it into meat and milk and pigs for their own profit on their own holdings?  If it is right to bring cotton from Carolina and convert it into dear fabric in Athlone for which the Irish people have to pay, why is it wrong to bring maize from Kansas so that the farmer in Mayo may process it on his holding and sell it in competition <Col N="2220" /> with the world as pigs of bacon to his neighbours or abroad?</P>
    <P>I never could see any crime in it and so long as our people were able to use maize profitably and economically as a raw material of our agricultural industry, I would bring it from the Yang Tse Kiang.  I do not see why our farmers should be made hewers of wood and drawers of water to be perennially the servants in the lowpaid service of the tariff racketeers of this country.  So long as I was Minister for Agriculture they were never that.  So long as I am in Dáil Éireann nobody will make them the hewers of wood and drawers of water for tariff racketeers and get away with it in silence.</P>
    <P>Where do you think the bulldozers, the cranes, the shovels, the machinery that drained the Brosna, that drained the Corrib, that helped to drain 200,000 acres of arable land came from? Do you think we bought them in Ballina?  Possibly Deputies on the far side of the House imagine that they should have been manufactured in the bus depot, the beloved bus depot, where you are going to have everything but buses.  If we were to get this type of machines at all they had to be bought for dollars and paid for in dollars.  Were we wrong to buy them?</P>

      <P>Where do you think we got the oil and the petrol to operate the transport of this country and on which the revenue of this country is founded?  We paid for it in dollars. When we came into office there was not one-fifth of the oil storage of this country occupied and when we left office four-fifths of the oil storage was full. Were we wrong to do that?  If we did not do it, we would have surrendered the dollars in the year in which we failed to spend them and our allocation in the subsequent year would have been cut down on the ground that we did not spend what were allocated to us the year before and we would have been told that if our requirements did not impose on us the necessity to spend <Col N="2221" /> those borrowed dollars the United States Treasury had no intention of making any grant.  We got the grant and Fianna Fáil lost it.  Maybe we will get it back again.  If we do not, it will not be for the want of trying.</P>
      <P>What makes me sick is realising that Deputy McGilligan's successor can go over with sanctimonious piety to render an account of his stewardship to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and to assure him that he will certify in writing his firm resolve to restrain dollar purchases within a certain figure and that he is enabled to do that by the prescience and energy of the Government that went before him and that his sole reaction to that fact is an effort to denigrate and belittle those who put him in the position where he ought to show independence when defending the interests of this country where, most unhappily, he does not appear to do so.</P>
      <P>I want to say this, Sir&mdash;at this moment Ireland is one of the most prosperous countries in Europe.  I want to say this&mdash;that at this moment the wealth potential of Ireland is greater than that of any other agricultural community in the world.  I want to remind Dáil Éireann that the inter-Party Government took the precaution of summoning the editors of the four leading newspapers in this country, including the kept paper of the Fianna Fáil Party, and telling them, in October, 1950, that it was the Government's intention to throw the balance of payments in 1951 emphatically out of balance and I challenge the kept newspaper to deny that, and it would if it could.</P>
      <P>I want to warn Dáil Éireann that we did that of set purpose and that, as a result of our prescience and prudence in doing that, the present Government have stocks at their disposal which insure them against the possibility of crisis.  But, they have something more. They have stocks at their disposal which materially relieve their necessity for foreign currency in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember it is money value that counts when you are talking about balance of payments.  I want to remind <Col N="2222" /> Dáil Éireann that the money value of our exports, including re-exports, in 1951 was £81,000,000.  That is the highest figure ever recorded since statistics were first kept.  I want to remind Dáil Éireann that in January, 1952, the money value of our exports and re-exports exceeded those of January, 1951, by 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Dáil Éireann that there is nothing on God's earth to prevent our people enjoying for generations they have ever known or that their fathers and grandfathers have ever known unless our own Government sabotages and destroys the work their predecessors did.</P>
    <P>I remember the day I left office I spoke in this House and in concluding I said to Fianna Fáil Deputies this much:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beseech of those who come after us, what you cannot complete at least do not destroy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do not let envy or jealousy mislead you into the loathsome treason of injuring our own people for the purposes of denigrating your political opponent.  Watch the men who constitute the Government to-day in the disedifying scramble that proceeds between them for the preferment they await on the retirement of the present Taoiseach.  The interests of our people and our country are being forgotten and these men are thinking more of whether it will be Lemass's group or Aiken's group which will prevail when the new leader is to be chosen.  I wish they could conduct their quarrel and vie with one another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The British Budget secrets are bursting out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For that profound intervention from Deputy Killilea, our representative at Strasbourg, I am profoundly grateful.  Deputy Killilea does not advert to the fact that the British Budget was open ten days ago and its contents are secret only to <Col N="2224" /> those who are deal and illiterate, neither of which disadvantages afflicts Deputy Killilea.  I can only attribute his ignorance in this matter to a reluctance to undertake the public duty of studying British Budget proposals.  I want to warn Deputy Killilea that I think that the members of his Party will be taken into a room one of these days and will be told by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance that this is what Chancellor Butler did and &ldquo;therefore I have got to do the same thing.&rdquo; Deputy Killilea has put it in a nutshell that the British Budget will become the secrets of our Irish Budget.  May I impress upon Deputy Killilea, when that proposal is made to him, to rally the stalwarts of the Fianna Fáil Party and say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Forget Butler for a while and think of Ireland.  Forget the intoxicating experience of prancing down Whitehall and come back to the pedestrian atmosphere of Upper Merrion Street.&rdquo; If I could get an assurance from Deputy Killilea that he would deflate the distended but empty head of his Minister for Finance my worries would be over.  Deputy Killilea has put it in a nutshell.  The danger that confronts this country is that the facts of the fraudulent British Budget should be the secret of the pending Irish Budget. If Deputy Killilea will bind himself to deliver us from that peril I will labour to have him named a Casabianca for the front cover of <i>Time.</i></P>
      <P>Three weeks ago, the Iron Chancellor, who went to London, denounced a newspaper for daring to suggest that he had the intention of cutting down the allowance given to travellers going abroad from £50 to £25.  He said there was not a shadow of truth in it.  He went to Whitehall and he came trotting in here as mild as could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought I heard Deputy Killilea grumbling with approbation when the Minister announced that he was going to cut the allowance to £25 and he had said three weeks before that it was a malicious and wicked thing to say. Deputy Killilea has had his say and if the only effect of all my assertions to-day was to make Deputy Killilea bind himself to undertake that, should his Minister for Finance become too <Col N="2225" /> Butlerish, forget he is in the service of the Irish people whose interests he is charged to defend, he will bring him back on to the straight and narrow path and walk beside him along the paths of economic rectitude, my time will not have been misspent.  I pray that the courage which flames in Deputy Killilea now and the fire which flashes from his eye will not flag or dwindle between now and the time that the Party is assembled to hear what the Minister has to tell on the Budget he is about to introduce.</P>

By the statistics I have quoted in this House I have demonstrated that, the Fianna Fáil Government notwithstanding, the fact is that this country is prosperous, that it is economically strong and that it has resources and the courage to use those resources for the benefit of our people. Nothing can stop her but the Fianna Fáil Party.  Great as are the many wrongs that have been done this country by the Fianna Fáil Party, I hate to think that they would crown their loathsome activities over the past 20 years by this final felon's blow at their own country outlined and envisaged by the language of their Minister for Finance and by the publications for which he has been responsible before the peoples of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Dillon speak during the last hour about the prosperity of this country and of what a happy people we should be. I should like to draw attention to the growing unemployment we are experiencing at present in Dublin City.  I believe that the country could be as prosperous as we are told it should be were it not for the depressing speeches which are occasionally made in this House describing to the people how bad things are and urging them not to spend.  It is obvious that when people do not spend they do not purchase the products of our Irish firms, and that, in turn, results in unemployment.  That unemployment is growing and day by day men are being dismissed from their jobs.  What is the Government going to do about that position?  Down in the dock area you will now meet hundreds of men seeking work.  Two years ago we sent to Britain for our building operatives, guaranteeing them ten to 20 years' employment on the building of houses for their own people.  These men are now to be seen in Palace Street seeking passports to enable them to go back to the place they left some years ago.  Will somebody tell us where the hidden hand is that is keeping back the prosperity of this country?  Will somebody tell us where the hidden hand is that is keeping back the finances for housing?  We are told that the Government guarantees the money for housing&mdash;and we got that guarantee from the previous Government. In spite of that guarantee, the position now is that our building operatives are emigrating and those people who are seeking houses are being left in the unhappy surroundings in which they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the intention of the Government to encourage employment and industry in this country?  Myself and another Deputy were stopped outside the gate of the Dáil last week by a man carrying a banner on which it was indicated that he was a married man with a family trying to exist on a dole of 26/- a week.  Surely that is not the prosperity that we promised these people nor is that the prosperity that we all had hoped to see.  We all know, too, that the staffs <Col N="2230" /> of various business houses and distributing centres in Dublin, instead of being increased, are being reduced at every available opportunity.  In the past month especially it has become a regular feature outside the doors of Dublin Deputies to see queues of people looking for jobs.  Many of these men are now seeking passports to get out of the country.  If one goes down to the boats at the North Wall or visits Dún Laoghaire Harbour, one will see them going away, I shall not say in hundreds because I do not want to exaggerate, but in dozens every evening of the week.  I remember hearing some Ministers of the present Government saying some years ago that it would be necessary for us to bring our own people back from England there would be so much employment available here at home.  We may as well face the fact that they are not being brought back now and that unemployment is growing.  There is no employment open to young people leaving school and one is frequently asked for a letter of recommendation to enable these young people to get work in some part of Great Britain.  I would ask that the various Parties in this House should get together to devise ways and means of providing employment for these young people in their own country.</P>
    <P>It was not my intention to speak here this evening but when I found a slack moment with nobody else apparently anxious to get up after Deputy Dillon had concluded, I thought I might avail of the opportunity to tell the House of my experiences, an opportunity which otherwise I might not have had until the tail-end of the debate.  I ask the Government what they propose to do to deal with the growing unemployment and I would appeal to the Taoiseach to prevent his Ministers making these dull, depressing speeches which are so frightening to our people.  People who would not hesitate to spend a few pounds in the shops, are afraid of doing so because of these depressing speeches.  The absence of purchasers in the shops means that workers in industries are being displaced.  I might remark that quite recently there were a number of people over here from England offering <Col N="2231" /> to assist passages to Canada and Australia.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out this should be one of the most prosperous countries in the world having regard to the fertility of our land and our various other resources and our workers should be fully employed to obtain an increased output both in agriculture and in industry.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what, for instance, is going to happen the shipbuilding industry in this country?  I understand that although we require ships at the moment skilled men are being knocked off down at the dockyard every day.  I visit the North Wall, the Alexandra Basin and the vicinity of the dockyard at least three times a week and I find an air of depression existing there that never existed before.  I am frequently stopped by dockyard workers who inform me that sufficient work could be provided for them were it not that there appears to be a shortage of materials.  Why cannot the Minister ensure that materials are made available for these industries which could pay such good wages?  I am stopped almost 20 times a day by young fellows who ask me if I could recommend them for a job and, as I say, I see men standing around at the dockyard who formerly were in constant employment.  I mention these things because I know them of my own personal experience and they are typical of what is going on in Dublin at present.</P>
    <P>Something has apparently happened within the last three months to worsen the unemployment position and I believe it is due to the depressing speeches made by Ministers.  In the building trade, for instance, we cannot find out exactly what is the cause of the hold-up.  The Dublin Corporation say they were guaranteed money to finance their schemes.  We need the houses, we have the plans ready but workers are being dismissed and are seeking passports to get back to Britain.  Not alone are young single people going away, but married men with families are now leaving the country as well.  That means that these men have to support two homes.  An unfortunate married man has to pay <Col N="2232" /> for his board and lodging in England and what he is able to send home afterwards is not sufficient to maintain his family here.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try to do something to stop this emigration of the best workers of the country.  As I have already mentioned, we saw a man last week standing outside the Dáil carrying a placard announcing the fact that he had a wife and two children, that he had to pay a pretty high rent for his cottage in Dublin and that he could not get a day's work.  That, I think, is indicative of the deplorable situation which exists in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the majority of the people realise that a great deal of the unemployment is not due to that world depression but is due to stockpiling by the previous Government.  It is also due to their destruction of industries which were initiated by Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Byrne is a Dublin man and must know that, after Fianna Fáil had imported machinery for the chassis shop for Córas Iompair Éireann, it was sold as scrap by the last Government. That was done because it was a Fianna Fáil project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>By some gentleman not far from Dublin.  I believe he comes from Monasterevan, so the Deputy should know more about him than I do. If that machinery had been retained for the purpose for which it was purchased it would have provided much <Col N="2233" /> needed employment and would have meant the starting of a heavy engineering industry here.  That industry would have been able to provide chassis for Córas Iompair Éireann, the Electricity Supply Board and the sugar company. The last Government, however, preferred to bring in those chassis and let Irishmen go over to England to make them.  We had no protest against that from the Labour Benches, the Fine Gael Benches or any of the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne spoke about the slowing up of housing in Dublin.  Deputy Briscoe made the position in regard to that clear in one of the papers last Sunday.  The previous Government were warned that if they were going to assist town planning there could not be more than 1,000 houses built in Dublin this year. I understand that the number of houses in Dublin will be increased in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>So do I.  A lot of Deputies on the other side of the House, rather than face the facts as regards the world depression, adopt the attitude of the boy passing a graveyard at night who starts to whistle so as to pretend that he is not afraid of ghosts.  They are carrying on the same sham idea now, that they are not afraid of any depression and that the country was never so prosperous.  The fact is that they left the country in the position in which we have to pay seven and one-third million pounds by way of interest on loans.  That charge increased more in their three years than it did during the 15 years that Fianna Fáil were in power.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Dillon talking last week about the spending of dollars and the bringing in of Cuban sugar.  Most Deputies will remember that Deputy Dillon said in the year 1947 that if we bombed and blew up all the sugar factories we would save so much money as to be able to increase the children's allowance to 5/- for every child in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Lemass said they were white elephants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Now he talks about buying Cuban sugar.  He also said that when the war was over sugar <Col N="2235" /> would be landed on the quays of Dublin at 2d. per lb.  I think it is a good job that the people of this country do not always take his advice.</P>
      <P>The people who talk about unemployment occurring during the time of the Fianna Fáil Government must have very short memories if they are not able to recall what Fianna Fáil did for industry in this country.  Deputy Hickey need only go down the quays of Cork to see the mills and the silos that are there now.  Before Fianna Fáil came into power the previous Government were satisfied to have all our flour manufactured in Liverpool and Birkenhead. It was Fianna Fáil that started the flour-milling industry and insisted that all the flour we use would be manufactured in this country.  That has gone on ever since, with the exception of the present of flour that was given during the period of the last Government by the American Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have Ranks in Limerick now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better to have Irishmen working there for Rank than to have them going over to work for Rank in England.  During the time of the Fianna Fáil Government, Dunlops started their tyre factory, the Sunbeam Wolsey factory was started and the cement factories were started.  If I were to recite all the big industries which were started here by Fianna Fáil it would take me at least half an hour to do so.  In view of that, how could anybody make any accusation against Fianna Fáil about unemployment? If there has been unemployment it was due to the fact that the country was flooded with goods which were imported during the term of office of the last Government.  Deputy Byrne wants to know what the Government are going to do to stop unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Tánaiste has shown the way to do that by the action he took in the case of the textile industry when he cut the quotas for imported goods. He brought them down to a practically negligible quantity.  I think that the same rule will apply to most industries. That has always been the policy of <Col N="2236" /> Fianna Fáil, that it is better to keep men working in Ireland than to be sending them to England to make goods there and then import the goods here.</P>
    <P>Everybody remembers what the position of this country was at Christmas 12 months ago when we had not a sod of turf or a lump of coal in Cork City or in Dublin, Limerick and other places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a positive fact. There were pictures in the papers showing what happened in Limerick and other places when a cargo of coal arrived.  I am sure Deputy Hickey will not deny that there were queues of children waiting with go-cars outside the retail stores in Cork trying to get coal.  I defy him to deny that the retail stores had to close down because they had no coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe profits should be fixed by means of a maximum price only.  In most businesses now there is a minimum price fixed as well and if a trader sells below that minimum he is immediately struck off the traders' list.  That is helping to keep prices up and it is a matter to which immediate attention should be given.  If a shopkeeper is prepared to a take a lower price and make a smaller profit no combine should have the power to punish him for selling at competitive prices. Some may call it undercutting but I know of no more effective way of bringing down prices other than to have a bit of competition between shopkeepers. I know of several commodities where the shopkeepers, if they sell under the price fixed by the manufacturer and the wholesaler, will no longer be served with supplies.  That is a shocking state of affairs and the Government should give it immediate attention.</P>

The Minister for Finance on that occasion made it quite clear that he was accepting the policy enshrined in that report while the Minister for Industry and Commerce endeavoured to persuade the House and, through the House, the people that he and the Government stood for its rejection. Now we are confronted with Estimates and a Vote on Account supported by a speech made by the Minister for Finance in which it is quite clear, to me at any rate, that the Minister for Finance, supported by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has won this <Col N="2240" /> sham battle.  Sham battle is all it is or all I can see in it.  If, however, the speech made by the Minister for Finance on that historic occasion and, more particularly, the speech that he made here when introducing this Vote on Account, indicates the considered policy of this separatist Republican Government, then it is fatal to the future of this country.  It is financial suicide to follow British financial policy when the circumstances and conditions in the two countries are so different.</P>
      <P>We are a creditor country, high up on the list of creditor countries. Britain, on the admission of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, is facing bankruptcy.  A considerable portion of our surplus profits is in Great Britain by way of external assets, invested in a bankrupt country.  We are asked by the Minister for Finance, supported again by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as he will be on this occasion, to continue to invest in Great Britain the profits of our agricultural and industrial production, the profits of the daily labour of our people, and to increase our investments and external assets in Great Britain rather than use them for national development purposes to provide employment for our people in our own country.</P>
      <P>That is a clear-cut issue.  It is a fundamental issue.  As far as this group is concerned, there is a wide gulf between that policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and the policy of the members of this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government has been condemned in unmeasured language for repatriating or proposing to repatriate, not all our external assets, but a portion of our external assets for the purpose of carrying out works of a capital development nature, thereby providing increased employment. The short history of the inter-Party Government proves that that policy was to the advantage of the plain people of this country.  Now we are asked to reverse that policy.  We are asked to subscribe to a policy of restriction of credit and to follow Great Britain, with whom there can <Col N="2241" /> be no reasonable comparison, in pursuance of that policy.</P>
    <P>Why is Britain carrying out a policy of credit restriction?  It is in order to make it possible for people to be changed over from industrial employment to the manufacture of arms and armaments, atomic bombs and so on. Surely we are not expected to pursue that line of policy, if neutrality is the policy of this country to-day and if neutrality is to be its policy for the future.</P>
    <P>By continuing to invest our surplus assets, the profits of our agricultural and industrial production, in Great Britain at 1 per cent. and less than 1 per cent., at a nominal rate of interest, we are allowing the profits of production in this country to be used by the British for the purpose of carrying out a rearmament policy.  Apart from other considerations, is that in keeping with the policy of strict neutrality?</P>
    <P>I want to know whether the policy outlined by the Minister for Finance in introducing this Vote on Account will help to increase agricultural production. All of us in this House, whether associated with groups or so-called individual Deputies, subscribe to the policy of increasing agricultural production in the interests of all sections of the people.  Will we help to increase agricultural production by increasing the rate of interest on agricultural loans at a time when everybody is pleading for an increase in agricultural production?  An increase in the rate of interest on agricultural loans will increase the cost of agricultural production. I cannot understand why Deputies like Deputy Cogan, who talks about interest-free money when he speaks in the Carlow County Council, can come in here and support a speech made by the Minister for Finance which amounts to a confirmation of the attitude of the Minister in increasing the cost of agricultural loans simply because Mr. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, increased the rates of interest in Britain for entirely different reasons.  Is it not a glaring example?  Is it not clear evidence that he is following the financial policy of <Col N="2242" /> the British Chancellor in the most patent and loyal manner?</P>
    <P>By increasing the rate on agricultural loans, instead of reducing the rate of interest, as has been demanded very often in this House, we will not help to increase agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Will we increase agricultural production by suspending the activities in connection with the acquisition and division of land?  When the inter-Party Government was in office, several decisions were taken affecting the acquisition and division of large estates in my constituency.  I can quote them if challenged.  The Fianna Fáil Government, immediately they came into office, as far as I know, deferred some of the decisions and reversed the decisions in other cases.  Does not every Deputy who represents an area where there is still land available know that if that land is acquired and divided and allotted to industrious people who have been working the land on conacre, and who will work the land to the best possible advantage, agricultural production will be increased?</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister for Agriculture know the extent to which the Land Commission is responsible for reversing decisions of the previous Government and deferring others in connection with the acquisition and division of land?  I challenge the next Deputy on the Government side who speaks in this debate to say whether the rules that were to be made under the 1950 Land Act have yet been issued or are in operation.  I accuse the present Minister for Lands and his colleagues in the Government of deliberately holding up the issue of these rules so that they can hold up the operation of the 1950 Land Act, against which the Fianna Fáil Party voted when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>Can we increase agricultural production by slowing down the land reclamation scheme?  The Minister for Agriculture will not deny that that is being done with his connivance and goodwill?</P>

The figures have improved in Carlow and Kilkenny but that is not the case in other constituencies in the Midlands. The Minister for Agriculture is, no doubt, using the big stick that he now has in his hands as Minister to see that the land reclamation scheme is speeded up as far as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net amount required is a sum of £10.  There is excess expenditure on a number of sub-heads, for instance, F (1)  and F (2), K (3), M (5), M (14), O (4) and Q.  There is also a deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid.  We are able to make up that deficiency by a saving under sub-head (11).  If the Deputies opposite think I should <Col N="2244" /> give details on the various sub-heads, I am prepared to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On sub-head F (1)&mdash;Agricultural Schools and Farms&mdash;there is a deficiency of £26,000, due to the additional provision for general expenses and management of the Department's farms.  It includes £13,000 for reserve stocks which were provided for in the Supplementary Estimate for 1950-51 but which were not procured in time to enable payment of the suppliers' accounts to be made before the 31st March, 1951.  A sum of £7,000 is being provided for the purchase of heifers in connection with the scheme for the elimination of uneconomic cows.  The remaining £6,000 is in respect of additional expenditure arising from increases in the prices of seeds, manures, feeding stuffs, implements and tools, and other farm requisites.</P>
      <P>The provision under sub-head F (2) for grants to private agricultural schools, etc., is £11,995.  This provision comprises capital grants of £8,000 and £3,395 respectively to Gurteen Agricultural College, Ballingarry, County Tipperary and Ardagh Rural Domestic Economy School, County Longford.  In the case of Gurteen Agricultural College, a capital grant of £9,000 was made in March, 1949, on the assumption that the total capital expenditure incurred would be approximately £22,100. An audited statement of the capital expenditure incurred up to the 15th March, 1951, showed, however, that the total of such expenditure was £36,000. In these circumstances, an additional grant of £8,600 was authorised by the Department of Finance, and a further contribution towards expenditure incurred in the repair, renovation and reconstruction of the college and the development of the lands and buildings attached thereto.  There is also a grant of £3,395 to Ardagh Rural Domestic Economy School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision under sub-head K (3) for a grant in respect of the development of the manufacture of milk powder is £14,678; the provision under sub-head M (1)  for miscellaneous work is £4,000; under sub-head M (5)  there <Col N="2245" /> is a provision of £5 for loans for the purchase of cattle and sheep, agricultural implements and milking machines; under sub-head M (14) £200,000 is being provided for the ground limestone subsidy; under sub-head O (4)&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Acts&mdash;£7,000 is being provided. This additional provision is necessary, due to the expansion during the past year in the export trade in carcase meat.  It was also necessary to recruit additional supervisors and inspectors.</P>
    <P>There is also an Appropriations-in-Aid deficiency of £257,700 which is really a biggish item in the Supplementary Estimate.  Details of the estimated deficiency in receipts are as follows: Receipts from sale of seeds, manure, live stock, etc., £3,000; receipts in respect of seeds supplied to smallholders at reduced prices, £2,000; receipts from sale of vaccines for treatment of cattle against contagious abortion, £9,500; receipts from artificial insemination fees, £2,500; Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, receipts from fees, etc., £4,000; Dairy Produce Acts, etc.: fees on production of butter and fees in respect of butter imported, etc., £1,000; receipts from fees for inspection of potatoes, etc., £1,000; receipts in respect of butter wrappers and permits, £247,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the accounts for the year 1951/52 were not submitted before the Estimates were submitted and were, therefore, not paid.  The accounts came up for payment in 1952 and are now being presented to the 31st March, 1952.  Before March, 1951 some of the payments had not been made because the butter had not been even sold at the time and the loss could not be estimated.  Since then <Col N="2246" /> the loss has been estimated and the account paid, with the result that the payments must be made now before the 31st March&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you any explanation you need.  I told you that the importation of butter was one. During the period September to November, 1950 the Butter Marketing Committee exported 45,600 cwt. of butter.  On that transaction they made £296,000.  Later on in the year, they found it necessary to import butter from New Zealand and Denmark.  The amount imported was 90,017 cwt. The total loss on that transaction was £465,184.  The net effect of such transaction was that the Butter Marketing Committee incurred a trading loss of £269,200 which must be made good to the committee during the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the Butter Marketing Committee has a separate account which is not a Public Exchequer Account and that <Col N="2247" /> this is by way of recoupment to the Butter Marketing Committee Account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They have to have an account if they purchase butter.  It is the Department's money they use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All the money which is brought to account for the Department and paid out for the Department is included in the Exchequer Account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In addition to that there is the sum of money lost on the wrappers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was estimated that a certain amount of money would come in through the sale of wrappers.  That money did not materialise because we did not sell off-the-ration butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this Estimate, it includes the sum of £4,000 on sub-head M (1), which sum of £4,000 includes advertising, publicity and food production propaganda. Therefore, that includes the propaganda which the Minister has, through his Department, been carrying out. One of the items of propaganda was a certain luncheon and meeting, or rather meeting&mdash;I do not want to stress the luncheon part of it&mdash;that took place on 16th January last.  As I read the Supplementary Estimate, since we are providing money for that, I think we are in order in referring to what took place there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting there was a discussion about the price that was going to <Col N="2248" /> be given for grain crops for the coming year and in respect of the tillage drive. The House will remember that either before or immediately after that meeting&mdash;I forget which&mdash;Deputy Costello made a speech in Cavan in which he made it perfectly clear that, so far as this side of the House is concerned, we were entirely in favour of the increased production drive.  The only difficulties that we had were the methods which the Minister and the Government were operating towards that drive.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position&mdash;the Minister was present, of course, I was not&mdash;at that meeting, according to the report, there were discussions on the price, first of all, of wheat.  It was indicated by representatives there at the meeting that they believed that if the Minister was to get the bigger acreage of wheat for which he and the Taoiseach were asking, they would only get that bigger acreage if they offered, by way of inducement to the farmers, a substantially better price.  I think that question has been stressed to the Minister so much that it is unnecessary for me to stress it further now, but it is a fact that, with the increase particularly in the price of fertilisers, the increase that there has been this year for the coming year in rates and in the other outgoings of the farmers, they are entitled to receive a better price for their wheat for the coming year than has already been fixed if they are to produce that area, that yield and that production for which the Government are asking.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of discussions on the price of wheat, there was also a discussion on the price of barley relative to the price of wheat.  It was mentioned by certain delegates that day when they were comparing the price per stone of wheat to the price per stone of barley&mdash;they made that comparison and they were allowed by the Taoiseach and the Minister to make that comparison on the price of barley, on the basis that barley for the coming year was going to be paid for at the rate of 84/- per barrel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the price of barley and wheat <Col N="2249" /> comes under this heading.  This has reference to advertising and publicity. If the Deputy wants to say the Minister was or was not doing his duty regarding the price of wheat and barley, I think he should raise that on the Estimate which carries the Minister's salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Deputy Cogan has the habit of interjecting sometimes which is somewhat annoying at the time but, when one goes home and thinks about it, it always leaves one with a sense of satisfaction that at least those on this side of the House, who know the real reason why the Deputy who is now on the other side <Col N="2251" /> of the House withdrew his support from the inter-Party Government, refrained from stating it.  That leaves one with a certain degree of satisfaction. If we did state the reason, the Deputy would not like it.</P>
      <P>This £4,000 seems to be badly spent propaganda money, because the essence of good propaganda is to sell your case, to leave the people to whom you are trying to make your case with a satisfied feeling.  The most important people in the country to be satisfied&mdash;I think the Minister will unquestionably admit this much&mdash;are the various county committees of agriculture throughout the whole country.  If the Minister is going to be successful in his propaganda, in his publicity and in his advertising for which, apparently, he is not looking for money, although it is included in this Estimate and although we read about it in advertisements, he must not merely put over his case but put it over in such a way that he will get the people who are reading that case and who understand that case to be satisfied that he is right and that what they are asked to do is correct.  They must be contented in their outlook.  The Minister is not going about this in the right way.  The Chair will not permit me to develop this matter of the price of grain to a greater length to which I feel I could develop it.</P>
      <P>I do suggest to the Minister that unless you are going to get people to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister himself then you are not likely to be successful in any propaganda that you may put over.  You will not get any acceptance unless the Government are entirely frank and make up their minds that in regard to the propaganda they are putting over they want to put it over as a genuine national effort and not merely as an endeavour to cloak up certain aspects of it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that a deputation from the Beet Growers' Association met the Minister on the 9th January in regard to the price of grain. I have a letter from the Beet Growers' Association.</P>

I cannot see how any intelligent body of people going to see the Minister for Agriculture could discuss the price of wheat relative to the price of malting barley without, at <Col N="2253" /> the same time, informing the Minister of the price for which the contract had been agreed the previous day.</P>

      <P>My recollection of what happened at the interview was that there was no discussion on the price of malting barley which, we understood, was outside the scope of the Minister. There was a discussion on the price of wheat and we related the price of wheat to the price of barley, having regard to the fact that there were 16 stones in a barrel of barley and 20 stones in a barrel of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was a member early in 1951 because he was one of the people appointed as a deputation from the Beet Growers' Association to go and see the then Government and get a price of £4 per barrel fixed.  When the deputation came along, it was found that the Minister was one of the party to come and see himself.  That was disclosed to the South Tipperary County Committee of Agriculture by a person who voluntarily told the county committee of agriculture that he was a member of the Minister's Party and a supporter of the Minister's Party.  However, Sir, I must confess that that interjection was hardly relevant to the main matter.</P>
      <P>I want to put this to the Minister. There was no person who was at that meeting who did not subsequently feel it was an extraordinary thing that they could that night hear on the wireless that a different price for barley would be paid for the coming season rather than the price which was in their minds and, I believe, in their minds at that meeting.  Certainly, the coincidence was most peculiar and it has left a very, very unpleasant taste in the mouths of the people who were there.</P>
      <P>They believe&mdash;I cannot understand how they could believe otherwise&mdash;that a person who fills the important position of Minister for Agriculture must have sufficient interest in the production of malting barley to know what is happening all the time from day to day.  If he is not in the position of being able to know what is happening in regard to malting barley from day to day, again I suggest that he is not in the position of being able to make good propaganda for the production drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied myself that the position never before occurred in the history of the Department of Agriculture, even for the period while Deputy Smith was Minister, that the Minister for Agriculture had no contact with <Col N="2255" /> Messrs.  Guinness between the months of August of one year and February of this year, which was what the Minister told me in reply to a recent question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that it should be the aim of any Minister for Agriculture to keep in proper contact in regard to a crop of sufficient importance if he is going to get his propaganda effort over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate includes, under sub-head M (1)  (4) £200,000 for ground limestone.  I suggested to the Minister that he might, at the outset, give some explanation of the items because I thought he would offer some explanation of that item in addition to the others.  Deputy Dillon will, no doubt, be able to explain the matter more fully to the House but, as I understand it, the position is that informal discussions took place between Mr. Millar, who was then head of the E.C.A. Administration in Ireland and <Col N="2256" /> the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, in regard to the ground limestone subsidy scheme.  Public utterances were made by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, and Mr. Millar that a ground limestone subsidy would be considered as an eligible item to be met out of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  Those public utterances were made prior to the change of Government.  If action had been taken on these public utterances and the matter brought to a final conclusion the effect would be that the taxpayers would not now be asked to pay the £200,000 involved in this case, because it would be met direct out of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  Those public utterances were made approximately 12 months ago. When the Minister came into office last June he must have been informed&mdash;if he was not already aware of it&mdash;of the legislation passed in the American Congress last May to the effect that all arrangements in regard to grant counterpart aid must be concluded before 8th January of this year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reason for this Supplementary Estimate which is now before the House is that the Minister did not conclude in a formal way the informal discussions that had already taken place and which were publicly confirmed by Mr. Millar prior to the change of Government.  If the Minister had concluded in a formal way these informal discussions before 8th January of this year then this Supplementary Estimate would not have been necessary because the amount in question would have been met out of the Grant Counterpart Fund or if we should have to have it by way of Supplementary Estimate we should also, at the same time, have had a similar Appropriation-in-Aid from the special grant account in the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture failed to bring to a formal conclusion before 8th January of this year the informal discussions that had taken place on this matter before the change of Government&mdash;and in that respect let me be clear that I am not <Col N="2257" /> quite sure whether it is the Minister alone who is to be blamed in that connection or the Government as a whole: I am not clear whether this is a ministerial act <i>per se</i> or a Government act <i>in toto.</i>  The effect of that failure has been that the taxpayer must now supply the amount required for this Supplementary Estimate.  Now, in order to get the use of the $18,000,000 that was there, or such part of it as is necessary to meet the ground limestone subsidy, a special Act must be passed by the United States Congress and without the passing of a special Act the money cannot be utilised for the ground limestone scheme.  These are matters on which those of us on this side of the House can get only a certain limited amount of information especially when certain Ministers are somewhat reluctant to expand when they are asked for information. It appears clear, judging by a notice in the newspapers yesterday and by the answer to a parliamentary question to-day, that no formal tie-up of the proposals was made by the Government or by the Minister and that, in consequence, we are not now enabled to draw on that Grant Counterpart Fund for this ground limestone subsidy without a special Act being passed by the United States Congress.</P>
      <P>I think these circumstances warrant an explanation from the Minister for his failure to adjust that matter in the six months that elapsed between the time he took office and the 8th January of this year when E.C.A. administration terminated.  When the Minister was introducing this Supplementary Estimate he did not see fit to give us any explanation of his failure in this connection.  Before the money is passed by this House I think the Minister should give us a more detailed explanation in this connection or else we may, perhaps, have to refer the matter to his superior officer on the Vote on Account as, I suppose, the Minister for Finance probably figured in that arrangement, or lack of arrangement, in some way or other because, for obvious reasons, the Department of Finance has a say in most of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> I was convinced in my innocence and perhaps in my ignorance of Standing Orders that I was entitled to go somewhat outside the scope of the Supplementary Estimate, to which the Chair has limited me.  I understand that I cannot advert, as I had hoped to be allowed to advert, to the question of prices in regard to a food production drive.  Of course I must, without question, bow to the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    <P>I believe that no Minister will succeed in any publicity or propaganda effort unless he gains the respect and the confidence of the people towards whom he is directing that propaganda. He will not get that respect and confidence if he allows those people to feel that for six months of the year he is not interested in one of their main crops&mdash;a crop which brings very substantial profit to the farmer, and particularly to the farmers of Munster and of South Kildare and Carlow.  In addition he must ensure that such a crop will be utilised, as it can be utilised, for the purpose of stepping-up production and increasing our balance of payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>My first point is in connection with sub-head M (1) (C)&mdash;Advertising and Publicity, including Food Production Propaganda.  There is absolutely no use in wasting money on advertising in an appeal to the farmers to produce more if they find themselves in the position that, having already answered, at very high cost, previous appeals for increased production they cannot get a market for the produce. That is the situation in Cork at present.  People were asked to produce more bacon, more beef and more crops. Having produced more bacon at a considerably higher price than it took to produce it in the past they now find that they are unable to dispose of that bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that situation exists is not the time to spend money on publicity and propaganda calling for increased production. Even the numbers of pigs that can be taken at the factories in Cork are being reduced and there are cuts in price.  Owing to the increase in the cost of feeding stuffs, these pigs cost considerably more to produce <Col N="2259" /> than pigs marketed three months ago. I suggest that, if the Minister is serious in the advice which he gives in these advertisements to increase production, he should make some attempt to provide a decent market for the food that is available at the moment. I suggest that he should take his courage in his hands, open the Border and let the pigs go out again.  If there is an artificially created surplus in this country, let them go out to a place where there is great need of food of any sort.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister in his advertising campaign should also try to get the goodwill of agricultural producers.  Agricultural producers are working under heavy difficulties.  There is no use in putting big advertisements in the Press calling on producers to grow more, when you have the veiled threat in speeches from the Tánaiste: &ldquo;If you do not grow more, you are going to get compulsion next year.&rdquo; That is the only interpretation that can be put on the speech made by the Tánaiste at the meeting of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants recently.  There is no use in the Minister spending money, trying to win the goodwill of the people, at the same time as you have another Minister in the Cabinet coming out and just annoying the food producers of the country by these threats, as I regard them.</P>
    <P>In regard to item M (5), I think that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are unduly troublesome in looking for sureties.  In many cases people can get loans from the bank much more easily than they can get them from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think that if we want farmers to avail of these loans there should not be so much red tape about them.</P>
    <P>There is another item, O (4), dealing with veterinary services.  A vicious attack was made on the Cork milk suppliers in this House by the ex-Minister for Agriculture, and one of the veterinary officers stated publicly that 20 per cent. of the milk going into Cork was dirty.  The actual facts are that of 1,800 samples tested in Cork, one sample, according to the report of <Col N="2260" /> the medical officer for health to the city manager, was very dirty, and approximately 6 per cent. were graded as dirty.  I think that if a veterinary officer can be quoted in the Press as saying that 20 per cent. of the milk was dirty, that is a gross exaggeration of the position and he should be asked to be more careful in the statements he makes in future.  I think also that the ex-Minister for Agriculture might be more careful in his statements, too, but he has called &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; so often that I do not think anybody pays much attention to his statements now.</P>
    <P>With regard to ground limestone and other forms of lime, I should like to point out to the Minister that particularly in Cork and in Kerry, we feel that ground limestone cannot fill the place of sea-sand.  I know that the Minister has agreed very reluctantly, as his predecessor did before, to continue the sea-sand scheme in Cork but if we want to make any suggestions about the sea-sand scheme, we are threatened: &ldquo;If you open your mouth, the scheme will be dropped altogether.&rdquo; There are certain areas in Cork where sea-sand is vitally necessary and there are certain increased costs involved in finding that sand due to awards in the Labour Court or to increased wages granted in various districts. I think the Minister should be very slow before putting the policy in operation in Cork, which he has already put into operation in North Kerry, that is, to get rid of the scheme. If suggestions are made for the improvement of the scheme in Cork they should not be met by criticism of the county committee of agriculture and the threat: &ldquo;If you suggest any improvements, the scheme will go by the board.  You are lucky to have it at all.&rdquo;  These are a few points I should like to put to the Minister and I hope he shall have something to say about them when he is concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputies to look for a moment at the Appropriations-in-Aid because I thought the Minister would avail of this occasion to give us particulars of the development and extension of the glass-house scheme.  Perhaps when he is replying he will tell us the scale on which he <Col N="2261" /> hopes to expand this service so that a greater number of our neighbours may enjoy its benefits.  I hope to have shortly with me the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for the month of June.  A note appears in that trade journal to the effect that on 23rd May the then Minister for Agriculture had reimposed the restrictions on the import of tomatoes and that he did not propose to authorise the import of any tomatoes in August and September.  I should be glad if the House now would turn to column 820 of No. 5 of Volume 129.</P>

      <P>No.  I never got to the end of it.  I found myself in the dilemma that the Dungarvan Creamery Company alleged that there was an arrangement which had been made with my predecessor, but nobody seemed to know what the details of the arrangement were.  Nobody seemed to know what the position was, either to deny it or to sustain it.  After protracted reflection and discussion, if my <Col N="2264" /> recollection serves me right, I said that some conclusion must be arrived at, or the Dungarvan Creamery should be advised to sue us and let the matter be disposed of in a court of law.  I would be very much interested to discover how this figure of £14,678 was arrived at.  Is that on the basis of loss sustained or is it on the basis of anticipated profits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not on the basis of loss sustained by the creamery company or was it on the basis of profits anticipated which were not realised?  I think that the Government would, in equity, be bound to indemnify the creamery company against loss sustained, but I do not think that Parliament is in equity obliged to indemnify the company against profits hoped for which had not been, in the event, realised.  I think the Minister ought to tell us whether he is satisfied that the company made a loss, and that the loss was approximately the figure which the Supplementary Estimate represents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture may, I think, be technically described as a corporation sole.  He goes on for ever.  The individuality of the occupant of the office for the time being is not revelant to our deliberations here.  It is not enough for me to be informed or the Minister for Agriculture to be informed.  Dáil Éireann is entitled to be informed when Dáil Éireann is asked to vote £14,000, and I think the Minister ought to inform Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, under sub-head M (1)&mdash; Advertising and Publicity&mdash;to direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of June, 1951; they will find there a paragraph in the terms to which I have just referred informing the public at large that on 23rd May the Minister has brought tomatoes under control and that he further warns all and sundry that he does not intend to issue licences for their import in the months of August and September.  That notice appears under date 5th May, 1951, Tomatoes Regulation Import Order, 1948, and it concludes with the sentence: &ldquo;It is <Col N="2266" /> not the intention that licences to import tomatoes should be granted during that period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the Minister reconciles that public advertisement with his indignant observations printed at column 820, Volume 129, of the Official Report.  Like Deputy Sweetman, I believe that the powers of advertising and publicity can be of great assistance in the development of the agricultural industry, but they must carry conviction that the man for them responsible believes what he is saying.  I do not think the Minister will now maintain that he believed what he was saying&mdash;or, did he?&mdash;at column 820 of Volume 129 of the Official Report.  I suggest it is not a pleasant thing for a Minister to be convicted in open forum of stating what is not true.  Can he deny that on that occasion he stated what was not true?  I would not do that again if I were he.  He is not looking for a job now.  He has got it.  Aspirants to public office may go a long way to get what they aspire to but, once they have become Ministers of State, they should not go on record as stating, in their capacity as Ministers, what is not true.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rub the Minister's nose in this.  It is not a pretty business.  Under sub-head M (5)  a scheme is provided for loans for the purchase of implements and milking machines.  I think the effect is simply to raise the ceiling.  That is all right, though I think it is unnecessary, because I believe the loan facilities available at present are quite adequate to meet any reasonable demands. Truth to tell, I am not much impressed by the necessity for granting loans of £700 and £1,000 to farmers for the purchase of machinery.  I think the man who can use that amount of machinery on his land is damn well able to get his own machinery without loans from the Department of Agriculture. I believe the function of that Department is to step in and help the hard-working, honest, small man, who has no collateral, and who finds it difficult to get credit through the ordinary credit channels.  When I am invited to facilitate a man to buy <Col N="2267" /> machinery worth £1,000 for use on his own farm, I must point out that there is ample scope under the land rehabilitation project to give such a man all the credit he wants to buy machinery under that scheme.  I think a man who wants machinery costing in the region of £700 to £1,000 ought to be able to get that for himself without the assistance of the Department.  However, I do not regard it as a matter of any great consequence.</P>
    <P>I do regard it as a matter of consequence at this time to hold out to small farmers the temptation of easy credit to purchase heifers.  I think that is daft&mdash;pure daft.  The demand for heifers at the present time is very, very strong.  The prices are their full value.  If one makes available to a small farmer unlimited credit to go out and buy heifers with borrowed money, then past experience teaches us immediately that 80 per cent. of such heifers will be bought too dear.  What is more natural than for a man who longs for the chance of restocking his holding and is firmly convinced that, by doing so at the present moment, he is likely to make more money, particularly as there is no question of his taking out his own warranty, putting down his own cash, and cutting his suit according to the measure of his own cloth, to go out and pay too much, put it on the long finger and find, when the tale comes to be told, that, by paying too much for his live stock, he has burdened himself with a repayment problem which consumes the profit on his heifers and on the land on which he has put the live stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know the history of the previous heifer loan scheme when auctions were held all over the country.  Most people who are familiar with that period can tell him that the vast majority of the cattle bought were badly bought in, that too much was paid for them by men who could not afford to pay too much, and ultimately the redemption value on these loans constituted an intolerable burden on those who had bought the heifers.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to know from the Minister what is the present basis of <Col N="2268" /> the ground limestone subsidy and what does the average rate of transport per ton mile work out at?  Has he decided in the light of the experience that he now has of the transport problem to zone the country?  In the initial stages we determined to allow Córas Iompair Éireann, inasmuch as we knew the officers would do their best to operate the scheme as economically as it was possible to operate it, to deliver the lime at large with a view to determining by experience what the average ton mile cost would be, and by our experience deciding whether it would be expedient to zone the areas to which it might be carried free of charge to a certain circumference around each plant.  I would be glad to know from the Minister what the fruit of his experience to date has been and whether he intends to proceed on those grounds or not.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought to tell us whether he hopes to get the $5,000,000 which it was proposed by the previous Government to spend out of the Grant Counterpart Fund from the American Government because, of course, if he does, that should represent approximately £1,706,000 and ought to pay for whatever lime is distributed in the next five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman was right in saying that this matter had been considered before the last Government left office and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs recorded, as I read out earlier to-day, that the Government, before it went out of office, had put the appropriate proceeding in train.  It is a pity that our successors fell down upon it, although I am not without hope that the good offices of the American Ambassador may retrieve their mistake.</P>
    <P>I have heard rumours&mdash;if they are only rumours now is the time for the Minister to dispose of them&mdash;that some system of levies has been set up in connection with the meat export trade to America.  If there is, it is very wrong.  The Minister ought to tell us. We are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (4)  provision is made for this trade.  It is a very valuable trade.  I warn the House of <Col N="2269" /> this, that ever since the Department of Finance was instituted in this country they have always longed for the opportunity of getting the consent of some Minister for Finance in principle to a proposal to levy on the live stock exported from this country. Every Minister for Agriculture who ever sat in Merrion Street has always refused even to discuss such a proposal or to admit that such a principle is proper for discussion.  A suggestion has appeared more than once, in the course of organising the carcase meat export trade and getting it in step with the live meat export trade, as to the expediency of operating a levy and bounty system in the business, but every Minister for Agriculture, I believe, has always recoiled from that device lest it might be taken as a precedent by the Minister for Finance to levy on the live-stock trade and to bring the proceeds of the levy into the general revenue.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture will not initiate or set on foot a system of levy within the trade without informing the House of his proposal.  I invite him to give us the details and to correct any misapprehension that anyone may labour under.</P>
    <P>When are we going to hear of the setting up of the prices inquiry for the price of butter?  Has it been set up? It comes under sub-head Q.  The Minister ought to know it is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the details.  Deputy O'Reilly would like to know how much more New Zealand butter was imported this year than last year, how much more was paid for it. He is a public spirited man and he likes to keep his eye constantly on the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i> to the Minister for Agriculture. We will give him the money, and gladly, under sub-head M (1), but would he lay down this regulation, that from this day forth, so long as he is Minister for Agriculture, he will declare the agricultural policy of his Government to the country?  I have reached the stage when the last man in this Government from whom I expect to hear the agricultural policy laid down is the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proclaims it, the Minister for Industry and Commerce throws his weight about. The Minister for Justice drees his weird about it.  The Taoiseach takes a hand, and I am told that when the Minister for Agriculture goes out with the Taoiseach the tail of his coat is nearly pulled.  I was mortified when I heard that the Minister tried to rise four <Col N="2271" /> times in the Gresham Hotel and found the Taoiseach swinging out of the tail of his coat every time and pulling him down.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, next to the Taoiseach, is the most important Minister in that Cabinet.  The rest of them are living out of him.  The Minister for Agriculture provides the wherewithal for all the rest of them and he ought to make them acknowledge that. I have always tried to preach this doctrine, that whether the Minister for Agriculture is good or bad, he is the farmers' Minister in this country and, apart from controversial topics, it is the duty of farmers to hold up his hand and help him, but when they go to do that they want to feel that they have a man who will not be afraid to hold up their hand and help them.  I think they legitimately resent being told by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice what the Government has decided to do and not to do in respect of the agricultural industry.  If those kinds of communications fall to be made on behalf of the Government, it is the Minister for Agriculture who should make them.  Whether we like them or do not like them, we listen to them with respect from him.  We may differ from him but we will not challenge his right to be heard with respect nor will we challenge his right to speak on these matters.  It makes me sick when I see the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs throwing hand springs through this country, talking about things that they know less than nothing about.</P>
    <P>If I said any more I might say too much.  Suffice it to say that in a gathering where I am present if the Minister for Agriculture is speaking on the policy of the Government about agriculture, I and anyone associated with me will listen with the respect to which he is entitled, holding the position which he does.  But if any of the other tulips come down to try it on I will not stay in the room, and I think no self-respecting farmer will either.</P>

That is wrong. There was no misrepresentation as far as we were concerned.  He claims that we knew the new price of barley on that occasion.  Actually I did not know the new price of barley.

      <P>The question was raised at the Gresham by two representatives of the committees of agriculture, Laois and Offaly.  One of them, I knew very well, was in a better position to know the facts than I was.  He did mention a price.  I had already heard that price mentioned, but I did not know what conditions went with it.  However, that did not affect the argument in relation to the price of wheat.  The reason why the conference was called was to encourage people to produce more, and I think the Taoiseach made it perfectly plain on that occasion that the question of malting barley did not arise.  There was room for both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be provocative and I have evidence to prove t when I assert that sensible, reasonble Deputies, as Deputy Allen sometimes is, cannot hope for a big increase in agricultural production as a result of this new British financial policy of increasing interest charges on loans coupled with the restriction of credit. Assertions have been made here, and they could have been made by Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House as well as by Deputies on the opposition side of the House, that there has been a restriction of credit since the infamous speech which was made in this House on the 18th July by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture challenged the accuracy of a statement made here some time ago and asserted that, so far as there was restriction of credit, it was confined to the friends <Col N="2276" /> of the inter-Party Government&mdash;the traders who were associated with or supposed to be the supporters of the inter-Party Government.  If I am challenged to do so, I will name the strongest financial supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party in my constituency who advocated the policy of restricting credit in the constituency of Laois and Offaly and in the constituency of Offaly in particular.</P>

      <P>I am not mentioning anybody, but I said I would do so if challenged.  If I cannot mention his name in this House, I would do so outside this House without any hesitation whatsoever.  Can anybody explain, bearing in mind conditions here, why there should be an increase in the interest charged on agricultural loans at a time when everybody in this House and every influential person outside the House is urging the farming community to increase their production? Is there any justifiable reason for this?  I assert that there is not any reason for us to follow in the footsteps of the financial policy laid down by the present Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is the follower, the friend and the colleague of the Minister for Finance, to explain to the House, when he rises to speak&mdash;and he is an expert in this matter&mdash;what is the justification, from an Irish point of view, or raising the loan charges from 4½ to 5 per cent.  Let him justify that without any reference to Great Britain or to any outside country.  I now challenge the Minister for Finance for deliberately trying to put across upon the people of this country a policy of deflation with all the consequences that follow the adoption of such a policy&mdash;more unemployment, a cut in consumption, lower real wages, <Col N="2277" /> the increased taxation with which we are threatened and the reduction in subsidies to which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs himself referred when he spoke in his constituency last Sunday.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Congress, six months ago, when dealing with the Central Bank report, said: &ldquo;The adoption of such a policy would give rise to intolerable hardships and difficulties for wage and salary earners, and would be resolutely opposed by the trade unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us deal now with the question of unemployment.  The Minister for Agriculture seems to have doubts that there has been any increase in unemployment since this policy of deflation was announced in the House on the 18th July last.  Let us look at the increase, both from a national and local point of view.  I feel obliged to give the figures I have in my possession as they relate to the country as a whole and as they relate to my own constituency.  The number of persons registered at the labour exchanges on the 17th November last was 58,821. The number registered on the last date for which I can find figures is 73,083. That is the figure for the week ending the 8th March, 1952.  Therefore, the number of unemployed has increased by 14,262 since the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil-Cowan Coalition&rdquo; Government came into office only six months ago.  Nobody will dispute my right to mention the number of unemployed in my own constituency.  At the five labour exchanges in the constituency of Laois-Offaly, 527 unemployed persons were registered on the 3rd February, 1951. On the last date for which I can find figures&mdash;the 23rd February, 1952&mdash;the number of registered unemployed was 1,190, which is an increase of 633 during a short period.  In addition to the number of registered unemployed having increased in the country as a whole by 14,262, and in my own constituency by 633, I am sorry to say that in my constituency, particularly in the boot and shoe factories, of which there are five, and in the one worsted industry half the workers, both male and female, are at present employed on a half-time basis only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in his senses would say that the reason why 1,500 of the 6,000 people engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes in this country are employed on a half-time basis only is due to the import of boots and shoes.  When Deputy Carter speaks, he can give us his ideas on the subject.  It has been wrongly asserted that the unemployment is due to stockpiling. Does Deputy Carter not realise that when the inter-Party Government in their wisdom decided to repatriate some of our external assets, they did so at the time when there was a fear that a world war would come upon us?  If he casts back his mind he will agree with me, though I am speaking from memory on this point, that they did so when General MacArthur was withdrawn from his position in charge of the Korean troops by the United States Government.  The inter-Party Government had reliable information, and the other members of this House must have had reliable information, that we were on the verge of a world war at that time.  Therefore, it was a good policy, apart from any other reasons, to repatriate part of our external assets to purchase essential raw materials and, indeed, a certain percentage of luxury goods instead of waiting for a further devaluation, which would cut down the value of these assets.  If I cannot convince you that the recession in trade so far as it affects the boot and shoe industry had no relation to the import of boots and shoes, then it is impossible to convince you on anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that there was a big percentage of reduction in the number of persons employed in industrial concerns in my constituency.  I am glad Deputy Maher is in the House to hear what I have to say.  Deputy O'Higgins will agree with me that we had a considerable number of ablebodied <Col N="2279" /> men thrown on the labour exchanges because of the policy of this Government.  What was done by the inter-Party Government towards supplying the people with the means necessary to carry out nationally useful schemes which have been carried on over the past three or four years under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949?</P>
      <P>Shortly after the inter-Party Government came into office they were repeatedly accused in the House, and outside it particularly, of having reduced the grants to local authorities from the Road Fund.  I wonder if the Deputies who made these accusations know that there was a tremendous increase in the allocations from the Road Fund over the four financial years in which the inter-Party Government was in office.  I will give the figures relating to my own constituency because the position has a considerable effect on employment as well as unemployment.  In 1947-48, the last year in which Fianna Fáil were responsible for the preparation of Estimates, County Laois received from the Road Fund a total of £62,029.  The inter-Party Government was responsible for the preparation of the Estimates for four financial years and for those four years the total sum allocated from the Road Fund to County Laois was £380,607, an average over the four years of £95,172.  Compare the figure of £95,172 with the figure of £62,029 allocated by the Fianna Fáil Government in their last year in office.  In 1947-48 the County of Offaly received from the Road Fund an allocation of £38,133, and during the four years of the inter-Party Government that county received a total sum of £249,827, or an average of £62,456.  Compare that figure with the figure of £38,133 and it will be seen that there was a considerable increase in the moneys voted from the Road Fund to Laois and Offaly County Councils instead of the reduction that was alleged by Fianna Fáil Deputies and ex-Ministers as well, in this House and outside it, to have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got at my finger tips the amounts given in grants under the <Col N="2280" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act, but I know&mdash;neither Deputy Maher nor any other Deputy can deny it&mdash;that as a result of the huge amount provided by the Minister for Local Government in the inter-Party Government under that Act, the number of men given full-time employment by Laois County Council was doubled during the period from the coming into operation of the Act until February of this year, when 300 men were dismissed at the same week-end because the Minister for Local Government in this Fianna Fáil-Cowan Government refused to provide the further grants required to carry out schemes which the Minister himself had approved.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the consequences of the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Government from the point of view of creating more unemployment.  It was asserted by the Trade Union Congress Executive in the statement they issued last year after the Central Bank Report was published that this policy of deflation would mean a cut in consumption and lower real wages. Anybody and everybody will have to agree that the rapid increase in the price of essential commodities means that the real value of wages has gone down considerably, and if Deputies do not know that they can ask their wives or whatever person does their housekeeping work for them and they will find that it is true.  The Trade Union Congress asserted that this policy of deflation would mean increased taxation and every member of the Government, responsible and irresponsible, from the Taoiseach down to the most junior Minister, has foreshadowed increased taxation, but we shall have to wait until 2nd April&mdash;it should have been 1st April&mdash;to find out whether these threats are to be put into operation.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Congress asserted &mdash;and again we will have to wait a little longer to find out whether it is correct&mdash;that it would mean a reduction in subsidies.  I take it that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who will enlighten the House on the policy of the Government, will not repudiate the speech he is reported to have made on this matter in his constituency last week-end, but we <Col N="2281" /> will have to wait and see whether the prophecy he made there will turn out to be true.</P>

      <P>I take him on his own description.  The Trade Union Congress asserted that this policy would mean a restriction of the capital investment programme.  Nobody, not even the keenest student of finance, can find out from the Estimates, as presented to us on this occasion, what is the amount made available or to be made available for capital investment, or what is the figure out of the total sum asked for to be provided by way of taxation.  We have had it repeatedly asserted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the many speeches he has been making that we have to &ldquo;pay as you earn&rdquo;.  In other words, we are confronted with the policy of restriction of credit and told that where works to be undertaken during the coming year can or should be described as works of a capital development nature, we must pay for them out of normal revenue, which means, of course, increased taxation.  The &ldquo;pay as you earn&rdquo; policy, as I understand it, means that the money must be found out of current revenue and any savings effected are to be given to John Bull to pile up our external assets so that Britain and the British Tory Government can carry out their policy of rearmament at the expense of the Irish people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation whatsover in <Col N="2282" /> reasserting that there is a deep fundamental difference between the financial policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, whether it is dictated from inside or outside the country, and the outlook of the members of the Labour group on the vital question of the control of credit and of currency.  Fianna Fáil, in effect, say, as they have been saying on many matters of less importance: &ldquo;Leave it to private enterprise.&rdquo; We, on the contrary, say that the control of credit and currency should be in the hands of a body specially set up by the Government and responsible to the Parliament of the people, and that it is 100 years out of date to have the vital and major question of the issue of currency and the control of credit in the hands of 12 or 15 men sitting in the Bank of Ireland in College Green without authority or responsibility to the Parliament elected by the people of the country.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Banking and credit in this country are virtually the monopoly of a few professional bankers working in close collaboration with the Bank of England; they may in their absolute discretion provide, or refuse to provide, financial accommodation for any purpose whatever.  They determine the conditions on which credit facilities will be afforded, the period for which credit will be available and the rate of interest which will be charged for it.  These powers should not belong to a small body of persons, many of them out of sympathy with Irish aspirations and who are not responsible for their actions to any authority within the State.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that banking and the control of credit are of paramount importance to the well-being of the people and that the proper use of the community's credit can bring about a substantial improvement in the standard of living of the people.  The Labour Party will, therefore, seek to bring banking and the control of credit under public ownership through a board operating under the authority and supervision of the Government and subject to parliamentary control.&rdquo;</P>

I would say to the Chair and to Deputy McGrath that if there is an increase&mdash;as there has been an increase&mdash;by the figure of 14,362 in the number of unemployed citizens of this State since this Government came into office, it is due not to any decision of Deputy McGrath's or of any of his colleagues but to the decisions of people outside this House who have no authority from this House to make decisions affecting the control of credit and currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see unity between all Parties if possible on this major issue. Is it not more important to the citizens of this State, men and women, who are unemployed, the 73,083 people who are registered in the employment exchanges to-day&mdash;I do not want to be misrepresented on this issue to them&mdash; that they should have an assurance of work to-morrow, of a means to support themselves and their dependents, than an assurance that the Border will be removed the day after to-morrow?  If we are to induce our fellow countrymen and fellow countrywomen across the Border to fight for its removal we will have to bring conditions here up to the level which prevails on the other side of the Border, bad and all as it <Col N="2284" /> is, particularly for the Nationalists in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I would appeal especially to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party because they have the responsibility and the authority if they wish to exercise it, when they go to their Party meeting rooms to ask the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government to realise the seriousness of the international situation.  If Britain goes down and out to-morrow the external assets built up by the labour of those of us who are engaged in industry and agriculture will go down with her.  I do not wish Great Britain to go bankrupt&mdash;far from it&mdash;but I think that it is the duty and responsibility of Deputies on all sides, but of the members of the Government in particular, to see to it that if our next-door neighbour goes down and out financially the hard-earned money of the Irish people which is invested in Britain and is controlled by the Bank of England, where it lies at an interest rate of 1 or 1¾ per cent., is not lost to the people who made that money.  Do you seriously suggest that it was wrong for the inter-Party Government to repatriate some of the external assets?</P>

      <P>Was it wrong to repatriate that portion of our external assets which represented what we supplied to Britain during the world war period when we did not get any goods in return? I would be very glad to receive confirmation from the Minister <Col N="2285" /> for Posts and Telegraphs of my suspicion that he has given serious study to this side of our national policy.  I hope that if he has progressive ideas on this matter he will press them on his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I hope that whatever Government we have in the future, whether it be Fianna Fáil or inter-Party, sees to it that the profits made by our hard-working farmers, their wives and their families and by those employed in industrial concerns, those profits which are invested abroad at nominal rates of interest, will not be lost through following British financial policy.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would appeal particularly to those Deputies who made great sacrifices in the past to consider this major matter of policy in view of the dangerous world conditions in which we are living.  It is our duty to save our own nation.  Let other countries look after themselves.  We should not follow a financial policy which may be suitable for the circumstances in which Great Britain finds herself to-day but which is entirely unsuitable for this small country of ours.</P>

      <P>It is very dull to have to listen to the debate and to see the picture painted of the economic situation because it is so easy to exaggerate one way or the other.  We have had a good example of that in the course of the last 20 minutes when Deputy Davin, in his wisdom, tried to put into our mouths all sorts of ideas and policies which we do not hold.  We have been criticised because some Deputies say there is a difference of opinion in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Since one Minister stresses the danger of the situation and another stresses what we intend to do about it and the certain advantages we have, a suggestion is made that Ministers are conflicting with each other.  In other words, that we are opposed on the question as to what constitutes an economic crisis in this country.  We would like to end the state of confusion which, we think, has been created by the Opposition, but one has to speak carefully with due regard to the facts in analysing the general situation.  If there is a world economic crisis to that extent there <Col N="2286" /> must be some degree of crisis here because we are dependent on world conditions.  If there is a sterling crisis we must accept that some of the circumstances attending that crisis apply to this country because, whether we like it or not, sterling is part of our arterial economic bloodstream.  There is no way of facing the present situation except by accepting that fact.</P>
      <P>We do not believe we are in any danger of economic disruption.  We do not believe that any over-drastic action is required.  We believe that if wise action is taken now we can avoid more adverse conditions.  Neglect to do that might require far more drastic action. We believe that it will go on for some considerable time consequent on the world situation, and we prefer to point out the danger ahead.  If the Opposition misunderstand our point of view, if they wish to confuse the public mind, we cannot arrest their lamentable performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the average point of view stressed by the Government and this Party is that there is a difficult situation ahead of us and it must be faced by adopting reasonably wise measures.  The high level of the tourist industry here and the continuation of high agricultural prices should ensure that there may not be any violent depression, although a person would be unwise to prophesy what might happen, having regard to the state of the world.  There might well be some continuation of regional unemployment as long as retail prices of certain commodities remain very high.  I might add in this connection that the memories of the public are very short and the whole of the business world is tending to compare the level of trade during the extreme stockpiling period of 1950 with the level of trade to-day instead of going back to a more normal period, such as 1948-49.  In any way it is essential to face the issues which govern world conditions.  European Governments for the last few years have consisted of frightened and over-optimistic statesmen who, faced with the threat of Communism, with the demand for better conditions immediately after the end of the world war, improved social services, inaugurated <Col N="2287" /> development schemes, repaired devastation in their countries in an endeavour to increase production. Many of these countries did the same sort of things as ourselves.  Many had the same sort of problems as ourselves, problems of under-development.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil left enough plans behind in 1948 to last for a quarter of a century. In most countries the conditions of workers have been very much improved. They share a higher real standard of living in some cases modified by rationing limitations.  In England the workers are 25 per cent. better off than before the war but the things on which they could spend their money limited.</P>
    <P>Many countries during that time were uneasy.  When the Korean War came one could quite easily divide the Governments of the world into two groups&mdash;those who hid their heads, ostrich-like, in the sand, and refused to face the fact that there must be a change, and those who were prepared to face the situation that there would be a rapid increase in the prices of raw materials, some degree of economic disruption, and they might have to tell the ordinary people in every country, the normal persons who desired a normal life, that their desire must, to some extent, be thwarted by the effect of world conditions.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to expect that this country or any other country can live a normal existence when the world is preparing for a new war only a few years after preparing to make good the devastation of a war that ended only a short time ago.  In Great Britain the Labour Government&mdash;whatever virtues it may have had&mdash;did not prepare the people to face the situation. The British Government has faced bankruptcy nearly three times since 1945.  We did not need to copy them, but what has happened to the British Government can serve as a warning to some of the Parties in this country who preach the Paradise-round-the-corner type of economics.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride, in the course of his speech, a number of times suggested <Col N="2288" /> that we were copying literally the Tory Government.  Will the Deputies of the Opposition Parties have some sense of humour?  Neither we nor any Party in this House would be willing to accept one half of the restrictive measures accepted by the Tory Government in Great Britain as part of the Socialist régime which they inherited and a great deal of which they initiated.  It is absolutely laughable for Deputies to suggest that either we or any other Party in this House would try and copy the economic policy of the Tory Government or of the Labour Government, because no Party would ever succeed in gaining any kind of over-all majority with the sort of restrictions in Great Britain and in view of the many social panaceas that have been held out to that country. Suggestions of comparisons of that kind under the circumstances are ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The former Government, we believe, were frightened to tell the people of the economic position as it affects us. The patterns of world trade have shifted.  The American standard of living has improved so much that dollar prices have gone up to our disadvantage. Many other things have happened which seem as remote as the sky from the life of the ordinary people in this country but which, nevertheless, impinge on our economy.</P>
    <P>The freezing up of Iron Curtain trade between Eastern and Western Europe, the continuation of under-production in Asia and the liberation of a number of people in Asia and the consequent rise of raw material prices together with rearmament have all had their adverse effects.  There has been no time to invest money in African raw materials and a great deal of Africa as a partner of Europe in trade has been frustrated by rapid rearmament consequent on the Korean adventure.</P>
    <P>We are affected by the fact that the adverse trade balance of Europe with countries outside Europe went up by four billion dollars in the first half of 1951.  That is a large sum of money and we made some little contribution to the increase in that deficit and it is not a thing that can be disregarded in a study of our economy or the economy of any countries associated with us. <Col N="2289" /> Last year throughout the world the cost of living rose as it has risen here.  It lagged here for some time and then began to rise rapidly in the first half of 1951 and continued.  There has been unemployment of a much more serious character in countries where there is defence work carried on.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, as the House knows, the number of unemployed is now 46,000, 14,000 more than it was a year ago.  In regard to the unemployment mentioned by Deputy Davin he compared a period in the summer with a period in the winter.</P>
    <P>The actual unemployment here, as far as I recollect, is about 10,000 more than in the corresponding period of last year.  It is greatly regretted by ourselves.  It occurs largely in the textile and allied industries.</P>

I do not think, therefore, the last Government need lecture us on the subject of unemployment. About 24,000 people emigrated every year during their term of office, after the most florid promises made by them to end emigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He should study the average figure of net emigration.  The trend of British economy affected us <Col N="2290" /> also.  Recently, the British decided to reduce their imports by £600,000,000 in a single year.  Naturally, that is of interest to us.  The fact that Marshall Aid has ended for the present deeply affects the economy of this country. We borrowed about £45,000,000.  That is equivalent to putting £70 into every dwelling in the country.  It is equivalent to a free gift of drink, tobacco and amusements undertaken by people for one year.</P>
      <P>It is equivalent to the consumption for three years of wheat, sugar and wearing apparel imports.  When it ends, and we can no longer borrow that amount to substitute for Marshall Aid on that scale by the issue of internal loans, it is obviously a matter of the greatest difficulty, and one that cannot be sneered at by the members of the Opposition saying that the loan ought to be replaced immediately, just because they know that it will place us in a difficult position.  We believe that a portion of the loan was misused by the last Government.  We have yet to have explained to us why we should borrow money to pay for our daily bread.</P>
      <P>In 1951 there was a net dis-saving on the part of the people of the country. We know beyond all doubt that the ordinary people of this country were saving both in 1950 and 1951 a lesser proportion of their income than they were in 1938, just at the end of the economic war.  We know that that is the position that must be studied very carefully.  In fact, to some degree, the country has been on what might be described as a &ldquo;spending spree.&rdquo; No matter how much the cost of government went up in the past two years and no matter what world conditions were, the people were told that they need not alter their habits of life, and that there need be no economic changes of any kind.  Members of the Opposition can have the doubtful consolation that other countries who indulged in escapist talk of that kind are now finding themselves in difficulties&mdash; countries such as France, where coalition Governments change rapidly because they can never take firm and decisive decisions on economic policy.</P>

      <P>If we do not, then the workers of this country stand to lose 20 years of benefits by the oncoming of further inflation.  We should stop repatriating assets that we control for non-essentials.  There is no objection to repatriating assets if they will assist in increasing our production and our volume of exports.  While the inter-Party Government were in office their imports for capital goods purposes amounted to 10 per cent. of all imports. In 1938, at the end of four years of economic war, the percentage was seven.  At that time there was no handful of cranks talking about repatriation of external assets without knowing what it meant.</P>

      <P>The figure has not increased very much as far as capital goods are concerned.  It was about 10 per cent. in the last year of the inter-Party Government and it was 7 per cent. in 1938.  We might consider that we should stop importing at least some of our wheat, at least some of our sugar and a great deal of our maize unless we can see some great advantage in the way of the development of agricultural exports.  We have to face long-term facts about agricultural production in this country.  Half the country was dazed by the oratory and false optimism of Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture and a very large number of people were nauseated by his abuse of Fianna Fáil, by his misuse of statistics and by the fact that, starting off after a period of two years of weather almost unequalled in Europe, he made the wildest promises and failed to fulfil them.  We remember Deputy Dillon saying a few years ago that he would restore the pig population in a few years, and he made <Col N="2292" /> the fantastic boast that he would increase the volume of exports by 100 per cent. in five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In spite of all these advantages, Deputy Dillon was not able to do anything notable.  In order to try and confuse the country there has been the questioning of the accuracy of figures for production issued during the whole of his régime by Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach and head of the Statistics Department. He has been trying to give the country the impression that the figures we use are bogus in some way although, in fact, they were prepared in the same way as they were prepared under the auspices of Deputy Costello when he was Taoiseach and head of the Statistics Department.  As a matter of fact, his method of calculating agricultural production differs in the long run very little from Deputy Costello's as Taoiseach.  The facts are that by 1950 the volume of production was about the same as it was in 1938&mdash;and it does not matter whether it was 5 per cent. more or less, and that is all the difference there is in the figures mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  In 1951 there appeared to be a definite decline in certain directions as compared with 1950.  Deputy Dillon has never yet explained why, in 1951, there were 86,000 <Col N="2293" /> fewer pigs, 2,000,000 fewer hens, 20,000 fewer cows and 33,000 fewer in-calf heifers than in 1950.

      <P>I think it can be fairly assumed that for some time ahead agricultural prices will remain as they are at the moment.  We do need a long-term plan for agriculture.  Farmers are 70 per cent. better off than in 1938, in terms of purchasing power, but agricultural <Col N="2294" /> prices may be stabilising.  It may be difficult to think in these circumstances of increasing exports immediately, but we should, over a long period, be able to expand agricultural production.  We need to increase our exports by £20,000,000 and to reduce our imports by the same figure, if we are to have some reserve of foreign assets.  That is not a matter that can be implemented rapidly but that should be the ideal at which we should aim&mdash; to expand our exports by £20,000,000 and reduce our imports by the same amount.  We ought to aim at that to put ourselves in a fundamentally sound position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon questioned in the course of his speech the figures of O.E.E.C. in regard to production and the comparison of our position with that of other European countries.  In the course of my speech to which he referred, I was quoting from the figures supplied by F.A.O., a body which inherited the work of the international statistics organisation in Rome.  Even though there may be variations in regard to comparisons or production in one particular period, over a period of years the figures quoted may be regarded as reasonably reliable.  They show that in the period from 1936 to 1947 this country was fourth highest in terms of resiliency or recovery on a list of 14 Western European countries, and 1946-47 was a year of ghastly weather.  That was the position when Fianna Fáil left office, but by 1950 we were eleventh in order of progress, and by 1951 we were no better.  On top of that, we had the boasting of the ex-Minister for Agriculture that production was going to expand not only in prices but in volume as well.</P>

As I have said, stagnancy in our agricultural production increased under the last Government which vacillated with its tillage <Col N="2295" /> policy and showed a lack of fundamental vision in approaching agricultural problems.  So far as exports are concerned, the trade figures are incontrovertible. The figures are made available by O.E.E.C. so that there can be no difficulty in calculation and no difficulty in the manner of arriving at them. The volume of our exports during the last year of office of the previous Government was exactly the same as in 1938.  No greater quantities were exported.  Prices had gone up but no fundamental change had taken place in volume of exports.  Again comparing our progress with that of 14 other European countries, we were twelfth in the list of countries as compared with 1938&mdash;not at all a good record and something rather humiliating to ourselves.</P>
      <P>As regards imports, we showed a record of profligacy.  In the year 1950, we were third highest in the list of countries in Europe which had increased their imports.  We could well examine how we could emulate the example of some countries, which did succeed, unlike this country under Deputy Dillon, in improving their agricultural exports, countries such as Denmark, Holland and Sweden.  Their exports went up in volume by 25 to 30 per cent. in comparison with the period 1938.  So far as a comparison of our own country with that period of 1938 is concerned, in 1951 in spite of Deputy Dillon's promises there were some 400,000 fewer pigs in the country, although he said he was going to smother England with bacon.  There were 46,000 fewer young cattle and there were 1,000,000 fewer poultry than in 1938.  There was about 4 per cent. more cattle but one of the strange things is that in 1950 the increase in the number of cattle was very largely amongst cattle of two to three years old.  Some of them must have been calved in 1947 and some of them in 1946.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talked about the number of cattle exported in his last year of office.  Cattle exports in that year were value for £23,000,000 and they were value for £22,000,000 in 1950.  Total animal exports, alive and dead, were value for something in the region of £29,800,000 in 1951 as compared with £29,250,000 in 1950.  In 1951 the same number of cattle were exported as in 1947 or about 5 per cent. more than in 1946. Luckily for Deputy Dillon they were worth very much more because agricultural prices had gone up all over the world since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You have nearly proved that the farmers were better off in 1932 than they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the farmers benefited by higher prices.  If we take exports of live-stock products, they were value in 1951 for £18,580,000 in comparison with £17,311,000 in 1950. Increases in the export of fresh, chilled and frozen beef, lamb and tinned beef were nearly cancelled out by a reduction in the exports of butter and eggs in shell.  In other words, the value of the important exports in the two years was nearly the same.  In the meantime, our export price index had gone up by 13 per cent. from 1950 to 1951, taking the average for the two years, while our agricultural price index had gone up by 9 per cent., showing, in fact, that there was stagnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dreary deduction from all this is, once more, stagnancy and yet more stagnancy, in a year when the Opposition gloat gleefully about the huge adverse trade balance, as though it were of some benefit to the country. Our total exports under all heads were just a little more in value than in 1950 but allowing for the increase in prices <Col N="2297" /> there must be a slight reduction in the actual volume of exports in the last year as compared with 1950.</P>
    <P>When we speak of these matters we are not trying as Deputy Dillon suggested to drive the farmers to work harder.  We do not feel that we are sitting, loafing at our city desks, as he indicated in his speech.  We are talking about the necessity for having a fundamental long-term plan for improved agricultural production.  We know that it is affected by long-term issues which cannot be easily changed. We know that under our system of agricultural production, only one in a family inherits the land.  We know that there is a tendency to save in cash and to keep it on deposit, instead of increasing capital investment in the farm.</P>
    <P>It is a conservative system, known as an extensive system of agricultural production.  Due to adverse influences in the past, it has elements of great stability, particularly in times of economic crisis.  It is going to take a long time to change.  One of the results has been that farms have grown constantly in size in the last few years. In 1926 there were 646,000 people at work on the land.  In 1951 the number was 500,000, and of these, 25,000 left in the last three years.  If that process continues, then, in about 70 years' time, farms will be about 70 acres instead of about 35 acres as at present. We have to face the fact that any project for increasing agricultural production must be of a long-term nature, and that the farmers must be given a genuine confidence in their Government, no matter what its complexion may be, if they are going to make any great effort at increasing production which, as we know, has barely altered in quantity since 1911.</P>
    <P>We, all of us, look to the Land Commission to settle the problem of the land, but the fact is that, under all the Governments of this country, the people have been settling the land problem themselves much more quickly than the Land Commission could ever hope to do unless they were to adopt the Communistic methods of expropriation. The sooner we face these facts the better.  Within the last three years <Col N="2298" /> the then Minister for Lands promised in a speech at Cork, rather unwisely, I think, that he would end congestion in five years.  He gave the number of congests as 50,000, and said he had succeeded in either rearranging or increasing about 1,500 new holdings per year.  While doing that, about 8,000 people were leaving the land every year.</P>
    <P>That, of course, simplified the problem for him and for the Land Commission.  The position at the moment is that about 250,000 farmers own the land of this country, and out of these 42,000 are women.  There are about 203,000 working relatives who hope to inherit the land of these 250,000 people.  That again indicates that it is going to be a long-term problem to increase agricultural production in this country because there is every evidence that the farms are going to go on increasing in size.  Agricultural production must go up if we are to be able to continue with the full volume of our national development programme, particularly under difficulties of the kind which we face at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon knows the problem as well as any member of the House.  The problem is to persuade the farmers of this community to increase their own private capital investment in the land and to adopt scientific methods. Until we have some kind of an agreed policy in this House in regard to agriculture, I think it is going to be difficult to persuade them to alter the long-term, conservative and stable habits of a lifetime.  We have a land rehabilitation scheme.  Some features of it are good and some are unpopular. It is going ahead.  We do not intend to abolish it.  We do not believe that the result of it will be an immediate increase in our exports.  It may have a long-term effect, a gradual effect, in increasing production, but it is not a solution of the present agricultural and economic problem.</P>
    <P>One particular matter of very great importance which was neglected by the last Government until very recently was a limestone deficiency.  We assumed that Deputy Dillon was correct when he indicated in his <Col N="2299" /> statement that there was a total capital deficiency of 10,000,000 tons of limestone, that the land required 1,500,000 tons per year, while at the moment the aim is between two and three hundred thousand tons.  One can also say that there will be no great increase in agricultural production until some Government has managed to get the whole of the 10,000,000 tons supplied because obviously, as every one knows, there is not much hope of increasing production on a farm that has a big area of acid soil.</P>
    <P>We hope that the market is safe for the farmers and that prices will only vary by small margins.  We know that the population of the world is growing more quickly than the production of food.  We hope that the farmers will be encouraged, particularly if they are given a long-term policy, so that they can look forward to at least ten years of a stable policy which will not be interrupted constantly by changes to their disadvantage.  I think myself that we will have to face the necessity of having an agricultural policy which will cease to be a matter, if one may so describe it, of violent Party striving. It would be much better if people came into this House to criticise the efficiency of a Government in operating a policy that was accepted by most of those in the House.  If we reach that point we may get somewhere with a long-term plan for increased agricultural production. I would say that if the last Government ceased to pretend that they had made substantial progress in their three years of office, we on our side could perhaps cease making what I believe to be genuine and truthful excuses, namely, the economic war and the world war with all the difficulties we faced at that time, such as world depression, as a justification for the fact that we did not succeed in increasing agricultural production.  If both sides of the House could make an effort of that description we might get somewhere with a long-term policy for increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The fact is that exports in this country went up by about £8,000,000 a year since 1944.  If export prices do not level off this year&mdash;we do not know whether they will or not&mdash;then we can <Col N="2300" /> have no great increase of exports beyond that figure.  They might be a little bit above or a little bit below it, but it must be obvious that it would be impossible to achieve in a short time a very great expansion of exports in value.</P>
    <P>We have to face, as I have said, certain problems in regard to the adverse balance of payments.  These will have to be solved.  Perhaps I should again, for the benefit of the House, give some facts in connection with our adverse trade balance.</P>

      <P>I think it is very important for the House and for Deputies to understand all the facts.  We want to avoid the confusion that can be created otherwise.  The Deputy will have his chance of refuting them when he speaks later.  The figures I have are not absolutely complete.  They are not fully verified but they are approximately correct.  In 1947, we had, as for many years in the past, a positive trade balance in the sterling area of about £24,000,000 a year.  With that trade balance we used to direct the banking houses to spend it for us in the nonsterling area to which we exported practically nothing.  In 1951, owing to conditions, some of which were not within the control of the Governments of the day&mdash;the two Governments&mdash;and some of which were, there was an actual net adverse trade balance with the whole of the sterling area of £6,000,000 approximately.  This meant that unless we were able to avoid a procedure by which, by some roundabout method of trade of which I am ignorant, we actually had to sell sterling assets in London to pay for New Zealand butter.  Well. if anybody suggests that that kind of thing could continue for long I would be very glad to hear their defence of it.  I could <Col N="2301" /> understand selling sterling assets to purchase building materials or to purchase complicated mechanical equipment for our hospitals, but why we should sell sterling assets to pay for New Zealand butter I do not know.  No Government could continue that process for long.  That process had to be arrested to some extent.</P>

      <P>That kind of economic conduct cannot continue and the Deputy has the consolation of knowing that before we take any steps to deal with the situation in a more drastic fashion, we have predicted that there will be a further sale of external assets to the tune of £22,000,000, compared with £26,000,000 last year, and all we can do is to make a marginal change on that figure and the Deputy can be satisfied that that process will continue to some degree this year.</P>

      <P>In connection with the dollar area, we had a net adverse trade balance of £29,000,000 in 1947, and £23,000,000 in 1951.  Even including remittances sent here by our kith and kin and all the other invisible <Col N="2302" /> items in 1951, our exports were one to ten in proportion to our imports.  We borrowed a considerable number of dollars from America and we saved the British Government, as some members have indicated, by not drawing on the dollar pool during a period of time. Nobody could argue that the position could continue, and when anybody suggests we might go on to some other form of currency, such as dollars, they must make suggestions at the same time as to how we can alter that proportion of exports to imports, which was one in ten for the last full calendar year of 1951, and which included emigrants' remittances and all the other invisible items, expenditure by tourists, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come then to the E.P.U. area.  In 1948 we had an adverse trade balance of £13.7 million, which had doubled itself by 1951 to £27.8 million.  We had Deputy MacBride flitting around Europe, fluttering the dovecots, making new trade pacts with European countries, and worthy speeches on his return about the desirability of expanding exports to these countries.  He was rather careless of the results of his work because our exports to the E.P.U. countries in 1950-51 were exactly the same, £6,000,000.  The imports went up from £21,000,000 to £35,000,000.  If we have no longer a positive sterling balance to pay for these goods we must sooner or later take some reasonable restrictive action. We used to sell the sterling area far more goods than we imported in value, and we used to tell them to buy those goods in Europe for us.  That position has changed.  Sterling has weakened. It has got to be strengthened.  Even if we do go on selling sterling securities in London, where we spend about one-tenth of capital goods, obviously that cannot go on indefinitely.  As a matter of fact, we have spent about one-tenth of capital goods in relation to expenditure of that kind.  We must leave some controllable assets in Great Britain.  We cannot control a great part of the external assets, and we must leave some controllable assets. All we want to do is to take moderate action now to prevent much more serious disruption later on, disruption which might cause very grave unemployment <Col N="2303" /> and might result in the delay or arrest of our national development programme.</P>
    <P>I admit it is very dull to talk in that way.  It would be much easier to be melodramatic, to make wild promises. It would be equally easier to frighten the House with a horrifying description of the situation.  I prefer to take the middle course and describe the situation, as I see it, as accurately as possible.  We are becoming a debtor nation at present, and if we want to avoid that, so far as our controllable assets are concerned, by about the year 1954 we must now start to think about it quietly and deliberately.</P>
    <P>We do not want to have to take action such as France has had to take. We do not want unemployment such as exists in Holland at the present time.  We do not want to do anything at the last moment.  Above all, we want to avoid doing things at the last moment, things of the kind the British did.  As Deputies in the Opposition Benches are not slow to point out, we are in a better position in this country and it is solely a matter of adopting a balanced policy.</P>
    <P>During the three years of the inter-Party Government we had Deputy MacBride bemusing the country by implying that our exports to countries other than England were increasing and that a great deal could be done by these trade pacts to further increase these exports.  We hope exports will increase, but the actual percentage of exports to countries other than England was 11 per cent. in 1940 and 13 per cent. in 1951.  The process will take a long time.  At that rate, it will take 50 to 70 years.  We hope exports will expand under the new board set up to extend dollar exports in every direction.  Obviously, that again must be a long-term policy.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that, in some way or other, we have failed to take into account all the bargaining factors we can use in any negotiations with the British Government.  I want to assure the House that we have all those factors in mind.  We had them in mind in connection with the recent talks, and we will have them in mind <Col N="2304" /> in the future.  I suppose I ought to mention them again in case any Deputy might imagine we did not already know them by heart.</P>
    <P>We know all about the fact that Great Britain had deprived us of certain goods which could be bought with sterling.  We might still like to have those goods and we might be forced to seek them in other markets.  We are aware of the savings we enabled the British Government to effect by not drawing on the dollar pool until the latter part of 1951.  We are aware of their position in relation to the scarcity of meat and their dependence upon us for a considerable portion of their requirements. We are aware of the fact that we do not regard the recent price agreements as being entirely satisfactory and that we might be able to send them more of these commodities if the prices were more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the fact, too, that we are not responsible for the collapse of certain parts of the British Empire and we are no longer responsible for the fantastic decisions taken at the Yalta Conference, largely under the influence of the late President Roosevelt and which have resulted in the present military and economic pressures in Europe.  We know all these things and we will always stress them in all our negotiations with the British Government.</P>
    <P>We have, as I have already indicated, a completely selfish motive in wishing to preserve our arterial economic blood stream.  It is something from which no one can escape. Whether we like it or not, the sale of our securities in Great Britain and their injection through the pool sterling available for foreign purchase weakens the value of the total sterling pool, even though it may be only to a very small degree, unless we sell these assets for the purpose of increasing our exports in the long run to the non-sterling area or for the sake of some other purpose which will avoid imports on our part.  Although the amount may be very small, if other members of the sterling group have made some contribution on their own part to the common effort to preserve this bloodstream, having made all the reservations possible and having made all the <Col N="2305" /> claims possible, it is quite obvious that we are bound to make some reasonable contribution ourselves.  That is because we are dependent on world economy to a considerable degree and still more because of the fact that we are part of the sterling area.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have exaggerated the position.  We cannot alter the pattern of our economy in this country quickly.  Unless we can increase our exports enormously to other countries, divert our exports from England to other countries, we are affected by the sterling position and unless we are prepared to put up a considerable economic and currency boundary across the Border in addition to the boundary that is there now we have to accept very considerable similarities in our general credit policy in relation to Great Britain and the sterling area. It is just as well that we should admit that quite frankly.</P>
    <P>I hope that we can persuade the ordinary people to reject some of the Clann na Poblachta nonsense in regard to economics that appears to have been adopted by some but not all Fine Gael Deputies.  It is very easy to move from the scylla of <i>laissez-faire</i> and economic liberalism to the charybdis of super-planning, to try to give the people the impression that all economic problems can be solved by super-planning, that happiness can be produced overnight.</P>
    <P>Fundamental economic laws have not changed in 100 years.  What has changed is the fact that we can control economic forces by governmental means far more than we used to, although there is a great limitation, both here and in Europe, to the extent to which we can control those forces wisely and, frequently, most terrible mistakes can be made when people sit together in common concourse in one international assembly or another and give the impression to the people of the world that happiness will come in a short time.  I believe that very few people have been infected by that kind of doctrine but we have to speak frankly on these questions.  Progress must be slow when wars are just passing or are imminent.  Progress in developing a nation's resources may have to be slightly slowed down in order to get a country over a difficulty <Col N="2306" /> of that kind, in order to overcome the factors of high prices, and so forth.</P>
    <P>We know those things and we know also that the substitution of socialist controls for free trade and imperial greed are not a panacea even if they may correct some social evils.  Leaping from one extreme to another will not get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>As I here indicated, there is nothing which is Tory in the British sense about the Government's policy.  Some members of the last Government were constantly talking Labour Party policy but were utterly unwilling to accept the kind of economic controls which would be necessary if it was to be put into operation.  It might be a very good description of the general doctrines of the Clann na Poblachta Party, that exercised such influence in this House for a short period, even though they were small in numbers, that it was Labour Party policy without any of the economic controls, without any of the insistence on the controls that would be necessary in order to find the money to do the work.  The most modern Governments in the world believe that the cost of development must be met by borrowing, by saving and by taxation. The last Government had very nearly scraped the bottom of the barrel on one point, in regard to borrowing money.</P>
    <P>The most modern Governments in the world, the most perfectly streamlined Socialist Government, tell their people that if the banks lend their deposits outright to a Government, instead of the people willingly lending their savings and buying National Loan themselves, the effect is inflationary and it will raise prices.  That has been said in fact more often in countries of the most advanced socialist economies than in countries which are more conservative.  Sir Stafford Cripps spent part of the declining years of his office in trying to persuade the British people of these facts.  In spite of all, he said, they nearly went off the rail several times.</P>
    <P>Some members of the House talk as though our external assets were unlimited in quantity.  Some of them are not controlled and some we do control, and we must make sure that sufficient controllable reserves are left in <Col N="2307" /> England in order that we do not become a debtor country.  Those people who talk about repatriating assets, without discussing in detail for what they are to be used, can have the consolation of knowing that of the £160,000,000 of assets accumulated during the war all but about £5,000,000 have been dissipated, some for useful purposes and some for very doubtful purposes, so that we are where we were before the war began in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise once again that we do not object to the repatriation of assets for national economic development. We do object to them if the dis-saving is excessive, having regard to all the circumstances and having regard to world conditions.  That is, as I have said, a dull, ordinary, sound, middle-path statement, and is intended to be so, and it is not intended to be exaggerated in one way or the other.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal this evening about the restriction of bank credit.  I do not know what Deputies mean when they discuss restriction of bank credit.  Advances from the banks went up by 20 per cent. from December 1950, to 1951 and, as far as I know, although the prices of some commodities went up by more than 20 per cent. others went up by less than 20 per cent.  If I remember rightly, the increase in wholesale prices was something of the order of 10 or 15 per cent. during the same period.  Bank advances have increased since December, 1951, although they have not been published.</P>

      <P>There are the facts. They went up 20 per cent., and the Minister for Finance, if he wishes, when he comes back into the House to reply, can give some more figures showing that, whatever the position, it is not nearly as bad as that described by some Deputies.  That is all I am arguing at the moment.</P>
      <P>In fact, I think some of the attacks that have been made on the banks have been most unscrupulous.  One Deputy, outside this House, said that we have been crucified on the cross of bankers' credit.  It was a most wildly exaggerated statement, made in extremely bad taste, and it gives an entirely false impression to people in this country who are unemployed to some considerable degree owing to excessive stockpiling by the last Government.  To make an excuse that unemployment is caused by that means in the case of a very considerable part of our textile industry is quite unscrupulous and simply leading people up the garden path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that we have heard many <Col N="2309" /> attacks on the banks.  The banks were left intact by the last Government. The last Government regarded them as all right when they were in office, with the exception of certain Ministers when they were making off the record speeches in their unofficial capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Ministers made off the record speeches, attacking the conventional credit policy of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant. The Deputy will at least accept my word.  I intended no other thing than that.  The last Government, in spite of the disinvestment that took place during their period of office, actually managed somehow to invest £33,000,000 abroad in foreign securities.  It would take some time to explain how they managed it.  Although external assets declined, they did manage it, showing that they were not averse to investing money in external securities on a very considerable scale.  The money was <Col N="2310" /> invested with the knowledge of Deputy MacBride, when Minister for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>Deputy D. Costello made, in my opinion, a very able speech which was well worth listening to.  He suggested, in rather virulent terms, that we should have issued a loan during the summer of 1951 or a little bit later.  Is the Deputy not aware of the fact that the National Loan Conversion was effected in that period with some degree of success?  Arrangements were made for the conversion to take place in July, 1951, involving stock to the value of £21,000,000.  It is at least arguable that, with such a major operation pending, the issue of a new loan would have been highly inadvisable. A still further reason, however, makes it quite clear that to borrow in the summer of 1951 would have been a very imprudent venture; both Dublin and Cork Corporations issued stock during that period on more or less attractive terms without much success. Therefore I do not think that any stockbroker or credit expert would blame us for not issuing a loan during recent periods.</P>
      <P>Deputy D. Costello also suggested that it was customary to issue loans around the Budget period.  I would remind him that that is not always the case.  The success of any future loans we issue will depend on the public appreciating that we are determined to restore a sound economy, to make ends meet and to cease living by subterfuges. I feel that some of the people whom we hope will lend us money in the future will not be impressed by the fact that, for the first time in the history of the country, the Opposition have not done their ordinary conventional duty of questioning our items of expenditure and of asking whether Estimates are not capable of pruning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose this House must have one of the few Oppositions in Europe who have not adopted the conventional practice of at least criticising expenditure, although in this case most of the expenditure was devised in 1948, altered in character and degree by the last Government and inherited by this Government, who may alter it slightly. <Col N="2311" /> It is rather peculiar that the Opposition did not question our extravagance in regard to a great many matters. This always provides interesting debating points, and it is a good thing for the national credit to have two points of view expressed and to have a position in the House where the Opposition wants to spend more money than the Government Party and does not even suggest methods of economy.  However, maybe the Opposition Deputies have their own reasons for not adopting this attitude.  I personally feel that it would be better if Deputies questioned expenditure in regard to all sorts of matters.  It would keep us on our toes, whereas, if we continue in this way, there will never be the pressure of public opinion to ensure the efficiency in administration which is so important.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that a respectable Budget will be presented to the nation. We, as a nation, would like to hold our heads high before the world.  We wish to produce all we can, export all we can, pay our debts, and repatriate our assets for purposes of capital development. We are assisting the preservation of sterling to a reasonable degree in our selfish interests and not because of dictation from any one Minister, foreign or otherwise.  We believe in rebuilding our country by the sweat of our brows and not by clever talk and the liquidation of our fundamental resources.  This is a perfectly genuine belief, for which we will be thanked by the Irish people in the future.  We believe in telling our people quite frankly that, at the present time, they are spending a quarter of their time working for the Government&mdash;a quarter of their time is spent earning taxes for the Government.  The amount we can tax is limited, and it can be increased or decreased by a margin.  There is a small group of rich people in this country, about 106 in number, who can be taxed on over £10,000 a year.  Even though there are a small number of rich people and rich communities, the vast proportion of our expenditure is paid for by the ordinary people and by ordinary taxes imposed upon the people of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> We feel we should encourage people to save all they can and, at the same time, to spend reasonably for the preservation of internal trade.  That is a rather dull, ordinary, middle-path economic policy, but it is not intended to frighten the people.  We do not claim to work miracles, end social evils overnight or rapidly expand agricultural production.  We have our own plan which we believe, if implemented, will greatly improve the life of this country.  That is our policy which must be stated in a very balanced way. It is impossible for us to be florid about it or to dramatise it.  We believe in developing our national resources and going ahead with the work left incompleted in 1948.  Part of it was continued by the last Government and part of it, we believe, neglected by them.</P>
    <P>Although the people of this country work for the Government for a quarter of their day, they enjoy a level of expenditure in regard to certain commodities which we feel is reasonable.  We think it is not at all bad going for the people of this country to spend 2/6 out of every £1 of wages on drink and tobacco.  It may indicate to some degree the fact that there was absolute dis-saving in 1951 on the part of the people of this country.  In 1949 the people of this country&mdash;men, women, children and babies&mdash;were spending on an average ? per head per week on drink, tobacco and amusements of various kinds exclusive of tourist expenditure.  Deputies can work out figures as to what the expenditure would be per head if one assumed that certain members of the community spent nothing on drink, tobacco or amusements.  I have given the 1949 figures which must have increased since then.  I made the above statement in a speech recently and I said also that subsidies worked out at 2/- per head per week.  I said this was a matter of consideration for the Government.</P>
    <P>The nutritional report of 1947, which was brought out as a result of the activities of certain doctors and social workers, showed that, where the consumption of food is concerned, we rank the second highest country in the world.  However, the report showed <Col N="2313" /> that while there was an ample supply of food for every household through one means or another, food was not very well balanced in kind or variety in the case of large families earning minimum incomes.  When you have to measure that position and the value of these subsidies against the very high expenditure, which is exclusive of tourist expenditure, I think everybody will agree that the expenditure of ? per week per man, woman and child in this country, exclusive of tourists, on drink, tobacco and amusements, is not too bad.  As I mentioned already, subsidies work out at 2/- per head of the population per week.  I feel it is absolutely true to say that there are large groups in the community not in need of children's allowances or of subsidies.  I simply mention this as a fact which the House should study and examine in considering our whole economic problem.</P>
    <P>One could argue that in the face of that there must be at least some families where that level of subsidy might not be necessary, although one could equally argue the great sociological value of subsidies taken as a whole. No one begrudges people that amusement or some of those items, tobacco, drink and so forth, but Deputies will be fully aware of the fact that, leaving out the cost of services, about which we could argue whether they were capital or current, and taking the purely current expenditure on the basis of the double Budget, as it was published by the last Government, the increased cost of the services inherited by the last Government from us in 1948, and carried on by us now&mdash; altered here and there, but left more or less intact&mdash;is very substantial.  No one will question that the position is serious for us, and when we say that tax will be necessary we are speaking the ordinary truth.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to see how the current services could be maintained without some increase in taxation.  As I say, I cannot prophesy in that connection. I can only give the facts.  Any Deputy who studies the Book of Estimates will see the facts and will know the extent of expenditure involved.  For instance, it will be seen that a large amount is <Col N="2314" /> necessary in connection with social welfare and other measures in the social direction.  There may be other factors, such as the loss on Córas Iompair Éireann and matters about which I have no definite information at the moment.  The current expenditure for services is high enough, so Deputies will realise that we have difficulties in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for keeping the House so long.  I do not know whether I need answer some of the observations of Deputy Dillon.  I do not think that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce need any defence in this House against the abuse poured upon them by Deputy Dillon.  I have that answer for Deputies in this House. If they so wish they can leave this House and wander over any square mile of Irish territory.  They could not wander for a single square mile without finding some evidence of the work done for the reconstruction of this country and its preservation by those three men.  I think that is a better answer than to attempt to reply to the abuse of Deputy Dillon in regard to them.  I will not answer him on the question of Belgium, which would get very far from the matter in hand.  I would suggest that Deputy Dillon and some members of the Opposition ought to agree about tariffs &mdash;he implied he was more restrictive in his attitude towards tariffs but during his period of office the last Government managed to impose a number of tariffs against which I would have thought he would be an ardent speaker, but maybe they managed to resolve their differences in some way or other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made other observations, most of which I answered in connection with the general speech that I have made.  I would like to assure the House, having heard Deputy Davin, that we do not intend to follow blindly the policy of the Tory Government. We certainly do not intend to follow them in regard to their economic policy.</P>
    <P>We have our own and we know perfectly well that it is no use whimpering or banging the table if the British Government ask us in common with all other sterling countries to make some <Col N="2315" /> contribution for the preservation of sterling.  Nobody in the Dáil can suggest that diverting our exports in some other direction would be a satisfactory alternative to making this small and reasonable contribution which we must make, while doing our best and continuing in our national development campaign to the greatest degree possible.  We have both a selfish and an unselfish motive in preserving sterling and when other countries who wish to be as free as ourselves and who are economically as free as ourselves are willing to make some reasonable contribution, we do not think that we are deviating from the position of independence in this country or that it will fundamentally affect the work which we hope to do.</P>
    <P>I will now conclude by saying once more that we in Fianna Fáil are going on with our programme at the rate which we can afford, having regard to all the circumstances.  Whether we are engaged in defence production or whether we are at the perimeter of Europe or in the middle of it, we are affected by all these circumstances. Nevertheless, our programme is continuing at the highest possible level consistent with present conditions and I do not believe that the Irish people would be ashamed of the result of our work or of our progress.  Our national development campaign is going ahead in spite of the difficulties that surround us, which I have tried not to exaggerate but to describe impartially, as I have tried to give a balanced picture of our economic policy and of our methods in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that during the time the speech was being delivered it was heard by at least three of those opposite of the Fianna Fáil Party who are responsible for having the last speaker sitting in a ministerial bench and in a position to deliver the type of speech to which we have just listened.  Did you ever listen to anything delivered with such a degree of smugness; a speech which was largely dishonest, very illinformed, full of inaccuracies, had a considerable amount of misrepresentation, <Col N="2316" /> a deliberate choosing of periods to compare with other periods that would show up statistics that he hoped would benefit the present Government.</P>
      <P>What was running through my mind, and I hope through the minds of those responsible for that type of speech, that mentality and that outlook, was the fact that it was that type of speech, delivered not only in Leinster House but down through this country, that is responsible for the fact that we have to-day 12,000 more persons lining up at the labour exchanges than we had nine months ago.  It is responsible for the fact that there are many more thousands on short time.  It is also responsible for the fact that there is many a working man to-day who has been in secure and well-paid employment for a number of years who does not know but that he is going to receive notice next Saturday.  That is the mentality, the type of speech and the inspiration that we get.</P>
      <P>This gentleman comes in to lecture us as if he were talking to a lot of students from a debating society.  This gentleman wants to talk to us about agriculture, industry, tillage, farming, all of which knowledge he has extracted from statistical abstracts and from the leaflets published by the Department of Agriculture.  I say that that is the type of speech delivered by that Minister, carrying weight only because he is Minister, delivered by the Minister for Finance and delivered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce before he discovered his mistake.  Let it be said to the credit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that when he realised the effect that type of speech was having and was likely to have, he at least had sense enough, intelligence enough and character enough to mend his hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 12,000 additional unemployed, and Deputy McGrath told us to-day it was entirely due to the stockpiling of the previous Government.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs started his speech by telling us that we did not stockpile, and ended by repeating Deputy McGrath's yarn.  The fact of the matter is that, in the three and a half years during which the inter-Party Government sat on the opposite <Col N="2317" /> side of the House, there were more people put into employment in this country than ever in its history and fewer people registered at the employment exchanges than at any time since records were first kept.  Not only were people in employment but they were in full employment and very large numbers were working overtime.  Deputies like Deputy Cogan&mdash;and I mention him only because he has a vote, which, strangely enough, carries as much weight as the vote of anybody else in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not need to go to the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  I will give the Minister a very simple figure from my own county, a figure which I got from the local paper only last Saturday.  After the March fair during the first week of this month, in my home town, 175 railway wagons of cattle were taken away from the fair as against 128 from the corresponding fair of last year.  That carries more weight with me than all the figures poured out by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2320" /> I know, and so do Deputies who have some practical, close and intimate contact with the country, that there are very few articles or commodities produced on an Irish farm to-day which are not showing a profit.  Some of them are showing an infinitely greater profit than others and there is no question whatever that cattle are making prices far in advance of anything we ever dreamed of.  Nobody begrudges that to the farmer, because all of us, no matter whether we sit on this side or the other, will admit that the farmers were entitled to a break, that they had many a long and lean period, but for a Minister to try to juggle with figures so as to suggest&mdash; he could not prove&mdash;that in fact agriculture was worse off now than in 1938 is all sheer nonsense.  This is the gentleman who tells us that Deputy Dillon did not improve the position of agriculture or agricultural output in the slightest.  That statement is made either dishonestly or out of complete ignorance and the Minister can have his choice.  There is no Deputy who believes that.  Whatever may be said for any other section of our community, so far as agriculture and rural Ireland are concerned, they are to-day enjoying a measure of prosperity such as very few people believed, or for a moment thought, would be achieved in our lifetime.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped the market we had would be retained.  I hope so, too.  I want to remind the House that that prosperity and steadiness in prices for agricultural produce, and particularly for live stock, is based on the 1948 agreement.  I know that speakers on the opposite side of the House have derided that agreement. I know that the <i>Irish Press</i> has said that we would be better off without it, but it is a remarkable fact that neither the <i>Irish Press</i> nor the present Government have the slightest intention of terminating it this year when it can be terminated, and, mind you, I give them full credit for that.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Deputies who were sitting behind the Minister, particularly for the last 20 minutes of his speech, were feeling happy about the line he was pursuing.  I doubt it very much, indeed.  I am sorry&mdash;and I mean this&mdash;<Col N="2321" /> that this debate, which should be one of the most important and serious debates in this House in any year, but particularly this year, should have been introduced and carried on up to the present moment&mdash;and I am including myself&mdash;in the way, the spirit and the atmosphere in which it has been carried on.  It is to be regretted, and very much regretted, that the Vote on Account was introduced in the manner in which it was introduced by the Minister for Finance.  He was provocative, aggressive and challenging, and tried to provoke as far as he possibly could the people on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, notwithstanding the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that we are in the middle of a first-class crisis; I do not believe that we are facing bankruptcy; I do not believe, as he said a moment ago, that we are rapidly becoming a debtor nation.  Just imagine that statement from the Government Benches from a person who is supposed to be a responsible Minister.  There are problems&mdash; very serious problems.  There is the problem of a lack of stability and a feeling of uneasiness.  There is more than a feeling of uneasiness among those who are unemployed but there is uneasiness among those who are employed and who do not know how soon they may be under-employed or unemployed. Deputies with more knowledge of conditions in the country than the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had to listen to him trying to put across the House that there would be bankruptcy and that bank issues had increased by 20 per cent.  Is there any Deputy in this House, whether he comes from the City of Dublin, a provincial town or a rural area, who is not perfectly conscious of the fact that there has been and is a policy of restriction?  Is there any Deputy in this House who is in touch with business people who is not aware that there is extreme uneasiness among them as to whether they will be able to finance their business?  Does anybody suggest for a moment that we still have, as a result of the speeches to which I have already referred, that stability, that faith in the future of the country which we had 12 <Col N="2322" /> months ago?  It is not there.  It has gone.  I believe that it can be restored and I hope that it will.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to throw off whatever blame may attach to myself, but I would prefer if this whole matter were discussed in a more dispassionate and objective way.  While I do not subscribe for a moment to the exaggerated views put forward by certain Ministers, I do not blind myself to the view that there are problems, and serious problems.  If these problems at all approach the serious level about which Ministers have spoken, is that the time for the Minister for Finance to speak in the provocative way in which he did speak?  Is that the time for the Minister to try to distort, belittle and abuse the work which was done by his predecessors?  In the same debate other Ministers tell us that the Government itself can do nothing or very little, that it can succeed in dealing with these problems and in finding solutions for them only by getting the full support of all the people and all the Parties in the House.  What we must remember, of course, is that that appeal for co-operation, assistance and goodwill comes from a Party that has consistently refused to co-operate with any section of this country either outside the House or inside it.  I venture to say that if there are real problems, real troubles or any real dangers facing the country, people of all sides of the House will be prepared to come together and give of their best to meet them.  There is no question about that. That was demonstrated more than once in this House before.  It has been demonstrated more than once that when unified action is not merely desirable but absolutely necessary to get the proper results, unified action can be got, but if we are to have co-operation and unity in dealing with national problems, then there must be a certain basis for that in justice and in fair play, not a unity and co-operation the terms of which are to be dictated and the operation of which is to be completely dominated by one man.</P>
    <P>I know a good deal more about unemployment, what it means and what it leads to than, perhaps, the Minister <Col N="2323" /> for Posts and Telegraphs.  I was closer to it all my life and in more intimate contact with it than many members of this House.  I suppose that I have spoken on the question of unemployment and on behalf of the unemployed more than any other member and over a longer period.  I do not believe that it is a pleasure to any member of the House to see the number of unemployed growing, but if I am asked to make the choice&mdash;and that, in effect, was what I was asked by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;between maintaining or increasing our sterling reserves while increasing the numbers in the labour exchanges, which nowadays are very largely the canals to employment on the other side, and maintaining our people here in employment, then my choice is an easy one. Deputies supporting the Government know this statement to be true: the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tried to suggest to the House that, in so far as moneys were repatriated, those moneys were not used for schemes of national development; that statement is not true.  I have yet to discover&mdash;and I am no socialist or communist and I do not want any lectures from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on private enterprise&mdash;that our sheet anchor of safety as a nation lies in increasing our sterling assets from £400,000,000 or whatever they may be at the moment to £600,000,000 or £700,000,000, that it is any guarantee of our future credit-worthiness.  This nation is not a debtor nation.  It is a creditor nation and will remain a creditor nation, and all the juggling and misrepresentation in regard to imports and exports indulged in by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his cheap little way will not alter that fact.</P>
    <P>What are the real assets of this country?  They are quite simple.  It is not for me to follow the lead of the Minister and lecture the House on things which are obvious to everybody. We talk about there being no increase in production in the country.  I do not care what anybody says, I do not care what organisation issues statistics, we cannot believe for one moment that industrially and agriculturally there is <Col N="2324" /> not more production in this country. That is not saying that there is enough.  That is quite a different matter.  There is not enough.  So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think I speak for my whole Party&mdash;I am as anxious as anyone on the opposite benches to see the farmers of this country produce the maximum amount of food.  We always preached that the best way was to grow what would feed our own, both human and animal, but I do not want anybody to run away or be misled by this talk about the acreage under wheat being reduced by so many acres. That does not necessarily mean that you have fewer barrels of wheat at the end of the year.  I know that.  During the war I saw that.  I sold and supplied seed wheat.  I saw where people in the mountains of my native county were compelled to sow seed wheat and you might as well sow it in the middle of Kildare Street for all you would get out of it.  That was counted as acreage. There is not any Deputy in the House who has any contact with or knowledge of rural Ireland who does not know that that is true.</P>
    <P>I know equally well that some of the owners of the best and richest land in this country failed in their duty to the nation at that period.  There is no question about it.  I believe that our farmers can be induced to grow their requirements.  I doubt very much whether farmers, with the best will in the world, could give or can give us our entire requirements of wheat.  I doubt that very much.  I grant you that they can give us considerably more than they are giving us, but the question of providing the essential food for the nation should not be a matter of by-play and smart talk in this House.  It should not be seized upon on every occasion by certain Deputies, like Deputy Cogan, in order to pay off old scores against Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Cogan has got Deputy Dillon badly on the brain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>75,000 unemployed. It is a remarkable thing that, notwithstanding all the development for the last 25 years, all the factories about which Deputy McGrath spoke this afternoon&mdash;I do not want to be taken as trying to belittle the factories &mdash;notwithstanding all our increased prosperity, all out mechanisation, all our improved methods and increased standard of living which has increased enormously even if we had to start very low, we nearly have as many registered unemployed to-day as we had 25 years ago.  That is something we ought to think about.</P>
      <P>I have a lot of notes here, Sir.  I do not intend to use them now as there will be other occasions for that.  This Government tells us that there is going to be a gap of £50,000,000.  They have told us it can only be met by taxation.  I do not believe that and I do not believe they believe it.  I do not even purport to understand their motives but if there is to be any heavy increase in taxation we will not be talking this time 12 months about 12,000 additional unemployed and we will not be talking about the cost of living.  We will have an unemployed roll that will far exceed anything we had since the State was founded and Fianna Fáil will not have the excuse of stockpiling.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacGrath spoke about our flooding the country with goods.  He ought to remember 1947.  I can tell the Deputy that the country was flooded with worsteds, woollens, wearing apparel and footwear to an infinitely greater extent than at any period since.  Let me remind the Deputy that the quota for footwear alone for 1947 was no fewer than 1,200,000 pairs. That had been reduced to 20,000 pairs by the time the inter-Party Government left office and for the first time the entire home market in footwear had been given over to the Irish footwear factories.  I do not want to go back on all this.  I do not even want to waste the time of the House in taking up the question of fuel with the Deputy.  I am just telling the Deputy what the position was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy believes, and I accept that he does believe, what he said about the fuel situation in Cork City <Col N="2327" /> then he has been completely misinformed or, alternatively, I was completely misinformed&mdash;and, frankly, I doubt that.  So long as there were 9,500 tons of coal in the dumps in Cork there was no reason whatever why it should not have been distributed. The only point was that the retailers were not prepared to pay the price for it.  That was the only thing&mdash; because we were anxious to sell it.  We were doing all in our power to sell it. But you cannot have it both ways.  One Fianna Fáil leader in the other House accused me last week of running down the price and of giving the stuff away for nothing.  Now I am accused of holding out for such a high price that the retailers would not pay it and, therefore, would not take the coal into stock.  That is not true.  I told them to give that turf to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or any other charitable organisation that would take it away because I could not sell it at any price. The fact of the matter is that nobody would take it free because it would cost more to remove it than it was worth.  The Deputy himself told me this evening that, in fact, it cost £20,000 to remove it.</P>

      <P>I cannot remember the date but I think it was either in the first or the second year we were in office.  I would remind the House that that was something that I inherited. Remember, the grass was growing on it before I became Minister.  Remember also, when we hear the type of cheap talk we heard in the Seanad last week, and which sometimes goes on here, that there were 350,000 tons of it in the Phoenix Park which was beginning to be swept down the main road. There was coal there, too, which seeped through into the lake there and killed every fish in it.  We have a sum of £3,000,000 for it here now&mdash;and Fianna Fáil are trying to beat the inter-Party Government with that stick.  Will Deputies who know the country and something about turf tell me how long those clamps of turf would have remained there?  Remember, it was costing almost as much, if not more, to remark and rebuild these clamps, as a result of weather conditions, as it was costing to pay the men to produce the turf in the bogs.  I know something about turf and I will not be lectured on that subject by anybody on the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>

      <P>Of course, they will keep bringing this up.  I said here before that I was not prepared to blame my predecessor or the Fianna Fáil Government for laying in these stocks. Anybody who remembers the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947 could not be blamed for doing so.  When Deputy McGrath talks about the winter of 1950 I should like him to cast his mind back to the provision made for the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947. We will not go back on that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over a considerable number of subjects even in the short time we have been discussing the Vote on Account.  It has helped to give a number of important pointers which the Minister, I hope, will find of value when coming to the consideration of the Budget and the policy on which that Budget must be founded.  The contributions from both sides of the House have been of help.  The contribution, in the first instance, of the Minister for Finance <Col N="2330" /> in introducing the Vote, could not have been particularly enlightening beyond a statement of the case for the consideration of the House.</P>
      <P>I was, however, rather concerned at the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs' treatment of the problem.  Admittedly, he was particularly careful to confine himself to verifiable and factual statistics which, I have no doubt, were of a non-controversial nature.  But he made some comments or drew some conclusions from those statistics which appeared, to me at any rate, to suggest that the implications of those statistics upon the lives of our citizens did not appear to have penetrated very deeply into his political conscience.  He said &mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash; that we could go on for some considerable time without feeling the effects of outside influence.  It would be a very serious thing indeed were these sentiments to be shared to any extent by his colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>It has been emphasised by the Opposition that the position is extremely serious at present, and I believe that we have gone long past the time when one could say that we have yet to feel the effects of outside influences. There is at present a very high level of unemployment.  Both sides of the House deplore this unemployment, and I do think it very wrong of the Minister so to confuse himself or to blink facts to that extent, in order to bolster up his case.  I suggest that it would be much better for him to admit the facts and the conclusions from the many statistics that he produced, and then provide for the House a solution to the problem.  Listening to both sides, I have, as I said at the beginning, been considerably assisted in my attitude as a most fervent and unrepentant believer in what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs describes as a high-level planned economy, a political philosophy usually associated with what has been described as the achievements of the welfare state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a completely unrepentant believer, as I have said, in the conception of a Government that can so organise the activities of its Ministers and Departments of State by intelligent <Col N="2331" /> anticipatory planning for the future that by such planned co-ordination of the different Departments, particularly Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Finance, it can ensure that the weaker sections of the community&mdash;the very young, the very old, the poor and the sick&mdash;shall, out of the community purse, be cushioned against the effects of the accidents of life in modern society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made some slighting references to the chaos in Great Britain, following the activities of the Labour Government, but he made no references whatever to the tremendous achievements of that Government.  He made no attempt to deal with the tremendously beneficial results which have accrued to the ordinary people of Great Britain as a result of the activities of the Labour Government's few short years in office.  Equally I would suggest he was not being completely fair when he attributed the blame for Britain's present economic troubles to the activities of the Labour Government.  It is quite obvious to everyone that their preoccupation with a defence economy, forced on them by the particular policies which they have followed, made it practically impossible for them to achieve a balanced economy and to live the normal life of a modern State.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, contrary to the Minister's views, we shall have a Government here who will be prepared to copy, not only the Tory Government in England, which he says is much too far ahead of us, but also that we shall have a Government here which will have the courage, the self-confidence and the sense of social responsibility to want to copy, in the years to come, as many as possible of the achievements of Labour Governments in Great Britain, New Zealand, Sweden and other progressive nations.  I believe that we are now passing through a very important phase in the evolution of the development of our State.</P>
    <P>Tremendous contributions have been made by the older generations of politicians on both sides of the House to the achievement of our present status.  When physical courage and <Col N="2332" /> idealism were required, they were freely without question forthcoming from those politicians, many of whom are here present now.  The territorial or political freedom which we at present possess we owe to their sacrifices, and we in our generation should try to achieve economic independence and the establishment of a State in which there will be a modicum of social justice for the underprivileged in all sections of society.</P>
    <P>I believe that since the foundation of the State three very considerable contributions have been made to our economic independence for which individual members of this House were largely responsible.  The first development provided power for industries and for domestic life.  For that I think we must pay tribute to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash; Deputy McGilligan.  He was apparently the first to realise the importance of the development of hydro-electric power.  He developed the scheme despite the attitude of those who doubted the possibilities of its success.</P>
    <P>I believe that the next contribution of value was made by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, again in relation to industry and power.  I refer to the development of peat as a source of power for our industries and as a fuel to meet our domestic requirements.  We owe a considerable measure of the development which has taken place to the Minister, together, of course, with his development of industries.  It is quite obvious that mass production is now creating a situation which our industries will have to face.  That, I suggest, is a most important consideration for them since it is possible for modern mechanised industry to produce sufficient in one week to meet the requirements of our whole State.  If, for example, Solus Teo were to introduce the most highly mechanised bulb-producing machinery into its factory it would be able to satisfy the requirements of our whole market in a matter of weeks, and then, of necessity, would have to close down. It is obvious, I think, that if our industries are to go ahead and to justify themselves they must accept <Col N="2333" /> this development of mechanisation.  It will demand from them that they will have to budget for an export economy and when you budget for an export economy in industry you are budgeting for competition against the United States, Great Britain and other countries.  That is a problem which is facing the Minister.  It is one which, I am quite certain, he is completely capable of handling and of dealing with to the satisfaction of both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, the former Taoiseach, in the course of his contribution referred to the necessity of showing our gratitude to the United States of America for the assistance which they had given to us in the last few years. I should like to add my vote of thanks for the loan and the grant moneys which they made available to us.  At the same time, we must surely keep our minds clear as to the reasons why this money was made available.  We should suffer no illusion that it was done because of any particular concern which America had for our security, well-being or general prosperity. Recent events in connection with the Mutual Security Act have shown that there is a purpose, and was a purpose, behind the American intervention, as an international moneylender, to give us this large help.  Mr. Truman has recently been very clear and candid on that point.  He has told us that the reason why they came over and helped was because they could then draw upon the tremendous man-power in Europe in case they had to decide to go to war.  I think that the Government have taken a very wise step in refusing to enter into any commitments either with the east or the west, that we should do our best to maintain our neutrality and economic independence, and that we should pursue our own life in our own way and as free as we can from outside commitments or interference.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the British sent over their recruiting agents here. In order to build up their armies and to increase their strength, they took our young men to fight in their wars and to build up their empire.  Now, we are seeing the American dollars <Col N="2334" /> being sent across for a similar purpose. I, at any rate, would endorse the attitude of the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I believe that this Budget can be a most important turning point in the development of our State as an independent democratic Republic, working towards the integrity of the country as a whole.  But I cannot see how we can possibly develop a sound economy with the present policy.  Let me add that, in my view, it is no different from the policy which, generally speaking, has been pursued by two Governments since the inception of the State, with the exception of what was done by individual Ministers.  In my anxiety to develop the social services aspect of Government through the health services by better living conditions, with provision for widows and orphans and so on, I found that one of my troubles was that in the absence of a real prosperous agricultural economy the drive towards the balancing of the books of the nation could not be properly developed. To-night the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave us copious figures. These showed that there has been little if any improvement in agricultural production since 1938, 1944 or whatever year it was.  Deputy Dillon tried to prove the contrary.  The main point, however, which arose from the debate was this, that there has been no appreciable change in the level of agricultural productivity over the last 25 or 30 years.  I could give figures but the House has been pretty well sated with figures, and so I shall not dwell on that particular point.  It is quite obvious to anybody passing through from east to west or north to south of the country that Ireland is not producing anything like the maximum output of which the land is capable.</P>
    <P>I believe a courageous Minister for Agriculture is more necessary than any other single Minister in the Government. A Minister for Industry and Commerce will always largely be confined within the limits of tariff walls, quota restrictions and other penal impositions on imports.  Every nation has to take such measures as a protection. We do it ourselves.  At the end <Col N="2335" /> of the next ten or 15 years the only single valid international currency will be food.  Indeed, food is almost the only currency at the moment.  Anything, therefore, that we can produce off the land stands a good chance of being disposed of at fairly remunerative prices in the international markets both to-day and in the future.  Other nations less fortunate than ours are at present committed to spend their agricultural man-power, transferred into industry, in building up a defence programme.  We, on the other hand, have an opportunity of developing our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>A courageous policy in relation to agriculture is essential, and an agricultural survey of every county should be carried out in order to assess the optimum productivity of the land.  It should be instilled into the farming community that they hold the land in trust for the people and it is their duty to increase the productivity of their land to the maximum of which it is capable.  Before we can have a well-balanced economy the farmers must be given to understand that unless they are prepared to take on the responsibility of developing their holdings to their maximum the Government will have to take control and re-allocate the land to those who are prepared to make the best use of it.  Compensate the dispossessed holders, by all means, but ensure at all times that the land is so worked as to give its maximum productivity.</P>
    <P>If one travels from one end of the country to the other one sees vast acres untilled and untouched by the hand of man.  These grazing-areas are capable of a tremendous degree of production if properly and conscientiously worked.  Again, there should be&mdash;and this will require the courage of a strong Government willing to face the realities of the situation&mdash;an end to the conacre system.  I am well aware that such a move would not be vote-catching from the political point of view, to say the least of it, but we should not delude ourselves.  The time will come, perhaps not immediately, when we will see an end to dialectics here in this Assembly and get down at <Col N="2336" /> last to the real problem of providing solutions to the many evils and ills which afflict our society at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us that he has a long-term policy, but he did not tell us what that policy is.  It is about time we showed a little more faith in the intelligence and understanding of our people, and a little less of the &ldquo;Hush, hush, secret weapon&rdquo; attitude towards the solution of these evils.  Both sides to-night, and on previous occasions, have illustrated clearly and effectively in the figures of under-production, the absolute bankruptey, lack of courage, lack of determination to face the realities of the position as we see it, and the failure to get down to a really effective policy of providing the balanced economy this country so sorely needs; that is, an economy which, looking ahead for ten, 15 or 20 years, the ordinary common-sense farmer or business man will be willing to accept for the improvement of his own enterprise or his own farm.</P>
    <P>How, in God's name, can any country continue to proceed with a lackadaisical <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude towards the serious problems confronting it?  The Minister referred to a figure of 70,000 in relation to unemployment and a current 25,000 emigrating or, as I used to interject in the inter-Party Government, 50,000 unemployed and 20,000 emigrating.  We have no right in face of that to feel complacent or self-satisfied.  We have no right to feel that we are achieving anything like the degree of intelligent Government for which so many paid such high sacrifice 30 and 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Courage is necessary.  It is easy to mouth platitudes.  It is easy to hurl accusations from one side of the House to the other: &ldquo;You did this,&rdquo;&ldquo;Why did you not do that?&rdquo; and &ldquo;We will do something else when we get back.&rdquo; The fact of the matter is that the statistics quoted by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and by Deputy Dillon together with the figures for unemployment and emigration, show there has been no constructively coherent collective policy directed towards ending the common ills that <Col N="2337" /> afflict the modern State.  There is a planned economy in New Zealand and Sweden.</P>
    <P>There was a planned economy for a few years under the Labour Government in Great Britain, and that Government achieved many things. Though I may be the only one here prepared to come forward and declare that I believe this to be the only solution to our problems, I can wait, because I feel sure that, in time, it will be borne in upon the people here and outside that our native Governments have failed in the last 30 years to order or govern the State, as it was their duty and their responsibility so to govern and order.  I move to report progress.</P>
