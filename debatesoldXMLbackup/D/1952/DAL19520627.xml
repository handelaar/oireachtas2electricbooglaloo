      <P>It is proposed to take business as set out in the Order Paper in the following order: Nos. 2, 5 (Votes 60 to 66, inclusive), 6, 8, 9 and 10.  It is proposed that the consideration of Public Business be not interrupted to take Private Deputies' Business.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interfere with a Government decision in regard to the Order of Business because I am aware that under Standing Orders they are entitled to make that decision.  However, I must protest against the fact that Votes 8, 9 and 10 are being delayed.  These three Votes are very important to rural Deputies.  Vote 8 was introduced last night.  It is proposed that to-day the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare will be discussed.  That Estimate will be under discussion in this House for the next two or three weeks. At the end of that time we shall go back and take Votes 8, 9 and 10.  It is most unfair and it should not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £264,040 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for my Department, which I now submit to the Dáil, were prepared without reference to the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Act, 1952, which became law on the 14th of this month.  As a result of those Acts, certain Supplementary Estimates will be required for the current financial year, in addition to the Estimates now before the House, in order to provide the increased amounts which will become payable as from the beginning of July, to the recipients of old age and blind pensions, children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and sickness and disablement benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts.  I will, however, deal briefly first with the Estimates for 1952-53 as originally prepared, and then refer to the Supplementary Estimate for children's allowances, which is also before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a net increase on all seven Votes of £595,330 as compared with the amounts provided for 1951-52.  This is more than accounted for by an increase of £713,000 in the Vote for old age pensions which is due to the fact that the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1951, which increased the rates of old age and blind pensions, will operate for the full year as against a half-year in 1951-52.  A Supplementary Estimate will be required later in <Col N="1794" /> the year in order to provide for the increased payments arising out of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £64,000 in the Estimate for Children's Allowances as originally prepared.  This increase is a normal feature of this Vote.  I will deal later with the Supplementary Estimate for this service, which I am also presenting to the House now.</P>
    <P>The Vote for National Health Insurance shows an increase of £18,990, which is due to an increase in expenditure on treatment benefits, such as dental, optical and hospital benefits. The increased amount payable by the Exchequer in respect of national health insurance benefits under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, will have to be provided later by means of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The four remaining Estimates, as now presented, all show decreases for 1952-53 as compared with 1951-52. These Estimates are those for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and miscellaneous social welfare services.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the net amount required for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare in 1952-53, as compared with 1951-52, is £44,520.  The provision shown in the Book of Estimates for this Vote for the year 1951-52 included, however, an amount paid in that year but applicable to the previous year in respect of the increased salaries awarded to civil servants in 1951.  If adjustment is made for this, the amount required under this Vote for 1952-53 is approximately the same as for 1951-52.</P>
    <P>The decrease in the amount required for the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance for 1952-53 as compared with 1951-52 is £103,300.  This is due mainly to the fact that the amount included for unemployment assistance in 1952-53 in the Estimate now before the House is £92,000 less than the corresponding amount in the Estimate for 1951-52.  Owing to expenditure on unemployment assistance in 1951-52 being less than expected, there was a substantial saving under this sub-head of <Col N="1795" /> the Vote and, accordingly, a somewhat reduced provision was made for 1952-53.  This Estimate will have to be increased later in the light of the recent Act.</P>
    <P>The third Vote on which there is a decrease in 1952-53 as compared with 1951-52 is that for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The decrease amounts to £15,040 and is due to an estimated drop in expenditure on noncontributory pensions in 1952-53 as compared with 1951-52 which would have been realised had not the position been changed by the 1952 Act. This Estimate will also require review at a later date.</P>
    <P>The last Vote on which there is a decrease is that for miscellaneous social welfare services and the amount of the decrease in 1952-53 as compared with 1951-52 is £37,800.  This decrease is due mainly to the fact that the amount provided in 1952-53 in respect of grants towards the supply of fuel for necessitous families is £40,000 less than the amount provided in 1951-52.  The smaller amount required in 1952-53 arises from the fact that provision was made in the Estimate for 1951-52 for the accumulation of a special reserve of fuel by the Dublin Board of Assistance to meet any difficulty which might be created by a break down in deliveries of fuel to the Dublin area during the winter period.  This special provision does not require to be repeated in 1952-53.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with all the Estimates as they are being presented to the House and have drawn attention to those for which Supplementary Estimates will be required later as a result of the enactment of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Children's Allowances is required early owing to the fact that an additional sum of over £2,000,000 is required for this service this year in order to pay the allowance for the second child and the increased allowances for the third and subsequent children which are provided for in the Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> I am, therefore, presenting this Supplementary Estimate to the House now along with the original Estimate for Children's Allowances in order that sufficient money may be made available to carry on this service up to the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The remaining Supplementary Estimates to which I have referred are not so urgent and will be presented later. I ask the House to approve of the Estimates and the Supplementary Estimate before it, and if there is any further information required by Deputies on any of these Votes I shall endeavour to supply it when replying to the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the emphasis on the last portion of the Minister's speech indicated that he was only taking the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of social welfare were discussed in this House during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, Children's Allowances Bill and other aspects of social legislation which we had an opportunity of reviewing recently.  It is not, therefore, necessary or desirable to travel over the same ground again.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a few administrative matters that I would like to raise with a view to focusing attention on these problems and in the hope that the Minister will give attention to them during the ensuing year.</P>
      <P>I noticed in the Press during the past week references to the praiseworthy endeavours of high-minded people to provide some means whereby aged persons might be enabled to get more enjoyment from the winter years of their lives.  Efforts in that direction were initiated in Dublin about two years ago, when, as I said, high-minded people organised the Geriatrics Society with a view to providing certain amenities for elderly people.  I think that is a praiseworthy endeavour and that the State should lend its assistance in every possible way in order to further a movement of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> Department of Social Welfare, I was anxious to blaze a trail in one aspect of that work which was to make available to our aged people free access to the cinemas or, at all events, access to the cinemas at a nominal charge.  For that purpose I saw, at my request, the secretary of the Cinema Owners' Association and put to him the consideration that cinemas ought not to be regarded only as a means of earning a dividend for those who invest money in them but that cinemas had a very valuable and growing social use and that those who own cinemas ought to be willing to demonstrate their desire to share with less fortunate citizens, particularly aged persons, the enjoyment which it is now accepted the cinemas provide for virtually the entire population of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the proposal which I then made was sympathetically received, at all events, by the official with whom I discussed the matter but, of course, he had no authority to say anything from his principals in defence of it at that time.  My view was that the cinema proprietors in Dublin and in the country might make arrangements whereby old age pensioners would be permitted to attend cinema performances at certain times of the day when the cinemas were not normally used by cinema-going patrons, either free of charge or at a nominal charge. I felt that that would not be a heavy burden on the cinema proprietors.  I did not intend that the old age pensioners should sit out the full cinema programme.  What I had in mind was that the cinema proprietors would put on a show for an hour or an hour and a half.  It need not be the latest picture, the hottest picture or the most exciting picture.  I felt that free admission to that show could be granted on one day per week or on all days per week to old age pensioners.  In that way, it seemed to me, that the cinema proprietors would be making a very valuable contribution to organise leisure for elderly people, that they would be demonstrating their desirability of sharing the social benefits of the cinema with the less fortunate sections of the community and that, at the same time, they would be <Col N="1798" /> providing a very valuable source of recreation for a section of the community which I feel is entitled to every practical sympathy which we can give them.  There would be virtually no cost involved for the cinema proprietors, and it would be a very great boon indeed, if they would permit the aged people to have access to cinemas, either free of charge or at a very nominal rate.</P>
    <P>I felt that there would be no difficulty in having old age pensioners recognised; the Department could quite easily associate with the old age pension book some form of identification which would ensure that abuse was kept to an absolute minimum.  I do not know whether anything has been done since in that field.  I do not know whether the Minister or the cinema proprietors have come back on the proposition which was made to them.  If there have been no developments in the meantime, I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to the possibility of using his good offices in that field in the hope that we can provide that amenity for our old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I would like to raise on this Estimate concerns the position of managers of branch employment offices.  The Department of Industry and Commerce previously and now the Department of Social Welfare staff a number of employment exchanges throughout the country which are run by persons who are not civil servants.  These offices number about 90 in all, and they are called branch employment offices. Whoever is appointed to the office has the responsibility of running it for an inclusive fee which is based upon the volume of transactions in the office.  It means that where a person is a manager of a branch employment office, his salary is highest where the unemployment is greatest.  While everybody ought to welcome a diminution in unemployment, so far as a branch manager is concerned, that would be the worst catastrophe that could happen to him, because he is paid in accordance with the number of people unemployed.  If, therefore, unemployment is substantially reduced or <Col N="1799" /> abolished, the office of the branch manager is either abolished or his salary is reduced to microscopic proportions.  That appears to me to be a vicious method of employment.  It is certainly a complete negation of everything that employment exchanges were originally created for.  On the Continent, where, of course, employment exchanges are in existence longer than they are here, such offices are known as placing offices.  They place people who are out of employment.  The general intention underlying our unemployment exchange system was to endeavour to place unemployed persons in employment.  However, so far as the manager of a branch employment office is concerned, if he manages to place a substantial number of people who are registered as unemployed at his office in posts his salary stands in dire danger of being reduced.</P>
    <P>Not only are these managers notoriously underpaid, but the whole system under which they are employed is vicious.  It is most unfair that a man should have his wages computed on the basis that the more people he has registered, the more salary he will get, and that when the number registered falls, his salary will fall accordingly. Clearly it is no encouragement to a manager to try to place those registered in his office in employment when the fact of placing them will reduce his salary.  The basis of such a contract with the manager seems to me to depart from every decent standard.</P>
    <P>When I introduced my comprehensive Social Welfare Bill which, of course, provided much wider services than the present one does, I contemplated taking the managers of branch employment offices into the direct employment of the State.  That is, I proposed to absorb into the Civil Service proper those managers who could be certified to be giving full time to their employment offices.  I had in mind absorbing those managers into the Civil Service either in an established capacity, or, if that were not possible, in an unestablished capacity. I had contemplated paying them on the basis of being regular civil servants, not on the basis of the number <Col N="1800" /> of persons who were registered at their offices, and encouraging them all the time, to ensure that, as far as possible, those who were registered at their offices would be placed in employment.  The manager would be placing unemployed persons in posts in the knowledge that, by doing so, he was not in danger of getting a cut in his salary.  I feel there would follow from a re-grading of that kind better administration in branch employment offices and better supervision of the whole unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any intentions along that line, but it is a problem which cannot be postponed indefinitely.  I would strongly urge the Minister, if he has not already done so, to examine the problem with a view to abolishing the present rate of remuneration, which I look on as vicious in its whole conception, and with a view to absorbing managers of branch employment offices into the Civil Service and regarding them as regular officers of the Civil Service.  I know, of course, that it will be argued, particularly by the Department of Finance, that such an arrangement would mean more costly running of branch employment offices.  Of course, it would mean more costly running of these offices.  It always costs money to abolish slavery, and to do the thing decently.  However, increased cost is no justification for maintaining a system of employment and remuneration which cannot be defended by reference to any decent standard.  If it costs more to run branch employment offices, by reason of having them staffed by regular civil servants, then, I feel, that the community will have the compensation of knowing that these offices will be administered better, that there will be better supervision in those offices, and that factors of an undesirable character which grew up under the present system can be eliminated.  Staffing by civil servants would quickly kill many of the difficulties which are inseperable from the present method of staffing these employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>There are in the Department of When I had responsibility for the <Col N="1801" /> Social Welfare quite a considerable number of temporary clerks.  These are officers who are employed in the main at employment exchanges throughout the country.  They are the direct employees of the Department and many of them have been employed there for a considerable number of years.  When I was in the Department of Social Welfare I was anxious to do something to provide these officers with an opportunity of securing established appointments.  With that object in view, and in order to overcome the difficulties presented by the Civil Service Regulation Acts, I arranged for an examination to be held with a view to providing the temporary officers concerned with an opportunity of securing established appointments. The examination was, in fact, held for a certain number of vacancies but with the hope that the number of successful candidates could be extended and that established appointments could be provided for a considerably greater number of officers than those who qualified for the vacancies actually advertised.  I do not know whether the Minister has since called any additional candidates from that examination but it is a problem which ought to be tackled with some sympathy and understanding.  It is not fair that those who have been employed for a great many years should continue to remain in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>In the case of those who competed in the examination and who demonstrated their educational suitability for established appointments, the Minister should make special arrangements to have those temporary officers called for established appointments and thus recognise the long and faithful service they have given to the State.  There is a considerable number of these temporary officers in Dublin and there is quite a number of them at employment exchanges throughout the country.  It is a problem which will ultimately have to be tackled comprehensively and now that the Minister has got through his Social Welfare Bill, which ought to provide expanding opportunities for employment in the Department, I hope he will lose no time in dealing with that problem and that he will find it <Col N="1802" /> possible to hold out hope to those who qualified in the last examination that established appointments will be forthcoming for them, even though it may be some little time before the Department would be able to absorb them directly on to the established class.</P>
    <P>One other matter I wish to raise is this question of decentralisation.  When the present Minister was on the Opposition Benches two, three and four years ago, he suddenly developed a passion for decentralisation; so did some of his colleagues, notably those from Cork and Galway.  At that time everybody was bursting to have the Department of Social Welfare transferred either to Cork or Galway without, of course, the slightest regard for anybody who worked in the Department of Social Welfare.  I assume from that that the fertile notions which the Minister had in 1949 and 1950 of uprooting the Department of Social Welfare from Dublin and transplanting it in some hallowed spot in Cork or Galway have by now fertilised into a master scheme for the transfer of the Department to either of those cities.  The Minister has had 12 months now in which to meditate upon this master plan which we saw only in its embryonic stages about three years ago.  No doubt he has filled in all the blanks during the past 12 months and he now contemplates, with the power at his disposal, transferring the Department to various cities or perhaps to one city outside Dublin, so as to prevent this monster of centralisation smothering the citizens of this city.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now tell us on this Estimate what he has done during the past 12 months to give effect to the decentralisation notions which he unfolded in this House a few years ago, how far he has got with the plan of decentralisation, what notice will be given to the staff of the Department of Social Welfare as to the date upon which they will be transferred, either to Galway or to Cork, and what accommodation will be provided for them in the way of housing?  He might also tell us what opportunities they will get to bid good-bye and make all the necessary family arrangements in respect to those members of the family <Col N="1803" /> who cannot probably be transferred when this scheme of decentralisation is operated.  Now that the Minister has the power to implement the decentralisation scheme we ought to have from him on this Vote some idea as to when this scheme will reach maturity and when this mass transfer of the Department is likely to take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of decentralisation raised by Deputy Norton and the facilities to be given in other cities to members of the staff who may be transferred, I am sure Deputy Norton realises that many of those employed in the Department would merely be going home.  There are many applications from time to time of that nature.  However, that point aside, it would be desirable at times, in connection with matters which have to come to headquarters to be dealt with, that the local managers and the officials would have more power to make quick decisions on matters that dealt with local problems.  In many cases it is pure waste of time and causes inconvenience to the persons concerned to be referring all matters to headquarters.  Once a general policy is determined the local officers should get more authority to deal with these problems they meet with from day to day.</P>
      <P>On the question of salaries of unestablished officers to which Deputy Norton referred, there is a point in what he says.  Too often we have a number of those unestablished officers in various Government Departments who, perhaps, eke out an existence well enough until they have come to their declining years, but then when it comes to the matter of pension and all the rest they suffer very serious disabilities.</P>
      <P>As far as possible officers who go full-time, or very nearly full-time, in the Civil Service should be established and, thereby, have their future secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undesirable that salaries should be based on the number of unemployed in a particular area.  Many are unemployed to-day really because of a change of system, and are for that reason deserving of very special consideration. <Col N="1804" />  In many of our employment exchanges to-day there are people registered for whom very, very few opportunities of employment are available.  Some of these in their younger days were trained as office clerks, and so on.  Because of the development of the typewriter, the comptometer and other office machinery of that type these clerks are now registering at the unemployment exchanges.  I suppose that is the way of civilisation, and progress in one direction almost inevitably means victimisation of some group of people who have passed beyond the age when they can learn new methods or operate new machines. Consequently many of these unemployment lists bear no relation to the number that are really employable in present-day circumstances.  What can be done for them is a problem that presents some difficulty.  The managers in the local labour exchanges co-operate to the fullest extent with the local authorities in trying to get a few months for these particular people during the summer period when the regular clerks and office staff employed by local authorities are on annual leave.  That is the only season of the year when any hope of employment is held out for many of these people.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation was referred to by Deputy Norton.  It has much to recommend it.  If in the principal towns and cities, as seems to be the case, we have very competent officers in charge of the various Government sub-departments, I think they should have discretionary power to deal with matters affecting their own particular areas.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister, too, in relation to applications for special allowances.  I am referring to the Old I.R.A. men in various parts of the country.  I think the investigation into their means carried out by the social welfare officers should be done as expeditiously as possible.  In many cases these welfare officers have their routine work to do and it is inevitable that some delay occurs in dealing with these special cases because of the applicants' inability to attend at a particular place for the investigation.  A certain amount of travel may be entailed and <Col N="1805" /> certain arrangements may have to be made.  All these things cause delay.  I am sure the Minister will ensure that the reports to the Department of Defence are speeded up so that those who are qualified for special allowances will get them as quickly as possible.  I think that practically all these matters have been discussed already in connection with the Social Welfare Bill.  Very little remains to be said beyond pointing out a few items here and there where more efficiency and quicker decisions might be to the advantage of the service generally.</P>

      <P>Not being a representative of either Galway or Cork I have no very special interest in decentralisation.  I am not sufficiently optimistic to hope that it might be possible to transfer the headquarters of the Social Welfare Department to Rathdrum, Baltinglass, or anywhere else in my constituency.  My interest in this question, therefore, is mainly in connection with the suggestion that has been made that we should aim at decentralisation in the form of giving more authority to the local exchange managers.  In that connection I think it is desirable that a new approach should be made by these officers and by the Department generally to the whole problem of unemployment.  I am not now dealing with the question of finding employment or reducing the number of unemployed, because that is more or less bound up with industrial and agricultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary operation of the Social Welfare Department the bulk of the unemployed is made up of those who in some way or other missed an opportunity or have been jostled out of the opportunities offered of getting whatever employment is available. These people are deserving of particular attention and special consideration quite apart altogether from any monetary State aid that may be made available to them.  I think it is essential that there should be a better understanding and a more sympathetic investigation of their circumstances by the officers of the Minister's Department.  I agree with what Deputy Norton has said, namely, that the main interest of the manager of the labour exchange <Col N="1806" /> should be to try to find employment for these unemployed and fit them in in some capacity wherever work can be obtained.  In order to do that it is essential that the personal circumstances of each applicant for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance should be carefully investigated and the qualifications of the applicants for any work that may be available more thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>I think the labour exchange should be called an employment office and it should be the function of the manager of that office to concern himself mainly with the task of finding employment. In order to do that he should study the qualifications of each applicant and his family and personal circumstances. Since this work is most important in the life of the nation from a purely social point of view, I think it is desirable that public-spirited people should be asked to co-operate with the local manager in seeking to help the unemployed and in assisting them in every possible way.  In the same way as we have vocational educational committees we should have employment committees representative of the people, representative of the workers' organisations, representative of the Church, representative of business.  I think such committees would be of immense benefit and would perhaps help to raise the tone of the matter to a higher level.</P>
    <P>There is always a danger when a young person starts to draw unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance that he or she will tend to become a chronic recipient and may develop a mentality of looking to the labour exchange for benefit rather than seeking employment.  For that reason it is desirable that those people should be helped by advice and instruction as to where and how to seek employment and should be facilitated in availing of any technical education that may be within reach.  In regard to younger people it is essential that, if they are unemployed, they should be given every opportunity to improve themselves by attendance at vocational classes where they are available.  A local committee working in co-operation with the exchange manager would be of <Col N="1807" /> immense benefit in that direction. People who are unemployed should not be regarded as untouchable in the community.  Our aim should be to lift these people up and to help them to get on their feet.  If they have not an opportunity of obtaining technical training the opportunity should be provided for them.  That would help them to overcome any obstacles they may meet in life and to secure employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister the disabilities from which the national health insurance agents have suffered for quite a long period.  It is unnecessary for me to state that it is really due to the devotion and loyalty shown by these national health insurance agents over a number of years since the initiation of national health insurance in this country that the former society was the success which it proved to be.  Anyone who is very well acquainted with the duties imposed on national health insurance agents is astonished that their position has been defined as parttime.  It appears to me that this is merely a form of escape by the Government in connection with their responsibilities to these people.</P>
      <P>As a dispensary doctor I have very close association with the work performed by the national health insurance agents and I am convinced that their work cannot be done within reasonable hours.  I am aware that night work, overtime, and even Sunday work, have been necessary in order to cope with the enormous amount of clerical work which needs attention from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospect for those agents who, since 1934, have by their efforts made amalgamation the success it has been, is anything but rosy.  After spending 30 or 40 years as insurance agents they are forced to retire at 65 without pension or provision of any kind.  It is only natural that, having given the best years of their lives to the service of the State, they would resent being thrown on the scrap-heap without any prospect other than to become a burden on the community.  As we all know, these very loyal and hardworking <Col N="1808" /> servants have spent the best years of their lives travelling over bad roads on push-bicycles in order to carry out their duties.  With the exception of those serving in the Cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Dublin, they are paid on a capitation basis.  This system militated against them inasmuch as the number of insured persons in the rural areas has not been on the increase, with the result that their emoluments have been sadly depleted.</P>
    <P>I am informed that during the past couple of years agents have had on occasions to send reports to the Department concerning persons claiming benefit or pensions from the British Ministry of National Insurance and that they have not yet received any payment for such work which in strict justice they would be entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>In connection with these servants we must remember that it was as a result of their attitude, courtesy and attention to duty at the start that non-compliance and malingering ceased.  It was always very difficult for dispensary doctors certifying people to separate the malingerers from the genuine cases. It was as a result of the efforts of the national health insurance agents in this regard that the society were able to eliminate all but the genuine claims and so ensure the success which the society undoubtedly attained.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain the continued success of the amalgamation and the new Social Welfare Bill, it is even more essential to ensure the continued loyalty and devotion of these agents. The one sure way to achieve that is to see that each agent is content and satisfied with his conditions of employment.  I would ask the Minister to consider the claims of these people sympathetically and thereby ensure continuation of what the Minister and the Department admit was genuine loyalty on their part.</P>
    <P>In connection with blind pensions, it appears that where a man has a blind wife and, say, three or four children, and he is earning, say, £131 a year or £2 10s. a week, the wife is assessed with half his earnings and is not entitled to pension.  That is a matter <Col N="1809" /> that should be rectified.  It is very unfair that the blind wife of a man who is earning £2 10s. a week should not receive some form of compensation for this tragic state of affairs.  I do not know if the Minister intends to amend the section which covers such cases but I would appeal to him to see, if possible, that in such cases the wife would not be assessed with half her husband's earnings and that she would be able to receive some little form of consolation from the State in her affliction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal first with Deputy Norton's appeal for certain amenities for old people.  I was not aware that the Deputy had done anything about that matter but, naturally, I quite accept what he says.  Consequently, I had not done anything by way of continuing those efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that we should encourage in every way we can the voluntary effort which is directed towards the praiseworthy effort to provide certain amenities for old people. Some Deputies may not be aware that the Red Cross have recently been devoting a good deal of attention to this matter.  They have started old folks' societies which are organised, as a matter of fact, by some of the younger people in the Red Cross.  The object is to visit those old people fairly regularly and especially what are called the lonely old people, that is, people who are living alone.  They do messages for those people, help them to tidy up their houses and take them out for organised motor drives.  They even organise socials for them in the way of concerts, teas and so forth.  I have no doubt that they would be very glad to consider Deputy Norton's suggestion of finding out if they can get either free entertainment at a cinema or entertainment at a nominal fee.  I shall pass the Deputy's suggestion on to them.  I think it is much better that <Col N="1810" /> a voluntary organisation should do that type of thing rather than that the Department should do it officially.  Of course, if they ask for help in any negotiations I shall be glad to give it. Certainly, it is an idea that is worth pursuing.  We shall see if it will bear results.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to encourage voluntary effort in other directions as well. Deputy Cogan mentioned that there might be some committee to co-operate with the manager of the branch exchange.  I had not that in mind exactly, but I had in mind encouraging the provision of voluntary committees all over the country for, in particular, rehabilitation.  I had in mind in particular people who are down and out because they could not get work for a long time or people who are down and out as a result of illness or for some other reason.  I had in mind that I should like very much to encourage the organisation of voluntary committees who would take an interest in such people, who would call on certain employers who might have suitable employment for some of those people and who would try to persuade the employer to give a certain poor person a chance.  I do not know how successful such an effort might be but, in any event, it might do a certain amount of good.  I mention it now because it is an extension of the idea put forward to-day by Deputy Norton.</P>
    <P>On the subject of branch offices, the position is as stated by Deputy Norton, namely, that the salary is based on the <i>per capita</i> rate or, in other words, the number on the register.  I agree that it is a bad system.  However honest and anxious a man might be in his efforts to secure employment for those on his register, it must cause him a certain amount of personal anxiety if he is too successful in his efforts.  I should very much favour changing the system. Personally, I am not keen on taking all those people into the Civil Service. The Civil Service system is unwieldy for men who have to do work of that kind.  Sometimes they must work a long number of hours and at other times they have very little to do.  I think a contract of service would be better so that whatever amount of <Col N="1811" /> work might fall to be done within the year would be done irrespective of the long hours and the short hours of duty. Having said that, I agree that the men should be properly treated and properly paid.  I am aware that Deputy Kennedy, the Parliamentary Secretary, has a report practically ready on the subject of branch offices in general.</P>
    <P>It covers the type of office that is maintained in the various towns and villages, whether that office should be improved, whether there should be a general improvement all round or merely an improvement in certain cases.  As well as discussing the building, he also has a report on the conditions applying to the office of branch manager.  He is making certain recommendations as a result of an inspection which he made personally of a good many of those offices.  I promised to have his review considered very carefully as soon as the legislation was passed.  That is completed now, of course.  Therefore I think I may say to Deputy Norton and to others who mentioned this matter that the whole question of branch offices, including personnel and conditions of employment, will be examined in the very near future.  That will also apply to the national health agents.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Maguire that those people have given very long hours of service to what is called a part-time job.  I think that, on the whole, they have been a very good group of public servants.  They have done their work very efficiently.  Therefore they deserve to have the position reviewed also.</P>
    <P>The policy advocated by Deputy Norton is being pursued in regard to temporary clerks.  These men are being absorbed whenever an opportunity arises.  Therefore I think the Deputy may take it that these men are being treated as he would wish them to be treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that at the time ten were called or were in process of being called.  The question of calling more was related to the subsequent developments in staff, matters consequent on the new Bill.  Will the Minister look into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  That will be kept in mind.  I do not think that, in itself, the Bill will create much extra employment.  However, it may.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of decentralisation as a means of providing employment for more people in some of the larger towns throughout the country and in that way preventing Dublin from growing too large.  I was in favour of decentralisation in 1947.  In 1947 I sent a very important officer of the Department to Galway and Cork to investigate the possibilities of the decentralisation of the Department of Social Welfare.  We were only investigating the matter at that time.  It is not to be taken as anything other than an investigation if I send an officer to report on the possibilities of getting offices in Cork and Galway, to report on the accommodation which is there already, on whether or not it would be necessary to build an office and on the sites available; secondly, to discuss the matter of housing of the staffs with the county manager.  That also was discussed.  I think any Minister in any Department should consider ideas like that.  There is no reason to conclude, however, that it will go on and that staffs will be ordered to Cork or Galway whether they like it or not. Instead of spending £500,000 on the Land Commission buildings if the Government sent an inspector round to have a look at the Phoenix Park, I think he was bound to do that but that is no reason why a Deputy should go down the country and say we are going to spend £25,000,000 on Government buildings.  The same thing applies to decentralisation.  The fact that I sent an officer down does not mean that next month or the month after officials will be sent to Cork or Galway.  We should do as much decentralisation as we can but I do not <Col N="1813" /> think we will ever succeed in getting rid of the nucleus of a social welfare office.  That will be in Dublin, where the Parliament and the Minister is. Dublin is the natural centre of the country for co-ordinating matters and the central office will also be here. I am, however, still keen on seeing how much can be decentralised.</P>
    <P>In my reference to a report that is being prepared on the branch offices, one of the things I asked to have reviewed at the same time was how much work could be left efficiently with the branch offices and not have all sent up to Dublin to be dealt with.  I think a certain amount could be left with each branch office.  Some more work could be left in Galway or Cork but I have no idea how much work could be so left.  I think everybody will agree that I am right in having the matter investigated.  If, as a result of that investigation, we find that 5 per cent. of the work could be done in the branch offices and another 10 per cent. done in the provincial offices we will have gone a long way towards decentralisation.  I would like to reassure the staffs that they are not going to be ordered down to Cork or Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only in the Minister's mind.  The buildings will remain here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as Deputy MacCarthy explained, some civil servants here from Cork and from time to time they ask to be transferred back to Cork.  That does belie the statement that every Corkman wants to get to Dublin.  The same thing applies to Galway.  If we could get some of the work done in Galway or Cork we would have quite sufficient volunteers but if we have not got them my idea is that we should make the few top jobs very attractive for these men.  We ought not to force them but let them know there is promotion.  I am quite sure that we will get men in the Department to volunteer for promotion if that is how this matter is to be approached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that I promised the Deputy strongly to decentralise.  Why should I not?  I am in favour of decentralisation in so far as we can do that efficiently.  When I said 5 per cent. of the work might be done efficiently in branch offices and 20 per cent. in the provincial offices, I would be more pleased if I find, on investigation, that that can be made 40 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing.  Her means would be assessed at half.  That is a general rule all through the old age pensions and blind pensions codes.  The matter was considered generally whether we should try to make half of the husband's earnings go <Col N="1815" /> to the wife or half of the wife's earnings go to the husband.  I am afraid it would be very hard to make an exception in this case although I can promise that it will be considered in case we are revising that code.  That probably will not be revised for some time.</P>

Suppose such a person, because of the very great urgency of his or her case had to get teeth attended to, will he or she be entitled to retrospective payment, say, in October, when a satisfactory agreement has been arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister answers this question may I say this? Dental treatment is a very spread out operation.  A person goes along to the dentist who looks at his teeth and suggests treatment.  There is a fair amount of coming and going in the preliminary stages.  Then the dentist extracts the teeth.  There is another interregnum while the person concerned is waiting to get an impression taken.  This transaction drags along for months, and for years in some circumstances.  This strike has been in operation since the 1st April.  I suppose one may call it a strike.  On the day before the strike took place, there must have been quite a considerable number of insured persons in the hands of dentists awaiting treatment.  But for the fact that this dispute intervened, their treatment would have continued and ultimately they would have got out of the dentist's hands and have had their requirements satisfactorily met. The Dental Association now say: &ldquo;We will not do any more business until we get a new agreement from the Department.&rdquo;  What has become of the people who had teeth extracted before the 1st April and who have had an impression taken by the dentist? If such people make up their minds, for one reason or another, that they want to have full dental treatment and do, in fact, get such treatment, surely debarring them from the benefit which they would have got as insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts is not contemplated?  Is it now contemplated that persons who are entitled to benefits under the National Health Insurance Acts are to be <Col N="1818" /> denied these benefits because they proceed to have the treatment completed by a dentist in his private capacity? Would the Minister clarify the position in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, all insured persons who were receiving treatment on the 1st April have had that treatment finished.  Only those who needed treatment after the 1st April will be affected.  Everybody who applied for treatment prior to that date has had his treatment completed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked whether we could, as it were, make retrospective provision so as to pay those who would be treated in the meantime.  I am afraid that would be impossible.  Even if I say we will have the matter considered, I feel it is extremely unlikely that anything will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate, of course, that this practically means a withdrawal by the State of dental treatment over a period.  I am sure that is not the desire.  If an agreement were in operation the State would have been prepared to give this free dental treatment.  I feel that an impossible position will be created for the Minister if persons are made to suffer&mdash;in urgent cases at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The present dispute is probably one of the most difficult disputes to settle.  On the one hand there is a dental association which is well organised and in no way dependent on this kind of work for the livelihood of its members.  On the other hand there is the State with all its majesty and all its starchiness.  On what terms is this dispute going to be settled?  That is the problem.  If it is left in the hands of the Dental Association it will be a long-drawn-out matter.  The State's resources in matters of this kind are limitless and the Dental Association is sufficiently strong to be able to dig its heels in permanently.  On the one hand the State will sit tight, the staff in the Department will not be losing a penny; the Dental Association will continue to get patients, and it is only the unfortunate insured persons who will lose as a result of the dispute.  No wounds <Col N="1819" /> will be inflicted on the State, the Dental Association will be able to hold out for anything like 12 months, and the unfortunate insured person will have to suffer while this battle of wits is going on between both sides.</P>
      <P>This is an occasion in which there ought to be some sense of savvy. Somebody ought to approach the problem from a statesmanlike point of view with a view to getting the matter settled.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he feels he has justice on his side, to get the matter examined either by a single arbitrator or by a group of arbitrators.  Both sides would be bound by the arbitrator's award. If the Minister does not want to waste time getting an arbitrator to deal with a matter of this kind, perhaps the thing to do would be to take the case to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court is a qualified board, recognised by legislation and composed of persons competent to express an opinion on a dispute of this kind.  Both sides, the Department on the one hand and the Dental Association on the other hand, could come before it and have the dispute resolved.  It would be a much better arrangement than having both parties sitting down, making faces at each other and getting into a strait-jacket, as happens in disputes of this kind.  As I said before, the Minister should submit the case either to a single arbitrator, to a group of arbitrators or else get the matter resolved by the Labour Court.  Both sides would be bound by the award. Would the Minister consider doing anything on these lines?</P>

      <P>The point raised by Deputy Norton is important.  I feel it would be as well to isolate the staff problem from the major problem and to ask the Minister to discuss it in cold blood.  Where people are going to be deprived of dental benefit of all kinds from 1st April until this dispute is settled, I think the Minister would come to the conclusion that that would be unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I was referring to the fact that Votes 8, 9 and 10 would be put back because I felt that the Estimate for Social Welfare would go on for at least a week or ten days.  I suppose Deputies are all dumb awaiting the results of the by-elections and I expect that is the reason why it has gone through so quickly.  No matter how the <Col N="1823" /> by-elections go, one thing always has to go on and that is the Office of Public Works because without them no other Department could make much progress.</P>
      <P>Concluding last night I was asking the Parliamentary Secretary about the co-operation which was going on in my time between the Department and the Department of Agriculture as regards works such as I was referring to, for instance the work done at Tinnecara Rock in Roscommon.  I wonder how much of that co-operation has continued.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying I should like to hear whether that co-operation is continuing.  I know in my time certain survey parties were loaned from the Office of Public Works to the Department of Agriculture to carry out surveys on certain rivers.  I would like to know how much of that has continued or is any work being done other than the work on Tinnecara.  The work on Tinnecara, like the Brosna, is a very good job.  It is work that is a big advantage to the people of that area.</P>
      <P>I was referring to a matter last night when the Parliamentary Secretary interrupted me.  I spoke of the fact that in each of the three years of inter-Party Government we started an arterial drainage scheme.  He is there now for the past 12 months and no other scheme has been started.  Of course, as I have said, there is the Corrib scheme but in the statement which he read last night in introducing the Estimate, if I did not make a mistake he referred to the fact that the machinery from the Brosna was going on to the Feale.  I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the arrangements in my time were that the machinery from the Brosna would be going to the Corrib.  I would like to know what is the cause of the changeover in that.  I do not believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is deliberately, of his own free will, holding back the progress on the Corrib.  I do not believe it for a moment but I want to tell him what the intention of the Board of Works was in my time at any rate, and I want to know what is the cause of the change in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> That, of course, brings me back to the point that the amount provided in the Estimate for machinery is being cut down.  I believe even if you were to leave the machinery idle, it should be purchased and brought in.  There will be plenty of work for machinery in this country and, therefore, it should be purchased because the day may come when it is not possible to get it in.  That was the Fianna Fáil cry at the time of the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act: that from 1945 to 1948 they could not start any work.  The Parliamentary Secretary went through the country and down in North Mayo he stated that all I had to do was blow a whistle to start these schemes. Such was not the case at all.  I had to buy the machinery to start the scheme.  You cannot start them with a spade or shovel, a fork or spoon. The machinery had to be purchased and I want again to emphasise, as I emphasised last night, that the machinery that started the Brosna scheme was purchased during my time of office from February, 1948, to June, 1948.  There was no machinery there other than the machinery I purchased. Some of the machinery used in the opening of the Brosna was purchased at that time.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies must be missing out on their sleep because of their worry over the priority list.  I believe that preference should be given where the greatest necessity exists for arterial drainage.  It was for that reason that I was so keen on the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan scheme because there was density of population and the people had to leave their homes due to flooding.  In the priority list so far as I could see the idea was to drain good land so that there would be a good return financially.  To me that was nonsense, because I held the view that the people with the nine and ten acres of land living in areas like the Corrib should be attended to first.  There is greater necessity for looking after the man with ten acres of land of which five acres are subjected to flooding than there is for looking after the man with 100 acres of land of which 50 acres are subject to flooding.</P>
    <P>Before I left office the inter-Party <Col N="1825" /> Government had decided to survey the Moy.  Another scheme in which I was interested was the Suck.  The small landowners along that river deserve as much consideration, or even more consideration, than those who are lucky enough to hold large tracts of land.  I had hoped that more progress would have been made.  In my time we suffered some delay because of the necessity to recruit staff and train them in drainage work, and because we had to buy machinery and train people in the operation of it.  When the present Parliamentary Secretary took over he had a trained staff at his disposal. Certain additions should have been made to that staff.  They have not been made so far.  The Parliamentary Secretary also had the machinery available. I fully expected that at least one scheme per year would be carried out. I hope we will see the day when five arterial drainage schemes will be operating simultaneously.  If drainage is not done on that basis none of us here will ever see the day when we will have again 1,000,000 acres of land under production&mdash;land that has been subjected to flooding for years past.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to get going on the job.  When the Book of Estimates appears next year I hope to see in it a substantial sum for the drainage of the Corrib. There are people who say that work has not commenced on the Corrib this year because of certain political reasons.  I do not believe that is so. If it is so, I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary and to his Government that that does not do me any damage.  It is the people of Galway who will suffer.  Despite anything the Parliamentary Secretary or the Fianna Fáil Party may say, I want it to be clearly understood that I am the man who is responsible for the Corrib-Clare-Dalgan scheme.  That was my baby.  I felt that that scheme should be carried out and the Commissioners of Public Works agreed with me.</P>

A scheme like the Corrib or the Brosna is a greater advantage to a greater number of people than any other scheme on the priority list.  The same is true of the Suck.  No province suffers more from flooding than does the province of Connacht.  I am a Connacht and a Galway man; so is the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have given the Parliamentary Secretary my view and he can verify that view by looking up the records in the Office of Public Works.  It is upon his Estimate that I shall judge him and I shall be very disappointed next year if the Book of Estimates does not show an addition for at least two further arterial drainage schemes.  I would even be satisfied with one scheme and if the book fails to show that scheme, then harsher criticisms will be made when this Estimate is introduced next year.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if any progress has been made in finding a permanent home for the temporary clinics which were erected on the site of the proposed Garden of Remembrance to commemorate the 1916 men and the men of the Dublin Brigade who fought for Irish freedom.  All the plans were ready for that memorial.  Those plans were left in abeyance and a temporary clinic was established for children.  If steps are not taken soon it looks as if the clinic will become a permanent one and we will have no Garden of Remembrance.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will use all his energy in an effort to find an alternative site for this clinic.  Naturally, I do not want to interfere with the good work that is being done there, nor does anybody else but I do think that it is a pity that after all the years that had elapsed and in view of the stage that the preliminaries for the Garden of Remembrance had reached, some alternative site was not found in the first place.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is the position and what efforts are being made to find the alternative site which was promised some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1827" /> I would also like to know what is the position about the Custom House Memorial.  The site is available.  Is any progress being made with a view to the completion of the memorial?  I know the committee in charge of the memorial have worked very hard but they have met with great difficulties. I understand that they have practically to start all over again.  They have a couple of thousand pounds but owing to the delay, the cost has increased very considerably.  In view of the importance of this engagement in the fight for freedom, the final major engagement, which practically brought about the truce by the destruction which it did to the British power in this country, we will all agree that a memorial to the men who died in that fight and to commemorate that very important episode in our fight for freedom, should be proceeded with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of the delay that has occurred and the increased cost, I would suggest that the Government should give a grant to the committee to help them to put the work in hands at once.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider that suggestion favourably because the project has been in hands for four or five years.  I would ask him to consider it favourably and to put it before the Government.</P>

      <P>I believe the business of this office is administered at present in a very niggardly fashion.  I cannot see any reason why more money is not made available to this Vote, particularly under certain sub-heads.  I know that when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was in operation, many beneficial schemes were carried out under that Act, schemes which were of immense advantage to the farming community and to the workers because it gave them an opportunity of productive employment.  While that Act was in operation, as it was under the last Government and while three times the money was available for carrying out those schemes, there was not the same necessity for increased moneys under this particular Vote.  Now that there has been a reduction of about <Col N="1828" /> 30? per cent. in the Vote for the Local Authorities (Works) Act and as the works carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary's office and those carried out under the Act are so much similar there is a case to be made now for increased money under various headings.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency that would be very interested in this matter because we labour under many disadvantages which are not to be found anywhere else except on the western seaboard.  There is a good deal of water-logged land in West Cork and a good deal of undeveloped bog.  It would be money usefully employed if more money were expended on the development of those bogs and in draining the land and clearing it and making it arable.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the present year a big area like West Cork is getting from the Parliamentary Secretary's office only some £2,000 or £3,000.  Of what use is that sum of money to such a big area?</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to what I would term the dilatory methods of the Office of Public Works in dealing with repairs to national schools, especially in South Tipperary. There are many schools there which are much in need of repair and the furniture of which is disgraceful. <Col N="1829" /> Irrespective of some little legal hitch or impediment, the Board of Works should not allow red tape to bind them to the extent that children must attend schools the furniture of which is antiquated and worn out, the buildings being in anything but good repair.</P>
      <P>The particular schools that I refer to are Monard&mdash;which has been the subject of lengthy correspondence between the manager and the Department&mdash; Oola, Ballyheaty, Lagginstown and Ardfinnan.  The children of Ardfinnan, where the population, I am glad to say, has increased considerably, must attend school at a local hall, the accommodation at which is altogether out of proportion to the number of children asked to attend there.</P>
      <P>When the Office of Public Works have been approached by a manager in regard to a school, if on examination his complaints are found to be justified, there is no reason why the office should not go full speed ahead and carry out the work.  In Monard the furniture is in such a bad condition that I certainly would not allow a child of mine to go there and the people are very patient, to say the least of it.  My patience has been nearly exhausted.  I hope that these schools will be dealt with during the holidays, when work can be carried out effectively and when there is no interference with the education of the children.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the former Parliamentary Secretary regarded drainage as such a parochial matter.  When he says that in his opinion five acres of land belonging to a farmer with double that amount should come before 50 acres I cannot help thinking that, in the interests of the country as a whole, if we are going to step up production we must step up on the greatest number of acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again I have been on deputations on the subject of the colossal damage done by the River Suir.  Some of the finest land in Ireland is being destroyed year after year because of the constant flooding that occurs there.  The village of Ardfinnan is a fine prosperous village.  Sometimes that whole village is flooded as many as four times a year and the people <Col N="1830" /> must be evacuated each time.  If the main rivers of the country are tackled I believe the tributaries will not be such a great job.  There is no use in draining the small rivers because the backwash from the main rivers will eventually cause more erosion.  I do not know when the Suir will be tackled but it is a nightmare to the people who live in towns and villages and farms and holdings adjacent to that river. Even the town of Clonmel is subject to flooding of a very serious nature at times.  We have the manpower and all we want to enable us to go ahead are money and good will.  I feel that Deputy Beegan is the right man in the right place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what has become of the programme for the reorganisation of the Board of Works?  When the last Government were in office we undertook consideration of the common complaint that civil service administration lacked much that business administration provided and that there was a waste of money because business methods were not applied.  I asked leave of the Government to employ the leading firm of business consultants in London to reorganise the Department of Agriculture.  The same firm had, in fact, reorganised two or three Departments of State of the British Government at the request of the British Treasury.  They are at present engaged on the reorganisation of the entire civil administration of Ceylon. They did very valuable work in the Department of Agriculture.  I was informed that, at the request of the Minister for Finance, they prepared a report on the reorganisation and administration of the Board of Works.  I should be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary if he has had time to consider that report and what recommendations he has made to the Minister for Finance for implementation by the Government.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether it might be appropriate or proper to make copies of the report available in the Library&mdash;though I fully appreciate that, administratively, that may not be desirable.  If the Parliamentary Secretary came to the <Col N="1831" /> conclusion that he would not feel himself free to make the report available to all and sundry until the Government had decided what it proposed to do in regard to it, I have no complaint to make.  On the other hand, if the Parliamentary Secretary did feel free to make the report available I believe the document would be of great interest to those of us who are concerned with the reorganisation of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>It is to be borne in mind that the administrative machinery of the Board of Works was designed in the middle of the 19th century, when the functions of the Board of Works were very limited and circumscribed.  Over the years the practice has grown up to saddle the Board of Works with more and more duties of a wide and growing variety.  They are struggling to carry out a relatively vast programme of works with an administrative organisation which, in my submission, was never designed to carry the burden which it is now called upon to carry. I know the House will appreciate that, so far as the investigation directed to the reorganisation of the board's administrative machinery was concerned, no one was more co-operative in facilitating that investigation than the Board of Works themselves.  I feel that the Board of Works are aware that in many respects their own administrative resources are archaic and that much of the work that they themselves would desire to expedite and transact on behalf of this State is being held up, not by any reluctance on the part of the servants of the Board of Works to do their work, but by red tape, to which, I think, Deputy Davern referred.  It is an inheritance from a past age which no Government has yet turned its mind to correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to submit one proposal which is of some importance.  Our Botanic Gardens, which come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture, is circumscribed by the development of the City of Dublin.  It contains a lot of very precious material and it is a very pleasing amenity for the citizens of Dublin.  Part of a wellrun botanical museum must be what is <Col N="1832" /> technically known as an arboretum. But an arboretum, which consists of a display of varieties of trees, takes up a very large acreage.  The maintenance of the arboretum at the Botanic Gardens means that the Botanic Gardens must forgo a number of other botanical displays which they would like to undertake but for which they have not space.  I think I made the suggestion to the Board of Works, when I was Minister for Agriculture, that the arboretum could more conveniently be accommodated either in the Phoenix Park or at Muckross, Killarney.  An arboretum would not interfere with the amenities of a park such as the Phoenix Park.  On the contrary, it would, rather, be a decoration.  It could conveniently be annexed, for the purposes of students, to the main botanical collection if it were located in the Park but it would be no serious inconvenience if it were located at Muckross.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might turn his mind to that desirable reform.  If the Minister for Finance would consult with the Minister for Agriculture, I believe the proposal to transfer the arboretum to the Phoenix Park would confer a very great benefit on the Botanic Gardens and a substantial benefit on the citizens of Dublin to whom the arboretum would be an agreeable amenity.  I believe, too, that the colleges would appreciate the larger and more convenient space that would be available for the maintenance of the arboretum in the Park.</P>
    <P>I would like to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary what has become of the report of the Dutch engineers on the reclamation from the sea of the back strand at Tramore. Deputies will recall that, under the land reclamation project, there were four divisions, the fourth of which was the reclamation of the estuarine marsh land from the sea.  We wished, naturally, to get the other three divisions of the project working before we turned our minds to that but, when the first three sections to the land project were well launched, we turned our minds to the question of how to go about the problem of estuarine marsh reclamation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> That is very highly specialised work. If we had chosen to ask our own chief engineer to organise staff for that purpose I doubt if our resources would have reached such a project.  As Deputy Donnellan has informed the House, one of the chronic difficulties of the Board of Works has been to get a sufficient number of trained engineers and, therefore, with the entire approval of the Board of Works, as I believe, we inquired who were the leading firm of engineers who had experience of this work of estuarine marsh reclamation.  We were informed it was the Dutch firm who had carried out the reclamation of Walcheren Island after the recent war.  We asked them to make an inspection of the back strand at Tramore and report as to whether reclamation was feasible and what it would involve.</P>
    <P>That particular reclamation work was chosen more as a pilot plan to see if our experience there would encourage us to proceed to similar works which we would undertake in Clare and in certain other coastal areas, where extensive areas of potential agricultural land are rendered useless by the encroachment upon it of the sea.  To the best of my recollection the report had not been made available when we left office.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would let us have such information as he may now have at his disposal in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would also be glad to know what progress has been made on the Rye. The House will remember that authority was given by the Government to the Department of Agriculture to bespeak the assistance of the Board of Works, and accordingly, in pursuit of our desire to clear the bed of rivers which were beyond the engineering capacity of the Department of Agriculture and yet did not fall within the category of arterial drainage work, the Department of Agriculture were authorised to bespeak the assistance of the Board of Works and on their undertaking, to carry out the repairs of a given river.  The charges connected therewith were levied on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and the work was done on an agency basis by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> I should like to avail of this opportunity of expressing my profound gratitude, as Minister for Agriculture at that time, for the invaluable help extended to the Department for which I was responsible by the Board of Works.  We do not deny that we used on occasion to have what I will describe as metaphorically bloody battles, but if we had it was merely in rivalry of zeal to get the works for which we were severally responsible expeditiously done.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, I welcome this opportunity of expressing my profound appreciation of the invaluable work that was done on behalf of the Department of Agriculture by the Board of Works and of the ready willingness of the board to undertake unreasonable demands that were perennially made on them to provide assistance in completing works which were really beyond supply.</P>
    <P>There was one work on the Rye which involved the removal of a large rock at the point of the Rye joining the Liffey.  There was another work on a river, I think, in Clare.  I would be glad to hear a word of their progress.</P>
    <P>I am in a position to report to the House myself on the admirable progress that has been made on the Tinnecara Rock because, on my way home from this legislative Assembly, I not infrequently pass the scene of operations.  I know from my own experience how precious that work is to the people of a large area in Roscommon and East Mayo.  I can only hope that in that connection, if it should become necessary to secure the maximum advantage from that work to clean the bed of the Lunge river and the Bridogue river, that somebody, under the inspiration of the Parliamentary Secretary, whether it be the local authority or the Board of Works or the Department of Agriculture, will excavate the bed of the Bridogue and the Lunge rivers.  I hope that will be undertaken if the necessity appears to exist, when the level of Lough Gara has been reduced by the work on the Tinnecara Rock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> I find myself somewhat abashed because, when I heard Deputy Davern clamouring for something for which I was clamouring for four years, I began to wonder which of us had taken leave of his senses.  Deputy Davern mentioned that he thought that whatever should be done ultimately about the catchment area of the tributary rivers of our main arterial rivers the urgently necessary thing to do was to get the main channel of the arterial rivers cleared and then deal with the tributaries as circumstances would allow.  I think Deputy Davern is entirely right.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and appreciate the outlook of the Board of Works. It is the outlook which underlies the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  The Board of Works became exasperated by having their efforts perennially dissipated in doing what they regarded as substantially nugatory work on a lot of tributary rivers since that work was fated to be destroyed by the passage of time if the main arterial river was not first attended to.  The result is that there is a provision in the 1945 Act prohibiting the Board of Works from dealing with a tributary river unless and until it deals with it as part of a complete arterial drainage scheme over the catchment area in which that tributary flows.</P>
    <P>The principle having been established that the Board of Works will only be called upon to deal with the drainage problem of an entire catchment area, they are very reluctant to allow any encroachment to be made on that principle.  Here I feel the Office of Public Works is wrong.  I pressed on them at a very early stage the view that, instead of insisting that they would not do a hand's turn in a catchment area until the whole catchment area was done, they should make a survey of a catchment area and estimate the total probable maximum volume of water which would pass through the main channel to the sea when the catchment area ultimately was completely dealt with under a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme, that they should then allow themselves a margin of 10 or 15 per cent., that they <Col N="1836" /> should then determine to excavate the main channel from the sea to the river's source on the basis of an intelligent anticipation of the maximum volume of water which would ultimately have to pass through, allowing themselves a margin of 10 or 15 per cent.  Then, gradually, every main channel in Ireland would be done, leaving behind in every catchment area a splendid volume of work on which we might fall back if any local pocket of unemployment showed itself at any future time.</P>
    <P>Deputies may remember that I reported to the House that, under an agency agreement between the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Public Works, I asked the Office of Public Works to make a survey of the Boyne, the Moy and the Inny.  They were precluded from doing that under the 1945 Act, which provided that they must not drain a catchment area unless they did the whole catchment area.  It was possible, under the Land Rehabilitation Project, to make an agency agreement with the Department of Agriculture to engage technical staff and to charge up to the Vote for Agriculture the expenses of a survey of a main channel as distinct from a survey of a whole catchment area.  It was in accordance with that scheme that I hoped to get the survey of the main channels of the Boyne, the Moy and the Inny undertaken.</P>
    <P>People asked me: &ldquo;Why these three rivers?&rdquo; We, in the Department of Agriculture, resolved to ask the Office of Public Works to undertake three main channels at the same time, and we said that we would provide them from the Department of Agriculture Vote with the money necessary to employ and train survey staffs sufficient to drain the main channels of these rivers.  When the chief engineers asked me what three rivers I would nominate on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, I said I would nominate the three rivers that the chief engineer of the Office of Public Works considered to be the most desirable.  My recollection is that the Office of Public Works said that the rivers they considered to be most desirable were the Boyne, the Inny, and a river in Kerry called the <Col N="1837" /> Maine.  I remember agreeing to that and asking the chief engineer of the Office of Public Works to take out the Maine and substitute for it the Moy. I informed him that we were experiencing very great difficulty in the Moy catchment area in getting work done by the local authority; the county engineer got it into his head that he would not open any of the drains which led ultimately to the Moy if the Moy were not drained.</P>
    <P>We could not get the land rehabilitation project moving satisfactorily in Mayo north, south or east.  The main drains leading into the tributary of the Moy could be closed under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts, but it appeared the county engineer would not give any such work to the local authorities in County Mayo unless and until the danger of the flooding of the Moy tributary was abated.  Therefore a lovely vicious circle was created in which the Office of Public Works said they could not engage in work on the Moy, in which the county engineer said he could not open the drains into the Moy, and in which the Department of Agriculture said they could not move ahead with the land rehabilitation project while the main drains leading into the tributary of the Moy were open.  I felt that that vicious circle had to be broken and, as usual, I turned, not in vain, to the Office of Public Works. In this set of circumstances the chief engineer of the Office of Public Works pointed out that, in his considered judgment, the River Moy must be regarded as a catchment problem.  He said that he saw my difficulty and would be glad to help me so far as his duty would allow by making a survey of the channel.  He warned me that in making that survey he might have views to express when the survey was completed as to whether that channel <i>se ipse</i> would be sufficient to cover everything in that catchment area, and that I must expect him to express that view resolutely when the time came.</P>
    <P>I believe that that survey is now under way.  However, I am not so sure that the agreement with the Office of Public Works to continue the programme of surveying the main channel of arterial channels is still <Col N="1838" /> under way.  I want, on its merits, to recommend that to the Parliamentary Secretary.  One of our difficulties, perennially, in rural Ireland is to find a programme of works reasonably adjacent to the homes of groups of people who may, for one reason or another, experience temporary bouts of unemployment.  What is a more ideal backlog of suitable work for a rural community than draining the main channel of a river where heavy machinery is ordinarily used so as to have it clear and ready to receive whatever volume of water the catchment area can pour into it.  There are many tributary rivers where a large percentage of manual labour could be used awaiting to be done.  It is quite possible to do them in pieces and blocks as the necessity arises always knowing, in the meantime, that the main channel has been done.  The situation to which Deputy Davern has referred cannot materialise while the complete treatment of a catchment area is postponed.  Deputy Davern referred to the Suir.  This is a huge river which requires to be done from the sea right up to its source requiring the most expensive machinery and highly skilled technical staff.  Such a river would not be at all as fruitful a source of local employment as tributary rivers ordinarily are.  These tributary rivers must be drained some time. There are about 14 or 15 arterial rivers in this country, and they must be done some time.</P>
    <P>Every year we leave that undone involves us in a very substantial annual loss because the land which is rendered useless by flooding fails to produce income that it otherwise would produce if these main channels were cleared.  I do not understand what is the delay.  Up to two years ago the answer of the Board of Works was: &ldquo;We will do it gladly if we get the staff but we have not any staff and we cannot get any staff.&rdquo;  I think we got authority for the Board of Works to employ more staff.  Certainly they got 40 engineers in one slap.  They got authority to get substantially more engineers and doubtless the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us about that. <Col N="1839" /> I remember when I was trying to get engineers for the three schemes they were undertaking on my behalf, the Board of Works went out and scooped the pool.  Having failed to get sufficient staff in ten years, the moment I got the sanction they got the sanction. They went out and scooped the pool and got a total of 49 engineers.  They ultimately got their requirements as regards staff.  The House will understand under what difficulties the board were operating when they realise that only two years ago they had to supplement their staff by over 40 engineers. They have got them now.  These main channels must be drained and I am blowed if I can understand what is the economics of the situation or what is the sense of leaving these main arterial rivers undone.  We have plenty of men.  The universities are turning out engineers who are going abroad.  The machinery can be obtained.  Every year we postpone its acquisition it becomes dearer to buy. Everybody wants the work done and it will pay for itself over and over again but it seems that some queer kind of paralysis has set in in this matter which I am at a loss to understand.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Beegan if he wants to earn immortality he has in this matter an utterly unprecedented opportunity, if Deputy Beegan would drop everything else in the Board of Works and really show his teeth on the subject of the main channels of the 14 or 15 arterial drainage catchment areas in this country, and say: &ldquo;I am determined to have a survey party put on all these areas before I leave the Board of Works, on the clear understanding that I am not planning to do the whole 15 or 16 catchment areas <i>in toto</i> but I am planning to clear the main drainage channels and to leave it to posterity to do the rest of the catchment areas as circumstances will require and allow.&rdquo;  I speak from some experience in this matter and I assure the House that there is nothing to prevent that being done to-morrow morning except the kind of atavistic belief that it cannot be done.  But if you once persuade them in the Board of Works that <Col N="1840" /> Oireachtas Éireann want it done and are prepared to meet the bill, it can be done forthwith.  The work can be put in hand in 48 hours.  The man primarily placed to get that work done is the Parliamentary Secretary.  If he does not kick up a row the Board of Works cannot kick up a row.  If he brings sufficient pressure to bear on the Minister for Finance, making a case that everybody in Dáil Éireann wants it, I think Finance will meet him.  I suggest to Deputies on all sides of the House&mdash;because I do not think the matter raised by Deputy Davern relating to the main channels is a question of politics; everybody on all sides who knows anything of rural Ireland understands how vitally important this matter is, the drainage of our agricultural land&mdash;that they should impress on the Parliamentary Secretary our earnest desire not to demand a rate of progress in arterial drainage which is physically impossible but to demand the clearance of the main channels, leaving the balance of the catchment area to be done as opportunity offers; and he will be able to get it done.  Perhaps I could encourage him.  I will promise him this.  If he does not get it done certain events may transpire in the course of the next month which will enable me to get it done.  I warn him, if he does not get it done I shall.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what is the position in regard to the plant that was purchased down in Dundalk way back in 1948.  Being present at one of the Public Accounts Meetings last year, we discovered that that plant is still down in Ringsend.  We are paying £600 a year to the Port and Docks Board or somebody else for having it there.  I wish to inquire what is being done with it.  When we were discussing this matter I came to the conclusion that it was so much scrap. It was rather strange that we were paying £600 a year to the Port and Docks Board for watching and for dues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plant was purchased in 1948 for £6,000.  It was then estimated that £4,306 would have to be expended on it to make it any way useful.  It remained there for some time and it was <Col N="1841" /> discovered that it would cost something like £18,000 to make it useful.  It was then transported to Dublin, and I understand some of the barges were lost on the way.  When the plant was brought to Dublin a search was made for tugs but it was unsuccessful, and the engineers examined the possibility of getting a tug.  It was estimated that would cost £80,000.  What I am trying to convey is that there seems to have been no supervision and no desire to save public property in the whole transaction.  They then got an estimate that it would cost £18,400 for a dredger.  At that time we suggested it should be sold for scrap.  I am anxious to know if it has now been sold for scrap notwithstanding all the money it cost to buy it.  I understand the reason it was not put in Dún Laoghaire as the property of the Board of Works was that it was unmanæuvrable and could not go on its own steam.  Is the engineer or the number of engineers who purchased that plant still in the employment of the Board of Works?  They do not seem to have had any sense of responsibility purchasing that plant in such a condition, and then having to sell it for scrap after three years.  I shall probably say something about that at a later date when I have some knowledge of what has happened the plant since we discussed it at the meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>For three years I have been trying to ascertain by way of question and supplementary to whom do we give our insurance every year from the Board of Works.  I asked that question almost three years ago and I was told it was given to an agency.  That agency has a very nice Irish sounding name but I am not at all satisfied that it is Irish controlled.  I asked the same question recently and I got an answer on similar lines from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am still ignorant as to the reason or the justification for not giving our insurance in the Office of Public Works to an Irish insurance company.  I will continue to ask that question until I get a satisfactory explanation.  We have Irish companies. As far as I know our insurance for workmen's compensation is not lodged with an Irish insurance company. <Col N="1842" /> What can we expect from people whose interests are far removed from Ireland if the State itself gives its insurance to a foreign company?</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am interested is the Local Loans Fund.  I found that there was a good deal of duplication in regard to the control of that fund.  I understand the Cork Corporation borrowed some money some time ago from the Local Loans Fund through the Board of Works.  I am anxious to know if there is only one authority controlling the Local Loans Fund because it does seem to me that there is duplication between the Office of Public Works, the Department of Local Government and the Local Loans Fund.  I am anxious to know, too, what interest is being charged for that money this year as compared with last year and the year before.  When I have been given information by the Parliamentary Secretary on those points I will probably have an opportunity of discussing these matters more fully at a later date.  I am particularly anxious to know what happened the plant that was purchased in Dundalk in 1948.  Is it still in the hands of the Board of Works?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give some explanation in regard to the placing of the insurance with the company whose name he furnished to the House some time ago.  I am anxious that he should let the House and the country know whether any prior consultation took place with the Irish Assurance Company as to the conditions under which they would undertake the work.  That company is a State-controlled corporation, as the Parliamentary Secretary well knows. I am reliably informed that although it is a purely Irish company and a State-established corporation it is in a position to compete with big English companies and has secured business with these companies which have subsidiary companies here.  If it is in a position to do that, surely it should be in a position to secure from a State Department like the Office of Public Works business of a similar kind.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state specifically in reply <Col N="1843" /> whether the Irish Assurance Company was offered any opportunity of tendering?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested in the improvements that have been carried out at Dún Laoghaire pier.  I presume the work that is being done at the moment is of a temporary nature.  It will certainly help to tide us over the summer period but I would like to be informed whether the permanent improvement scheme that was submitted prior to 1939 will now be deferred because of the temporary reconstruction work that has been done.  Undoubtedly there has been an improvement upon the previous position but the temporary work will not stand the test of time.  It is absolutely essential that improvements of a permanent nature should be carried out at all our principal ports in order to provide proper landing facilities.  The longer that work is delayed the more costly it will be.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any idea how much the State and the taxpayers would have been saved if the permanent improvements scheme had been carried out as compared with what the work will cost if it is carried out in the <Col N="1844" /> future?  I urge him to get the commissioners and the Department of Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to look into the matter for the sole purpose of going ahead with the permanent improvements scheme as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I am pretty well acquainted with the details of that scheme but I do not want to go into them here.  I know that the running of trains between Dún Laoghaire pier and Cork or Cobh would have been cut down by as much as 55 minutes.  With the new engines now in the possession of Córas Iompair Eireann possibly the time could be cut still further.  We should ensure that when people are invited to come here they will be received at whatever port they arrive at without any of the trouble, inconvenience and confusion that existed in the past.  I have a pretty good knowledge of the facilities provided at ports in Great Britain, on the Continent and elsewhere.  We lag badly behind other countries in relation to the facilities we offer for the reception of tourists.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cut across either Deputy Hickey or Deputy McGrath in relation to what should be done in Cobh.  I have a limited knowledge and experience of the position in Cobh.  If Deputy McGrath and Deputy Hickey had experience of the landing facilities in British and continental ports they would appreciate the fact that there is considerable room for improvement in our ports.  I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of looking at the original scheme submitted prior to 1939 for the permanent improvement of Dún Laoghaire pier.  I would ask him to go ahead and finish the job as soon as possible.  The longer it is delayed the greater the cost will be eventually on the taxpayers.</P>

I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the state of the jetty at Haulbowline.  Haulbowline docks are the property of the Department of Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is at present in charge of a contract for the building of a 24-feet jetty at Haulbowline for the Department of Defence.  I understand that his office will be responsible for carrying out a 31-feet extension which will enable transatlantic tankers to be accommodated at Haulbowline.  I think it is the Department of Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary's office that will be responsible for carrying out that 31-feet extension, and I would like to know the position about it.  Will it be carried out in the coming year? It is very necessary.  Transatlantic tankers have no means of discharging at Cork Harbour unless this 31-feet extension is made.  It is very important from the point of view of the fuelling of ships.  At present we are able to fuel ships at the quays of Cork, but I understand that fuelling costs much more there, especially in the case of large ships, than at Haulbowline. Many ships that fuel in the lower harbour, as we call it, would not be coming to Cork City at all, and it is very often a big disadvantage because ships that were being repaired at Rushbrooke and other places frequently had to go across Channel for refuelling.  It would be a tremendous advantage to the port of Cork and to this country if we were able to accommodate transatlantic tankers at Haulbowline.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to use every means in his power to speed up that work.  It is work of national importance.  I feel that when the Parliamentary Secretary's attention has been drawn to it he will not put any impediment in the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to find out the position as regards piers in Cork Harbour out of which the Cork Harbour Commissioners receive no revenue whatever and which are chiefly used for the accommodation of men working in Irish <Col N="1846" /> Steel and Rushbrooke Docks.  The piers I am talking about are Ringaskiddy and Monkstown.  I do not think it is right that a body such as the Cork Harbour Commissioners should be expected to finance completely piers like that.  There is a difficulty at the moment in Ringaskiddy.  A large number of workers embark there for day and night shifts at Irish Steel and Haulbowline and the Cork Harbour Commissioners are not in a position at the moment to carry out the dredging that is necessary to accommodate a larger boat to convey these workers to Haulbowline.  I think the Office of Public Works should be responsible for that work.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to draw attention is the system of farming out work to contractors.  In Dublin and Cork men are nominated by the Parliamentary Secretary as quasi-permanent men.  These men are actually working for an outside contractor and the contract is relet every year.  Last year a new contractor was appointed.  There are about 11 men involved in Cork.  At least one of them who was 30 years in the service was displaced for a short period, five or six days.  It seems extraordinary that these 11 men should be suddenly thrown out of employment because the contract had not been arranged at the proper time, or something like that.  I could not discover any other reason for it.  The system of giving out this work to contractors and paying them, I suppose, a certain percentage commission on the work, is all wrong.  When there are architects, carpenters in charge and other people available, the Board of Works should take responsibility for carrying out the work.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to take notice of that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the point that was mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  In 1950 a similar case arose and I got in touch with the Office of Public Works at the time.  Men who had been 26 or 28 years on the job had no guarantee of being re-employed when the contractor was changed.  At that time we got a tentative agreement that all the men employed by the previous contractor would be re-employed. <Col N="1847" />  In view of the amount of work that is being done by the Board of Works in this place, it is not unreasonable that there should be somebody there who would be responsible to the Board of Works and to these men.  These men should be employed directly by the Board of Works.  It is a ridiculous arrangement that a new contractor is appointed whenever somebody feels tired of the job.  These contractors have no sense of responsibility to the men who have been employed there for the last 26 years.  It is only by chance that they are taken on by the new contractor.</P>
      <P>These matters could be dealt with. We are living in the tradition of the old system instead of adapting ourselves to our own methods and doing things in proper fashion.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see to it that this matter will be rectified, as was suggested in 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the way this Estimate has been received, for the constructive observations that have been made, particularly by my predecessor, Deputy Donnellan, and also for his very effusive compliments to the Commissioners of Public Works, with which I entirely agree.  They are working pretty hard.  Perhaps a number of people do not understand sufficiently well all the matters that have to be met from day to day in that office and do not appreciate the fact that the commissioners are dealing at one part of the day with an Embassy in Rome, and, in the next half hour, with concrete pipes for the field, in the next half hour, with some staff matter and, perhaps, with some question regarding a school building for the rest of the day.  Such multiplicity of work is daily cropping up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief matter that Deputy Donnellan referred to was arterial drainage.  He asked a number of questions regarding it and said that he believed we had not sufficient engineering staff in the office to deal with the work.  That is true.  It is very difficult to get sufficient engineering staff.  It is not so difficult to get civil engineers, <Col N="1848" /> but mechanical engineers are very difficult to get, and that is a very great problem so far as the Office of Public Works is concerned, particularly in regard to the machinery that is employed, the replacements and refittings and all that kind of thing.  But no effort is being spared in that direction.  In fact, there is a pretty good provision in this year's Estimate for the recruitment of further staff.  We have a provision of £8,500, and that is no small sum.  We hope that the response will be a good one and that we will secure the necessary staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan stated that he could not understand the great delay in carrying out arterial drainage.  He had experience of the office himself for over three years, and I suppose he understands every comma in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 and that it is quite apparent to him that arterial drainage is a very complex and difficult problem.  We are making no secret of that fact, and I think experience should indicate to everybody that that is so.</P>
    <P>So far as the schemes in operation are concerned, the Brosna, the Glyde and Dee, and the Feale, it took a considerable period of time to carry out the survey of these three rivers.  It took from three to four years.  The survey of the Corrib was undertaken in August, 1948.  Full pressure was put on, and undoubtedly Deputy Donnellan was pressing it all the time.  I took over in June, 1951, almost three years after the survey had commenced, and still it had not been completed.  They told me it would not be possible to have the survey completed until the end of October, 1951.  It was not actually completed until about the middle of November, 1951.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of the survey staff who were on the Corrib have to be retained in the office to prepare the design and plotting of the scheme, and that is still continuing.  It is in a fairly advanced stage and it is hoped to have the actual work commenced in the summer of 1953.  Deputy Donnellan stated that he was promised it would commence in 1952.  I have been insistent in inquiring into that and I have been told by the chief engineer that no <Col N="1849" /> such promise was ever made, that at all times in the opinion of the chief engineer the earliest date on which the Corrib scheme could be started and machinery put in would be the summer of 1953.  I am only stating what I have been told.  There seems to be no note on any official document to show that any promise of that kind was made. While Deputy Donnellan was rather complimentary to the Commissioners of Public Works and to a certain extent to myself, at the same time right through his statement regarding the Corrib there seemed to be an inference that we were holding it up deliberately from some ulterior motive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that that is not the case and that every possible step is being taken to ensure that the operations will start in the summer of 1953.  I think everybody will agree that I have to take directions, particularly on technical matters which I do not understand, from the people who are capable of advising me.  How can I rush them? They will tell me: &ldquo;It is all right to go in and dig and dig and dig, but that is not the proper way to carry out an arterial drainage scheme.  The survey has to be completed and the design and plotting made out&mdash;a very difficult job in itself&mdash;and then we are in a position to undertake the work.&rdquo; I have to abide by that decision.  I do not think I can say to them: &ldquo;I can get somebody else to take your place.&rdquo; That is impossible.  It is very difficult to get even junior engineers not to speak of getting engineers with experience of difficult work of this kind.  It is not possible to get them as quickly as people imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arterial drainage survey parties are now on the Moy, and we hope to augment them with a view to getting that work done as speedily as possible. According to what I have been told, because of the very complicated nature of the work it will take three years if not more to complete the survey of the Moy.  That may be unpleasant news for the people living on the banks <Col N="1850" /> of the Moy, but is much more pleasant news for them than for the people on the banks of the Suck or the Maine or the Nore, where work will not be undertaken for perhaps five years.  I am only giving these rivers as an example.  That does not mean that any of them will get priority after the river Moy survey is completed.  That is largely the position.  Of course a good deal of the preparatory work had been accomplished when Deputy Donnellan took over in respect of the Brosna, the Glyde and Dee, and the Feale.  He asked how it was that machinery was being sent from the Brosna to the Feale.  A certain amount of machinery has been sent from the Brosna, but new machinery altogether was taken to the Feale. Some of that machinery was purchased in Deputy Donnellan's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>More machines have gone to the Feale since then.  The Feale is a very difficult river to deal with, particularly at the estuary, and it is a very big problem.  The heavy machinery there will not be able to proceed up the river.  It is a smaller type of machine that will be used on the river itself and, when work on the outfall of the Feale has been completed, that machinery will be ready to go on the Corrib.  I believe that work on the estuary of the Feale will be completed in sufficient time for it to travel on to take up work on the Corrib, and in that way we are getting around.  I expect that, when work at the outfall of the Corrib commences, there will be big difficulties, too, but at the same time, with the survey of the Moy proceeding and not likely to be completed for a period from three to four years, the big machinery which is at present working on the Feale and which next year will be on the Corrib will, in turn, be transferred to the Moy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have more machinery on order, but it would not be advisable to get very much more of that type of machinery.  We have machinery on order to the amount of £35,000 for this year.  It has not yet been delivered, but when it comes along we will be nearly up to the maximum which we can use at present or for the next two years.  I want to emphasise that that big machinery can be used only on the outfalls and there would not be much point in bringing in a lot more of it and leaving it lie idle.  I do not believe in that procedure, because, even if it is only a motor car which you leave idle, no matter how you attend to it and look after it, it will deteriorate.  I can visualise a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, with Deputy Dillon as chairman, having the Chairman of the Commissioners of Public Works before it as accounting officer. If he said that he had purchased machinery that was not required for the next four years, he would get a pretty severe rap on the knuckles from the chairman.  We are doing the best we can in that respect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan and some other Deputies mentioned that there was a reduction in the Estimate for the erection of national schools.  There is a reduction in the Estimate, but this year's Estimate is based on last year's expenditure, with an addition.  We do not make our Estimates in the fashion of the person who says: &ldquo;I will lay aside £1 for to-day's expenses but will make sure to spend only 10/-.&rdquo;  I do not think that is the proper way to make out Estimates.  We hope to be able to spend what is provided for in the Estimates for the erection of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education was referred to yesterday and mention was made of their difficulties and of the difficulties of the Board of Works in dealing with such matters.  I have no responsibility for the Department of Education but I know that they have <Col N="1852" /> their difficulties, as have the Board of Works who act as agents for them. Very often, when the Board of Works architects have gone to the trouble of making out designs and plans for the erection of a school, some local interest finds that the plans should be altered, that it should be a three-roomed instead of a four-roomed school, or a four-roomed instead of a three-roomed school.  We have met cases of that kind and it means that the work has to start all over again, and not merely are the Board of Works held up but the Department is held up.  We come across all these snags in these matters from time to time.  We are quite anxious to go ahead with the erection of new schools and the reconstruction of old schools and I think that very valuable and good work has been done. In many areas, it is difficult enough to find a bad school, while in other areas you will find a great number of bad schools.  I do not think the charge in that respect, however, can be laid at the door of the Department of Education or of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath asked a question with regard to Haulbowline jetty.  He asked whether the new jetty at present under construction could be extended to give a greater depth of water alongside.  The present scheme, which is expected to be completed by the end of September, provides for a minimum depth of over 21 feet at low water at ordinary spring tides and the scheme does not preclude an extension so as to provide greater depth if that should be considered necessary at a later stage, but I take it from Deputy McGrath that what he has in mind is commercial ships coming in there.  If that is so, I think it is the Department of Industry and Commerce which would have the first responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations have been going on with the Department of Defence in connection with this extension&mdash;which was agreed to before Fianna Fáil went out of office&mdash;to have a jetty with 31 feet of water at low spring tides.  That was agreed to but it was left in abeyance.  When the harbour commissioners met the Minister <Col N="1853" /> for Defence, they were anxious to have the present contract concluded as there had been a bit of difficulty with the contractors, as the Parliamentary Secretary is probably aware, and it was expected that a new contract would be entered into for this 31 feet depth, which is most important for the accommodation of transatlantic tankers.  There is the largest fuel storage accommodation in the country at Haulbowline and ships were previously bunkered there.  It is absolutely necessary that this work should be proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, we can only consider that case when it comes along, but I do not think we are the people concerned with it, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell asked what was the total estimated cost of the improvement work at the Dún Laoghaire mail boat pier.  The total cost of the scheme is £35,000, of which £20,000 falls to be met in the current financial year.  The new high level customs enclosure is capable of being used now and the scheme as a whole should be finished in a few months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin mentioned further extensions, something which was visualised in 1939.  I believe that owing to the war they had to be left aside, but I do know that conferences in respect to them were held during the past year. I do not think that anything definite has taken shape yet other than that the matters are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance was mentioned by Deputy Hickey and also by Deputy Davin.  As I have pointed out in replies in this House, the placing of insurance is governed by an Act of this Dáil which made it possible for firms with brokers in this country to get insurance here. The same applies to the Board of Works as to any other State Department; there is no difference.  All insurance companies in this country in my opinion were quite well aware that tenders would be accepted from them and a number of them did tender but were not successful.  This firm we have been talking about was and I think <Col N="1854" /> that it is obvious to everybody why they were successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that if Irish insurance companies tendered at a competitive figure they would get it. This was not done in order to show favour to any outside firm; it was purely a business matter.  I do not know what the tenders were.  I have not asked for them, but I do believe that if Irish firms tendered as low as the others they would have got it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary at all because I am quite satisfied&mdash;I will be frank&mdash; that he is not getting the necessary information.  Surely priority should be given to insurance companies in this country over foreign companies.  Why is it that I have been trying by question after question in this House to find out why it was not given to an Irish company?  Why have I been denied information all the time?  If an Irish company's tender is a little higher than an English company's is there anything wrong in a Department of State accepting the tender of the Irish company?  There are 62 or 63 syndicates and 52 or 53 foreign insurance companies in operation in this country.  How are Irish insurance companies to survive if a Department of State gives its insurance to foreign companies?  Officials of the Government were sent to America and spent two or three months looking for insurance in America and here we have a Department of State giving insurance to a foreign company.  I am quite satisfied that if you were to express your view, as I know you, you would say that you are not getting the information.</P>

Surely the Department, therefore, could bear their own risk.  What profits have insurance companies got from your office?</P>

      <P>Someone mentioned the profits earned by insurance companies from the policies held by the Board of Works.  I am convinced that whatever profits they made were lower&mdash;because their tender was lower&mdash;than the profits which would have been made by any of the other companies which submitted a higher tender.  I think that that is logical enough.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley mentioned the Garden of Remembrance, and asked what progress has been made.  It was talked about here for a number of years.  The Rotunda was taken over for a particular business.  This place was taken over by the Department of Health.  In July, 1951, the Minister for Health stated that steps were being taken to find alternative accommodation.  Until that alternative accommodation is found we cannot do anything more and we must await that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the Custom House Memorial.  The scheme for the improvement of the Custom House surroundings, which included the construction of new roadways, a central stone feature, the planting of the ground, the rearranging of the gate entrances, the provision of car-parking space and the adjustment of the surrounding railings, following the construction of the new link road is virtually completed.  The new link road is at present under construction by the Corporation of Dublin and should be completed by August.  In conjunction with this work, the railings are being adjusted.  On the completion of the new link road some additional paths will be constructed.  The bronze castings for a fountain have been made and will be placed <i>in situ</i> shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A site has been reserved for the <Col N="1858" /> Custom House Memorial Committee for a memorial to those who lost their lives in the Custom House in 1921. Following a competition held by the Custom House Memorial Committee, an appropriate design was selected. The sculptor who prepared this design has since emigrated, and the question of securing an alternative design is being considered by the committee.  It has been decided to afford the memorial committee some extra assistance to complete their task, and this is being arranged.</P>

The matter is still under consideration.  We have no information about the report of the Dutch engineer on Tramore back strand.</P>
      <P>Possibly it also is with the Department of Agriculture.  He also mentioned something about the firm of consultants that were brought over here to improve the administrative side of the various Departments.  I understand they were over in the Department of the Board of Works.  These business consultants have been engaged for the past 12 months on an examination of the employment and organising scheme side of what they describe as &ldquo;preventive maintenance machinery&rdquo;. They have made certain recommendations which have been accepted and put into operation.  I read a great deal of the report, but, with all due respect to these consultants, I will say that we could get just as valuable advice in this country for less money.</P>

      <P>He also mentioned the engineering staff.  We had already got authority for 32 engineers and nine draftsmen for work with the Department of Agriculture.  This staff has not been at any time up to full strength.  These are temporary posts and there is normally a difficulty in recruiting engineers for such posts.  I think I have answered practically all the points that were raised in the course of the debate and that I have made a case for the Estimate.  There are decreases shown in respect to certain items but I believe at the same time that these decreases are not actual decreases.  They are nominal decreases.  The Estimate which has been submitted to the House for the various services, so far as the Office of Public Works is concerned, is a pretty firm Estimate and the amounts provided for will be expended during the coming year, unlike amounts in some other Estimates.  It is easy enough to bring in an Estimate before the House and then to carry over unexpended balances at the end of the year, but I think it is better to have a firm Estimate and then, if necessary, go for a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year when you find how things are going on.  That is better than to have overestimation as we have had for a number of years.  I do not think there is much overestimation here and the money asked for in this Vote will, we hope, be expended on the various services for which it is being provided.</P>

Is he obliged by law or by regulations to give this insurance cover to the company that puts in the lowest tender, whether it be a foreign or a national company, or must he send a recommendation from his Department to the Minister for <Col N="1861" /> Finance?

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that it would be better business and more economical, if the insurance companies were cut out altogether?  The Cork County Council is a much smaller body than the Office of Public Works and it takes on responsibility for its own insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act and other Acts.  I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary would not take on the risks that would be likely to accrue to the Office for which he has responsibility. I believe that, if he were to do so, <Col N="1862" /> eventually there would be a saving of money.  The insurance companies, of course, are only out to get business and to make profits for themselves.  A great deal of money is expended annually by the Office which the Parliamentary Secretary is in charge of, and I think it could bear the risks involved itself, and need not trouble about any insurance company.</P>

      <P>Under this Vote funds are provided for the annual programme of works to give employment in urban and rural areas to men in receipt of unemployment assistance; and also for other related services, including the rural improvements scheme, which are a useful aid to the relief of unemployment. The provision also covers the salaries, travelling expenses, etc., of the staff of the special employment schemes office responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services covered by the Estimate for 1952-53 are the same as those for <Col N="1863" /> which a provision of £752,000 was originally made in 1951-52, but during that year it became necessary to provide additional funds for expenditure under sub-head I&mdash;Development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers; and under sub-head K&mdash;Rural Improvements Scheme.  For this purpose a supplementary Vote of £35,000 was passed in February, 1952, so that the total amount available for expenditure in 1951-52 was £787,000 plus a sum of £8,190 transferred to Vote 10 from the Vote for Increases in Remuneration.</P>
    <P>As compared with the amount originally voted for 1951-52, therefore, the proposed provision for 1952-53 shows an increase of £256,000.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimates Volume was printed it has been decided to increase the provision under sub-head I&mdash;Bog Development Schemes&mdash;to £150,000, leaving the total of the Vote to stand at £1,008,000 in anticipation of possible savings which may occur in connection with the execution of the many and varied types of schemes covered by the Vote.</P>
    <P>Compared with the original provisions in 1951-52 the principal increases are:&mdash;sub-head H&mdash;Minor Employment Schemes&mdash;£95,000 increased by £25,000 to £120,000; sub-head I&mdash;Bog Development Schemes&mdash;£90,000 increased by £60,000 to £150,000; sub-head K&mdash;Rural Improvements Scheme&mdash;£125,000 increased by £50,000 to £175,000; and sub-head L&mdash;Miscellaneous Schemes&mdash; £52,100 increased by £149,760 to £201,860.</P>
    <P>The provisions in sub-heads A to E of the Vote are to cover the administrative expenses of the staff of the special employment schemes office. They call for no special comment as the increased figure in sub-head A is virtually offset by increases in remuneration which were provided for by special Vote in 1951-52.</P>
    <P>Provision for employment schemes in the various urban and rural units of area is made under sub-heads F, G and H.  The moneys are distributed broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients resident in each area.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I is <Col N="1864" /> for the repair or construction of roads and drains serving bogs used principally by landowners, who produce turf for their domestic requirements and for sale in neighbouring towns.  The increased provision this year is intended to encourage a greater production of native fuel.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J, provision £40,000, is to render available similar facilities in bogs acquired by local authorities to produce turf for their own needs.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head K&mdash; Rural Improvements Scheme&mdash;is for the purpose of carrying out works to benefit the lands of groups of landholders, including small drainage schemes and the construction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands and bogs.  State grants ranging from 75 per cent. to 95 per cent. of the cost of approved works are made available, subject to contribution of the balance of the cost by the benefiting landholders.  The landholders' contributions are graduated in relation to the average poor law valuations of the farms served, and in cases where the work is of substantial benefit to members of the general public in addition to the immediate beneficiaries the percentage of State grants may be increased.  The additional provision included in the Estimates for 1952-53 has been found necessary owing to the increasing number of applications which are being received.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L&mdash;Miscellaneous Schemes. The provision in this sub-head is mainly for contributions towards the cost of major harbour works, the amount of the contribution in each case being governed by the labour content of the work.  The remainder of the provision in the sub-head is required to meet any cases of unemployment or of an emergency nature which may be brought to notice during the course of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one thing which I thought the Parliamentary Secretary might have referred to, and that was the position of this office. Quite a lot of Deputies, at least in my time, thought that the special employment schemes office was something to be looked down on.  Indeed, some Deputies thought that it was an office that should not exist at all, but, as far as I was concerned and, I think, Deputies generally representing rural constituencies, we regarded it as a very important office.  I want to say that during the three and a half years in which I had responsibility in that office I discovered that it was an office in which there could never be any progress made, for the simple reason that the inspectors and engineers who came into it were all on a temporary basis.  They came in simply because they had no other place to go. They were barely trained into the type of work, of course, and the moment they saw something with a better outlook and some greater hope before them, they immediately left.  The result was that every year, on two or three occasions, boards were set up to interview engineers and inspectors who <Col N="1866" /> were required, because no sooner had you got them in than they were off again.</P>
      <P>I felt in my time that something should be done to remedy that.  I felt that the engineers and inspectors we had down the country were very hard and loyal workers&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me&mdash;and that they should not be, so to speak, hanging at the end of a silk thread, that the office should not be in the position that no sooner were some engineers recruited than they were away to some other place where they had a brighter future.  To prevent that I worked in a certain direction, namely, to have the office established. Now, from this side of the House, where I am more free to speak than when I was sitting on the other side, I must offer my congratulations to the Director&mdash;and to the previous Director, now the Chief Inspector&mdash;for the way they co-operated with me to have that office established.  I also offer congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary on the fact of the office now being established.  Establishment is there, the officers are not of a temporary nature and the office has come to stay.</P>
      <P>I notice a sum for minor employment schemes, showing an increase of £20,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it be £20,000 or £25,000 that is not enough. In my own county, Galway&mdash;the same county as the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;£76,000 was spent last year under another Act, the Local Authorities (Works) Act and this year only £5,000 is being spent in that county.  That will mean a great increase in unemployment.  The selfsame thing will apply to every other county.  While the Parliamentary Secretary tells me that for minor employment schemes there is an increase of £20,000 or £25,000, to me it is only like putting <Col N="1867" /> salt in cabbage; it will not in any way compare with the expenditure previously under the Works Act, which is now completely cut off by the present Government.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into that, especially in his own county and mine and such counties where that scheme operates.</P>

      <P>No, places such as Kerry, West Cork, Donegal and counties like that, where that scheme used to operate generally, as in those areas we had more unemployment than in any other place.</P>
      <P>I come now to the rural improvements scheme.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not take anything I say as being personal.  I heard him read from his brief to-day about the rural improvements scheme as it operates at present, but I listened to him in places in North Mayo during the past fortnight, especially last Sunday at Belmullet, saying he did not believe in the present rural improvement scheme as it is worked. I hope now that I am not taking an unfair advantage when I say that my only answer to the Parliamentary Secretary is that, if he does not believe that the scheme is working in a right and proper fashion he has been there for the past 12 months&mdash;why did he not change it?</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was explaining that rural improvements scheme to the people of North Mayo&mdash;and his heart bleeding for the poor people down there on the eve of a by-election&mdash;he told them that it was a Fianna Fáil scheme.  There are many Fianna Fáil schemes and there are many Fianna Fáil &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with this if the Parliamentary Secretary allows me.  When I came into office I examined that scheme&mdash;or &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;, one might call it&mdash;where the people <Col N="1868" /> contributed 25 per cent. of the cost&mdash; that is, where there were two qualified, those two contributed the 25 per cent. and the State contributed 75 per cent. At that time, I think £20,000 was spent by the State every year.  What did I find in areas that did not qualify because they had not the number of registered unemployed when they looked for this &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;?  Engineers and inspectors were sent on the job, but 19 out of every 20 of those applications were eventually turned down, after they had been surveyed, estimated, etc., for the simple reason that the poor people who did not actually qualify for the minor employment scheme to get a full cost grant were not able to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost.  I found, however, that, in the richer areas where people had £200 or £300 valuation and had probably 500 or 1,000 acres of land and wanted an avenue up to their doors, they applied, they were damn well able to contribute the 25 per cent., and they did so; and it was into areas of that description that most of the £20,000 went and not into the areas where it should have gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came before this House to make what I thought was a very honest change, that it should be on a valuation basis, that where you had a low valuation such as £5 they should get 95 or 100 per cent. full cost grant. Where the valuation was £5 to £7 they should get 90 or 93 per cent.  That idea would run roughly up to £18 valuation and from that on they should be asked to contribute the 25 per cent. as in the old scheme.  But when I brought that before this House, the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;who was in Belmullet last Sunday and his heart bleeding for the poor low valuation, down-trodden people of North Mayo&mdash;was the very man who opposed that scheme in this House.  He is the very man who said in North Mayo that he did not believe it should be so.  If that is the case, I ask him now, through the Chair, why he does not abolish it.  Why does he not go back again to the £500 or £600 valuation man and give it to him?  I think it is very unfair of the Parliamentary Secretary to carry on in that way and <Col N="1869" /> to give the impression to the people of North Mayo that what he knows to be the truth is not the truth.  The proof of that scheme is plain to be seen if only in respect of the increase in the amount of money.  I think that at that time only £20,000 was spent on it.  It has increased considerably because the poor people to whom I have referred can qualify.  They are able to pay the small contributions that are asked from them.  I hope that if the Parliamentary Secretary attempts to make any change he will come before this House and let us know about it.  I warn the Parliamentary Secretary that any change he attempts to make, other than a change for the better, will be strenuously opposed by me.  It will receive as serious opposition from me as I received from the Parliamentary Secretary when he was sitting on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that none of us who were members of the last Dáil will forget the accusations of jobbery and trickery made against me by Deputy Killilea.  We all remember how he used to say that I used that office for political purposes.  How often did I sit through an adjournment debate and have to listen to his violent abuse of me, not to talk of his abuse of me in Galway and in the Province of Connacht?  I am sorry that Deputy Killilea is not in the House now.  In view of the accusations which were made by Deputy Killilea while I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, I defy the present Parliamentary Secretary to point a finger to anything which I did for political purposes.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to say that I gave any appointment outside the advice of the officials of that Department.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary to say that I was responsible for appointments which were not given on merit alone but which were given through the political trickery to which Deputy Killilea used to refer.  In view of all these accusations and in view of the fact that the present Parliamentary Secretary now has the information available to him, I ask him to be honest about the matter and to reply to my question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> I know the rules which prevail in the Office of Public Works.  Appointments have to be made&mdash;and damn little thanks any man ever got for making appointments.  That is my view.  Any appointment that is made in that office &mdash;any appointment that I ever made in that office or, I am sure, that the present Parliamentary Secretary will ever make in that office&mdash;was and is and will be made on the advice of the officials of that Department.  That is the rule and it must be carried out.</P>
    <P>I desire to avail of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the officials of the Board of Works.  While I was Parliamentary Secretary I received many letters from people in different parts of the country who wanted a road built to the bog or to the village or to their house.  I may say that the Parliamentary Secretary who was in office previous to me also received such letters, and I am sure that the present Parliamentary Secretary receives them also.  On many occasions I tried to get the work they wrote about carried out for them.  I used to call on the chief inspector and very often on the director to discuss such matters with them.  Very frequently things which I badly wanted to be carried out could not be carried out with a full cost grant.  The fact of the matter is that the Act was there, and that the provisions of the Act had to be complied with.  Probably I was often blamed for not taking a certain course of action, but the position was that the money had to be spent as the Act stated it should be spent.  I am sure the present Parliamentary Secretary has experienced the same state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the cooperation and the goodwill of the officials of the Department.  While I was Parliamentary Secretary I heard Deputies in this House say that the officials of the Board of Works found no difficulty in refusing to grant requests, and that they used to have a smile on their faces when refusing people.  I deny that there is any truth in such a statement.  The officials of the Board of Works do their best within the meaning of the Act.  I only hope&mdash;I believe they will&mdash;that they <Col N="1871" /> will be as loyal to the present Parliamentary Secretary as they were to me. If they are, I am sure he will pay the same tribute to them as I am paying to them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Vote so far as the poor areas of this country are concerned.  I desire clarification by the Parliamentary Secretary on a number of points. At the outset I want to say that any help that we can afford to people living in isolated parts of this country is definitely due to them because the people in those areas are labouring under many disadvantages.  They are the real old Irish stock and the backbone of this country.  In view of the huge cost of public services in this country at present, and having regard to the conditions that obtain in the areas to which I have referred, I consider that this Vote should be at least twice the size which it is.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works confers a dual benefit.  In addition to giving farmers and other people living in isolated districts an opportunity of having drainage works carried out, of getting roads leading to their houses made, and bogs developed, the workers in those districts are given opportunities of productive employment.  I do not say that it is the present Parliamentary Secretary's fault but, unfortunately, since he assumed office the position has changed very much so far as West Cork is concerned, and I am sure so far as other parts of the country are concerned also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As its name implies, the Office of Public Works is the employment schemes office.  I assume from that, that its chief responsibility is to provide productive employment for workers in rural Ireland.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should take very serious cognisance of the position that obtains at the present time.  In West Cork, particularly in the remote areas such as the Berehaven Peninsula, Schull and Goleen Peninsulas, almost 60 or 70 per cent. of the workers are unemployed at the present time. Those who are employed are employed <Col N="1872" /> only two or three days weekly.  In those areas work is rotated.  I do not know whether Deputy Donnellan let the cat out of the bag when he mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary that they should satisfy North Galway and South Galway whatever about the other areas, as I am doubtful if the money is apportioned proportionately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that with any intention of casting a reflection on Deputy Donnellan, but West Cork is not getting its fair proportion of the money which is made available for schemes from the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  There is no doubt at all about that.  West Cork is one of the poorest constituencies and the people there find it very difficult to live.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that could happen Cork so far as the Parliamentary Secretary's office is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount we got under the minor employment schemes and rural employment schemes last year is negligible having regard to the area covered.  There is no doubt about that.  The same could be said in respect of the other development schemes.  A few thousand pounds are allocated under each heading.  Having regard to the position which obtains in West Cork and having regard to the size of the area, the few thousand pounds allocated under these headings are of no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information, whether correct or incorrect, so far as the current financial year is concerned, is that there is only one area in West Cork which will benefit under unemployment schemes. I do not know whether it is on the system of the number of registered unemployed or on the number of those drawing unemployment assistance that the money is allocated.  I believe that must be a very tight system.  I find that it is only the Berehaven Peninsula in West Cork that will benefit.  The Berehaven Peninsula would need 20 times what it is getting from the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  I fail to see why such poor areas as Goleen <Col N="1873" /> do not benefit.  What is happening in Cork may happen in Kerry and Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to believe it could happen in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is happening all right.  You are wiping our eyes.  I believe that the whole position should be reviewed.  As I have already stated, it takes over £100,000,000 to run the public services of this country.  I believe that the small farmers and workers living in those isolated areas are definitely entitled to a bigger slice of that £100,000,000 than they are getting at present.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the many benefits this measure confers on the people.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take cognisance of the unemployment position.  He would be quite justified in coming before the Dáil to ask for a Supplementary Vote to meet the unemployment position in the areas I have mentioned.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary would have the blessing of all the unemployed workers in the West and South of Ireland if he adopted that attitude.  If we spent the money on the development of bogs in the rural districts it would improve the lot of the people to whom I have referred&mdash;people who are finding it difficult to eke out an existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan pointed out that the reduction in the amounts allocated under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is responsible for increasing unemployment and for the withdrawal of many schemes that would be of general benefit to the people in those areas. Many of the works carried out under this Act were somewhat similar to the works carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  Since the Department of Local Government have failed entirely in their duty and have reduced the amount made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to local authorities to carry out essential works, I believe it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to say they have failed in their duty and to rectify the position.  That is one line the Parliamentary Secretary could take if he thought fit to increase the amount <Col N="1874" /> under the various sub-heads in this Vote.</P>
    <P>I know that the rural improvement scheme is a first-class one.  There is no doubt about that.  The State contributions are very reasonable.  I agree with the former Parliamentary Secretary, when he says that the valuation system is the best system that could be devised for allocating moneys.  Any group of farmers with less than an average valuation of £6 are entitled to a 95 per cent. grant. The grants are graded down to 75 per cent. according to valuation.  I think that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>My main grievance, in so far as the rural improvement schemes are concerned, is the undue delay between the date of the application and the date the work is to be carried out.  I see no justifiable reason why 14 months, on an average, should intervene.  If a group of farmers make an application to-day for a drainage scheme or anything of that sort I cannot see why it should not be ready for implementation within six months.  At the present time, if my information is correct&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;it takes 14 months.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to talk this matter over with responsible officials in the Department and try to reduce the time to at most six months.  I think that would be very important.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of bog development schemes we only got a little over £1,000 last year.  I cannot say that was a fair proportion for our part of the country.  In many places you have undeveloped bogs.  It is very difficult to develop them.  It would take definitely an amount of money to do so, since you have to make roads and carry out extensive drainage works. It is often difficult for private individuals to get grants to carry out this work as it may be deemed to benefit only the person who owns the bog. Every effort should be made to facilitate any person with undeveloped bogs in the mountains and places like that. You will find these undeveloped bogs in the valleys between the hills. Every effort should be made to give facilities to those people who have those bogs to develop them.  Some of <Col N="1875" /> the money we are sending to England to purchase coal could be kept at home if we developed our bogs.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very difficult to find fault with those schemes.  My main grievance is that the money allocated is entirely inadequate.  People in the rural districts are entitled to everything we can give them.  The majority of the members of this House know the difficulties with which people have had to contend for years past.  They have small weekly incomes.  I believe we should help them, and the best way to help them is to give them all the money they require under this particular Act for essential schemes.  By doing that, the Parliamentary Secretary will be doing a good day's work for the country and for those people, and he will be calling down the blessing of God upon himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first speaker was my predecessor in office, Deputy Donnellan.  He mentioned the question of the engineering staff.  I entirely agree with points he made.  It was very difficult, as far as the special employment schemes office was concerned, to carry on in view of the fact that all the engineering staff were unestablished and engaged on a temporary basis.  That state of affairs was the cause of grave dissatisfaction.  We now have four Grade II inspectors and 12 Grade III inspectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this improvement <Col N="1876" /> in status will encourage young engineers to offer themselves to us for employment in future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan said that the money for the minor employment schemes was not sufficient, even though the sum allocated shows a vast in crease.  The Deputy said, and so did Deputy M. Murphy, that this was due to the reduction in the money allocated under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts.  I am not responsible for the Local Authorities (Works) Acts nor is this Estimate.  However, I do know that the £5,000 mentioned is only a token Vote, and that there is a great deal more to come.  I wish to point out to both Deputies that, as far as minor employment schemes are concerned, they were only intended to provide employment during the bleak period from November to March.  They were never meant to be operated in the late spring, in the summer period or in the early harvest.  We are sticking to that rule, and I believe it to be a sound rule.</P>
      <P>The schemes established under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts are altogether different in my opinion. Such schemes are meant to deal with certain drainage works, with roads and with the relieving of flooding.  In my opinion, the proper time to have such works carried on is in the dry period of the year and, consequently, the question of minor employment schemes being substituted for the Local Authorities (Works) Acts schemes does not arise at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan castigated me very severely regarding rural improvement schemes.  I feel that he did not present the facts fairly.  He said that I opposed them in this House.  If my memory serves me correctly, what really happened in this House was this: members of Deputy Donnellan's own Party brought in a motion requesting the then Parliamentary Secretary and his Government to increase the State contribution from 75 per cent. to 90 per cent.  This matter was debated here for some time, though not for very long, because the motion had been allocated only a certain time.  As far as my memory serves me, Deputy Donnellan informed the <Col N="1877" /> two framers of the motion&mdash;Deputies Beirne and Commons&mdash;that he would look into the matter if they withdrew the motion.  I objected to the withdrawal of the motion, because I wanted to have the matter decided definitely.</P>
    <P>I feel I was very fair to Deputy Donnellan in Belmullet on Sunday last when I said that he made a vast improvement in the rural improvement schemes as far as the poorer areas were concerned.  There is no objection to that.  It would be very difficult to change the situation now, but if I had been in the Deputy's place when the alteration was made I would still have had a flat rate for the entire country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formed the belief that at the time the Deputy would have been well advised to accept the motion framed by Deputies Beirne and Commons.  In my opinion, while the present position is undoubtedly a big advantage to the poorer areas&mdash;it is giving them the full cost grant if you like&mdash;at the same time there is a considerable amount of delay entailed checking up on valuations in county council offices.  We know that for some years a number of people have had three or four demand notes, perhaps under different names, though intended for the same persons.  That means a considerable amount of delay in that respect.  There are not so many farmers with a valuation of £1,000 in this country.  We have not so many of this category of farmer even in the rich counties of Laois and Offaly which Deputy Davin represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation could arise where a number of farmers could be living in a district and where some very big farmer would be in amongst them near the end of the road who would have his valuation counted with theirs.  The result would be that the other farmers would be penalised, and the big farmer would not give a pin whether or not rural improvement schemes were allocated.  In this case <Col N="1878" /> all the valuations would be averaged. It will, therefore, be admitted that there are some snags with regard to rural improvement schemes, even though I do admit they are a vast improvement as far as the poorer areas are concerned, and that satisfied me, and I said in Belmullet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend mentioning here what transpired between Deputy Donnellan and other Deputies in North Galway.  I am not going to go into these matters, but I would like to mention one matter which was brought up in this House with regard to the allocating of jobs.  I am not saying that the men appointed were not all right. However, the paymaster system is a system in which I do not believe.  I could appoint paymasters all over Mayo since I took office, but I would not do so.  I could also appoint paymasters in Kerry and in Clare.  However, I would not do so, because I believe that it is better to pay the people direct from the office.  That ensures that the money goes into the home directly by means of a paying order just as the money paid by the county councils does.  If the money is paid by cash and if the local public-house happens to be situated between the scheme of works and the employee's home the temptation to go into the public-house will be very strong.  The result will be that all the money will not go into the home. <Col N="1879" /> However, the weekly or fortnightly pay docket paid direct from the central office will ensure the housewife will receive it all.</P>
    <P>He could not be going home and saying: &ldquo;I had so many days broken time that you knew nothing about and that is why I have only so much this week.&rdquo;  But when the pay packet would be there she would have full knowledge of what that man's weekly wage was. That is the only objection I have to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>The above amounts were expended on those schemes.  As far as the West Cork people are concerned <Col N="1880" /> they will get unemployment assistance in due proportion to any other part of the country.  There has never been any differentiation in that way.  That is how it was calculated in the office.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking some time ago on the Supplementary Estimate I brought a certain matter to the attention of the Deputies in regard to the manner of making enquiries in relation to schemes.  I do not blame new Deputies at all but Deputies who have been in the House for 30 years and who should understand every detail regarding minor employment schemes, bog development schemes and rural improvement schemes, send in queries to the office and give such vague details that it would take a month in the office to trace them.  As a result of that I have got the director to prepare a letter which I have sent out. I hope it was not an insult to the older Deputies on to those who understood the routine.  In a case like that you cannot have segregation thus inferring that some people were so unintelligent that they had to be reminded.  However, if they will only apply that in making their inquiries it will expedite matters considerably.  It is as simple almost as a telegram.  There are only a few headings concerned&mdash;the county, the rural district, the townland, the nature of the work and the name of the correspondent.  If that is submitted I will guarantee that it will not be so long before they get a reply showing what the real position is.  That is all I have to say and I am thankful to the Deputies for letting me off so lightly.</P>
