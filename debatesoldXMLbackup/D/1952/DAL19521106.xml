      <P>Out of the Estimate provision of £10,000, payments totalling £5,000 have to date been made to An Chomhairle Ealaíon on foot of the grant payable to them in respect of the current financial year.</P>
      <P>I have no information regarding the amount or object of the actual disbursements that have been made by the council out of the grant.

      <P>It is not possible to give the particulars sought in respect of persons resident in Ireland (excluding the Six Counties) <Col N="1046" /> but not citizens of Ireland.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, however, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the available particulars regarding purchases of land by persons not citizens of Ireland and in respect of which the 25 per cent. stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, was paid. The information available does not distinguish between purchases by noncitizens resident here and those resident outside.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>VALUE and acreage of sales in respect of which the 25 per cent. stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, was paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the low price available for hides and skins in the home market, he will now remove the restrictions on the export of these goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Restrictions on the export of hides and skins are necessary to ensure adequate supplies for the home tanners.</P>
      <P>As part of comprehensive arrangements designed to encourage the development of carcase beef exports, the hides derived from that trade are permitted to be exported, as well as hides shown to be surplus to home needs.  There is no surplus of native sheep skins.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in present circumstances no relaxation of the existing export restrictions would be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of this ban farmers and butchers have been compelled to pay millions of pounds in subsidies to local tanneries?  At the moment, there are skins and hides rotting in this country because the ban will not be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Donegal is in a peculiar position, due to the fact that buying there has ceased?  I think that in that county the situation has been, and is, worse than anywhere else due to its geographical situation and to the cost of transporting hides to the tanneries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a special position in Donegal.  It is not that buying has ceased but that selling has ceased.  With regard to the supplementary question asked by Deputy Lehane, if I have any information that <Col N="1048" /> there is a stock of hides anywhere which is not needed, I shall take the matter up with the Tanners' Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the reply, may I say that selling in Donegal has ceased due to the fact that 4d. per lb. is the highest price offered by buyers for hides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Hides are sold on a different basis in Donegal to the rest of the country.  There is an objection there, I gather, to the system of grading which is the normal system throughout the rest of the country. The situation has been receiving attention but I do not want to hold out any prospect that a different system of buying hides can be instituted to that which prevails for the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the grading system not just a pure racket to get hides cheaply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been directed to a statement attributed to the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and published in a Dublin evening paper on the 28th October, 1952, and in the Dublin morning papers of the 29th October, 1952, as having been conveyed to a Deputy of Dáil Éireann, regarding certain alterations in services on a Dublin City bus route; whether the conditions of appointment of the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann included any provisions governing the issue of information to Deputies of Dáil Éireann, and whether he will take steps with a view to preventing a recurrence of the procedure followed in this case and of ensuring that the practice which has hitherto obtained will be reverted to whereby such information will in future be conveyed to the general public through the Public Relations Officer, Córas Iompair Éireann, by means of a general Press announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the reports to which the question refers and which were, I understand, based upon a personal <Col N="1049" /> letter sent to a Deputy by the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann concerning certain alterations in the service on a Dublin City bus route.</P>
      <P>The conditions of appointment of the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann do not include any provisions governing the issue of information to Deputies of Dáil Éireann.  While it is open to Deputies to make inquiries from the board in regard to matters affecting their constituencies, nevertheless I consider it desirable that information concerning decisions of the board on matters of general public interest should be conveyed to the public through the normal channels of the board, and I propose to convey this view to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this has been the practice for quite a considerable time, that letters similar to this have been addressed to members of all Parties in this House and that at least it has been claimed that the majority of these letters were sent to members of the Fianna Fáil party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is hard enough to squeeze information out of Córas Iompair Éireann without giving them any excuse to clamp down on the giving of information through any source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the practice of Córas Iompair Éireann to write direct to private individuals, to members of organisations, and to organisations themselves which are responsible associations giving particulars on request about their services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but in the particular case to which the question refers the matter was one of considerable public controversy and, in such cases, I think that the board should be at pains to avoid the suspicion of being influenced by political considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, within the last three weeks, a letter was addressed, concerning the extension of a very necessary new service, to a very prominent member of the Minister's own Party in reply to a <Col N="1050" /> letter which he had addressed to the chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann?  I saw it in the public Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to prevent Deputies getting information concerning their constituencies from the board, but where decisions are taken by the board which are of general public interest there should be at least simultaneous publication through the normal channels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disagreeing at all with that, but I want to dissipate the attempt which is being made in this question to suggest that only a member or members of a particular political Party get this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the nature of the Minister's statement, I want to ask him are we to be in the position, say, in the future that, if I address a letter to the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board or to the chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation about a matter of general policy rather than one dealing with my own constituency, the chairman of either of these bodies is not going to be allowed to reply to me directly on a question of general policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Deputy should get information upon matters of general policy in advance of the rest of the public.  My view is that announcements on matters of general policy should be made through the normal publicity channels.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is a substantial amount of turf of good quality in the Rathangan area of County Kildare for which the owners can find no market; and if he will take steps to have such turf purchased immediately by the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna for use at Allenwood or Portarlington.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are some relatively small quantities of hand-won turf at present unsold in the Rathangan area of County Kildare.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the statement of Government policy in relation to the disposal of this year's hand-won turf crop, which was set out in an official announcement issued to the Press on 14th June last.</P>
      <P>That statement was issued in order, firstly, that producers would take advantage of any market offering while conditions are favourable; secondly, that producers would know the market prospects and realise that there is nothing to gain by holding back stocks in the hope of higher prices; thirdly, that they would be aware that the services of the turf marketing section of Bord na Móna are available, free of charge, to assist them in marketing their production; and, finally, that if they had unsold turf on hands at the end of the winter, they had an assured market for such supplies at the price it would normally command at that time.</P>

In view of that will the Minister take steps to ensure that Bord na Móna will step in before the end of the winter?

As a result of a price adjustment the amount was subsequently raised to $593,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be based on a misconception of the financial structure of the National Health Insurance system.</P>
      <P>The contributions payable under the National Health Insurance Acts by insured persons and their employers are solely for cash payments in respect of sickness, disablement, maternity and marriage, and there is no content in them for the provision of dental benefit or any of the other benefits made available under the scheme of additional benefits administered by my Department. The income from the contributions payable under the Acts, which is not, in fact, sufficient to meet the payments for sickness, disablement, maternity and marriage, is augmented considerably by State grants and by interest on investments.  It is only when, after the payment of these benefits, there is a disposable surplus of income that additional benefits may be provided.  It will be clear, therefore, that as contributions are not charged for additional benefits and as entitlement to them does not derive directly from such contributions a refund of portion of them to insured persons cannot be made in view of the fact that dental benefit is not at present available.</P>

      <P>The consulting engineer engaged by the Dingle Harbour Commissioners to make a preliminary survey of the harbour <Col N="1066" /> recommended, as an alternative to dredging, that consideration be given to the question of erecting a jetty at a point in the harbour where he considered recurrent dredging of an extensive nature would not be necessary.  It has been decided that the suggestion would not suit the fishery interests.  With a view to proceeding with the dredging necessary in the fishery interests it is intended on the advice of the Office of Public Works to ask the harbour commissioners at an early date to have a close survey made of the area between the pier and the deep water and soundings plotted.  I cannot at present say when the actual dredging operations may commence.</P>

      <P>and <b>Dr. Esmonde</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the fact that an Bord Iascaigh Mhara have recently marketed Scottish kippers despite the fact that prime Irish herrings were procurable for kippering; and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara not to import kippers when home landings of herrings are available in sufficient quantity to meet the demand for kippers.  On a recent occasion a consignment of Scottish kippers reached the board when herring landings had commenced but I understand that the sale of the landings or of the kippers made therefrom was not adversely affected by the imported kippers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

In view of the fact that there are firm contracts which have to be fulfilled for the supply of kippers the board has to take the necessary steps to meet the contracts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1952, made on the 29th day of July, 1952, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 1st October, 1952.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1952, which I am asking the House to approve, contains amendments of the 1951 Pensions Order and also a provision to enable the pensions of certain members who retired prior to 1st January, 1952, to be re-assessed.  A memorandum, explaining the provisions of the Order, has been circulated to Deputies.  The details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Article 4 (a) of the Order amends Article 9 of the 1951 Pensions Order. When the latter Order was framed provision was made under Article 8 (b) for the payment of extra gratuities, calculated at the rate of 1/2 of 1 per cent. of annual pay for each year of service prior to 29th December, 1951, to members of the force who retire and receive ordinary pensions.  Provision was not made for the payment of this extra gratuity to members of the force who might be awarded special pensions on retirement by reason of injuries sustained in the course of their duty. Provision is now being made for the payment of the extra gratuity to such members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 (b) of the Order amends Article 13 of the 1951 Pensions Order. The latter Order provided that, if a <Col N="1068" /> member of the force to whom a retirement gratuity had been paid served again, the amount of any retirement gratuity to which he later became entitled would be reduced by the amount of the gratuity previously paid to him.  No provision was, however, made in the case of a member who might die during his second period of service for the deduction of the gratuity previously paid from any death gratuity to which the deceased member's legal personal representatives might become entitled.  This is now being done and is necessary to prevent the payment of a gratuity twice in respect of the same period of service in the force.</P>
    <P>Article 5.  The Garda Síochána Pensions Act, 1947, permitted members of the force who retired from the force and who were allowed to rejoin to count the period they were absent from the force as approved service for pension purposes, provided that a certificate was issued under Section 8 of the Act that their retirement had been due solely to political reasons.  They were not, however, permitted to receive increments of pay in respect of the periods they were absent.  Provision is now being made to re-assess the pensions of any such members who may have retired before the 1st January, 1952, as though their annual pay, on retirement, had included increments of pay in respect of the periods they were absent from the force.</P>
    <P>The general effect of the Order is to make improvements in the Garda Síochána Pensions code and no further comments are, I think, necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and to include those people I mentioned.  Those Guards have been in the people's service during a very difficult period and it is not fair to exclude them from this Order.  I referred also to the widows who have only 17/3 a week and if the Minister considers the purchasing power of 17/3 and spreads it over seven days of the week, he will not think it unreasonable to ask that the matter be referred back and that those people be included in his Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

I do not hold out any hope of an improvement in the 1950 pensions but if there is any it can be done by another Order of this kind.  There is nothing to be gained by asking me to withdraw this Order to amend it.

We have an obligation to those Guards who retired prior to 1950 and who have been in the service of this country during a very difficult time, and to their widows who are getting only 17/3 a week at the present time.  Anyone who divides 17/3 by seven can find out what they have to live on for the seven days of the week.  I appeal to the Minister to give these people the consideration they deserve.</P>

      <P>I would ask if this Order applies to Guards who were too old at the time they joined to be able to serve the full period and who were forced to retire before whatever period <Col N="1071" /> of years would enable them to enjoy the fullest pension.  Does this Order apply to them and rectify their position?  It is a considerable grievance up and down the country among Guards who managed to get only about 20 years' service instead of the requisite 30 years.  Therefore, they are eligible for only two-thirds pension facility.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned on Friday last, I was making the point, with which I think the Minister agreed&mdash;I just want to repeat it to get it out of the way&mdash; that whatever comments or observations were made by the American delegation in relation to restrictive practices which were hampering or alleged to be hampering our productive capacity in this country, none of those comments or observations applied to the practices with which it is sought to deal under this Bill.  It would, I think, be interesting if it were possible for us to get before the Bill leaves this House some idea, if not a full account, from the Minister or from somebody else, of whatever comments or observations were made by the American experts in regard to restrictive practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> So far as I can gather the objections taken to this Bill by certain persons and certain associations are largely directed against Section 8 of the Bill, what they describe as the powers given to the Minister.  I do not believe they have any reason whatever to be apprehensive in relation to Section 8 because, as I read it, any Order made by the Minister under this section can only become operative when it has been submitted to the Oireachtas, and I suppose that is as good a safeguard as one can get short of having a direct appeal to the courts.  Frankly, as I tried to make clear when I was speaking on Friday, I am not enamoured of this Bill.  I am still of opinion that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to make it effective in dealing with the types of practices that there are undoubtedly in this country and which are harmful to the public interest.  In so far as there are legitimate fears in trade or commercial circles regarding the operation of this particular Bill, they are founded on the commission.  People are apprehensive as to the type of commission, particularly in relation to the personnel of the commission.  The commission here is getting very considerable powers.  I have some idea of the difficulty with which the Minister will be faced in getting personnel for that commission of the right type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said of the right type.  I want to emphasise that.  They are not there to be picked off gooseberry bushes.  It is very difficult and the Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about clause 8 of the Schedule.  I would like to hear from the Minister his reason for clause 8 of the Schedule&mdash;inspection of premises and obtaining of information.  If I were a trader, whether I was or was not indulging in restrictive practices, I would certainly be a bit worried about this particular part of the Bill. Clause 8 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this paragraph `authorised officers' means a member of the commission, a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>any one of the 7,000 or the whole 7,000&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" />&ldquo;or a person authorised in writing by the commission for the purposes of this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember what they are authorised to do.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of obtaining the information necessary for the exercise by the Minister or the commission of any function under this Act, an authorised officer is hereby authorised&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) at all reasonable times to enter premises at which any activity in connection with the business of supplying or distributing goods or in connection with the organisation or assistance of persons engaged in any such business is carried on and to inspect the premises;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That authorises any one of the 7,000 members of the Garda Síochána in any part of this country to enter on any business premises during business hours, whether at the slack hour or at the busiest period of the day and, according to paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of clause 8&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to require the person who carries on such activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the officer any books, documents or records relating to such activity which are in that person's power or control and to give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books, documents and records;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned&mdash;and this cannot be construed as any reflection on the Garda Síochána&mdash;I am not prepared hereby to authorise the 7,000 members of the Garda Síochána or any one of them to enter upon any business premises in this country at any time and to hold up traders, as they would necessarily have to do in order to carry out what is set out in (a) and (b) there. I do not think it is necessary to do it.</P>
    <P>We have provided here in years gone by for the services of the Garda Síochána or officers of the Garda Síochána to be utilised for certain purposes in relation to particular Acts but, if my recollection serves me right, it was set out in the particular statutes <Col N="1074" /> that the officer had to be an officer not under the rank of superintendent, inspector or sergeant.</P>
    <P>I do not say that it will happen but, as we have often said before, what our intentions or what the Minister's intentions here are in relation to legislation are one thing and how that legislation will be administered when it leaves this House may be a very different thing and I could conceive&mdash;and it has happened and is happening in certain parts of this country&mdash;that in part of a city, but particularly in a village or town, where a member of the Garda Síochána for any reason you like might have a dislike for, or an edge against, a particular local trader, he could make that man's business existence far from pleasant.  I would like to hear the Minister on that and on the necessity for creating, by this particular part of the Schedule, 7,000 inspectors plus whatever number may be authorised in writing by the commission.  That is something that I would like the Minister to refer to.</P>
    <P>It is said by certain parties outside and by certain organisations that there are no restrictive practices in operation in this country which are detrimental so far as the public are concerned.  I have no hesitation whatever in asserting that there are such practices in operation in this country and my only regret is that this Bill does not seek to deal with the most objectionable of them.</P>
    <P>Let me quote, without giving names a copy of a letter which came into my possession since this Bill was set down for consideration.  This letter was addressed to a manufacturer in this country who is manufacturing a range of articles that are in practically everyday demand in every part of the country.  I do not propose to give the firm's name and, for the moment, I do not propose to give the name of the association.  I will be very glad to give it to the Minister, if he requires it, afterwards.  I want to make it quite clear, because it is the sort of organisation that probably would jump to mind, that the association which addressed this letter to this manufacturer is not R.G.D.A.T.A.  This manufacturer had written to the association <Col N="1075" /> stating that he proposed to reduce the price of a certain article which he was manufacturing and distributing rather substantially.  The price of the article was less than 3/-.  It was proposed to reduce it by 6d.  This is the reply he got:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the suggested reduced retail price for &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the commodity. If I did, it would be recognised.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter has been brought before our committee who instructed me to inform you that, irrespective of what the trade price may be, the retail price is remaining as at present in the list.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that in the proposal which the manufacturer was making to reduce the price to the trade, he was not in any way proposing to interfere with the margins of profit.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to your notification to place a retail price lower than that usually in our price list, the committee would take serious exception to this step.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot quote the name of this firm because I know enough about the situation to know that that manufacturer would be severely victimised.  I quote that one case.  There are various other restrictive practices which are very objectionable.  The Minister mentioned quite a number.  I do not want to weary the House with them.  There are two aspects of that letter.  One is that it demonstrates that an association is dictating to a manufacturer.  The other is that the fixing or branding of a price by a manufacturer on an article which is to be sold retail does not necessarily mean that that price is stamped on the article by the manufacturer for the purpose of maintaining the price.</P>
    <P>I could quote quite a number of articles which are branded by the manufacturer with the retail selling price for the very opposite purpose, for the purpose of preventing retailers from charging a higher price than the price at which the manufacturer believes the article should be sold.  Frankly, I fail <Col N="1076" /> to understand why any manufacturer who wishes to improve and expand his business and to establish a good market for his produce should wish to co-operate either with wholesalers or retailers or with both for the purpose of maintaining a price higher than would give a reasonable profit to all three.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his speech, as reported at column 820:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am asking the House to agree that where a trade association takes power to exclude any citizen from any trade, or imposes restrictions which have the effect of excluding any citizen from any trade, then no matter what justification there may be for that course, and no matter what arguments can be advanced by the association in defence of these restrictions, that association is taking to itself functions which properly belong to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am asking the House to agree&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister is not asking the House to agree to any such thing unless the Minister was opening the door a bit wider than he intended when he said &ldquo;any trade,&rdquo; because where those particular types of restrictive practices are being enforced rigidly and ruthlessly and impact in many cases on the weakest section of our people, this Bill does not even purport to deal with those and the Minister is quite aware of that.</P>
    <P>I do not want unduly to delay the House on this measure.  I agree entirely with the Minister that there is a problem in relation to restrictive practices in this country that must be dealt with.  I agree entirely that legislation is the only way to deal with it. I am not satisfied, frankly, that this is going to be effective.  I am not satisfied that the Minister was right when he said that, having examined various other means by which these particular practices could be dealt with, he had come to the conclusion that the method set out in the Bill was the best one. Frankly, I do not agree.  The Minister said that it would be impossible to operate a legal prohibition.  It has not been found impossible in other countries where trade, manufacture and distribution is much more complex than <Col N="1077" /> it is in this country.  They have found it possible to do it and it is being done and so far as I can learn it is being done effectively.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as the Minister to stamp out any restrictive practice that shows its head and that is going to impose injustices and hardships&mdash;and extreme hardships, in some cases&mdash;on any of our citizens.  On the other hand, I do not want the House to go to the other extreme and impose restrictions and handicaps on industry and trade that may do very grave harm to industry and trade.  I doubt very much indeed that there is any hope that when this Bill becomes law it will have any effect whatever in helping to reduce the cost of living.  I doubt very much if it will help to any extent worth talking about to keep the cost of living from going still higher, but whether it does or not, this House, in my opinion, is bound to make an attempt to deal with these practices and the Minister is fortunate to this extent anyway that there appears to be unanimity of opinion in the House that there is a problem to be dealt with and it is only a question as to how it can be dealt with most effectively.</P>

      <P>There is a certain advantage in entering a discussion on the present Bill following the Minister and the ex-Minister because in their contributions to the debate both of them, on the basis of their far greater knowledge of the problem than could be available to any ordinary member of the House, have committed themselves to the statement that so far as the argument for some machinery of this type is concerned they know, from their own personal experiences, that there are restrictive practices and that they are of such a nature as to require attention.  That should be noted, not merely as an indication that there is a problem which merits our attention but for other reasons which I will deal with later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to deal with the question of restrictive practices, it should be worth while, at the early stages of the debate, to try to recall to ourselves some elementary facts. Since the Bill became public there has been widespread publicity in the <Col N="1078" /> Press giving vent to the views of various associations who have been concerned in one way or another with the possibility of this Bill becoming law.  This House has also to indicate its viewpoint.  So far as persons who may be affected by the Bill are concerned, so far as their activities as manufacturers or traders arise, we should be quite clear that, as against them, this House is speaking for the community and that they represent a very specialised, a very sectional and a very selfish interest and that they are on the defensive.  We are dealing with individuals who, whatever they may claim for themselves, do not serve the community out of love to the community. We happen to live under a particular form of society&mdash;whether we like it or not does not arise in this matter&mdash;in which men and women enter into industry and commercial pursuits not out of any regard for the community or any desire to serve the community but purely as a means of pursuing their own choice of livelihood and that choice is based on the possibilities available to them under the present system of society for making profit out of their activities.</P>
    <P>I have yet to read or learn of any occasion&mdash;there may have been one or two isolated occasions&mdash;when any individuals of this type have voluntarily, of their own accord, decided they were going to take a smaller amount of profit than was otherwise available to them from the community.  Therefore, in entering into a discussion on this Bill, we should have no qualms in devising machinery which may appear to be somewhat severe, which, as Deputy Morrissey says, may be interferng too much with the activities of these people in the normal conduct of their business.  We are dealing with a condition of affairs in which the guiding motive&mdash;and let us be quite plain about it&mdash;is a purely selfish motive.  We know from experience and from our reading that over the years that selfish motive has had to be curbed time after time by social and communal effort either through legislation or through the self defensive mechanisms of sections of the community who are driven to desperation by the pressure of these circumstances. Whatever seeds of social consciousness, <Col N="1079" /> understanding or of moderation in their conduct were sown in the minds and the activities of those engaged in these forms of activity were the outcome of pressure of communal forces and did not originate in their own desire to conform to higher standards. I am speaking of the mass and not of individuals.  The need for a Bill of this character coming before this House arises not out of any desire on the part of the Minister, the Government or the House itself to interfere with these activities, but because common sense has told us that these activities have got to be limited and cannot be allowed to run wildfire at the expense of the community.</P>
    <P>Possibly the strongest case that can be made against the Bill is that it is long overdue.  When we come to deal with the actual problems presented by the Bill, it is interesting to note that we have had statements made by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the former Minister indicating the existence of the problem and, to their minds, the magnitude of the problem.  It is remarkable that neither of them has indicated up to the moment why the machinery and the measures which were available to them in their ministerial capacities were not used up to this to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I have read through the Minister's speech.  He lists a whole number of commodities in respect of which he indicates there are various forms of restrictive practices.  He points out that in certain cases these products are manufactured by protected industries and he seems to have glossed over the fact that whatever may be the defects of the present Bill, there is no more effective machinery than the power that lies in the hands of the Government in respect of protected industries to ensure they conform to certain desirable social standards.  I may be mistaken but I cannot recall at the moment any special step that I am aware of where that machinery was used to deal with some of the abuses.</P>
    <P>I wonder&mdash;I think many other people wonder, too&mdash;why the Bill was introduced just at this particular moment. <Col N="1080" /> I am not concerned with the fact that there is a by-election on.  I am concerned more with a long-term view.  I feel that we should have some regard to that aspect of the matter.  We have had in this country over the last 25 years a steady development of industrial activities carried on on the basis of the sacrifices made by the community as a whole for this industrial development, an industrial development which was very lucrative for many of those engaged in it.</P>
    <P>The cost to the community of financing that development, through our system of protective tariffs, must have been fairly heavy.  None of us objected to that.  We recognised that it was a national, economic necessity that we had to face up to that task but in the process and over the years all of us have been aware that there were practices developing to which strong objection could be taken.  We are reinforced in that belief by authoritative statements made by the present Minister and by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>If we have particular industries operating under a tariff, a tariff which is provided at the expense of the ordinary consumer, and apparently it is a fact, as indicated by the speech of the Minister and of Deputy Morrissey, that, within some of these protected industries, there have been practices which should have been rectified, why has no step been taken up to the present time?  Surely it is a very simple question to inform protected industries that if they do not mend their ways there will be a change made in the protection afforded them.  I have yet to learn of that being done in any drastic measure.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister touched upon this particular problem and stated that where protection was afforded to home industries against external competition the community were entitled to expect that competition within the domestic market should not be interfered with and that competition should prevail for the benefit of the consumers. We have had so many instances, particularly during the last 12 years, of that competition failing to be effective and of the fact that the Government itself, upon occasions, <Col N="1081" /> ensured there would be no competition that the question arises in many minds as to why, in fact, we are presented with this Bill at the present moment.</P>
    <P>We can recall that in the case of one of the most important building materials we had a shortage existing in the country for nearly three years while discussions went on as to the rate of profits that was to be allowed to the concern.  There was no competition with that particular concern, and yet the sole result at the end of a very considerable delay as to payment for this material was that the concern got their way and we are now paying for the result.  We had many other instances like that.</P>
    <P>We have had over 12 years the continuous and never-ending problem that has faced the consumer and Government after Government, the problem of dealing with the prices of the general range of goods in this country.  We finally reached the position where we had a tribunal established to deal with these prices by public examination.  We are equally aware that in many cases the problem that arose in respect of a particular price was not merely the problem of the rising cost of materials and of labour but purely the question of individuals, either in a particular industry or in a unit of industry, taking an unjustifiable advantage of the situation and as they were quite entitled to do, under the economic laws that rule, reaping as big a harvest as they could while the going was good. Up to the moment, no effective steps have been taken to ensure that if we are to pursue a policy of protection for Irish industries, that policy will not only operate for the purpose of ensuring industrial development, employment for our own people and the supplying of goods for our own people but that there will be none of the restrictive practices in any particular industry to which we take objection to-day.  It could be dealt with very simply without any Bill of this character and without any elaborate machinery.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party not only support the Bill but we agree that it is necessary.  Choice as to the character of the Bill is not something which is open to us to any extent.  It would be difficult, as indicated by the Minister, <Col N="1082" /> to set down in the Bill the various forms of restrictive practices to which objection could legitimately be taken, and the best we can hope for is to devise machinery which can be made available for the examination of charges or complaints of restrictive practices, for the determination of fair-trading rules and for advising not so much the Minister as the House as to what steps should be taken to deal with the particular problem.</P>
    <P>My doubt in regard to the Bill is not in respect of the machinery, although it is worth making the comment that, if this Bill were introduced by a Labour Government, or even by a Government with which the Labour Party was associated, the outcry would be so great and the opposition so strong that one might well believe we were on the verge of civil commotion and revolution.  We would be told that we were interfering with the rights of private property, that we were interfering with private enterprise and trying to apply the most extreme forms of socialistic and communist doctrine that one could envisage.  Yet a Government who, according to their own claim, are the supreme defenders of private enterprise and private property are the Government who bring in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of comment on it and a certain amount of opposition, but on the whole it is very mild.  I do not think that either the Federation of Irish Manufacturers or the Associated Chambers of Commerce are unduly worried by the fact that the Minister has introduced the Bill. I wonder why that is, because, some two years ago, when the previous Government took steps to set up a prices tribunal and to put a temporary stop on price increases, the outcry was at least 100 times greater than it is on the present occasion and very effective steps were taken to ensure that the stop put on price increases was very quickly removed and the effectiveness of the prices tribunal very greatly reduced.  It has been much more effectively reduced since the change of Government and since we had the present Minister coming back into office with a declaration of <Col N="1083" /> his lack of faith in that type of machinery to deal with prices.</P>
    <P>However, the tribunal is still there and we are now proposing to establish another tribunal in the form of a commission to deal with this other problem of restrictive practices.  Yet, as I say, the outcry is not very great.  I frankly think that it is because those who are engaged in restrictive practices, such as they may be, are not very fearful that the machinery is going to operate very drastically, and over the years they have not got any strong indication that the Minister and his Party are going to interfere unduly with the manufacturer, the wholesale distributor or the merchant who pursues his merry way at the expense of the Irish community. They have had a very good run for their money over the years since we acquired the right to decide our own destinies and it is remarkable that the darling of Irish manufacturing circles, the circles which represent what we have come to regard as the moneyed interests in this country, is the Fianna Fáil Party and Government.  The Minister shakes his head, but he knows that that is shown exceptionally clearly by the list of those who contributed to the National Loan.</P>

      <P>As I say, my doubt with regard to the Bill is not in respect of the Bill itself or the machinery proposed. It is the same problem we have had time after time when we tried to devise machinery of this kind.  The machinery itself is not so important. It is the conviction and the earnestness with which the machinery is to be operated which are important.  This commission which is now proposed to deal with restrictive practices can be just as ineffective as the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce was for many years and as the Prices Tribunal has largely become <Col N="1084" /> by reason of the way in which it is allowed to operate to-day.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which we might point.  It is an aspect of restrictive practices for which both this Government and the previous Government should answer.  In addition to the imposition of import duties on foreign made goods, we have a system of controlling imports by quotas, and it is a peculiar thing that these quotas operate in such a manner as to enable an imposition of as much as 10 or 15 per cent. of the cost price of these goods to be imposed on a manufacturer and therefore, finally, on the consumer by a single individual who never possesses a yard of the goods and whose only claim to charge that 10 or 15 per cent. is the fact that he is allowed to operate by the good grace of the Government in power.</P>
      <P>I recall on one occasion having to make representations on behalf of a small factory in the city, employing 60 or 70 people.  They were on the verge of shutting down and putting these men and women out of employment.  They were making a good article, and a reasonably cheap article, but they could not continue manufacturing because they had no raw material&mdash; cloth in this case.  Their apportionment under the quota was so small that it allowed them to work only three days in the month, but they would be able to work for the other 27 or 28 days of the month on one condition, that they went to an individual, an agent, obtained their supplies of cloth from him and paid him an agent's fee amounting to 15 per cent. of the cost of the material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This individual had no office, and, so far as I am aware, all he had was an attaché case and a book of order forms. He had, however, a very large share of the total quota of that cloth coming into the country, and, because he had a right to that share, he was able to charge a manufacturer 15 per cent. on the cloth supplied.  He never saw the cloth and never had it in his office or warerooms, because he had no office or warerooms to keep it in.  He acted merely as a parasite not merely on the back of the manufacturer but ultimately on the back of the consumer as <Col N="1085" /> well.  The only justification for a continuance of that system is that it was the way it worked before the war and we could not interfere with it, could not interfere with the normal channels of trade.</P>
    <P>That is only one small instance, but I have no doubt that if we could utilise as the Minister could utilise and as his predecessor could have utilised, the full information service of the Department to check up on all the similar cases, we would find a very highly developed system not of restrictive practices, because it seems to me that is too fine a name to attach to it, but of open piracy carried on by individuals in that position.  If we object to trade associations fixing prices or restricting the supply of goods or excluding individuals from particular trades or activities, what justification can we find for imposing on a whole section of industry parasites of this type, who, because of their single individual activity, are able to impose such a heavy charge as 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. of the cost of basic raw materials on a manufacturer? From that point of view the Government, whether it be the present Government or their predecessors, have got to meet the charge that whether they like it or not they are party themselves to certain forms of restrictive practices and should put their own house in order.</P>
    <P>Similarly we have another interesting aspect of restrictive practices.  The Minister in his speech referred to restrictive practices whereby certain conditions are laid down which deny individuals an opportunity of engaging in a particular form of business or pursuing a livelihood along certain lines, maybe because their premises must meet certain minimum standards, or because they must be admitted to a trade association which has a monopoly of certain supplies.  Apparently the objection there is that conditions are being laid down which prevent an individual or individuals from entering into a perfectly legitimate form of business activity.  Yet for the last 18 months the country has experienced the greatest ramp in restrictive practices which probably any country has known <Col N="1086" /> for quite some time.  I refer to the restrictive practices of the banks and financial institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr Larkin Mr Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the sense in complaining about a small number of individuals not being able to open a petrol station or garage down the country when we know that whole sections of industry in this country have been crimped, confined and restricted in their business activities over the past 18 months by one section of the business world who engage in the monopoly of the money, finance and credit activities of this country? I recall that in this House the Minister referred to this particular problem and expressed the hope that as far as the capital development plans of the present Government were concerned the banks would be co-operative and would not create difficulties.  I wonder what he feels to-day and whether he has made up his mind about them. Quite clearly, in relation to the capital programme of the Government and to the activities of small manufacturers, shopkeepers and wholesalers the banks play exactly the same restrictive role, when they feel like it and they have felt very much like it during the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we will have an opportunity later of going into the whole matter more fully, but if we want to go into restrictions which hamper and hold back the development of our industrial economy, the development of manufacturing industry, our trade and our commerce, if we are to authorise limiting the effect of restrictive practices in so far as they impose additional charges and expense on the consumer, is there any reason why we should not go into the basic cause of the trouble and deal with our financial problems at the same time?  I gather that within the scope of the present Bill it is unlikely, if it becomes an Act, that the commission will have power to deal with the problem of the banks' activities.  Apparently, they are engaged in a &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  It would be interesting to have the nature of the service defined.  As far as the scope of the present Bill is concerned, however, <Col N="1087" /> they are not selling or distributing goods and, therefore, for the moment, they are excluded.  It would, I think, be of great benefit to the community as a whole and would probably solve many difficulties of the business and industrial community if we did apply our minds for a while to an inquiry into the restrictive activities of the banks.  For that reason I feel, as I said earlier, that we are entitled to have some sense of dubiety as to what will happen after the Bill becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage it is likely that there will be a number of points which we will wish to take up and have clarified but at the present stage the main consideration is to indicate our approach in principle to the Bill.  The Labour Party are in favour of the Bill which will give power to inquire into, and deal effectively with, restrictive practices.  We feel in the circumstances that we have little choice but to accept the machinery set out in the Bill.  We frankly do not feel that it would be possible to define the various forms of restrictive practices which would be regarded as objectionable and prescribe remedies and palliatives, but we do wish to emphasise that no matter how effective the machinery may be as it is established by this House, ultimately that machinery will depend for its results, not on the commission&mdash;though that is important&mdash;but on the Minister and the Government under whom the commission operates.  We have very grave doubts whether under the existing Government and with the existing Minister that machinery will be effective.  We feel that their ties are too close and intimate with the various individuals and groups against whom the Bill is in the main directed.  Above all, the real test both of the intentions of the Government and of the effectiveness of the machinery suggested in the Bill is that the commission should operate in the fullest possible publicity.</P>

      <P>Too long have we had the suggestion that because an individual is engaged in business or manufacture he is to be afforded a protection <Col N="1088" /> not granted to other individuals in the community.  I again emphasise that where an industry is carried on behind a protective tariff the community has not got to make any apology for insisting upon its rights to have the fullest, and most public inquiry into the activities of that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual units of that industry are not entitled to dark corners into which the light of publicity cannot be shone.  The Labour Party have pointed out on many occasions that we have now got machinery in the State whereby the ordinary working man and woman must go into a public court and submit themselves if necessary to a most public examination with regard to their claims for an improved standard of living.  When we speak of utilising the same type of machinery for manufacturers and businessmen, however, the defence is made that it would be unfair to them to have their personal and confidential business secrets exposed not merely to the public but to their rivals.  Frankly, I have always had very grave doubts about that.  The only kind of business secret that could possibly be dangerous or create difficulties if it were known would be a secret manufacturing process.  Such secrets, however, are not subject to public examination.  The only things which we ask should be publicly examined are their financial transactions. A great many public companies in the State have already got to submit to that and if private companies expect&mdash;as apparently they do&mdash; that the consumer will continue to pay tribute to them year after year to maintain them in business, they have no legitimate grounds for objecting to publicity or a public examination of their affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Bill provides that the commission may conduct portion of the inquiry in private and that the Minister may decide that certain sections of their report to him may not be made public.  I would strongly suggest to the Minister that he divest himself of those powers because if there are reports to him from that commission and portions <Col N="1089" /> of those reports are retained as being private and confidential there will be no doubt of the construction which will be put on the Minister's decision to retain those sections in private and not to give them to the public.  If we believe &mdash;apparently the Minister does and Deputy Morrissey&mdash;that we have got a problem to deal with here, that we have got restrictive practices that cannot be justified, which are unfair and which, in fact, should be made illegal, then the public are entitled to the fullest information on every aspect of the examination into those practices.  That, I would say, particularly arises in respect of industries that are enjoying the favour of protective tariffs, protected industries.  I know of no reason, excuse or justification why any section of the examination should be held in private and, in particular, should be kept from this House.  It is well to bear in mind that if a report comes before this House in the form of an Order and the House is asked to make it a legal instrument, the House is entitled to know as much as the Minister before they make that a binding and legal decision.  As the Bill stands at the moment, possibly the most important and the most essential part of the report can be marked by the Minister as private and confidential and not made available to the House.  The members of the House will be required to accept the Minister's word that what he asks them to do should be given effect to.  That is objectionable and will have to be considered on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, this Bill is put forward, in the main, for two reasons. Its first object is to remove as far as possible those restrictive practices which interfere with the proper and normal development of Irish industrial economy.  I take it that when we think in terms of Irish industrial economy we have in mind the welfare of the Irish people.  The second object is to ensure that restrictive practices which will extract from the consumer an unduly high price are not continued. In other words, it is for the consumer that we purport to put forward this Bill and are asked to pass it into law.  If that is the case and <Col N="1090" /> if the consumers are the main consideration in our minds, either as consumers of goods or as members of the Irish community, we should have clearly set out in the Bill the approach which is available to any consumer or any body of consumers who require the commission to investigate any complaint they may desire to make.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands at the moment, the making of fair-trading rules can be initiated only at the request of a trade association; in the case of an inquiry the initiatory act must come from the commission.  In order to ensure our <i>bona fides</i>, to make the machinery effective and to enlist the support of the public and the consumer, we should make it clear that the commission is approachable by every consumer directly and without qualification.  It should be made clear that the commission will consider any reasonable submission made to them and will indicate whether they propose to take action and, if they do not, the grounds on which they refuse to do so.  The position should not be allowed to remain as it appears at the moment because already there is the feeling that the commission will act only when it thinks fit, itself, to do so or when required to do so by the Minister.  Already I have heard complaints outside the House that, while this machinery is being devised for the benefit of the consumers, the consumers are the one body being denied access to the commission.  I am satisfied that that is not the case.  I believe that if the commission receive representations from anybody they will consider those representations.</P>
    <P>It is important that in setting up bodies of this type, whether to deal with price control or control of trading practices, from the beginning we invite and secure public confidence in and public support for the machinery.  I know of no more effective way of destroying that confidence than by giving the impression that the machinery is going to operate in some kind of semi-secrecy, is going to be divorced from the mass of the people and will operate merely as some form of departmental activity in the same fashion as the prices section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> The Labour Party welcome the Bill. We propose to support it.  We hope we shall have an opportunity, on the Committee Stage, of improving it.  We stress very strongly that to the extent that the case has been made by the Minister that these objectionable practices exist, to the extent that he is now asking us to provide the machinery, to that extent he takes the responsibility of seeing that the machinery works and of not continuing the practice which we believe has operated for too many years in this country of merely making a pretence of dealing with the problem and then, when the problem has ceased to arouse public interest, to allow the machinery to become ineffective and to allow these extortions and exploitations of the mass of the consuming public to occur again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a Bill such as this is long overdue but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Larkin that this Bill does not go far enough. In my opinion, some indication should be given as to what will happen those people who commit breaches of the Act.  It is clear that in this country and, I suppose, in other countries a certain section of the people have for a considerable time been getting huge profits.  Manufacturers have been attacked in this House and outside it but I think it is a terrible state of affairs when the cost of selling an article amounts to as much and in some cases more than the cost of producing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported in columns 714 and 715 of the Official Report of the 27th March last, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he was aware that certain manufacturers and wholesalers compel retailers to charge fixed minimum prices for certain goods and that, although in many cases the retailers would be satisfied with smaller profits, they are unable to reduce prices as they would be struck off the traders' lists if they did so; and, if so, if he would have immediate steps taken to end this compulsory practice so as to foster competition and reduce prices.  The Minister in his reply <Col N="1092" /> stated: &ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a somewhat similar question on the 22nd November, 1951.  A Bill containing legislative proposals dealing with restrictive trade practices is in course of preparation; and the proposals will relate also to resale price maintenance.&rdquo;  I asked the Minister then if they would be allowed to carry on in the same way until the Bill was introduced.  We remember the famous case taken against the R.G.D.A.T.A. by a retailer who tried to sell goods to consumers at a cheaper rate than other traders with the result that he was struck off the traders' lists.</P>
    <P>What prompted me to put down the question to the Minister which I have quoted above was that, at the time, I was a member of the board of a voluntary hospital and a member of the committee of the local sanatorium.  The two bodies concerned happened to buy a wireless set at that particular time. It was the same make of wireless set and the same price, but the voluntary hospital had to pay £18 whereas in the maintenance orders for the sanatorium committee the price was £18 less 33? per cent.  I asked the secretary of the voluntary hospital to ring up the retailer&mdash;who happened to be the same person in each case&mdash;and to look for the 33? per cent. reduction.  The secretary of the South Infirmary, Cork, was told by the trader that the reduction could be given only to local authority hospitals or else he would be struck off the traders' list.</P>
    <P>I presume that when selling this wireless set to the local authority hospital at £12, the trader must have had a pretty fair percentage of profit, probably in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent., but in selling that particular set to the ordinary householder or to the voluntary hospital there would probably be 100 per cent. profit.  I think that is a scandalous state of affairs.  I know many traders who, if they got the opportunity, would be very glad to get a couple of pounds or 30/- profit on that particular set.</P>
    <P>The same thing happens in the case of many other commodities.  Are we going to allow our industries to be interfered with by wholesalers or even <Col N="1093" /> by manufacturers, who compel retailers to charge a particular fixed minimum price?  They are told that if they sell at a price less than that they will be struck off the trader's list.  I do not know what kind of consciences these people have.  I do not know what religion they belong to if they find it consistent with their conscientious principles to prevent a man selling an article at a smaller profit than other people demand.  We shall never get a reduction in prices if we have not some competition.  We always had competition long ago.</P>

      <P>I think that that particular case alone, in which a fixed minimum price was sought to be imposed, is a sufficient justification for any Government to bring in a Bill such as this.  Then you have the case of, say, a local authority engaged in a housing scheme and which tries to buy, for instance, 100 baths.  I asked our city manager to inquire from the manufacturers at what price they would supply 120 baths for a housing scheme. He was plainly told that they could supply only through a builder's provider or agent.  If an agent is to get 20 or 30 per cent. profit on 120 baths which are to be used in houses provided for the working classes in this country, without his ever seeing these baths, that is a practice that must be eradicated.  There is no use in talking about the increased rates of interest for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, if we do not abolish these practices.  I mention the case of baths because I asked the city manager to make certain inquiries and he gave me the reply he got to these inquiries.  The same thing applies to any other article.</P>

      <P>I certainly say that people who are in a position to give a big order for a housing scheme should not be compelled to hand over a bonus, if you like, for that is what it is, to those builder's providers who simply put through the order to the manufacturer and get them to send the goods direct to the housing scheme without ever seeing them at all or having any responsibility for handling them.</P>
      <P>The question of breweries was mentioned on the last day when reference was made to attempts by some breweries to compel licensed traders not to sell any product but their own.  My attention was drawn to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, October 31st.  The article is headed: &ldquo;Million Dollar Suit Against Guinness.&rdquo;  It states that the suit alleges that two firms, described as subsidiaries of the parent Irish company, cut off supplies of Guinness stout from Dublin Distributors Incorporated. I do not want to weary the House by reading the report in full but I should like to mention that because a brewery in Cork, Beamish's, was exporting stout to America and because these agents in America were distributing that stout of the Cork firm and earning dollars for this country, they were threatened that they would not get any more Guinness.</P>

There is, for <Col N="1095" /> instance, the attitude of the bottlers, which prevents bottlers in different districts from bottling Guinness stout with the usual brown label, if they are bottling any other stout.  I think that this all amounts to restriction in trade. It is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;If you do not confine your business to our goods, we will not supply you with any of them&rdquo;.  If practices of that kind are to be allowed in this country people will be selling only the product of one manufacturer.</P>

How does he know whether he is getting American or English coal?

It is only certain people who will get the petrol to sell and then only when certain trade associations will agree.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For 20 years I have inveighed in Dáil Éireann against the abuses of the distributive, wholesale and retail trade and of all others who sought to use tariffs for the purpose of robbing our people.  I wonder does that entitle me, as one who has proved the <i>saeva indignatio</i> which he felt right throughout that 20 years, to say: &ldquo;<i>Abi, viator et imitare si poteris strenuum pro virili libertatis vindicatorem.</i>&rdquo; These words are taken from the epitaph of Dean Swift.  He thanked God that he had gone to his grave where savage indignation would no longer rend his breast, and he exhorted those who read that epitaph to go and do what he would wish to do for the freedom of his people and their deliverance from exploitation.</P>
      <P>I have never hesitated to criticise in this House abuses arising from the distributive trade.  I have stigmatised tariff racketeers wherever I saw them, but I think it is right to say this, that there are more than tariff racketeers who operate restrictive practices which are gravely inimical to the legitimate rights of their fellow citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want all restrictive practices which operate unjustly in our community to be exposed to the light of publicity so that decent public opinion will operate to end them.  Mind you, I do not attach much importance to statutory penalties. I believe that these evils are best abated by the light of day and the disapprobation which their illumination <Col N="1099" /> will bring on them from all sections of society such as that to which we belong. Let us not forget that, in the ears of any reasonable person, it must sound, in some degree, fantastic to hear Deputy Larkin dragooning, for public odium, persons engaged in the distributive trade who, he said, did not enter it for love of their neighbour but for profit which he professes to scorn.  I compare the <i>entrepreneur</i> who enters the retail trade in rural Ireland for profit with the wealthy trade unionists in Dublin who belong to a trade union, membership of which is most emphatically restricted so as to keep the numbers down.  For what purpose?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says it does not come under this Bill.  Why does it not come under this Bill?  If there is to be restriction of one section why will there not be the same salutary control of all?  I am not asking to have exempted from this Bill the rich man, the influential man, the big man or anybody else.  I want all those who, by restrictive practices batten on their neighbours, to be brought within the control not of a punitive measure, for I do not give a fiddle-de-dee about the penalties prescribed in this Bill, but within the control of a measure which will enforce upon them the light of day and challenge them to have the practices to which they habitually resort described in detail to the neighbours among whom they live and have thrust upon them the burden of defending, justifying and explaining how the practice revealed conforms with equity and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that, I warrant that, without any penalty or prosecution of any man, the common conscience of our people will bring genuine offenders quickly to book.  I think it is wrong of Oireachtas <Col N="1100" /> Éireann to devise legislation which, in fact, operates to be sauce for the gander but something quite different for the goose.  There is only one proper kind of law that any Parliament can make and that is a law before which all men are equal.  I see no justice in a law which does not apply in exactly the same degree to the rich and to the poor, to the powerful and to the humble. Let us remember that if any man, be he rich or poor, powerful or humble, combines together with his neighbour or his colleagues in an activity which is not inimical to the commonweal, there is nothing in this Bill for him to fear. If he is doing nothing of which he need be ashamed and if he is supporting nothing that he would not be prepared to defend, will he not jump at this opportunity of coming before a body of this kind and saying: &ldquo;I welcome the opportunity of meeting in public the allegation that I have combined with others to do something unjust or unfair.  Here is all the detail of what we do and why we do it, and we think that it is right and just and fair and a hardship to no man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to deal with this measure as it is submitted by the Minister.  I want to refer to the Minister's introductory speech.  At column 817 of the Official Report on Friday, 31st October, 1952, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The operation of a resale price arrangement has been alleged to exist in relation to many classes of grocery goods, drapery goods, agricultural machinery, veterinary preparations, radios and distempers and, of course, as the House will remember from debates a long time back, to cigarettes and tobacco.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same column he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the volume of complaint which has reached the Department of Industry and Commerce, and which has occasionally been expressed in the Dáil, I think that the need for legislation is obvious.  It is true that it is contended that the scale and operation of restrictive practices here is not very great or, at any rate, is not as great as in some other countries.  The important fact for us <Col N="1101" /> to note, however, is that it is growing and it is the growth of these restrictive practices which, I think, emphasises the need for investigating the position and the taking of means to control it before it goes too far.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to peruse these columns and to ask themselves the question: Do they not contain the most admirable description of what I have stigmatised for 20 years as tariff racketeering?  Let us face the fact that tariff racketeers are the children of Fianna Fáil.  It is they who created them and it is they who live out of them.  Robert Louis Stevenson once wrote a story called <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>.  Dr. Jekyll is with us to-day. The Minister is in his reforming mood and wants to see justice done to all. No vengeance.  No recrimination.  He merely wants all to come together to see justice done.  Dr. Jekyll used to want that when he had his top hat, his spats and his frock coat on and if anyone had gone to him and said: &ldquo;But are you not the Mr. Hyde I saw cavorting on the roofs last night?&rdquo; he would have drawn himself up with dignity and bid the man &ldquo;Begone.&rdquo;  How dare he identify him with the disagreeable character jack-acting in the dark alleys the night before! We all know the painful story.  At periods, when Dr. Jekyll wore his frock coat and carried his doctor's bag he was a respectable citizen.  When Mr. Hyde went out on the tiles at night it became harder and harder to get him home until eventually when the patients called on Dr. Jekyll they found awaiting them Mr. Hyde.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Mr. Hyde days brought this tariff racketeering generally into existence.  As Deputy McGrath said so eloquently, in his plain and honest way, there used not to be these abuses.  That is quite true.  They are of recent growth.  If one could not buy a bath at a reasonable price at one period of our history one could go to another man and look to him for a price.  Why is it we cannot do that now?  The answer is that Mr. Hyde was on the tiles.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath was anxious to see the patients in Cork infirmary get a radio.  He was quoted a price.  He <Col N="1102" /> thought the price too high.  He finds now that he cannot get a competitive quotation and he wants to know the reason why.  The answer is that Mr. Hyde was on the tiles again.  There was a tariff put on radios, too.  Come! Name a single commodity in which a restrictive practice operates in this city that is not subject to a tariff or a quota.  I challenge any potential racketeer to establish a restrictive practice which I cannot break unless that restrictive practice is sustained by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he is on the tiles like Mr. Hyde.  I do not believe that the Dr. Jekyll side of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will long prevail. When someone calls on Dr. Jekyll to invoke the power of this Act and bring some miscreant to book there will be an election pending.  There will be an election pending and the treasurers of the Fianna Fáil organisation will simply rub the back of their heads and say &ldquo;crackle, crackle, crackle&rdquo;.</P>

I am suggesting that when a general election is pending the same vested interests that gave £9,000 for the three by-elections will contribute a further £15,000 to the Fianna Fáil organisation on condition that there are no uncomfortable references of their restrictive practices to the commission which is set up under this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did Mr. Hyde put on the frock coat and tall hat of Dr. Jekyll from time to time and put them on with lesser frequency as time went on?  Why did his appearances as Dr. Jekyll become a fragrant memory when he was finally put behind bars? Because he degenerated slowly.  That is why.  I do not doubt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has degenerated slowly.  I imagine that in his salad days and in his open-eyed enthusiasm when he was the dashing <Col N="1103" /> young Lochinvar in 1931 he thought all he had to do was to snap his fingers and swing his arms and industry would blossom in the land.  He told the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis recently that the industries established heretofore would compare with those as yet to come in the ratio of a raindrop to an earthquake. If the restrictive practices grew out of a raindrop to the same degree as we would expect to come out of an earthquake, God help us.  Deputy McGrath will not be able to get a mouth organ or a tin whistle for the patients in the Cork hospital, never mind a wireless.</P>
      <P>I think this Bill was brought in for the purpose of creating the impression that the Minister was going to do something about the mounting volume of protests rolling into his Department against the highway robbery that was going on.  I ask the House to remember that up to three months ago Deputy McGrath used to get hysterics and Deputy Davern used to rumble and if there were Ministers sitting on the front Fianna Fáil bench they shook like jelly at the horrible aspersion cast on Irish industry and the Gaels who manned it.  What has happened that the Fianna Fáil Party has now become the hammer and the scourge of tariff racketeers?  Is it that the scandal stank so high to heaven that they felt they could not sit on the lid of the pot much longer?  Or is it perhaps that Deputy McGrath struck and said he would not sit on the lid of the pot any longer?</P>

    <P>I think it behoves the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell me and not for me to tell him why he has changed his tune.  When did he find out that this tariff racketeering was going on?  I am bound to say, in order to give the devil his due, that I raised in this House a question relating to baths and their supply and I told the complainants who came to me that I had no doubt that if this matter was brought to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and conviction was carried to his mind that what I described was in progress he would provide a remedy.  Let me say openly and frankly that when the facts <Col N="1104" /> had been fully investigated by the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;I do not know how the executive action was taken&mdash;effective action was taken to put right what was wrong and I was very grateful for it because I had pledged my reputation to the people who approached me originally that it would be put right by any Department of State once the full facts were brought before them.</P>
    <P>It may be that I have educated the Department of Industry and Commerce. It would not be the first time. But if I have at last succeeded in bringing home to the mind of the Minister the facts which he has long and so excitedly and so violently denied, then I make the modest suggestion that if hereafter the House contemplates establishing any order of merit they can consider my name to be included very high up on the roll in that I have achieved in the political life of this country a miracle which deserves to take its place with some of the greatest that have been recorded in the history of the human race.</P>
    <P>I am glad, however, that a body is to be set up which will have the power to turn the searchlights of public opinion on unsavoury, smelly transactions such as have disgraced the business life of this country.  Bear in mind that I have stated repeatedly in this House and outside it that there are in the business life of this country strictly honourable and decent men who never sought any protection, who never sought any licence to rob their fellow man.  Their fine reputation has been gravely compromised by the racketeers who have sought tariffs and quotas for no other purpose than to rob their neighbour.</P>
    <P>I think it ill becomes Deputies to go out of their way to asperse the name and reputation of one of the greatest industrial enterprises which this country has.  There is no use closing our eyes to it.  I have heard illinformed references made to Guinness's brewery.  The only restrictive practice ever practised so far as I know by that brewery was to say to a bottler: &ldquo;If you bottle anybody else's stout you must use your own label.&rdquo;  Some of the largest bottlers bottle Guinness's <Col N="1105" /> and Beamish's and other stouts, using their own label without let or hindrance. There is, however, the proviso: &ldquo;If you want to use the labels which we supply free of charge you have to confine yourself to bottling our stout, because we have always held that that was a quasi-guarantee that there was nothing but Guinness's stout bottled. You can bottle our stout or anybody else's under your own label.&rdquo;  Some of the biggest of the bottlers have always done so and there has never been any hard feelings or ill-will or ill-feeling in the brewery against them.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is desirable to be arguing this across the floor of the House.  If he asks for a supply of a certain trade mark label which is supplied free, he undertakes not to bottle any other stout.  If he wants to get supplies of stout of any other brands and to bottle all brands under his own label, there is no restriction on his doing so.  I think Deputy Brennan will agree that to discuss the affairs of one firm across the House is wholly undesirable.  I think it ill becomes us to be taking side swipes at one of the most valuable and public-spirited undertakings in this country.</P>
      <P>I commend the attention of the Labour Party to column 820, where the Minister begins the second paragraph of his speech:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am asking the House to agree that where a trade association takes power to exclude any citizen from any trade...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask my friends in the trade union <Col N="1106" /> movement to remove from that great and beneficent movement the stigma of saying that in certain departments it operates to exclude from a skilled trade individuals, if for no other reason than that they were born under the wrong roof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At column 821, Volume 134, of the Official Debates of 31st October, 1952, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Bill which I am asking the Dáil to approve is based on two principles.  The first is, as a general rule and subject to public policy, to restrict imports by tariffs or quota arrangements in the interests of national economic development, with the fullest and freest competition in any trade, is in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the House that inside a quota there can be no competition. If it is ascertained that our people habitually consume in a given year 1,000,000 units of a certain article, and the manufacturer succeeds in getting a quota, I think the practice of the Minister's Department is to ask the manufacturer: &ldquo;How many units can you produce?&rdquo; Suppose he replies &ldquo;800,000,&rdquo; the Minister will fix a quota at perhaps 300,000, and he will feel that the surplus of 100,000 over and above &mdash;300,000 plus 800,000 gives you 1,100,000 &mdash;ought to create a situation in the domestic market of adequate competition. But it never does, because the manufacturer simply folds his arms, sits down, and waits until the 300,000 units are consumed.  Then he says: &ldquo;I will get my price for the 700,000 in any case, and if I succeed in getting my price for 700,000 why sell 800,000?&rdquo;&mdash; and there is nothing anybody here can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man gets a tariff of 10 per cent., 20 per cent., 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 50 per cent., 60 per cent., 70 per cent., 80 per cent., 90 per cent., it does not matter.  If he tries to push the profiteering up too high ultimately you could go and say: &ldquo;I will pay the 90 per cent. tariff and bring stuff in rather than pay a gouger's price to domestic producers.&rdquo;  That is not so, if there <Col N="1107" /> is a quota.  Once the 300,000 units have come in it does not matter what price it is at, we must either do without the commodity or buy what is produced on the domestic market, and when that commodity is made by a ring under a protective quota, in theory you can go to the Department of Industry and Commerce remonstrating, but in fact, you have something else to do without invoking the cumbrous machinery of the Department of Industry and Commerce to investigate your own particular grievance about the price of one article.</P>
    <P>Let me tell a story to give you an idea of how quotas work.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, by the authority of the Government I bought 100,000 tons of superphosphate of lime from the Dutch superphosphate cartel. When I made the bargain with them, I said: &ldquo;By the way, when you are selling the 100,000 tons in one parcel, do you not think it would be becoming if you delivered the commodity in Irishmade paper bags.&rdquo;  The representative of the Dutch firm said: &ldquo;I think it would be.&rdquo;  I asked him if he would look into it and see if it was a practicable policy.  &ldquo;I will certainly,&rdquo; he said.  Now 100,000 tons of superphosphate represented 2,000,000 paper bags.  I did not hear for about a month.  All this correspondence is in the Minister for Industry and Commerce's Department for I sent it to him.  At the end of a month I got a letter from the Dutch people to say they were sorry they were unable to carry out our agreement about the paper bags for reasons set out in the enclosed correspondence.</P>
    <P>The enclosed correspondence read as follows: the Dutch manure people approached the manufacturer of paper bags in this country and asked him would he supply 2,000,000 paper bags. The firm in Ireland replied politely that they had a Dutch correspondent and they had an undertaking with the Dutch correspondent that they would not supply paper bags in Holland if the Dutch factory did not supply paper bags in Ireland.  The Dutch people then &mdash;I think they knew what I thought of arrangements of that character and <Col N="1108" /> that that was not a very becoming communication to have to make to me &mdash;went themselves to the Dutch paper manufacturers and asked would they object to the Irish firm supplying paper bags for this particular parcel of fertilisers.  The Dutch paper firm sent them a letter saying that in the special circumstances of this case they would like their friends in Ireland to know they would take it in no sense amiss if they provided the bags for this consignment of fertilisers intended for Ireland.  The final letter from the Irish bag manufacturers was to say that with their existing equipment they had plenty of work to do to keep their business going; they were making a nice profit and they did not want any more.  And the paper bags had to be made either in Holland or jute bags had to be used for the consignment.</P>
    <P>That to my mind is the mentality born of the quota protection system and I venture to say if the Minister would open up the report of the American experts on industrial efficiency in this country one of the first things they would say is: &ldquo;If you wrap people in so much cotton wool that they quite luxuriously earn a high standard of living for themselves, how can you expect them to exert themselves to get more trade when they are already earning as much as the Revenue Commissioners allow them to keep?  They aim to earn just as much as the Revenue Commissioners will allow them to keep.  When they get to the level at which the Revenue Commissioners take everything but 6d. in the £ why should they break their heart and take the economic risks of expanding further?&rdquo; Mind you, I think this has to be said if the record is to be kept straight. I remember instances in which the most outrageous claims were made by tariff racketeers in this country for extra protection and the blackmail was: &ldquo;If we do not get it, we will close down and sack the men.&rdquo;  I am sorry to say that on one occasion I was approached by the trade unions who asked: &ldquo;What was I thinking of in acting tough with these people when it might mean men losing their jobs?&rdquo; I was confronted by a most notorious <Col N="1109" /> racketeer, an old warrior with a skin on him as thick as a tortoise's and lying on the tortoise-shell were the very people I was trying to protect from the exploitation which was going to be perpetrated upon them by this warrior.</P>

      <P>I understood their difficulty and we talked it over.  I sent them back to that fellow with a message to go and take a running jump at himself and if he jumped too far he might land where he never intended to land.  He did not jump.</P>
      <P>There are certain details in this Bill to which I want to refer because I think they are probably oversights. There is one matter in Deputy Larkin's speech to which I refer.  He is mistaken and I certainly disagree with him.  There is nobody in this House who wants this commission to be more active in pouring the light of day on the activities of these people, but do not let us turn an instrument for liberation and decency in our social life into an instrument of blackmail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No individual citizen of this State should have the right to initiate proceedings before this commission.  The commission should have it.  The Minister should have it on behalf of the people.  Therefore, if anybody feels that there is something wrong, they can write to the Minister and ask him to refer this matter to the commission to have it investigated.  Suppose they imagine the Minister to be improperly lethargic in this matter, they can write to any member of the Opposition; the matter can be raised in the House and the Minister questioned.  &ldquo;Why do you not refer this matter?&rdquo; If every person who was engaged in business was to have hanging over his head in perpetuity the sword of Damocles that any old dafty had a right to arraign him and make what she or he would call a <i>prima facie</i> case of misfeasance against him before a commission of this kind, life would become intolerable. In theory, if a man were to go before this commission 40 times a year, he ought to be delighted to trot off and defend himself but, in practice, he <Col N="1110" /> could be driven out of business and ruined by it and it could become a grave and serious evil and blackmail could arise.</P>
    <P>There is ample protection if, on the one hand, the commission have the right to initiate proceedings and, on the other hand, the Minister has the right to initiate proceedings, subject to his liability to be questioned here or to be actuated by motions adopted by Dáil Éireann which, in theory, this House could always pass, directing the Minister to refer any specific question to the commission.  In that case I think the Minister is perfectly right to withhold from individuals the right to initiate proceedings before this commission.</P>
    <P>There are certain details in the Bill which I cannot imagine will, on reflection, be left there.  I think it is altogether a mistake to give the commission the powers under Section 4. Heaven help us, is not the purpose of this legislation to do away with conspiracies to enforce rules of distribution? Is not the purpose of this legislation to release the power of free competition?  Why then do we put in Section 4 a power to lay down a code of rules and regulations which after this Bill comes into operation will cease to be a matter for concealment or shame but which the co-conspirators will glory in as having legislative sanction?</P>
    <P>In theory, if there were any injustice done by such a code of rules, they could be brought up again and reviewed but for what do we want a code of rules?  Our purpose is, by statute, to prevent bad rules.  Is that not so?  We are not concerned to facilitate combines to make what will hereafter be called good rules.  Let them make what rules they like and, if they are not bad rules, let them be, but why should we make Oireachtas Éireann party to what are called &ldquo;fair trading rules&rdquo;?  Every one of these rules is called a fair trading rule.  Ask R.G.D.A.T.A. and they will tell you that they concern themselves with nothing but rules to regulate fair trading, that anything else is anathema.  Call in builders' suppliers&mdash;call in any ring&mdash;and they will explain at infinite length that the <Col N="1111" /> sole purpose of their restrictive practices is to protect the interest of the consumer, that they think of nobody else and that if these regulations were not in being the poor consumer would be ruined.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister cast his mind back to the glorious performance he put on when he was introducing the Cement Bill.  Do you remember when he was reassuring us all that all the restrictive practices in that legislation had one thing in mind&mdash;to protect the poor, humble Irish from the voracious intentions of the Danish cement cartel up in Denmark and that, if he let them at us, Copenhagen would strip us bare?  Cement Ltd. was established, and who was Cement Ltd. but Mr. Jensen from Copenhagen, and there he is ever since.  The Minister will remember every restrictive practice laid down in that Bill.  Nothing but Deputy Dillon's obscurantism conceals from his eye the lofty purpose the Minister had in mind to protect only the Irish consumer from the cruel rapacity of those who would otherwise skin him alive.  Dáil Éireann swallowed it and we passed the Bill and set up Cement Ltd. and heard that not a trowel of Danish cement would be allowed into this country, and the first man to say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; was Carl Jensen from the chairman's seat, where he still sits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole code of the Cement Acts, which are nothing but a code of restrictive regulations, was sold to this House by the Minister as the fruit of his sleepless nights in his anxiety for nothing but the protection of the <Col N="1112" /> Irish cement consumer.  Look at what we got.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to you, Sir, that the moment this commission is set up the first references I am going to urge on the Minister for Industry and Commerce are the trade practices of Cement Ltd. and its subsidiaries, and I will venture to say that when the commission is finished studying them they will dazzle the eyes of the nation. Do not be under any misapprehension. Cement Ltd., <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo</i>, is embedded in every section of this Bill, and when its ramifications, and its interlocking agreements, and its wholesalers, primary wholesalers, secondary wholesalers, local distributors, retailers and manufacturers come to be examined, we will all be lost in admiration of the powers of salesmanship of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who sold us the code of fair trading rules incorporated in the Cement Acts of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I suggest to him that, having achieved that prodigy, he should rest on his laurels and omit from this Bill Section 4 and the powers enshined <Col N="1113" /> therein?  We do not want any new rules and particularly we do not want a set of trade restriction rules hallowed and sanctioned by legislation of this Oireachtas, and the Bill does not require it.  It takes nothing from the effectiveness of the Bill to leave out Section 4 and Section 5 and I urge the Minister to do it.  May I direct his attention to Section 10:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for a court of competent jurisdiction, notwithstanding any rule of law, to grant an injunction on the motion of the Minister or of any other person to enforce compliance with the terms of an Order under Section 8 for the time being in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the significance of the insertion of the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any rule of law?&rdquo; May I suggest to the Minister that it is a most undesirable thing, by the insertion of one sentence in a section of a Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, to sweep away the whole of the rule of law?  I suggest to the Minister that it could add nothing of value to the section, that it must give scandal, to begin with, and is certain to move the courts to do all in their power to devise an equitable means of rendering that section nugatory, as unquestionably they ought to do because this House should not by legislation sweep away the whole rule of law.</P>
    <P>Now, may I direct the Minister's attention to Section 11 (2):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who aids, abets or assists another person...to do anything...the doing of which is declared...to be an offence shall himself be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an unreasonable proviso.  Suppose a firm engaged in a restrictive practice sends a messenger boy around on a bicycle with a letter to one of the co-conspirators to say: &ldquo;I have a Garda sergeant here, weighing 15½ stone, moseying around among my books and you had better take precautions.&rdquo; Under that section the messenger is guilty of an offence.  May I suggest to the Minister that where you are dealing with companies or persons who contravene a law, one ought to define very strictly what criminal collaboration means and not simply provide that anyone <Col N="1114" /> who is employed by one of the persons under indictment is himself guilty of an offence, whether he knows he is taking part in the commission of the offence or not?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister have regard to Section 12 (2) (c):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A statement in writing purporting to be signed by a director of the body corporate to the effect that the person named in the statement has been appointed...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that statement in order to be judicially recognised should be required to bear the seal of the company? It is a small detail, but it makes the difference between proper authentication of a document which purports to speak on behalf of an incorporated company and the casual signature of a director who may be under considerable stress.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister, when concluding, explain to us the difference in Section 13 (1) of procedure under paragraph (a) where the maximum penalty is £500 and procedure under (b) where the penalty on conviction may be £5,000?  One is on summary conviction, that is paragraph (a), and the other is conviction on indictment.  Who shall determine whether summary proceedings or indictment are to be followed?  Surely there ought to be some mandatory provision here, setting out in what circumstances a defendant may be prosecuted by indictment? Otherwise, we might have two persons, one proceeded against under summary jurisdiction and the other by way of indictment, when it may appear to many that their faults were identical, where one is fined £500 and the other exposed to a fine of £5,000, one is exposed to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months while the other is exposed to imprisonment or to penal servitude for a term not exceeding 10 years.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say this.  In dealing with a restrictive trade practices Bill, does not the House think that we are beginning to get things out of a sense of proportion when we provide in the Bill the possibility of a person being sentenced to ten years' penal servitude? This is not a Bill to suppress rape or mayhem or arson.  It is a Bill to prevent tariff racketeers from continuing <Col N="1115" /> to do that which they were encouraged by the Fianna Fáil Government to do for the past 20 years; and I think that to give them 10 years' penal servitude for doing just the things they were exhorted to do, as good little Fianna Fáilers would be expected to do, is going too far.  I would be content to see them getting no more than hard labour for the peccadilloes we are concerned to correct here.  I beg the House to maintain some sense of proportion.  Ten years of a man's life in penal servitude is not to be measured in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

      <P>I see the bland smile on the countenance of Deputy Allen in contemplation of that possibility.  Let him banish the evil thought from his mind.  His Minister is in his Dr. Jekyll mood to-day and I should be prepared for Mr. Hyde if and when he should emerge.</P>
      <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to Section 14 (2) and ask the reason for setting aside the Petty Sessions Act.  Is there any particular reason why you should extend the period in this Bill to 12 months, if for all other analogous offences the provisions in relation to summary proceedings apply?  At all events, I do not mind that.  If you want to put that blister on your own spiritual children, I think they deserve it, and it is a good thing that they should bear that mark of your thumb upon them.</P>
      <P>I do not know the meaning of Section 15 and, therefore, in humility I would esteem it a favour if the Minister at his convenience would explain it.  It is probably something highly technical on which he might perhaps at his convenience get a note.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would look at the Schedule, he would find that Section 3 refers to the restriction on interested persons acting as members.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />&ldquo;If a member is personally interested in a particular matter with which the commission is dealing, he shall inform the Minister accordingly and shall not, unless authorised by the Minister, act as a member during the consideration of that matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is unfortunately drafted, for the simple reason that there may be two views as to whether a man is really interested in a matter or not. Somehow or other, I do not think it is fair to put on him the obligation of determining whether in fact he is or not.  I think the initiative must come from the Minister and that we should create in the Bill a position in which the member's duty is to stand ready to serve when called on to do so, leaving on the Minister's shoulders the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;Well, now, the three members of the commission are Messrs. A, B and C; here is something coming up about which I think we should ask member A if he has any interest; I can discuss it with him and if he has I can ask him to stand aside and appoint a substitute.&rdquo; It is not fair to put the members of the commission, who may in perfect good faith go in and take part in the proceedings, in the difficulty that somebody may ask here in this House &ldquo;whether the Minister is aware that Mr. A, at present examining the case of boot manufacturers, sells bootlaces in his establishment in Ballydehob&rdquo;.  The responsibility should be on the Minister to say: &ldquo;With all relevant information at my disposal, I take the initiative myself in dismissing him from this board of arbitration&rdquo;, rather than have the Minister say that &ldquo;the member of the commission sat not realising that anyone would make this representation and I can agree with the member of the commission.&rdquo;  I think the initiative should lie with the Minister to say that it is proper for the members of the commission to inquire into it, and that he should take upon his shoulders the responsibility of determining whether they had any interest in the matter to be discussed and, if so, the responsibility of asking them to stand aside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Deputy Morrissey has already dealt with the question of making a member of the Garda Síochána an authorised person for the purpose of this Bill. When I read this section, I read it to be &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána authorised in writing by the commission for the purposes of this paragraph.&rdquo; I think Deputy Morrissey is probably right that it is any member of the Garda or a person authorised by the commission.  Surely, on reflection, the Minister will realise that it is quite unsuitable to draw the Garda into these proceedings at all.  The job of the Gardaí is to bring criminals to justice and to prevent the commission of crime.  It is true that they engage in the collection of statistics and certain works of that kind where there is not <i>in potentia</i> any possibility of the discovery of crime.  When you bring members of the Garda Síochána into the business of inquiring into circumstances and facts which may ultimately lead to a prosecution, invariably their initiative in the matter puts the person whom they visit on his defence.  I suggest to the Minister that the probability of the Guards being employed for this work is remote and that a much more sensible arrangement would be to strike out the words &ldquo;member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; and leave it simply &ldquo;means a member of the commision or any person authorised for the purposes of this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-section (b), Section 2, the Minister will see there &ldquo;to require the person who carries on such activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to any officer any books...&rdquo;  I urge upon the Minister that the fundamental principle of the enforcement of the law should be that the penalty and the duty should devolve upon a responsible officer of the company, if you are dealing with a company, or with the employer himself.  It is a rotten thing to send representatives of the Government of the country into a place of business and to put a trusted employee into the horrible dilemma of having either to involve his employer in disagreeable proceedings or break the law.  That is not the responsibility of the employee.  The employee's job is <Col N="1118" /> to carry out the lawful commands of his employer and the more faithfully he does that the better citizen he is. It is a rotten thing to go in and if the employer should prove intractable or fail to give the co-operation required of him under this Bill say to the employee: &ldquo;Split the gaff on this fellow.  I appeal to you not only to help in the administration of the law but I warn you that if you attempt to maintain any loyalty to this man you will be subject to ten years' penal servitude if the Minister proceeds against you on indictment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remember when Minister for Agriculture that a question arose in regard to costing in the flour-milling industry.  It was suggested that a regulation should be made whereby the cost accountant should have the right, which he did not get, to go beyond the miller to his employee.  I said I would never sign any such Order, that if we had any quarrel with the miller and could not settle the matter by argument then we could prosecute in the court.  I would never ask an officer to go to a trusted employee who had spent his whole life working for a person and put him in a dilemma.  I would impress upon the Minister that he should remove that from the Bill, and face the fact that if a company or an individual fails in its responsibility the procedure should be to go into court and not put employees in a horrible dilemma.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that this Bill was brought in, that it will be passed.  So long as Fianna Fáil is in office it is the father and mother of all frauds, but Fianna Fáil will not be in office long.  The Bill has potentialities for great good.  I would cheerfully elide from it every single section that provides for a fine or imprisonment. I do not believe it is necessary and, upon my word, I do not think it is desirable for the House to say that it is the intention to clap citizens into prison for ten years.  I would willingly take all these sections out of the Bill. Such powers will never be used so long as Fianna Fáil depends for its return to office on the money of the racketeers; but they are going out. They are dwindling and mouldering <Col N="1119" /> away.  The Bill, without its penal sections, would be a searchlight which can in due time be turned on the spiritual children of Fianna Fáil.  I want that Bill to be a searchlight to turn on the spiritual children of the Fianna Fáil Party, the tariff racketeers.  I said this Bill was in certain respects a contemptible fraud. Yes, so long as we are depending upon Fianna Fáil to enforce it.  I look forward to its being an instrument of great value in the cleansing of the body politic of this country, the tariff racketeering parasites who have fed upon our blood for so long, when Fianna Fáil have been replaced by a better Government in God's good time.</P>

      <P>Like all other Deputies who spoke, I want to express my belief that this is the nearest thing to the perfect instrument to deal with the situation which arises in respect of restrictive trade practices.  It is obvious that the Minister has examined the position from every angle before he decided on that type of legislation. If he were to decide to make certain restrictive practices illegal he would not be effectively dealing with the situation but by making provision for permission to examine all or any acts which might be suspect he made proper provision for distinguishing between what might be inimical to the welfare of the community and what might not.  There are many trade associations which are not detrimental to the welfare of the community; there are many restrictions which are necessary for the success of the particular organisation or trade concerned; and there are even restrictive practices which are damaging but which, at the same time, contain a certain amount of good.  The Bill as drafted provides that such things can be dealt with according to their merits or demerits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech we have heard from Deputy Dillon had little or no reference to the problem at all.  He merely availed of the opportunity to give expression to his heart's desire, of which every member of the Dáil is aware, that we should have foreign goods pouring into this country, morning, noon and night.  He betrayed his <Col N="1120" /> hatred of Irish industry and his contempt for anything established here in a successful way by the Fianna Fáil industrial drive.  The country is well aware of his attitude towards that and will not take seriously any of his allegations that restrictive trade practices are due merely to the tariff protection afforded to industries to enable them to develop.  They are not.  Some of the most damaging restrictive practices we have have no relation whatever to firms which secured protective tariffs and many of them relate to goods produced outside this country; but I know that if free trade were allowed and if foreign goods could be dumped here <i>ad lib</i>, we would have no restrictive trade practices and we know how a future Government, which Deputy Dillon's wishful thinking would replace a Fianna Fáil Government, would deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>He visualised a system whereby the dumping of foreign-manufactured goods into this country, without a tariff wall, would, in its own way, prevent any restrictive practices.  Nobody in the country desires to see that means of stopping such practices in operation. Many of the associations which are becoming detrimental to the welfare of the community were necessary for the success of certain firms originally, and they helped them to climb to the stage at which they could feel they had made their position secure and at which they were able to produce at home and to employ Irish labour which otherwise they might not have been able to do.</P>
    <P>When we talk about dealing with firms guilty of restrictive practices detrimental to the community, we should remember that these firms into which private individuals have put their capital have certain rights and that there is a limit to the extent to which we should go to curtail their development.  I do not believe that every chemist's shop, every grocer's shop and every public-house should be selling wireless sets, but I believe that those who sell them should be entitled to sell them for whatever figure they wish, without running the risk of having their names struck off the list of people who may be supplied with <Col N="1121" /> such goods.  There is a fairly large category of people who would be eligible to deal with such goods, but I do not believe that every individual should have a large emporium which, in the long run, would mean that each would be detrimental to the other and would result in failures in business. Neither do I believe that every householder should have a petrol pump stuck outside his door, a system which would lead in the end to a position in which nobody was making a living out of the business; but no village should be left without such an amenity as a petrol pump, just because the garage in the neighbouring town can object to and prevent the erection of a petrol pump.</P>
    <P>There is a measure of restriction necessary for the success of business and the success of those engaged in it. There must be some restriction in order to ensure that success attends the efforts of those people who risk their money in dealing in the distribution of goods.  In the same way, I think the local mechanic who is prepared to use his little premises as a repair shop in the village should not be precluded from securing supplies of necessary accessories merely because he has not got the 3,000 or 5,000 square feet of space necessary to enable him to become a member of a particular trade association.  These are the things that really affect the liberty of the citizen and very often deprive him of the opportunity of securing materials at a much lesser price than he has to pay. These restrictions can in no way be traced to protective tariffs introduced by Fianna Fáil or anybody else.  I submit that the tirade of abuse which we heard from the previous speaker was merely a venting of his pent-up spite against the success of the industrial development drive initiated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the care with which he has forged the instrument before the House, because it is one which cannot be used unduly against any concern.  We are anxious that as many concerns as possible which engage in private enterprise should be allowed to succeed and enabled to employ Irish labour at home.  If we are to depend on our <Col N="1122" /> present system of private enterprise, we should not be harsh in our attitude towards these people as Deputy Larkin insinuated in his speech when he portrayed them as a lot of racketeers and persons not fitted to take part in the industrial life of the country at all.  We have seen the alternative to private enterprise in other countries and we thought very little of it.  We have seen how the taxes of the community can be squandered by nationalised organisations under the system in other countries.  Private enterprise is a system we want to encourage at present.  It is a system under which individuals are induced to put their own earnings into industry and just as the farmer who buys a farm has a right to make a success of his farming business and make a profit out of it, so has the man who risks his capital in an industry the right to be protected and not made the target of every attack in this House and of every piece of legislation that can be directed against him.  Otherwise, our industrial drive would never succeed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is carefully framed to attack restrictive practices only where they can be proved to be inimical to the welfare of the community.  I am satisfied that it has been so carefully drafted that it will not militate against fair associations or fair trade practices which sometimes may appear to be restrictive but which on examination are found to be nothing more than essential associations which are indispensable to the success of the firms concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey was fair enough in his speech on the Bill.  His approach to it was that which one would expect from a person who was in a responsible position and who had examined the facts carefully, but I do not agree with him when he said that the Bill would in no way influence the cost of living.  It can be used in many instances to provide consumers with certain goods much more cheaply than they are sold at present because we have many restrictive practices at the present time which really amount to preventing the trader from selling under a fixed minimum price at the <Col N="1123" /> risk of losing his supply of certain goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath from Cork mentioned the difficulty of buying a wireless set at a reduced price.  Not so long ago I was asked by a number of people who had decided to buy a wireless for a poor person in hospital to try to obtain it at a lower rate than the fixed price, but I was unable to do so because the traders pointed out that if they were to supply me at less than the catalogued price of these goods they would risk being struck off the list of the Wireless Dealers' Association and prevented from dealing in such goods in the future.  That restriction should not operate.  Many traders throughout the country would be satisfied with less than 33? per cent. profit on goods of that type.  I mention such goods only as an example.  There are many others.</P>
    <P>The most ruthless restrictive practices we know have nothing to do with protective tariffs, tariffs responsible for the development of our industries, and I do not think we should attack industrialists as they were attacked by the previous speaker.  We should encourage them, and assure them that the Bill will not be directed against anything which is not inimical to the welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would congratulate the Minister for forging for this House a piece of legislation which is nearly perfect to deal with a situation which could not be dealt with by anything other than the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all it is necessary for me and I think it desirable to congratulate the Minister on the lucid statement he gave the House in introducing the Bill.  It has come to be expected of him that in putting legislation before the House he will always explain it fully, as far as possible take the House into his confidence, and be in that way helpful to all Deputies in passing legislation through and in securing for it fair consideration.  At the end of his introductory statement I asked a simple question.  I asked whether this Bill would affect agricultural <Col N="1124" /> goods in just the same way as manufactured goods.  I did not ask the question in that form, but that was my intention.  The Minister politely informed me that it would, but when I asked that question there was an angry growl from the Opposition Benches, and the Deputies there almost all together demanded that I should have read it.  Let it be clear that this is a Bill the mere reading of which is hardly sufficient, the text of which does not contain all that is implied by the Bill.  It is a Bill which in effect sets up a body to carry out certain functions which are not too clear, but which we all know to be essential. Therefore, I think it was the right of any Deputy to ask the Minister for further information in addition to all he had given in this introduction.  The Bill applies to goods of all kinds, as I understand it.  In answer to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey the term &ldquo;goods&rdquo; does not include the harrowed bodies or blemished souls of ex-Ministers.</P>

      <P>It includes goods which are produced.  According to the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, if, when he goes down to Templemore or elsewhere, he is not plastered over the front page of the <i>Irish Press</i> he can invoke the aid of the Fair Trade Commission in order to secure justice. I think that the ex-Minister was a little bit frivolous in dealing with an important Bill of this kind and I do not think he could have been serious in making that point, particularly when he realised that his fellow-Deputy from Tipperary, who proposed another toast, is excluded completely from the columns of the <i>Irish Independent</i>; that is another restrictive practice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey did make one clear-cut definite statement in the course of his speech.  He said that this Bill will not affect the cost of living and almost in the same breath he said that he would support it.  When we realise the cost of administration in this country and the cost of government we should be slow to add to the administrative machinery another board or commission which, in the opinion of Deputy Morrissey, does not achieve any purpose.  If he were sincere in his statement that the Bill will not affect the cost of living I think that his rightful place would be in opposition to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan will allow me.  There is no need to refer on this Bill to a person's profession or calling at all.  I do not see any reason why that should be dragged in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  However, I think that Deputy Morrissey ought to give as patient a hearing to other Deputies as he expects for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Morrissey believes that this Bill will not achieve the purpose which it sets out to achieve, namely, a reduction in the cost of goods by the elimination of the causes of unjustifiable profiteering in the production <Col N="1126" /> and distribution of goods he should indicate his opposition to it.  I should certainly oppose this Bill if I thought for one moment that it will not have the effect of promoting competition amongst those who are engaged in the production and distribution of goods.  I believe it will encourage competition and I believe that unrestricted competition is the most effective means of reducing prices.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, and as every Deputy who has spoken has admitted, there are restrictive practices in operation over the whole field of production and distribution and particularly in the field of distribution. Attempts have been made inside and outside this House to represent this Bill as an attack on Irish manufacturers.  Attempts have been made to convey the idea that the only people who are against this Bill are the Irish manufacturers, but attempts have also been made to convey the impression that the only people who will be affected by this Bill are Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>It throws a considerable light on this question when we hear it said that there are cases of restrictive trade practices in which the distributors and not the manufacturers are at fault. Deputy Morrissey cited a glaring case of a manufacturer who sought to reduce the price of a commodity and who was sternly refused permission to do so.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon comes into this House and launches a fierce attack on tariff racketeers and industrialists he seems to me to be very wide of the mark.  In his opening speech on this Bill the Minister explained very clearly the different groups of people who will be affected by it.  He gave the House a list of certain restrictive operations that are affecting trade in this country.  He pointed out that refusal to supply goods on trade terms to persons who are not members of an association is an example of a restrictive trade practice.  He mentioned that that operated in regard to building materials and, strangely enough, in regard to newspapers.  Surely such a restriction could not be described as having anything but the effect of <Col N="1127" /> limiting competition, thereby raising the price of the commodity or preventing a reduction when the ordinary operation of trade would bring about that reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister cited exclusive dealing arrangements&mdash;arrangements by which certain powerful firms refuse to supply goods to a trader unless that trader agrees to sell no other commodity of a similar nature made by a rival concern. Petrol is an outstanding example under that heading.  Some of the bigger firms refuse to supply petrol unless the trader agrees to confine his petrol sales to the particular brand supplied by them.  Guinness's stout was also mentioned in this House.  I was impressed by the zeal with which Deputy Dillon rushed in to defend Guinness.  Evidently the fact that the Guinness firm was in existence before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office is sufficient reason for Deputy Dillon to regard them as worthy of special protection from him.  Everybody knows that Guinness exercise a very firm restrictive and, I would say, almost tyrannical control in their trade.  The Minister cited other examples&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister did not say that or even imply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cited other examples of restrictive trade practices. He convinced the House that there was need for this Bill so far as goods and commodities are concerned.  There is no use in one member of the Opposition Front Bench coming in here and describing this Bill as a fraudulent Bill while other prominent members, including Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Larkin, welcome the Bill as a reasonable contribution to the solution of our problems of production, distribution and marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness in this Bill, and I think it is a weakness, is that it is confined to goods and to goods only, and that it does not apply to services. Why should the person who is engaged in the sale of goods or in the production of goods be liable to prosecution and penalty under this Bill when it <Col N="1128" /> becomes an Act, while no such penalties apply in regard to the supply of services? Why should restrictive practices be so sternly condemned when they are engaged in by retailers' or wholesalers' associations or manufacturers' associations?  Why should there not be the same condemnation of similar restrictive practices when they are engaged in by trade unionists?  That seems to me to be a question which thousands of people all over the country are asking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin came into the House to-day and, unlike his usual form, he launched into a fierce attack upon everybody engaged in private enterprise in this country.  Generally we find Deputy Larkin moderate and restrained but to-day he went all out in a fierce onslaught on everybody who either produced or sold goods as a means of living or for a profit.  He described them as selfish, as people who were not engaged in business for the good of the community.  Is it not true that there is an element of selfishness in every human organisation and institution?  Is it not true that there is as much selfishness and self-seeking in the trade union movement as there is in any association of farmers or people engaged in trade?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases in which important branches of the transport industry were closed down and men forced out of employment because they would not join a certain union.  That is one example.  It is happening all over the country.  The most ruthless measures have been employed against men in order to drive them out of one trade union or to force them to join another union which they did not wish to join.  In the same way we have ruthless restrictions which prevent honest workers from putting their sons <Col N="1129" /> into a particular trade or craft.  Those are all restrictive practices.  It may be that in some cases there are justifiable restrictions even in regard to the supply of goods, but restrictions, if they are justifiable, should be imposed by law and not by any hole or corner organisation.  They should be imposed by the laws of this House and the laws of this House only.  A beginning is made by this Bill.  The Bill will provide any person who finds himself victimised in regard to the carrying out of his business, who finds that he is refused a chance of setting up in business for himself or of entering into any legitimate trade or calling, with an opportunity of stating his case before an impartial body.</P>
      <P>Here I think a very important matter arises.  The Bill, as I said at the outset, does not define very clearly the functions of the Fair Trade Commission.  It has pretty wide powers of investigation.  It is therefore all-important that the men who will constitute this board should be men with the highest sense of responsibility and with the highest knowledge of the task which they are called on to perform.  They must be men who are prepared to weigh every issue fairly and carefully.  They must be men free from that narrow, bitter class prejudice which Deputy Larkin demonstrated or that peculiar bitter prejudice which Deputy Dillon demonstrated in this House.</P>
      <P>They must be men with broad minds and fair minds and at the same time they must be men who, like the Tánaiste, are determined to battle with and overcome this nation's problems and who will face every difficulty with the long-term view of advancing the nation economically and putting it on a sounder foundation.  I am quite in agreement with those who have said that the selection of the personnel of this commission will be a task of considerable difficulty, a task that will require very considerable care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister has amply justified this Bill.  The statements that have been made from the Opposition side of the House, contradictory and illogical though some of them may be, have not weakened the case for this <Col N="1130" /> Bill.  There might be perhaps a little exception in regard to that.  Even in his endorsement of this Bill, Deputy Larkin displayed an amount of prejudice and an anxiety to destroy private enterprise which I think should make everybody extremely careful in approaching a question of this kind. We have got to be sure that the steps that are being taken under this Bill will be in all cases justifiable and that no firm or individual will be unjustly or unfairly treated.  That, I think, is very essential and the House on the Committee Stage of the Bill will be only too anxious to provide the necessary safeguards, wherever it is felt that there is danger of grave injury being done to any person engaged in either the production or the distribution of goods.  I think the aim of the House should be to ensure that production and distribution will go on at an ever-increasing rate and that the opportunities of employment through private enterprise will continue to expand.  That should be the aim of every Party in this House.  All that the Bill seeks to ensure, and that I hope it will ensure, that nobody is allowed to put a spanner into the works of production or distribution, that nobody is allowed to reap excessive profits by combinations which restrict free competition.</P>
    <P>There are people I suppose outside the House who will describe this as a socialistic or semi-socialistic measure. I think the safest answer to those people is that for over 50 years we have had similar legislation operating in the United States, a country which I think is not very favourable to socialistic legislation.  If the people of the United States, with their strong tendency towards private enterprise, found it necessary to introduce legislation of this kind many years ago, I think it is only natural that the people of Ireland should be equally favourable to such a measure.</P>
    <P>While this Bill will apply to agricultural products, I do not think that the farming community are unduly worried about the effect of its operation. The farmers are a free, independent section of the community, and I do not think anyone will ever accuse them of being unduly predisposed <Col N="1131" /> towards combinations or class organisations. They are people who, I think, are rather too much inclined, if I may say it, to compete against each other, even in the marketing of their goods. Anyhow, they have never been successful in securing excessive prices for their produce.  The people who buy food in the shops frequently complain of the high prices they have to pay, but I suggest that if they were to examine those prices right back to the source of production, they would usually find that there is a very wide margin between the prices which they have to pay and the prices which the farmers receive for the particular commodity produced on the farm.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as far as the farmers are concerned, they welcome this particular piece of legislation, and hope that it will operate to eliminate profiteering, as I think I must describe it, in the sale of goods to farmers.  I think it is particularly desirable that the margin of profit between the price of a tractor, whether it is produced here or imported into the country, and the price at which it is delivered to the farmer, should be reduced to the minimum.  That margin is far too wide. The same applies, I think, to agricultural machinery and implements.  There is a very wide margin of profit allowed to the people engaged in distributing those goods to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I think it is not desirable that such wide margins should operate or that the raw materials of agriculture should provide wide margins of profit for people who are not engaged in agriculture or in the production of those raw materials.  In that way, I think the Bill will not only reduce the cost of living, but that it will also reduce, I hope, the cost of production to the farmers.  Those who are really desirous of this nation's welfare are more anxious to see the costs of production to the farmer reduced than to see higher prices for agricultural produce, because, by reducing the farmer's costs, you can hope to make a permanent advance in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is one last word I have to say to those who have ascribed all our <Col N="1132" /> economic evils to tariff racketeers.  All I can say to them is that they were three years in office.  Deputy Dillon was three years in the Government, and all those tariffs which he found in operation were retained during those three years, and even some new tariffs were added.  That, I think, is the most effective answer that one can make to those who say that the only people really responsible for the imposition of tariffs and the promotion of industry are the people on the Government side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before speaking in a detailed way on this Bill, I should like, first of all, to say that I repudiate the statement which was made here by a very highly respected colleague of my own concerning Cement, Limited. I am not in the habit of introducing personal notes into debates in this House, but I have something to do with the cement trade.  I sell a certain amount of cement&mdash;indeed, I think a pretty large amount.  In that respect, I may say that the return which my company gets for selling cement is indeed a very small one, so that I am not beholden to the cement company in any way.  I do not hold any shares in that company.  Neither does any member of my family, so far as I know.</P>
      <P>I have long regarded the cement company operating here in Ireland as one of the model companies which we have.  I can remember the time when we imported cement from various places.  It was not always up to the standard which we would like to see and which is so vitally necessary in the case of cement, above all products, because of the fact that it is the basis and the foundation of so much building in this country.  If we had not a first-class product we would have untold chaos in the building industry. To my knowledge, Cement Limited have never produced anything but the very best quality of cement, and they have produced it at a fair price; indeed I think at a somewhat cheap price&mdash;cheaper than it would be possible to import cement at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that I would be failing in my duty as a citizen and as a Deputy if I did not say that, despite <Col N="1133" /> whatever disagreements individual Deputies may have with Cement Limited over this policy or that policy, they certainly have produced a first-class quality product and have sold it at a very cheap price indeed.  Speaking as a person who sells it, I want to say that they have not in way lined the pockets of those engaged in the distribution trade.  Indeed we have had a considerable quarrel with them in that respect.  I think it is only fair to the House that I should say that.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Bill, I find myself, in company with the rest of the commercial and industrial community, in a rather difficult position.  I think that the Minister was not quite straightforward with us in his opening speech.  I think he has kept a number of his best cards close to his chest, and probably when he is closing this debate we will have the position clarified to a much greater degree. Certainly, at the present moment there is a good deal of confusion and, possibly, a certain amount of alarm, caused by this lack of knowledge of what the Minister really means.  He is going to set up a fair trade commission under this Bill.  It looks as if the question of deciding what will be done, or of what will be regarded as restrictive practices, will be left largely to that commission.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Estimate the Minister gave a very full account of the operations of his Department over the last year and of his plans for the future.  I think the statement he made met with the general approval of the House though there was a certain amount of criticism in <Col N="1134" /> connection with one or two matters. That criticism related mainly to the employment of outside artistes and the proposal to set up a council under the control of the Minister rather than an independent corporation on similar lines to the B.B.C.</P>
      <P>In connection with the employment of outside artistes everyone will agree that we ought to ensure as far as possible that our own nationals are employed in so far as that is consistent with the overall policy of maintaining the highest possible standards.  Deputy Everett referred last night to his policy of rigidly confining employment to Irish nationals during the years in which he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He told us about difficulties he had in securing buglers and trumpeters for the orchestra.  I do not think he should have found such great difficulty even within the narrow limits of the Government of which he was a member.  He should have been in a position to employ some very effective buglers and trumpeters.</P>
      <P>With regard to the setting up of an independent corporation I do not think it is altogether desirable that Radio Éireann should be cut off completely from either parliamentary or ministerial control.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the Deputies who advocate that course would be entirely satisfied subsequently.  Some years ago legislation was enacted which cut Córas Iompair Éireann off from the control of this House and there have been many protests because of the inability of parliament to direct the policy of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Land Commission is a relatively independent body.  Yet, we frequently have vehement demands for the abolition of that body and the handing over of control to the Minister and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has acted wisely in giving Radio Éireann the widest possible measure of independence while at the same time retaining a certain amount of control.  We might not be too pleased with the antics or actions of an Irish broadcasting corporation completely independent of this House. That corporation might act in a manner of which this House would strongly disapprove.  The course outlined by the Minister is a reasonable one.  The <Col N="1135" /> country generally is satisfied with the personnel of the council and with the new director.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go too deeply into my personal opinions as to how Radio Éireann should be conducted but so long as this House controls that service it is only right that Deputies should make suggestions and that those suggestions should be considered. Deputies are not perhaps the best people to advise on broadcasting programmes because they have not very much time for listening to such programmes.  One suggestion I have put forward repeatedly here has been accepted by the Minister.  I have always advocated more debates on controversial subjects over the air. There is no subject too contentious or too controversial for broadcasting provided it is a subject of some interest and some importance.  We ought to learn how to differ on important issues without becoming personally offensive. Frequently, there is a tendency here and elsewhere when a difference of opinion arises to ascribe all kinds of motives to our opponents.  That does not help us in advancing towards a better solution of our problems.  We should give others credit for good faith, for sincerity and for honesty.</P>
    <P>If we had more debates on contentious subjects over the air our young people would have an opportunity of finding that it is possible for people to differ on questions of importance without heat, without rancour and without malice.  Our people badly need that kind of education.  There is a tendency to ascribe all kinds of ulterior motives to those who differ from us. That tendency could be counteracted by frequent debates such as I have suggested amongst the younger men upon whom the future of this nation depends.  We should have debates on subjects such as socialism versus private enterprise, free trade versus protection, democracy versus dictatorship. All these subjects could be debated intelligently.  There is no limit to the variety of subjects upon which people hold firm views.  Let us have more debates over the air.  It is particularly <Col N="1136" /> desirable that we should have debates on agricultural policy and agricultural practice.  The merits and demerits of wheat growing could be debated.  The merits and demerits of barley growing could be debated. There is an infinite variety of subjects which concern the agricultural community. These are all subjects which ought to be debated frankly over the air.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have listened to some debates on Radio Éireann and they were quite good, but I think there were technical faults.  I am not an expert on the subject, but I think there were faults in these debates.  One fault I find is a tendency towards incoherence owing to two speakers joining in the debate together.  Where you have three speakers debating a subject and one man has made a good point I notice very frequently that you then have the other two trying to chip in.  That is very irritating for the listeners.  A clear, distinct diction is absolutely essential in broadcasting, and I think it is the duty of the chairman presiding over a debate of this kind to ensure that each speaker gets an opportunity of putting his points across and that only one speaker is allowed at a time.  The tendency of two or three to chip in together does make the programme very irritating to the listeners.</P>
    <P>Then there is no reason why we should not have political debates, why people listening over the radio should not hear Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour putting forward their particular points of view as strongly, as convincingly and ably as they are capable of doing.  That would be a good education for the people.  The people would have a chance of hearing the different points of view.  There are many people in the country who have a tendency, because their leanings are towards one side or another, to listen only to the side they support.  But if there is a good interesting debate, people will be tempted to listen to both sides.  That would have a good educational value, and would be good for the creation of a better public spirit in this country and better citizenship.  All that is needed is that the debates should be <Col N="1137" /> conducted with moderation and restraint, and technically put over as well as possible.  I suppose it requires a certain amount of experience and training to be an effective debater, but it should be always possible to find in each of the political Parties some person who is quite good on the air, and that is very desirable.</P>
    <P>During the past year the Minister introduced a programme of weekly comments on the proceedings of this House.  That is a step in the right direction.  I cannot say, however, that I entirely approve of the form which this commentary takes.  The commentary is broadcast, I take it, by an impartial person, whose main idea is rigidly to avoid showing any favour to one side as against the other.  That is all very well, but it does make for a certain amount of dullness, lack of interest, and coldness in the broadcast. Political discussion is entirely a clash of conflicting views, and I think that the commentary on the Dáil proceedings should be given by people who have partisan views.  If half-an-hour per week is given to this commentary on parliamentary work, a quarter of an hour could be given to one side and a quarter of an hour to the other.  In other words, you get a person who is favourable to one side to give a 15-minute broadcast on what he considers was the important business transacted during the week, and 15 minutes to a person on the other side, to give his views on the business transacted during the week.  That is more or less the system operating in Britain. It may not be exactly as I say, but they usually select from one side of the House a member who gives his commentary on the work in Parliament. On the whole, I think that is proper. You cannot have a live, interesting commentary upon Dáil business, which is by its very nature controversial, by a person who tries to take an absolutely cold and detached view of the whole political discussion.</P>
    <P>In addition, I do not think the person who gives that particular commentary does it unduly well.  There is a tendency towards superiority in his commentary.  It is impossible to please <Col N="1138" /> everybody in matters of this kind, but I have often felt that the commentator was reading his broadcast while standing on the bank of a river after having a cold plunge into the water. There is a tendency to rush through the proceedings and to be rather unduly cold and detached in his approach to the subject.  I think that you would have a much more warm type of commentary if it were given by Deputy Corry or Deputy Corish or Deputy MacEoin and that the listeners would appreciate it more.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I have frequently referred and to which the Minister should give some attention. I have frequently complained of the low standard of our Sunday night plays.  We have a dramatic feature every Sunday night.  These plays, or most of them, I suppose are well-known Irish plays written by Irish playwrights. For that reason, one would imagine that they would be generally acceptable.  I have found, however, that most people, particularly in the country areas, regard them with a certain amount of horror.  They consider that most of these plays are coarse, vulgar and brutal.  There is nothing amusing or inspiring in them. Of course the Minister may say that he cannot do anything about that, that he has to take the plays that are offered and which are the only ones available.  It is a pity that in this country over the last 50 years nobody has been found capable of writing a decent play with a really inspiring motive.  This is a Christian country and surely we have some sense of nationality.  Is there any nationality in the <i>King of Friday's Men, Juno and the Paycock</i>?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do Irish writers concentrate so much upon belittling their own people, degrading them as coarse, vulgar and brutal?  Surely there are some educated, refined people in the country.  Surely we are not all as rough as the characters that are presented to us on the radio, through the radio plays.  I think that <Col N="1139" /> a separate cult was established many years ago probably by the Abbey Theatre and that cult is being followed slavishly by playwrights down through the years.</P>
      <P>There are elevating and inspiring motives which could be the subject of drama but they are completely ignored by our playwrights.  Again I say the Minister or the director of broadcasting may argue that he has no control over this matter, that he must take whatever is available; he is just like a miller who must use the grist that is brought to his mill.  But a good miller can exercise some control or influence over the type of grist that comes to his mill.  For instance, a miller, in the ordinary sense as a manufacturer, can encourage the growing of better grain.  In the same way Radio Éireann can encourage or should encourage the production of better and more inspiring radio plays, more conducive to a better outlook on moral and national matters.</P>
      <P>We have in the history of our nation a most inspiring source.  No nation in the world has as much material of an elevating and inspiring type to call upon, but somehow or other our playwrights have ignored it.  They prefer to grovel in the gutter.  Surely the life of Padraig Pearse, Robert Emmet or, to go back further, Hugh O'Neill, or even the life of the present Taoiseach, would be an inspiring story, the struggle of men whose motive was the freedom of our nation.  The struggle of such men to overcome all the difficulties that opposed them and their triumph or their failure is always an inspiring story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to make a suggestion in this matter.  I think that Radio Éireann should offer a substantial prize to some playwright who would write now, on the 150th anniversary of the death of Robert Emmet, an inspiring story on his life and his death.  Surely that would be a beginning. From that we might eventually have a spate of dramatic stories based on the lives of great men of the past.  I am not suggesting we <Col N="1140" /> should deal with the present day but with the past, and even with the distant past.  The men who sacrificed everything for an ideal are the people about whom we should write, not the type of guttersnipe that Irish playwrights prefer to dissect on the stage and in radio plays.  Radio Éireann has a duty to the Irish people, a duty to educate and elevate as well as to entertain.  They are failing and have failed in that duty.  There is nothing inspiring in the programmes that are broadcast from Radio Éireann down through the years, nothing that would make a young boy or girl desire to be a better Christian and a better citizen.  That is wrong, and it is time that a step should be taken to end that position.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is an imperative duty on the shoulders of Radio Éireann to promote vigorously the gift of self-entertainment amongst our people, to encourage the production of music, singing and drama by our people scattered throughout the length and breadth of the nation.  There should be regular programmes directed towards encouraging young people to use their talent, the gifts that God has given them, whether it be in the field of music or any other form of self-expression.  There has been too much of a tendency by our people to rely on vicarious entertainment.  The cinema has sapped the morale of our people to a great extent, and it is time we should call out what is best in our people instead of trying to dope or drug them into a critical silence.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Donnellan when he denounces various forms of comedy.  I understood he was referring to attempts at comedy or humour.  I know this is a very delicate subject.  There is nothing as difficult as the task of trying deliberately to make people laugh.  Those who have tried it will tell you that it is the most difficult form of entertainment. In Britain, of course, they have variety programmes of a light type but even those are very far from perfect.  Even if occasionally&mdash;this is the point to which Deputy Donnellan referred&mdash; there is a joke at our expense, I do not think there is anything wrong in that so long as it is a joke.  What I <Col N="1141" /> object to in our radio plays is their cold brutality, their morbidness, and in many cases the fact that they are degrading and demoralising.  But when it comes to enjoyment, it is no harm now and then to laugh at ourselves. All the comedians of history have perhaps induced laughter at their own expense and I suppose, incidentally, at the expense of their own communities, their own people and their own nation.  If you were to censure this form of humour we would all become deadly serious.  There is nothing wrong with laughter provided it is spontaneous and right laughter.  I think that anything that tends towards lightness in the programmes of Radio Éireann should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>The Irish people are being fooled into accepting brutal and cruel forms of drama on the plea that there have been great tragedies in history.  Many of the most important events in history were tragic.  The events that took place at the birth of Christianity appeared to be tragic but were in reality a triumph.  The lives of men like Robert Emmet or Pádraig Pearse may have seemed like tragedies but were spiritual triumphs.  I am opposed to broadcasting the morbid type of tragedy which offers no hope either in this world or in the next, which offers no inspiration but is simply a representation of death, destruction and despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to encourage a new departure in this matter through Radio Éireann.  The United States have built up a vast literature based on the exploits of the pioneers in the Wild West and unexplored areas and on their struggles and sufferings.  In the same way we can build a huge literature on the struggles, sacrifices and <Col N="1142" /> adventures of generations of Irishmen in their efforts to uphold a great ideal. That would be far more inspiring than anything that we have got from the Abbey Theatre or Radio Éireann in the past 50 years.  It is time to put in their place Seán O'Casey and the whole lot and to tell them where they stand.</P>
    <P>A film was shown in Dublin recently called <i>The Quiet Man.</i>  There was a certain amount of humour in it but it was not very good.  It was based on a story by an Irish writer who also wrote an historical novel of great merit, <i>Blackcock's Feather.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to see such a novel produced as a radio play if it could be condensed.  Our aim should be to produce a type of drama that would be edifying, particularly to young people. The lack of that type of drama on Radio Éireann programmes is deeply deplored by everybody who has the interest of the nation at heart.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious attention to the problem which will arise from the development of television. It would be wrong to hurry unduly.  The matter should be very carefully considered, and policy in regard to it clearly defined during the next year or so.</P>
    <P>I understand that in countries where programmes are televised there is a tendency for viewers to devote too much time to them.  Young children may waste a lot of time in this way.  If television were introduced here, the programmes should be of excellent quality but of short duration.  It would be wrong to encourage young people to spend too much time viewing television programmes.</P>
    <P>There have been and there always will be complaints about news broadcasts. I think they are reasonably fair. In fairness to Deputies, the bulletins broadcast by Radio Éireann should be made available in the Library.  We often have complaints, and we will always have complaints from whatever Party is in opposition that there is undue favour shown to the Government side in these broadcasts.  I do not think there is much in that complaint. Sometimes attempts are made to <Col N="1143" /> exploit Radio Éireann in the interests of whatever Government happens to be in power.  I remember on one occasion hearing a letter of resignation of a particular postmaster being read over the radio in full, and the Minister's reply to that particular letter was also read in full, although there had been no comment, good, bad or indifferent or no news, good, bad or indifferent in regard to that particular matter prior to that or since that by Radio Éireann. That was just one example of what a Minister should not do.</P>
    <P>Last week a Deputy complained bitterly that the engagement and marriage of a particular Minister were mentioned over the radio.  I do not think there was any cause for complaint there.  Engagements and marriages always have considerable news value and I think it was rather a mistake that the marriage of Deputy Flanagan to Fine Gael was not broadcast over Radio Éireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I notice here is that fees will be paid to members of the council.  I think we should start at the bottom.  We are not paying our artistes a sufficient fee.  I am personally aware of at least one of the greatest traditional violinists in this country, who was invited to come down here from West Donegal and spend two nights here, for the lucrative fee of three guineas.  It would not pay his bus fare&mdash;never mind the other <Col N="1144" /> necessities for which he will have to disburse in the city here.  I would like to see higher fees paid to our artistes and some recognition should be given to the expenses incurred by them in coming here.  Furthermore, when they do come, some scope should be given to their imagination and the programme which they must broadcast should not be mapped out for them. I have already referred to a traditional violinist.  When he did come here on a former occasion he was very anxious to broadcast some very old Irish traditional airs which never have been broadcast before, but he was prevented by the officials from doing so.  They said: &ldquo;You must confine your programme to certain reels and jigs and other airs of that sort.&rdquo;  Some scope should be given to these artistes to display initiative in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has spoken at considerable length on various matters, but there is one aspect which I think he did not touch, that is, broadcasts to schools.  I would like to see more co-operation between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, whereby wireless sets would be installed in every school in the country and at least one half-hour per day would be given to school broadcasts, be they educational or otherwise.  I think it would be to the advantage of the children and that it would also be a method of keeping the children in touch with everyday affairs.  I would respectfully and seriously suggest to the Minister that he should consider that matter and have a school half-hour each day, if possible, as they have in other countries.</P>
    <P>Again, when the Dáil is in session, and when questions are asked of Ministers between 3 and 4 o'clock or 3 and 3.30, these questions would be of general interest to the citizens and it might be possible to arrange that that part of the proceedings be broadcast. After all, there is a résumé of it given each evening at 10.30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a big number of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but possibly a half-hour could be given to it.  That would be of some interest to the <Col N="1145" /> citizens.  It would be a method of letting the electorate know what we are doing here and that the affairs of State are receiving attention.  The Minister should know whether it is possible or not.  It might be a cheap method of entertainment; at least it would not cost the State a lot.</P>
      <P>I think it was my colleague from Donegal, Deputy Brennan, who advocated here the other day more rural entertainment on the wireless.  I thoroughly agree with him.  Local concerts and plays down the country are as much worthy of being broadcast to the State as the shows of various artistes here in the city.  I would like to see the Minister do as his predecessor did some years ago, when he broadcast Question Time from different parts of the country.  Local entertainments should be broadcast from various districts.  It would be good for the local artistes and would be an encouragement to them.  It may also be a method of spotting talent which otherwise would never be heard.</P>
      <P>I have referred on many occasions to the need for the broadcasting of fishing news.  Each evening after the ordinary news at 6.30 and again at 10.10, we hear the greyhound racing results from Harold's Cross or Shelbourne Park or somewhere else and the quotations on the Stock Exchange. These things interest certain people, but there are other people who have interests also.  One of the things I would like to hear broadcast each evening is the fish landings, the supply and the numbers of fish landed on our eastern, southern and western seaboard.  Not only is it of interest to the fishermen themselves but it tells a prospective market where there is a possible glut in fish, it gives the fish dealer an opportunity of going to the ports where fish have just been landed or are about to be landed; and again it may open up other markets for the fishermen.  It is something that should be considered. I asked questions about it during the last few years since I came in here. Whatever the obstacle is, I think it could be overcome.  I would appeal to the Minister to do something in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when this council has <Col N="1146" /> been set up, if the Oireachtas accepts the Estimate, the members will not be bound by red tape, that they will have some opportunity to display initiative, and that they will be able to consult the various interests in the country regarding the type of material which may be of advantage and of interest to rural Ireland as well as to the towns and cities generally.</P>

      <P>Fortunately, this debate on Radio Éireann is usually a very chatty sort of discussion and I like to think that every year the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, whoever he might be, does really listen to the speeches of Deputies and does take a note of what they say and that after considering the comments, he endeavours to sift the different criticisms, for the general advancement of Radio Éireann.  I think the present Minister has done that.  As I said last year and say again now, he has displayed a tremendous interest in Radio Éireann, for the good of Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Evidence of the progress of Radio Éireann is displayed in the discussion that we have had here this year.  All the signs are that the service is improving. There was a time, even in my short experience in the House, when there was very sharp criticism and considerable abuse regarding the way in which Radio Éireann was conducted. We have had, I think, in the majority of the speeches on this occasion, more actual praise than criticism.  That is in itself a tribute to the Minister, his officials and all those who participate in running the radio station.  Those who criticise&mdash;and we have a fair number of critics of Radio Éireann still in the country&mdash;fail to appreciate the limited resources that the Government or the Department have for running a station which, whether we like it or not, is to the ordinary man in the street in strict competition with the radio services of other countries and, in particular, with the radio stations in Great Britain.  These people fail to appreciate the fact that the B.B.C. has, one might say, unlimited resources compared with Radio Éireann.  They have a home service, a light programme and a third programme.  Radio Éireann <Col N="1147" /> is in the unfortunate position of having to compete not with any one of these but with all three.</P>
    <P>I should like to describe Radio Éireann as a station combining all the qualities of the home service, the light programme and the third programme. People who criticise Radio Éireann fail to appreciate the lack of facilities there.  I was in the radio station on two or three occasions and was amazed at the small space they had in which to operate with their limited facilities.</P>
    <P>Any remarks I make here to-night could not really be described as criticisms. They are more in the nature of suggestions which, I trust, the Minister will consider because they are suggestions I hear from time to time from the people with whom I mingle. Before I deal with these criticisms or suggestions, might I say a word or two about the establishment by the Mini- of a Broadcasting Council?</P>
    <P>I, like other Deputies, welcome the establishment of that council but there are some questions I would like to put to the Minister with regard to the actual functioning of the council and the personnel of the council.  I fail to see how the Minister's task is going to be easy when he says that this Broadcasting Council will act in the nature not only of an advisory body but an executive body as well and that the Minister will be legally responsible. I assume he will be legally responsible to the Dáil on questions which arise from time to time with regard to the general working of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Will that necessarily mean that his invariable reply to questions in this House in regard to Radio Éireann programmes will be that this was done by the council, that he was sorry he could not take any responsibility, that the members of this House approved of the setting up of this council and that, therefore, we must leave the arrangement of programmes and the selection of this, that and the other thing to these five men in whom he has placed his trust?  I think, to that extent, Deputy Cogan may be right when he says that we may be divesting ourselves of a responsibility and a function that we have had up to this.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the five <Col N="1148" /> persons whom the Minister has nominated to be members of this council are all good men in themselves but I cannot reconcile the entertainment which Radio Éireann is to give to the public of this country with such qualifications as were described by the Minister in his opening statement.  One member is an insurance manager.  That is how he is described.  That is the only qualification we get.  The next member of the council is a lecturer in economics.  Another is a principal teacher.  One is an archivist and has qualification in regard to the collection of folklore.  The next member is a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and professor of modern history.</P>
    <P>Frankly, they will not appeal to the people who look to Radio Éireann to provide entertainment and amusement for them.  There is a possibility that one of these members may have qualifications in music.  It may be that another has some qualifications in drama.  I know one of them, Pádraig Mac Con Midhe.  He certainly has a tremendous interest in and knowledge of the G.A.A. which gets quite a lot of time on Radio Éireann.  From that point of view he possibly will be tremendous help to the Minister and to the station generally but he is the only one, I should say, who would be known by a vast majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The names of the others suggest nothing to the people in the country. I am not making any personal criticism of them.  I do not know any of them intimately, but I would be pleased&mdash; and I am sure the House would be pleased&mdash;if the Minister would say what particular qualifications they had in the entertainment world.  He may say they are just the same as Deputy Cowan or any Deputy in this House. From that point of view they know what they like and, consequently, what the people in general like but if they are to have executive powers I suggest that they should have some particular qualification in the field of entertainment as far as radio is concerned.  An executive in any business usually has some particular qualification in respect of the business in which the company engages.  Therefore, I hope that as far as these five gentlemen are concerned they have a qualification in some <Col N="1149" /> degree or another with regard to entertainment, music, drama and the usual things we get on the radio.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a small tribute to the outgoing director of Radio Éireann.  As far as I and the listeners to Radio Éireann knew him as he was portrayed through the radio programmes during the time he was director he has everything that is typical of Irish life.  He was a native speaker and was everything characteristic of the nation and its people.  He tried to portray that over Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I trust that the director who is to take up duty on the 1st January has similar qualifications.  Again, I do not know the man.  The first I heard of him was when the Minister announced it yesterday.  I trust he has the qualifications Mr. Kelly had.  I do not want to be insulting if I say that I trust he has a knowledge of the Irish language.  In such an important post it would be a necessary qualification. It should be a necessary qualification inasmuch as the smallest job in the Civil Service or in local authorities demands that the man appointed should have some knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>While I have said that the Minister has taken a very keen and active interest in Radio Éireann, I would not give him full marks or credit for his general approach to Radio Éireann. He dwelt at length on the point that Radio Éireann should portray the character of the Irish people and the character of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I thought it unfortunate that he should devote so much time to the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  I appreciate his views so far as the symphony orchestra is concerned and so far as the type of music the orchestra plays is concerned.  What I did not like&mdash;again, I will say for him that I am sure he did not mean it in any insulting way, nor did he attempt to dismiss it merely with a flick, although it seemed from his speech that he did&mdash;was that two or three pages of his script were devoted to the symphony orchestra and he expressed the hope that the people would, in time, through the education of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, become lovers of that type <Col N="1150" /> of music, while, in about five words, he mentioned the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  To use his own words: &ldquo;The light orchestra also progresses.&rdquo; I thought that a very poor tribute to the conductor and members of that orchestra who have done so much for light music in this country and who have done so much for Radio Éireann in making it as popular as it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it was generally accepted that the type of music we heard from other stations in the world, these dance tunes, were a type of Anglo-Americanisation and more or less said that we would have to accept that type of music.  From that, he jumped to symphony and the symphony orchestra.  There is a happy medium.  If the people are to appreciate the music played by the symphony orchestra, they will only be educated into a love of that type of music by such an orchestra as the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  I happen to have heard it over the week-end and I have nothing but praise and admiration for it, as other people who heard it have nothing but praise and admiration for it and for the conductor and leader of that orchestra.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it was appreciated that these were all 100 per cent.  Irishmen and that some of them were men of humble origin who had graduated from the ranks of the Army, who had been enlisted in the Army School of Music and had made their way to this light orchestra and that to them tremendous praise and credit is due. But let us get more of the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra and then possibly we will attain to that standard to which the Minister hopes we will attain when there will be a greater and more general appreciation of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  At the present time, there is not that appreciation of it.  I do not believe that I could listen to the symphony orchestra for any more than half an hour.  I would certainly go up the walls or close my ears to it after that.</P>
    <P>I know that it is good music, but I cannot appreciate it yet, and I would go so far as to say that 80 per cent. of our people cannot appreciate that type of music yet.  We know that it is good <Col N="1151" /> music, but the only way the people can get an appreciation of it is by being gradually trained or educated into a love of that type of music.  The Minister should do a little more with regard to getting these two orchestras around the country.  I know he has done it and that it is being done at present.  So long as he keeps that up and so longs as he sends the light orchestra, in particular, around the country, so long will the people have a greater appreciation of him and of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I cannot boast of knowing a lot about music and I cannot boast of being able to play any instrument, but like ordinary Deputies here I know what I like.  I think I would be speaking for a lot of people in my home town and in my constituency if I reiterated what I said by inference in a parliamentary question yesterday, that the standard of music presented in the commercial programmes from Radio Éireann is at about the lowest possible level&mdash;with <i>Sugar Bush</i> and <i>Liberty Bell</i> and all these low dance tunes that convey nothing except rhythm, with the rhyming of &ldquo;blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;flew&rdquo; and &ldquo;do&rdquo; and all that sort of thing. I do not know if there is a big number of people who like that type of music. I heard the Minister last Saturday night speaking about the low standard of music and I think he quoted what I thought was a very bad example&mdash; the Hospitals Requests Programme.  It is, so far as music is concerned, far above the programmes presented on the other days of the week.  The Minister gave that example to suggest that that is the type of music the people wanted, but the type of music that is requested and played on the Hospitals Requests Programme is of a fairly decent standard.  It is mixed &mdash;you will get <i>Liberty Bell</i> and <i>Sugar Bush</i> or <i>Sugar Puss</i>, or whatever the name is.  You will get these dance tunes, but you will also get ballet music and military airs and generally you will get a good mixture, but you will not get what you get on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays&mdash; these tin cans rattling all the time, no music but merely rhythm.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to enforce a somewhat stricter type of censorship because it is not the general type of music the people want.  As an example, I give the Hospitals' Trust Programme, an admirable programme.  If the other commercial programmes were on the same lines as the programmes we get from 10.30 p.m. to 11 p.m., I think the standard of the lunch time programmes from Radio Éireann would be very much higher indeed.</P>
      <P>I should like to see local musical productions recorded.  It has been done in my own town.  I referred to this matter on other occasions, and the Minister explained the difficulties, but in Wexford last week, on each occasion on which an opera was played, a recording was made by Radio Éireann in an effort to get the best recording for purposes of re-broadcasting at some future date.  I suggest that even in respect of this city, and the different musical societies here, there are many productions worthy of recording and re-broadcasting to the rest of the country.  I have no particular society in mind, but I can mention the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, the Dublin Operatic Society, and the Old Belvedere Society.  There are many other societies in production from time to time in Dublin, and in places like Roscrea, Galway and Cork.  These are admirable productions which the people of the country should hear. Owing to difficulties of travel to Dublin and the limited resources of the artistes, it is rather difficult to bring all these folk to Dublin, and many real Irish artistes never have an opportunity of being heard from Radio Éireann in this country, in Britain, or in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In co-operation with the Minister for Defence, the Minister ought to try to see that the No. 1 Army Band performs regularly from Radio Éireann. I do not know much about military <Col N="1153" /> bands in other countries.  I can listen only to the Foden Works Band, the Black Dyke Mills Band and the other different bands we hear from the B.B.C., but we will all agree that the No. 1 Army Band and the Garda Band compare very favourably with any of these.  The No. 1 Army Band is, I am sure, at the disposal of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the people, outside Dublin especially, would like it much more often.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, I think, spoke about country artistes.  I think it is generally recognised now that, unless one has made a reputation on the Dublin stage, it is practically impossible to get into Radio Éireann to perform.  I appreciate what the Minister said about a person who was good in a parish hall or who could recite well or mimic well in a drawingroom not being able to do so well in Radio Éireann, but there are many people who can act, sing and recite well who will never get an opportunity of performing in Radio Éireann because they cannot afford, first of all, to come up to Dublin to receive an audition and, in the second place, if they are accepted after the audition, to come to perform because the expense is too heavy.  They must travel from Cork, Wexford, Kerry, Galway or Donegal to Dublin, pay their rail or bus fare, pay for a night in an hotel and for the return journey &mdash;that merely for an audition, and if they are accepted and given an engagement they must do the same thing again for a few guineas.  It just does not pay them, and for that reason the artiste outside Dublin does not get a reasonable chance of displaying his or her talents on Radio Éireann.  I would suggest that auditions should be held in provincial towns.  I think it has been done.</P>

      <P>It may be a reasonable excuse that the resources of the Department are such that it <Col N="1154" /> would not be possible to have auditions as frequently as would be desired, but I would urge the Minister to see that Radio Éireann officials attend to other cities and towns in order to get the best the talent of the country outside Dublin can offer.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention the bad timing of programmes.  A programme which is scheduled to end at a quarter past eight stops at 12 minutes past eight.  There is a lull.  Nobody knows whether the wireless has broken down or whether Radio Éireann has broken down.  There should be a better effort by technicians and artistes to see that there is regular timing, and if there is not regular timing, to see that we have some sort of sound, some noise, whether it be a piano, drums, marching feet or bells, but no lull even for 15 seconds.</P>
      <P>I have another complaint.  I noticed last week that there is one particular announcer who has the habit of swishing the papers and it is heard distinctly over the radio.  That is not heard from the B.B.C.  I do not hold up the B.B.C. as the perfect example but it is not heard in other circles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not much interested in the B.B.C., but I want Radio Éireann to have the best possible.  If this point were attended to it would give people a better impression of Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too much time is lost on the Hospitals Requests Programme.  Twenty per cent. more records could be played. Much too much time is lost in reading out, not names&mdash;nobody objects to names as they are necessary&mdash;but these little messages from &ldquo;You Know Who&rdquo;, that fellow who gets all the records on the programme.  Too much time is lost on chatter in between records.  There should be an endeavour to cut out the messages.  If there is a request from Deputy Cowan for Deputy MacCarthy, that is the message. He does not need to send love and kisses, as that takes up too much time. The Minister should consider giving more time to the Hospitals Requests Programme.  There are many unfortunate <Col N="1155" /> people in sanatoria and other hospitals who have been waiting weeks and months, and have given up the attempt to have a record played for them.  The B.B.C. devotes four or five hours per week to &ldquo;Family Favourites&rdquo;.  I would urge the Minister to devote much more time to this programme than from 2 to 2.30 on one day per week.  If he could give even twice that time to the unfortunate people who are in hospital for a long period, it would indeed be a great consolation and boon to them.</P>
    <P>I have advocated this since 1946, and no Minister has yet listened.  Again I make the plea in the hope that the Minister might on this occasion.  I would ask him to change the time of the lunch time programmes, and have them from 12.30 till 2 p.m.  I do not know how it is in Dublin or what time the majority of workers go home to lunch, but down the country they start at 12.30, and in rural areas I think they start at 12.  If they start at 12 they have to be back at 1 o'clock when Radio Éireann is just starting.</P>
    <P>In my town they come from work at 12.30 and start back about 1.10.  They get 10 minutes of the programme.  I wonder for what class of people the programme from 2 to 2.30 is designed. For the housewife I suppose, but she is probably out in the kitchen then washing up after the dinner.  The businessman starts to go back about 2 o'clock.  I do not know what time civil servants start.  I do not see the reason for the programme between 2 and 2.30 as people are working then or on their way back to work and I would suggest that the Minister should seriously consider changing that time.</P>
    <P>As far as local complaints are concerned, reception in Wexford is atrocious.  I do not know whether it is peculiar to Wexford or not but it is well-nigh impossible during parts of the later evening to hear Radio Éireann at all.  What with distortion and interference from other stations people give up and turn to some other station.  I would like the Minister to investigate that complaint in respect of Wexford because it has been very widespread during the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>Lastly I would like to suggest that <Col N="1156" /> the Minister should get a better recording of the National Anthem&mdash; even though there has been an improvement. Somebody recently suggested that the Hallé Orchestra should make a recording of the National Anthem for Radio Éireann.</P>

I have heard their rendering of the National Anthem and to hear it was inspiring.  It did what a National Anthem should do to the people of a country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the world to-day the radio is recognised to be of such tremendous value and influence that I think this House should give very great consideration to anything that might be done towards the improvement of our presentations on the radio.</P>
      <P>In the first place, facing, as we are now, a new system of control which will be followed, I am sure, by reorganisation, I appeal that many of its best features in the past will be retained.  There is so much diversity of opinion amongst those who have spoken in this debate that it is quite obvious that the sooner we have alternative programmes the better.  In Cork we are building a new school of music in which Radio Éireann is being incorporated, with general advantage so far as the South is concerned at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing which I think we ought to consider, without being exclusively or too strictly obviously so, is that our radio should be national and recognisable as such when anybody tunes in to the station to listen to its music or its general features.  It should not be merely a case of waiting for the tinkling dulcet notes of <i>O'Donnell Abú</i> to know that we are tuned into Radio <Col N="1157" /> Éireann.  It is most important that in its national features we should have the language in its various aspects, our national pastimes, our traditional and dance music, historical features and past and present-day dramatic presentations.  We could also have informative features such as notes on our principal industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash; gardening, household hints and all the rest which would form a particular feature and be fitted in at a particular time.  Beyond that, we may have from time to time commemorative productions.  We could have gramophone records of some of our best singers as, for instance, the late John McCormack, Miss Margaret Burke Sheridan and others.  We could have musical presentations by our pianists and our best musicians.  As well as all that, however, something else is required.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled in respect of the employment of too many foreign musicians on our symphony orchestra.  I have seen some figures in that regard and my view is that we had to start somewhere.  Unless symphonic music is perfectly rendered it becomes absolutely absurd and nobody will listen to it.  We must either have perfect symphonic music or else we must cut it out altogether.  A start had to be made.  I understand that leaders of particular sections of the orchestra had, from the start, to be brought in, at least temporarily.  I think the result has been very good indeed.  Some people say that there is not a full appreciation of symphonic music in this country but everything goes to prove the contrary.  When the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra travelled to various cities throughout the country, though the halls did not fill the first time they were filled on the second and subsequent visits and there could not be a higher measure of appreciation and feeling of national pride in the Radio Éireann orchestra's playing of symphonic music.</P>
    <P>The light orchestra is very good. Nobody can but praise it.  Of course, it has a second advantage, namely, that it would be an excellent training ground for musicians who would subsequently be promoted to the main orchestra.  From that point of view <Col N="1158" /> it would be excellent.  In order to provide our own native musicians who, we all desire, should predominate in all these orchestras and presentations from Radio Éireann, co-operation with our schools of music, our various national festivals throughout the country, the Oireachtas, feiseanna, and so forth, might from time to time provide the talent that we require.  We all know that we are as impulsive in that way as we are in other ways and that our people are very often anxious to get on the stage or on the air before their training is perfect, but I think beginners should be encouraged.  The development of local talent and the presentation of what is being done in various parts of the country should be looked into and organised.  As a nation, we are not all serious at all times: a little bit of fun is diverting and entertaining and people look for it.  Once it is of the right standard I think that it will be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>The schools programme is a matter that should be looked into.  Though what is being done is excellent, a little more in that regard would, perhaps, be of considerable national advantage. The provision of radios in the schools is a very vexed question.  Some people might like it very much but there is always the danger in a school that for half an hour before the programme the children are watching for it and that for half an hour after it they are thinking of it with the result that they may learn very little else unless, of course, the programme is put on at the end of the day when the children are tired or are getting tired.  It is all very fine to say these things but when you come down to the practical results of these matters they are really not so good as perhaps people would think, looking at them in an objective or abstract way. We ought to think of it very seriously. The radio is principally for the provision of information and entertainment in the home.  Children at home can, in their own times, participate in whatever information or enjoyment is given by these programmes and learn from them in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I am not at all enamoured of sponsored programmes.  You might as well <Col N="1159" /> be listening in to the Bahama Islands as to some of the records they play at these programmes.  If people want to advertise Irish goods to the Irish people they should not try to do so through the medium of foreign music. If their broadcast is for somewhere else then that is another matter.  In all these things I think there should be a proper balance.  Whilst I do not, as I said at the start, look for any kind of exclusiveness, I think our own national characteristics should be featured predominantly in those various programmes.  Deputy Corish praised the Hospitals' Trust presentations. I have no hesitation in admitting that I would not listen to that programme in 99 cases out of 100. The programme has no national feature whatsoever except once in the blue moon.  Generally speaking, there is a kind of ragtime swing about the whole presentation that does not appeal to me or to anybody who looks for something more national in character.</P>
    <P>We have, as I said, productions of various kinds embracing various features of entertainment and instruction. In that respect, I think, generally speaking, there is no great reason for complaint.  Perhaps more could be said and more information given in regard to agriculture and matters of that kind which would appeal to the people of the country. Talks might also be given on industrial development and what is expected from the people in the encouragement and promotion of such movements. Generally speaking, I think all that is required is to get competent people to speak and to vary the programmes, not to have the same people broadcasting all the time.  There are other people with ideas, and while some features of a permanent nature are useful, the programmes should be more varied and different people should be asked to contribute.  In general, I think some progress has been made in recent years. Certainly there has been progress from the musical point of view.  I would say that, in the sphere of drama, the same progress has not been made.  I know that it is difficult to provide for <Col N="1160" /> these matters.  Of course we can all talk, but when the directors are faced with the task of getting the right material, it is not so easy to do so.  The trial system is sometimes quite useful, but at other times it involves considerable delay.  Generally speaking, I think we can compliment the Minister on what he is doing.  I know only one member of the new comhairle.  He is a very competent man, a man who has been connected with the language movement, who has been interested in the history and national pastimes of our country, and I am sure he will be of considerable advantage as a member of the new body.  He comes from Ulster also, a fact which makes his selection all the more commendable, inasmuch as it symbolises the unity of the country, in its distinctive features and traditions.</P>
    <P>The question of traditional music is a very vexed one, of course.  We have not very many compositions which would call for more than individual production, and it is not easy to get musicians up here to Dublin.  The question of expense is involved, but some effort should be made, at the same time, to encourage those people who have preserved and kept alive the traditions typical of our land.</P>
    <P>I think nothing more of a useful nature can be said on this debate which has gone on now for a considerable time.  We have only to hope that the new body will reorganise the programmes, retaining, as I suggested, the best features of the existing programmes and that with goodwill all round suitable encouragement will be provided from the radio for our own people in the development of their national characteristics.  I hope that the short-wave station will be established to cater for the scattered members of our race who have been looking forward to it for years.  Those who have gone into the mission fields and entered on various walks of life throughout the world are looking forward to the day when they can hear from their own land something to revive the memories which inspired them in the past and which will keep them, in their various spheres of activity, in contact with their people in the homeland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of Radio Éireann is to give to the people of Ireland the programmes they require.  I feel that the directors of Radio Éireann have succeeded to a certain extent in fulfilling that function, but, as other Deputies have mentioned, they have a rather difficult problem in that there is only one station available, and it often happens, when there are limited facilities, and when you are trying to please everybody, you succeed in pleasing nobody. I do not think we can accuse Radio Éireann of that.  However, there are one or two criticisms that I should like to offer&mdash;firstly, in regard to the employment of foreign artistes.</P>
      <P>I think we are all agreed that it is highly undesirable that we should employ all these foreign artistes, so many of them particularly in the light orchestra.  When musical broadcasts were first organised in this country, under the late Colonel Fritz Brase, a German, he did not import a whole lot of foreign musicians.  He recognised the fact that there was a fund of musical talent latent in the Irish people and he set out to develop that talent. When his time came he handed over to other people, but I think it is a pity that his policy was not continued, that this talent was not sought out and developed on a more extensive scale. That appears to me to be the difficulty with the orchestras in this country&mdash; that the talent that is there has not been sought out by the officials, the directors or whoever is in control of Radio Éireann and utilised so as to give employment to the fullest extent to Irish musicians and artistes.  I would ask the Minister to give full attention to that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that we should not have any foreign artistes.  Surely we can form an Irish orchestra wholly consisting of an Irish personnel.  If we want to bring in foreigners I admit there are certain countries&mdash;Germany and perhaps Italy&mdash;which occupy a prominent place in the world of Europe.  We should employ these people only as instructors and trainers but do not let them occupy the jobs that should be occupied by Irishmen.  We waited long enough to get on the air and to get our <Col N="1162" /> own control of the air, and let us use it for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word or two in regard to sponsored programmes.  I say that with one or two exceptions, the sponsored programmes are an outrage on the Irish people.  Why must we have this sort of muck, this jazz and this crooning, with no music, no rhythm and no tune?  When I was out in Africa years ago I went into a native village and I heard negroes dancing and singing.  That is exactly the stuff you hear to-day in these programmes that is presented as modern up-to-date music and that is put across to us in those sponsored programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If you think I am running down the negroes have it your own way or whatever way you like.  To get back to the sponsored programmes, why should we not have live artistes on the sponsored programmes?  There are plenty of people in the country who would be glad to earn a few pounds, if given an opportunity of contributing to these programmes.  I asked the Minister a parliamentary question in regard to that matter some time ago.  I think his reply was to the effect that it was a question of the difficulty of the people running the programmes paying for them: that it would cost them more to have live artistes.  That may be, but one of the sponsored programmes, the <Col N="1163" /> Mitchelstown Creamery, can get live artistes.  Why cannot these wealthy corporations which come on the air for a quarter or half an hour do the same?  That point has been put to me by some of my constituents, who are keen on music and are performers themselves.  They think they should be given a chance at these shows, and I agree with them.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word on Partition. It is the object of everybody in this House and in the country who is really Irish to get rid of Partition.  It is a running sore in our side.  It seems to me that one way of getting rid of it would be to make its existence known to the world.  One of the most powerful weapons we can use for that purpose is the radio.  It should be used more than it is to stress the economic advantages which would accrue not only to Ireland but to every peace-loving nation in the world if Partition were abolished.</P>
      <P>I may be wrong, but as well as I recollect, I think I have heard only one or two talks on the subject over the radio.  As far as I know, these talks were given by the then head of the Irish Government whoever he was. There is the old saying that if you tell people a thing often enough they will absorb it and believe it.  That applies particularly if you are telling them the truth.</P>
      <P>I think that, day in and day out, we should stress this injustice to the Irish race over the radio.  We have there, the opportunity of stressing it not to one or two people, but to hearers wherever the radio penetrates.  I put that suggestion to the Minister.  I think that many different types of people should be asked to give a talk, from different angles, on Partition.  I would suggest that these talks should not be too controversial.  They should follow, I think, the line of the economic and spiritual benefits that would accrue to everyone if this injustice were removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a countryman, I should like to stress the need for more provincial news.  The people living in the country are simple folk, and after all, there are a good many of us.  This country is not just Dublin alone.  There are many <Col N="1164" /> things we are interested in, such as fairs and markets, conditions in the different towns and districts and so on. I know, of course, there are provincial news talks.  I listened to one the other evening, and it was not bad at all, but my point is that I do not think we have enough of them.  When you switch on the B.B.C., you have at the end of the news, a North of England talk or a Scottish talk, a Welsh talk, a London talk or a North of Ireland talk. We should have the same on Radio Éireann.  We have four provinces in Ireland, and we could have a talk on each on different nights.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that we should have more agricultural news on Radio Éireann.  We are all depending on agriculture.  We are getting interested in agriculture nowadays, and the majority of us live by it.  I think the Minister should pay attention to that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point that was stressed by Deputy Corish about the lunch time intervals.  The normal time for the agricultural worker to go to dinner is 12 o'clock and to return at 1 o'clock.  I do not think a start is made in Radio Éireann until 12.30 or, in some cases, 1 o'clock.  I would ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the suggestion that the lunch time intervals should be from 12 o'clock to 2.30.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the new arrangements.  My own personal view is that they are good arrangements. I think it is a good idea that the Minister is retaining jurisdiction over the company or board which he is forming.  A number of us Deputies suffer a good deal in this House when we try to get Córas Iompair Éireann to do something or to find out something about it.  I do not think we want the same state of affairs to apply to Radio Éireann.  Normally, we get an opportunity only once a year of having a debate like this, so that it will be nice to feel that we can still make suggestions, by way of questions, and will be able to get an answer to them, and not be told by the Minister that he has no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, in conclusion, that I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has put a lot of work into this.  I think he has done his best.  He <Col N="1165" /> has looked at the thing from a sensible point of view.  I think he is an efficient Minister, and I may even go so far as to say that I think he is a courteous Minister.  I have always found him so. I wish him luck with his new arrangements. I also want to congratulate him on the way in which, for the first time since I entered Dail Éireann, he has formed his board.  I think I am right in saying that it is a non-political board and is representative of every political walk of life in the country.  I hope other Ministers will take that as a precedent.  I hope, when any more boards are being appointed, that the precedent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be followed, and that they will not be, as they were heretofore, 100 per cent. Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering which member of the board is going to look after the agricultural side, so far as Radio Éireann is concerned.  As Deputy Esmonde has rightly said, this is an agricultural country.  One would think Radio Éireann was run for a section of the people and not for all the people.  I do not know where Radio Éireann gets its weather prophet.  We call him &ldquo;Old Moore&rdquo; down the country.  There is an artiste who comes out every night during the Hospitals' Trust Programme and the country people call him &ldquo;Mick the Liar.&rdquo;  For a long period this year there was fairly keen competition between &ldquo;Mick the Liar&rdquo; in the Hospitals' Trust and &ldquo;Jack the Liar&rdquo; who was employed to give weather forecasts for the farmers. Neither of them was ever right.</P>
      <P>At least one half-hour every night should be devoted to lectures on agricultural subjects.  I would ask for an hour but that might be asking for too much for 90 per cent. of our people.  If we have to pay the piper we should get some return.  We do not want all the so-called entertainment.  The Minister should get some of our agricultural experts from the Department and from the sugar company to give lectures or talks for half an hour each night on agricultural subjects from 8 o'clock to half-past eight.</P>

      <P>They would listen to them far quicker than they listen to the present programmes.  I hear people describe Radio Éireann as a secondrate edition of an English music hall. There is another programme we should have on the radio.  The door seems to be closed and locked against a certain period of our history.  It is all very hush-hush.  We no longer hear the patriotic songs that used to be sung long ago.  We hear very few of them over the radio.  The Minister should look up the statistics and compare the time devoted to these with the time devoted to other things.</P>
      <P>Sometimes I find myself in the unfortunate position of acting as a member of an interview board interviewing applicants for certain positions. The applicants come along, and one asks them a question about recent Irish history and about the individuals who played a prominent part in that history.  One feels rather strange when one asks a young lady from West Cork: &ldquo;Who was Michael Collins?&rdquo; and she pauses for ten minutes and replies: &ldquo;He was a poet, sir.&rdquo;  I got that answer from a young lady who was born only 12 miles from the place where Michael Collins was born.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently it is shut out of the school books.  I suggest that a short talk on each Minister in the first Dáil would be no harm and would <Col N="1167" /> provide some education in the national life and the national figures for the youth of this country.  I suggest that talks should be given on notable military leaders, notable events and notable operations during that period. I would like to hear a talk on General Tom Barry.  It would be no harm if half an hour were devoted to the Crossbarry ambush.  We could have half an hour on Ballinalee General MacEoin.  We could have half an hour devoted to the exploits of General Seán Moylan.  That would supply the present deficiency in the primary schools.</P>
      <P>We have to pay the piper and we want something Irish in our radio programmes. We want something of educational benefit to our young people, something to remind them of the sacrifices that were made by the men who have gone before them&mdash;the men who got our freedom for us.  It would be better to devote half an hour to that rather than to the negro music about which Deputy Dr. Esmonde spoke.  It is disheartening to experience the ignorance displayed by young people of events that took place here 30 and 35 years ago.  Part of the Radio Éireann programme should be devoted to enlightening that ignorance.</P>
      <P>Our exiles would prefer a programme of the type I have suggested.  Such programmes would be superior to the sponsored programmes about which Deputy Dr. Esmonde spoke.  They would have a more beneficial result because they would remind our exiles that Ireland was still there and that they were not merely listening to a rehash of the B.B.C.</P>

On behalf of the agricultural community I must insist on at least half an hour each night being devoted to agricultural matters.  We are entitled to that.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why we would not get it.  You have very interesting lectures given from time to time in this country which would be of benefit to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I also suggest that we should go a little further with regard to dealing with our later history.  Even if we were divided from 1922 onwards, I do not think there is any section of our people to-day who would not like to hear of the sacrifices which were made by the men who did their part for this country during that period. It would help immensely towards getting a better feeling generally in the country, or at least getting what in my opinion the young people require more than anything else, a bit of nationality into them.</P>

We have to put up with the things that we hear over the radio at times and to be satisfied with them.

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on his attempt to improve the standard of the Radio Éireann programmes, an attempt which will be welcomed by every listener in the country.  I was particularly interested in the speech of Deputy Corish who expressed my opinions far better than I could.  I regret, however, that the Minister did not think of including a woman on the advisory body.  I did not hear any of the Deputies refer to that.  After all, there are many women in rural Ireland whose only source of entertainment is the radio, especially those who are living along the western coast and in the lonely parts of the country.  If the Minister could even now appoint a woman on that advisory body, she would be able to plan suitable programmes for these women.  I am not particularly interested in the women in the cities and the towns as they have other sources of entertainment. But a woman who understands women's life in the country, particularly a housewife, could plan very interesting talks, instruction in home crafts which are long dead to these women and other matters which would be an inspiration to them, especially the younger ones.  Good musical items of course could be interspersed through them.  I do not want a programme like Mrs. Dale's Diary or anything like that, but something which would be truly national and a reflection of the days that are gone.  If at all possible, I would be deeply grateful to the Minister if he could see his way even at this late hour to include such a woman on the advisory body.  I am sure there are plenty of women who could fill that post very well.  It would be a sad reflection on the country if we had not an educated woman who would carry out these duties just as efficiently as any other member of the <Col N="1170" /> board.  I hope the Minister will consider my suggestion.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to say anything further because everything I would have said has already been said.  If there has been criticism, I am sure the Minister will take it in the spirit in which it was offered.  We all want to have a truly national radio station.  If anybody does not like the programmes broadcast, they have other stations to which they can turn.  Our people have suffered over a long period and now that we have a radio station of our own it should express our own sentiments and the sentiments of those who suffered and died to bring freedom to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been tempted after listening to the debate this evening to make a few observations in regard to the matter before the House.  First of all, I think the Minister in his experiment, because that is what it is, of setting up this new board has made a really genuine effort to get a board that will do successful work in regard to Radio Éireann.  I looked over the names of the members he has appointed and I endeavoured to see the reasons behind the appointments and I came to the conclusion in a general way that he had done a very good job in selecting this particular board.  I do not think that any board composed of ordinary human beings could provide a radio service such as Deputies who have spoken in this debate would appear to require.  I know that if they did provide what has been advocated by some Deputies the number of listeners to Radio Éireann would considerably decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio Éireann is not just entirely a medium for amusement, nor is it entirely a medium for education.  It has other duties.  It must provide up-to-date news in such a way that listeners will turn to Radio Éireann to get the latest news served up in the best possible way.  I think it would be a mistake if the board should consider that Dáil Éireann insisted that they should provide nothing except the highest class of music and provide nothing except what we in a particular phase of our existence considered to <Col N="1171" /> be national.  This nation has lived for many centuries and the songs and the dances we have had in the last 30 or 40 years are not the songs or the dances we had 400 years ago or 1,400 years ago.  The generation that has grown up as we have and that is beginning to grow old is inclined to think that the songs we had in our youth are the only national songs and nothing else should be given.  This nation is growing up like everything else, and when I interrupted Deputy Dr. Esmonde in his reference to negroes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, Deputy Murphy. I am satisfied from what I see of the young people of to-day that they are as good and perhaps a lot better than some of the generations that have gone before.  If they want to enjoy the music which is enjoyed by civilised nations all over the world, we cannot stop them.  No amount of talk here will stop them.  If we do not provide that for them on Radio Éireann they will switch over and listen-in to some other station.  We cannot censor the people's lives in that way.  They made some effort to do it in the dictator countries, I understand, but it was not successful.  It cannot be done.</P>
      <P>There is one very peculiar thing about a sponsored programme.  I understand the people sponsoring the programme buy time from Radio Éireann and they buy a certain amount of time for the purpose of increasing sales of their particular commodities.  The only way they increase sales is by having a large audience and the way to get the largest audience is to put on what the largest audience requires.  It is not lectures they want at that hour, nor is it some of our old songs however much we may like them, nor is it some of our drama.  They want the modern stuff.  By the radio itself and by the rapid improvement in communications, the world is being brought much closer together and what the youngsters in Chicago enjoy to-day the youngsters in Germany, Italy or Ireland will enjoy to-morrow.  We must realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reference to our <Col N="1173" /> political broadcasts.  I agree with speakers who have suggested that the political broadcasts ought to be live broadcasts and that Deputies of this House representing different points of view ought to have an opportunity of expressing those points of view over Radio Éireann from time to time.  Now the Minister, since he became Minister, has made an effort to provide a political commentary on a Saturday evening. I must say it has been exceptionally well done, but what I found about it was that it was too well done, that the commentator, in an effort to be fair to all sides of the House, put up an argument for a particular side that was much better than the side itself had put forward in the House.</P>

      <P>I do not put it that way but if Deputies had to come on the radio and give a 15-minute talk, at least they would prepare their brief or get someone to prepare it for them. They would make a genuine effort to put their case across as best they could.  The people of the country are intelligent though some people think from time to time they are not.  They would be able to see those putting forward the best case.  They would be <Col N="1174" /> able to appreciate the value and importance of particular Deputies in this House who were chosen by their own Party to speak.  Britain does that.  It is a very welcome feature of the British radio that I should like to see introduced here.</P>
      <P>More time should be devoted to broadcasting.  There should be more programmes.  I would suggest that the morning programme, which was very sensibly started during the newspaper strike, should be extended until 10 a.m.  There would be a general desire for that.</P>

In some parts of the country the people go to bed early but in other parts of the country and in the cities and towns people like to remain up until midnight. I would suggest a half hour of music or some other programme between 11.30 and 12, finishing with a news summary which would give events which may have happened since the previous news bulletin.  People would like to have the latest news before going to bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was tempted to intervene in this debate only because of some of the statements that were made.  I agree in a general way that our radio station must be a national instrument, an instrument for the purpose of promulgating and propagating national culture. That can be done while at the same time giving to the general public up-to-date music, as hot as possible, informative discussions, lectures on matters of importance.  It is unfortunate, as Deputy Corry said, that a phase in our history of 30 years or so ago is apparently taboo in our school books, broadcasts and newspapers generally.  There may be some reason for that, some underlying motive that prevents us having an up-to-date history.  It is unfair to blame young people if they do not know the names of the heroes of 30 or 40 years ago, <Col N="1175" /> whose exploits were very familiar to us.  We should not be surprised. because we are the people who are responsible for that ignorance.  We have thrown a cloak as it were over the period from 1916 on.  I do not know why that is done.  That is a most interesting period of Irish history.</P>
    <P>The records of the events of that time should be handed down to the present and future generations.  As has been said to-night, the generation that grew to manhood 30 years ago fought against many obstacles.  It is only right that those obstacles should be made known so that there would be a greater appreciation of the heroes of that particular period.  As a result of this debate, perhaps the council and the Minister will arrange to have that particular period brought to life through the means of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that the Dáil may divest itself of some responsibility. I do not see that we are divesting ourselves of responsibility at the moment.  We are merely dealing with an Estimate.  The Minister has told us the new machinery that he is setting up.  As a Dáil, we are not divesting ourselves of any power.  We will still be entitled to inquire if we want to do so, but obviously we ought to give this new council a reasonable chance and having done that, if they are a failure, this House by means of question or otherwise can deal with the situation that will arise.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I compliment the Minister on the progress he has made.  I join with other Deputies in wishing every success to his new experiment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to say that I very deeply appreciate the observations made by Deputies from all sides of the House of a most friendly character in connection with the new plans for Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has hardly been any measure so unanimously accepted by Deputies of all Parties as the plans I have announced on this Supplementary Estimate.  I would like to thank Deputies of all sides for the fine spirit in which the debate has been carried on.  I am well aware that a good <Col N="1176" /> number of Deputies must have been humanly tempted to make criticisms of a kind which might have discouraged the new board and it is obvious that practically every Deputy who spoke here spoke in a manner which made it clear that he wanted the new comhairle to start with a fair chance of success.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that Deputies made it clear that, whatever their criticisms, they felt that Radio Éireann was improving and that it had improved steadily, particularly in the last year. I would not like to take credit for the improvement that has been effected, save to this extent, that I do think that the staff we have in Radio Éireann felt that there was bound to be some change.  It might have been quite easily carried out by some other Minister than myself, but they felt that the change was inevitable and they gave of their best because they were aware that there was bound to be a greater measure of freedom and a greater measure of opportunity for quick innovation, which would be one of the results of the reorganisation.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great many Deputies speak about various facets of the Radio Éireann programme and the expression &ldquo;vexed question&rdquo; has been used very frequently.  The question of this or that aspect of the programme is &ldquo;a vexed question&rdquo;&mdash; that is absolutely true.  To provide a programme to satisfy everybody is absolutely impossible and with a single programme those who are responsible have been doing their utmost but quite obviously it is impossible for them to succeed entirely.</P>
    <P>When I spoke yesterday I made probably too long a speech and, as a result, there were certain things that I said that did not happen to be noticed by the public at large, and I feel that I must repeat one particular thing which was omitted from comment and pay once again a tribute to Mr. Charles Kelly, the director, who has been promoted to the position of Director of Public Savings.  I would once again like to say that I appreciate that he was responsible for Radio Éireann at a time when there was evident improvement in the programme and once again I would like to wish him well in his new post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> I would like to stress again one point about which I feel very keenly, and I think my colleagues in the Government do likewise, and I believe that any Government that should succeed will feel the same&mdash;that the directorship of Radio Éireann should be considered as being independent of all political considerations and should be considered from purely the professional standpoint.  The Director of Broadcasting should have the gift and the vocation of producing programmes. Wherever he comes from or whoever he is, he must be able to provide a programme in a given setting&mdash;in our case, an Irish setting.  Anyone applying for that position or anyone seeking that position should be able to know in advance, as far as he can, whether he can adapt himself to provide a programme in a given setting.  If we can set that tradition in the future so far as the director is concerned, I believe it will be to the tremendous advantage of Radio Éireann.  As I have said, the director's position is in the nature of that of the head of a programme service in a larger organisation, and it is one requiring a peculiar and very rarely found gift.</P>
    <P>There were one or two observations by Deputies on the proposal to raise the licence fee.  In order that no one should be worried that this is another example of rather heavy taxation made inevitable at the present time, I would like to say that the increase in the fee will not be felt very severely by the people of this country.  We could make quite a considerable improvement in the service by charging three farthings more in the week. We could make a still further improvement by charging 1d. or 1½d. per week, in the form of increased licence fee.  I want to make it quite clear that the increase, though every penny counts, is nothing that will disturb the people in any way.</P>
    <P>The improvement of the programme depends to a certain point on the removal of a final bottleneck in studio accommodation.  There is an absolute limitation of studio accommodation available in the G.P.O.  For example, it would be quite impossible for us to provide two five-hour programmes in <Col N="1178" /> the G.P.O., and that is the minimum requirement of a good broadcasting service for a small country like our own.  For example, to provide a programme the equal of Denmark, we would have to broadcast two five-hour programmes.  In order to provide anything such as Deputy Cowan suggested, playing light music from 9 to 10 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night, or meet suggestions of that kind, we would need a new building.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention, for the benefit of Deputies, that the licence has remained at the lowest figure in Europe.  There are a great many licences at 25/-, a considerable number at 28/- to 30/- and a great many at £1.  We have a very small programme at the moment and we have to improve it and we believe that the people will find it is worth while paying the extra cost.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had better put down a question about that point.  Taking 400,000 licences at 2/6 more, it would bring in £50,000&mdash;or something of that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett, my predecessor, showed a very reasonable attitude towards the new proposals and I must pay tribute to him for his fair comment. One of the points he made was that the people of the countryside did not appreciate or like the music of the radio symphony orchestra.  He spoke as though there was nothing in between light music and symphony music.  The figures for music played may be divided into various categories and show a reasonable balance.  I suppose that the musical experts in Radio <Col N="1179" /> Éireann would disagree with me or anyone who attempted to measure them, but the disagreement would not be very great.  The highbrow music amounts to about a quarter of the total; the music of a light quality, such as described by Deputy Corish, played by the light orchestra and so on, would be about 56 per cent.; and the music of a very popular order, such as rather hot dance music and jazz music, would be about 19 per cent.  Therefore, the musical content is fairly well balanced; there is not an excess of highbrow music and that is about all we can do in a single programme.</P>
    <P>So far as the popularity of good music is concerned, the symphony orchestra is drawing larger and larger audiences.  It is going around the country, playing in various towns, and people of every kind are coming to listen to the music.  That is also the case with other orchestras visiting this country.  I would like to stress the point that, if we are to have our traditional music played here in the best way possible, played in the manner pleasing to the people, we must also have symphony music.</P>
    <P>Symphony music and traditional music go together.  The people who compose arrangements for traditional music, study traditional music, collect it and arrange it in various forms are also the people who like and enjoy good symphony music.  The two are complementary.  It would be inconceivable that we could have that development without having our people at the same time getting to like good music, not very highbrow, complicated music but ordinary, good music. I am certain that as the years go by Deputies will find that those two things go together.  If the younger generation are to appreciate our traditional music they will also appreciate good symphony music at the same time.  One will be complementary to the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett also spoke on the question of television.  We are beginning to examine the problem of television but there are a great many serious problems the principal one of which is the cost.  A television programme <Col N="1180" /> costs six times that of a sound programme.  For example, in Denmark they have experimental television for three hours per week.  It covers only the Copenhagen area.  I think there are less than 1,000 people with television sets as a result of that noteworthy experiment.</P>
    <P>For three hours a week the present cost is in the nature of £55,000 per year.  I do not think this even includes the capital and interest repayment on the equipment.  That is a very large sum for only three hours a week of purely experimental television, done, I think, mostly in the studio.</P>
    <P>A good example of the high cost of television will be seen from figures which I obtained from a foreign broadcasting company in regard to what a live television broadcast costs.  An hour of an international tennis event, if televised live, would, in addition to the ordinary operating costs of the television company, amount to anything from £700 to £1,200 per hour. That is the extra cost of doing a live television of a tennis international, and it gives some idea of the very serious problem we face.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is true that the desirability of television is a highly debatable matter.  I asked any number of people of all political Parties what they thought of television.  Almost as many people said it was a curse as those who said it was a blessing.  It is true that there were people who said that about the motor-car in 1900.  One has to look at that particular sort of observation in that light.  I do not think that anybody would desire this country, even if we could afford it, to have a very extensive television service.  If we could have six or seven hours' television I think it would very nearly destroy the art of conversation in this country.  It might not do that, but it would certainly have a very damaging effect on the people's capacity to amuse themselves.  Whatever we do in the future I trust that whoever is Minister at that time&mdash;it might not be myself&mdash;will make quite sure that it will only cover a limited field of time.  I hope that if television ever comes to this country it will be part of our composite programme, the two programmes in the evening.  In <Col N="1181" /> that programme I hope there will be some programmes televised, some to which one can listen or see, either one or the other, whichever is the most enjoyable, and some purely sound programmes.  That is what I would like to see if television ever comes, but that is only a personal opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett referred also to the short-wave station.  I may have misunderstood him, but he seemed to imply that there was some decision by the last Government to use this station.  I cannot find any decision at all in the records.</P>
    <P>The position is that the short-wave conferences in Mexico and Italy were both failures from the standpoint of being able to provide us with a wavelength which could be used effectively in America.  Therefore, the short-wave station will have to wait further developments.  In regard to the ordinary use of the short-wave in the range where we could obtain frequencies we have secured frequencies but the interruption would be so great that the heavy cost involved in emitting transmissions would not be worth while.  I will ask the new council to examine the whole question of a short-wave station to see if anything more can be done about it.</P>
    <P>There was comment on the whole problem of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and the employment of foreign musicians therein.  I have already said that good symphony music goes with traditional music and that if one is to be encouraged so also must the other.  In France, Italy and Sweden the people who are trying to revive national traditions are those who are already steeped in good music.  In England, where there is a tradition more in music of an international character of a jazz variety, there has been a very considerable revival of English traditional music, and 90 per cent. of what has been done to make traditional music more entertaining to the English people has been done by people already steeped in the love of symphony music.  I want to stress the importance of the Symphony Orchestra as being the apex of culture in any country.  At the same time the playing of the Symphony Orchestra encourages <Col N="1182" /> Irish composers and should encourage young men to equip themselves to join the orchestra.  It also encourages those who want to arrange traditional music for the orchestra.  It is part of the programme of national resurgence.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that we do not need to have an internationally famous orchestra.  I have no limit to my ambition for the Symphony Orchestra. I am determined that we shall have one at least as good as the Hallé Orchestra.  I am determined that as soon as it can be arranged the orchestra will consist of Irish musicians. That is my aim and ambition. I am not going to limit that.  I should like, when the Hallé Orchestra came to Dublin, the radio orchestra to be playing in Manchester and that the two orchestras would merely exchange places.  I hope also that we shall have Irish soloists singing Irish songs in Manchester.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the orchestra so far as employment is concerned is as follows.  In 1936 there were 28 Irish musicians in the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  In 1948 there were 40 and in 1952 there are 60.  There has been a constant increase in the number of native Irish musicians employed.  I hope that that will continue.  I was left with the responsibility of trying to bring the orchestra up to a standard whereby we could consider the appointment of a permanent conductor who, as I said in my Estimate speech, would wish to make the reputation of the orchestra and his own.  That was my problem.  I had to take the advice of the expert officers of the music section of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I felt that the best thing I could do was to make the difficult decision to bring in some more foreign players, to arrange that most of them would become instructors for concert standard playing, that that was the best way to ensure that Irish musicians, young men, would come forward and receive their final training from these foreigners and that the foreigners would be welcome so long as the great majority of them at least were instructors, so that we would eventually be able to have an orchestra completely Irish.</P>
    <Col N="1183" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a very high percentage of foreigners?  Surely they would not all be instructors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are foreign musicians brought in as part of the permanent part of the orchestra.  The recent players who have come in are on short contract and are here in a purely temporary capacity.  Many of these have become instructors.  It has been suggested that my statement that the training for concert standard was inadequate was an exaggeration.  It is quite obvious that the Royal Irish Academy of Music would hardly welcome with open arms increased grants to enable them to provide scholarships for wind instruments if the instruction was adequate.  So far as I know, they very much needed the extra grants that have been provided, £300 by the Minister for Finance and £400 by the Arts Council, for that purpose.  Until that time it was very difficult to secure training up to concert standard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the recent dismissals which have taken place, only two of those dismissed were permanently employed in Radio Éireann.  The others were in a purely temporary capacity and I want to make it quite clear to the House that every orchestra employs a certain number of what are known as deputy players, players who are in a purely temporary capacity and who are aware that they are there to fill in gaps.  It is the case with orchestras abroad and it is the case here, and the people concerned are well aware that, like many artistes of any kind, dramatic and otherwise, their positions are not permanent. They are aware of it in the same way as are actors in a repertory theatre company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be innovation and the suggestion that people were ruthlessly thrown out from Radio Éireann in the manner which was a surprise to them, in a manner which broke up their family life, is entirely inadmissible, because we have this temporary category of players and every orchestra in a state of development has to have this category of players.  Even if we had a sufficient number of trained <Col N="1184" /> musicians, particularly in the woodwind and brass sections, we would have to have a number of deputy players whom we could replace by other Irish players, but the effect on the people dismissed might be just as adverse.  They feel distressed, naturally, by losing their chance in the premier orchestra of the country, but there is always bound to be, out of a total orchestra, a certain number of players in a purely temporary capacity. We replace a foreign musician by an Irish musician and a foreign musician by another foreign musician.</P>
    <P>The position is that there is this special class of player.  Most of these players have received rather longer appointments than is customary in other orchestras, and it may perhaps have given them an unfortunate impression of their position.  So far as the observation made about two of these players having been asked to play with the Hallé Orchestra is concerned, it is perfectly true.</P>
    <P>The Hallé Orchestra wished to fill certain positions for a concert of a special kind here and they used these players, but the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra has been employing one or other of the players who are no longer in the position they were in temporarily.  That is quite natural. The fact that the Hallé Orchestra employed these people did not mean that they were wrongfully dismissed. They were merely using the same method of employing a deputy player, a temporary player.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that every care is taken to select such foreign players as have been introduced into the orchestra and the suggestion made by a Deputy that the examining board was inadequate is completely wrong.  The foreign players were appointed after the examination of the St. Cecilia Academy in Rome, an institution of European renown.  I also want to make it quite clear that we have frequent auditions for Irish players, for anyone who offers himself. There are almost permanent vacancies in Radio Éireann in various parts of the orchestra for Irish players who may present themselves.  The auditioning board consists of Irishmen as well as some foreigners, and, in actual fact, in <Col N="1185" /> the musical world it is recognised as being in some ways the best to have a foreign examiner rather than an Irish examiner, particularly in a centre like Dublin where there are so few orchestral players of any kind.  We do our best to have a fair examination.  The board, as I say, consists of a combination of Irish examiners and foreign examiners, but if it should consist only of a foreigner, my own belief is that, if he is an eminent musician himself, he will do his very utmost to be impartial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not have a completely Irish board, as I think you should have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible to have a completely Irish board, but my belief is that there would not be any different result.  It is simply a matter of whom one chooses, but I am examining the question of the auditioning board to make certain that no one can feel that there is any unfairness or prejudice in the choice of players. We had occasion some months ago to alter the programme for a concert because there was no one who could play a particular solo instrument. That is a difficult position.  There is also the difficulty that, if one player is sick, it is impossible to find a player able to play the solo part in his place. We want to improve the position, particularly in the wind section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reassure the House that there will not be any great change for the worse in the present orchestra, so far as Irish musicians are concerned.  Of the 84 members of the two orchestras, less than 10 per cent. have not been offered contracts of a permanent character, and we have reached a position in which, allowing for retirements, it will not be necessary to alter the present orchestra in any material way.  There will be very few changes required.  We have reached a stage of stability at which we can hope that Irish musicians will come into the orchestra to replace the foreigners who are on short-term contracts, and I say that, provided the present members of the orchestra improve their standard or at least <Col N="1186" /> maintain their standard, there will be few changes.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that this episode of change is over, because I am determined to have a truly Irish orchestra of international repute.  I hope the Academy of Music or any other academy in this country, which feels that the financial support it has is inadequate, will seek whatever aid it can.  I cannot promise them aid, but I wish them well.  If they need any other financial help, I hope they will make their appeal to the Arts Council, which is the body to look after such matters.  I was glad to see advertised in the papers yesterday 14 scholarships for wind instruments by the Royal Irish Academy of Music.  As I have said, the foreign players are providing the instruction, and I do not know any better way of meeting the position.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra is one which will have to have the attention of all music lovers in this country as a whole in the future, because it started off as an orchestra to play only over the radio system.</P>
    <P>It has become the national orchestra of the country but the cost of it is upon the broadcasting Vote and something will have to happen regarding its finances in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>To give a comparative example of finances, the Radio Éireann Symphony orchestra costs about £50,000 a year and our revenue is practically nil up to now from seats and so on.  A provincial orchestra in one small corner of England which I do not wish to name spends £86,000 a year, but receives in fees from people who have subscribed to concerts or paid for tickets at concerts about £60,000.  The balance is found by a city corporation grant of £5,000 and a grant from the British Arts Council.  I should like to feel that that could happen here.  If the symphony orchestra plays as perfectly as possible and achieves as high a standard as possible I believe we will be able to have greater revenue.  One of the necessities is that there should be a concert hall at least in Dublin and finances should be available for the orchestra to go to the provinces <Col N="1187" /> and become gradually more and more popular and more and more loved by the people.</P>
    <P>I hope at some future date to establish a paid choir in Radio Éireann &mdash;we have already a voluntary choir. In that case it would be possible to have only Irish singers or at least only resident Irish singers.  A choir is not the same as an orchestra.  An element of perfection is required in any symphony orchestra as is known to all Deputies who have studied good music. A choir need not have the same perfection as an orchestra and if we have a paid choir, as I hope we will, it can consist of Irish people or at least Irish residents and will contribute to the better singing of Irish songs.</P>
    <P>I do wish to make it clear&mdash;and I am quite sure that people will agree with me&mdash;that for us to try to make Radio Éireann too Irish in character will defeat itself.  A certain amount of all culture is international and a great deal of what is actually Irish culture was at one time international in character.  It is an answer to a great deal of what was said to-night by people who want either more dance music, more Irish music, more Céilí music or more Irish songs, that the two aspects must go together.  I am told that Celtic designs were originally Scandinavian, that they were adapted from Scandinavian designs and made Irish.  I read an article the other day claiming that hurling was originally an English game but that does not prevent it from being our national game to-day.</P>

      <P>I hope that there will be a stimulating discussion on the question.  This is the article I read and it actually quoted Saxon words for the game.  We should have a good discussion on it in a Sunday journal. I am not saying that it was a Saxon game; I am merely giving an example of the kind of thing I mean.  We do not want to accept blindly vulgar imports.  At the same time if we had a certain number of foreign programmes from Radio Éireann it would stimulate our people to compose their own poetry, plays and music.  Everybody knows that.  I would merely stress it to show that programmes on Radio Éireann must be balanced as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a very fair speech on the question of the reorganisation and I want to make it clear once again that the comhairle of Radio Éireann will be an executive comhairle and will be responsible for the overall supervision of the Radio Éireann service. As he indicated, ultimately the legal responsibility rests in myself, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of the day.  The question of how far we in Dáil Éireann should interfere with Radio Éireann is one which must be left ultimately to the good taste and discrimination of the Deputies.  It is most essential that Radio Éireann should be as divorced as possible from Party politics and political commentary. As Deputies have suggested, they are at liberty to ask questions in the Dáil, but it would be much better if, in the first period of the new organisation, unless something happens which to them is extremely distasteful, their questions could be addressed to the director or the comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that Radio Éireann should be as free as possible from ordinary Party comment from either side of the House.  That is why nearly all Western European countries have independent corporations.  They are democratic people, very much like ourselves in many ways, and they have <Col N="1189" /> discovered that the best way to run a radio service is to divorce it as far as possible from the Government of the day.  We are having this intermediate stage of development and I would ask Deputies to give Radio Éireann the greatest possible freedom and address their questions to the comhairle or the director if they feel dissatisfied with the programmes or have proposals to make.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that political broadcasts had their advantage but they would be difficult to carry out until Radio Éireann is really free of Government control.</P>
    <P>I would like to feel that we could advance to the stage of having more political broadcasts and the comhairle should be made sufficiently free so that we could have that development. I must leave it to the good sense of the House.  It is my hope, anyway, that Radio Éireann will progress in that way.  All those who work there should feel as free as possible to carry out the programme which I have outlined in my Estimate speech, a general programme in an Irish setting, palatable to the whole community.  They should be free to work it out as they think best.</P>
    <P>The observation was made by Deputy Cosgrave that our foreign news is a repetition of B.B.C. news. In actual fact, we collect our own foreign news and edit it from various sources so that our people may obtain independent information and to make sure that we will not be victims of the &ldquo;paper wall&rdquo;.  This is not always possible but in no sense is our news a copy of the B.B.C.  In actual fact, I have heard the heads of news services abroad in Europe, who use very powerful Monitor sets and listen to news from all over the world, praising the news from Radio Éireann as being most impartial and not affected by British, American or other foreign propaganda.  I hope that that will long continue.</P>
    <P>Deputies made innumerable suggestions for the improvement of programmes. I can only go through them very quickly, as many as I can, as many as I have time for.  Somebody suggested a revival of &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo;.  I hope that we will revive it in the future.  The whole success of <Col N="1190" /> Question Time depends on the compere. A great many people think they can be comperes but, in fact, it is a most difficult job.  It is a typical example of the difficulty of finding a person with a vocation for certain kinds of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also wants to encourage programmes to discover local talent.  We have our beginners' programme and we are going to continue it.  He said that he thought there is hidden talent.  Deputy Corish said that we should go round the country looking for it.  Within the means at our disposal, we have done so.  If there is an accumulation of people in a particular district who, we think, are meritorious we send people down to audition them.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies mentioned the agricultural programme.  We have agricultural talks.  The development of an agricultural programme to which people will listen is very difficult. Deputy Corry wanted talks of half an hour on agriculture.  It is the experience of broadcasting experts all over the world that it is extremely difficult to get anybody to listen to an individual talk for longer than a quarter of an hour without losing interest.  To get agricultural problems talked about in a way which interests the listener is more than difficult and the matter is having our attention.  I shall ask the comhairle to endeavour to make the agricultural programmes better, to consider how to increase their number and how to make them interesting to the average person living in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many Deputies spoke about what the people want, the different types of programmes, the length of time devoted to them and the hours at which they start.  We intend to start a listener research as soon as possible.  We were told that we could not have controversial discussion over Radio Éireann, that it would cause too much heat, that scandals would take place, that there would be trouble in the Dáil over it, and so forth.  I have been told by some cynics that if we adopt the kind of listener <Col N="1191" /> research which is carried out abroad we shall not get the truth, that if we send round part-time interviewers who will ask all types of people what programmes they listened to the night before and put it down on the list the people will say what will please them. I do not believe that.  I think that the people are growing out of that, if ever they had it.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to engage in innovation. We are always told that something peculiar will happen.  If we start this listener research in a short time people will be quite accustomed to tell the examiners what they listened to the night before, the hours they listened-in, and so forth, and we shall be able to obtain a reasonable idea of what people look for.  We cannot necessarily follow all their desires but it will give us some idea of how to present a palatable programme in which we hope the people of this country will enjoy, not only what is easiest for them to listen to but also the best that is Irish and the best that is our own.</P>
      <P>In connection with the proportion of Irish music in the programme, I regret to say that if we were to play all the available records of Irish music as often as some people would like the repetition would be so great that the people would simply turn off the radio. I am having the whole question of the arrangement of Irish airs and melodies examined with a view to providing a far greater diversity of programmes. There is a hopeless inadequacy of positions for various types of instruments and voices, not only in respect of the music we all know but in respect of, literally, volumes of music lying in the National Library, most of which has never been produced or arranged for popular consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is a matter for the Arts Council, if it is not already receiving attention.  We should kill the interest in Irish music if we were to increase the proportion of Irish music broadcast at present without making a great improvement in the arrangement. I do not know whether Deputies have, for example, ever heard that magnificent choir&mdash;I think they have now disappeared&mdash;called the &ldquo;Don <Col N="1192" /> Cossacks.&rdquo;  They were the original Czar's Cossacks and they sang the songs of their native land.  One part of the choir sang the tune while the other part of the choir accompanied them like an orchestra.  There is no arrangement like that for Irish songs.  I think it would be inspiring if <i>O'Donnell Abu</i>, for instance, could be sung like that. I am now examining the whole question of the arrangement of Irish music. We may even have to go abroad for some of the arrangements, judging by the prize money awarded for compositions which we have held at various times, by the number of entries we have received, and so forth.  The entries have been very small even for a prize of £50 for a musical composition. The number of arrangements we have received for Irish dance music, for example, has been very small.  We have to examine all that matter and find out why it is that we receive so few entries for the prizes we have already offered for musical arrangements. Take, for example, the Moore competition. We invited orchestral arrangements of Moore's melodies.  We received 32 entries, only seven of which were worthy of an award.  All that shows the necessity for developing music of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the playing of old records.  I do not think that is very frequent nowadays.  We need more balance and control officers in Radio Éireann to ensure that the production is good on every occasion.  I do not think I have heard many complaints of that nature.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell was very helpful in speaking of the high standard of certain types of musical training in Dublin; he thought training in other directions was defective but he said he appreciated the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Brennan suggested that we should have more traditional music. We are trying to get more traditional music arranged.  Again speaking of the control of Radio Éireann, some Deputy suggested that if Radio Éireann were made entirely free of Government control by making it into a statutory corporation the Dáil would lose control of the organisation.  I <Col N="1193" /> want to make it quite clear that that would not be the case.  We are having this intermediate organisation for the time being, until this or some other Government decides otherwise.  This is an intermediate stage.  If a statutory corporation were set up it could be granted a licence at the discretion of the Government of the day to broadcast for three, five or ten years, and at the end of that period the licence could be reviewed, the directors could all be changed, and a new licence granted to new directors under new conditions.  I think that, unknown to most people, the Postmaster General in Great Britain exercises an absolute veto on every single word uttered by the B.B.C.&mdash;but he must lay on the Table of the House of Commons within 24 hours his reason for exercising the veto.  In fact, only one Postmaster General has exercised that veto and that was in the early stages of the B.B.C.  It happened in 1926, I think, and I have forgotten the nature of the veto.  There are many grades of control, and it is simply a matter of the best type of organisation.  We have this intermediate organisation.  I should like to feel that it will be as free as possible if we are to succeed in our object to obtain the very best type of organisation, and I should like the people in it to feel that they are not constantly under the immediate observation of Deputies and that their positions are in danger, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan suggested that we should have more recording apparatus for taking down local songs and traditional songs.  We are ordering more recording apparatus and I hope it will be available sometime in the new year.  As Deputies already know, there is actually a special broadcasting cable within the main co-axial cable to Cork.  We can arrange similar circuits in any other telephone cables which are installed for the purpose of connecting local areas with the Dublin station, to enable programmes to be transmitted more easily.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested that we catered too much for Dublin listeners. In actual fact, the proportion of listeners in the provinces has been <Col N="1194" /> rising continuously and I hope it will continue to rise.  The difference in the number of listeners per 100 as between Dublin and the provinces is gradually decreasing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a number of suggestions particularly in regard to broadcasting the results of the Cork game of bowling.  I can have that suggestion examined.  I do not know whether it would be of quite sufficient interest to justify the broadcasting of news of the game but we can always examine questions of that kind.  He also asked for more céilí music.  We broadcast as much céilí music as we can and we are trying to secure a better arrangement of céilí music. There, again, if we had too much of it, people would tire of it and on most occasions on which it was broadcast, people would simply turn off from Radio Éireann and would not listen to it.</P>
    <P>Some observations have been made in regard to interference in West Cork. Interference, we admit, has been rather serious there.  It has been serious in Wexford also.  I think I shall have to be realistic about that and say to Deputies from these areas that the interference is caused by European stations which overlap the wavelength of Radio Éireann and break the international law.  To minimise the effect of this interference, I would suggest that people with wireless sets in areas like West Cork, Kerry and Wexford must, in the first instance, have their sets in perfect order and must use extra good aerials. That may be a problem to persons of limited means, but the realistic fact is that they must have their sets in the best order and have proper aerials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting because people nowadays do not have much regard for aerials. I think the Minister should make that widely known.  People in many areas are dispensing with aerials and they have instead an internal device in their sets that does not mean anything.  I have one myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, as the Deputy knows, if one requires a very high aerial with a large pole the cost <Col N="1195" /> even in Dublin is surprisingly high and it may be rather hard on some of these people to provide such an aerial.  I think the new transmitter should improve reception.  I would ask these people in West Cork and other areas affected to examine their apparatus and their aerials and to send us on any reports of interference when the new transmitters are installed which I hope, if all goes well, will be some time about next July.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have much time to go into all the other questions that were raised, they were so many and so varied.  Deputy Cogan spoke about the difficulty of getting satisfactory broadcasts of debates over the radio. We have, of course, to contend with a natural reticence on the part of people who have not been accustomed to speaking before the microphone.  We hope there will be an improvement in that respect.  There is a good deal of that reticence which is natural in a country which has not had much opportunity up to the present of broadcasting these unscripted discussions. We, like every other country, find that a good chairman for a broadcast unscripted debate is very much more difficult to find than a good chairman for any organisation, ceremony or function.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that we should broadcast the Dáil at Question Time.  That is a very big matter.  Very few countries broadcast their parliamentary proceedings.  Australia does it continuously and has a special programme in which the whole of the parliamentary proceedings are broadcast. It is a question which we could go into but it would be a matter for discussion, first of all by some parliamentary committee.  There are many advantages and disadvantages to be considered.</P>

      <P>There have been some comments on the kind of plays which we broadcast.  I could not enter into a discussion as to what constitutes or does not constitute the stage Irishman but plays in all parts of the world are <Col N="1196" /> inclined to be terribly critical of the country in which they are written.  If there are any plays which are thought to be offensive, naturally I shall examine the question, but some of the plays which we have broadcast and to which objection has been taken, have been very largely attended when produced in various theatres.  People seem to like tragic plays and plays with terrible endings.  It is extremely difficult to find good national plays. It is a difficulty which has faced every other country in the world, the difficulty of discovering plays of the purely nationalist type that are good in themselves. We have broadcast plays on Robert Emmet and other great national leaders and we shall continue that policy.  We have also tried to broadcast some dramatic features in the lives of great national leaders and in that connection we hope to be able to reconstruct for broadcasting some episodes in the national struggle from 1916 to 1921.  We have dramatised some of Maurice Walsh's works &mdash; at least one.  The whole question of dramatising a work for broadcasting involves a whole world of specialisation. A radio play is very different from an ordinary play.  In the recent competition, the majority of the plays sent in were full-length plays, in spite of our insistence that they should be radio plays.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy MacCarthy referred to school broadcasts. That is a very big subject.  I hope it will be possible to commence the study of that problem later.  It cannot be considered at the moment because, apart from anything else, we have not the accommodation for such a programme. Deputy Mac Fheórais made a number of very interesting suggestions all of which will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had better close by saying a few words with regard to the sponsored programmes.  We have been asked to improve the sponsored programmes but Deputies sometimes are inclined to exaggerate alleged defects in these programmes.  I do want to make it perfectly clear that Deputy Cowan is right in his suggestion that the sponsored programme is the result of a choice of music by advertisers who wish <Col N="1197" /> to sell their products.  I am going to consider the whole question with a view to seeing if we can effect some improvement.</P>

      <P>I do not think we can include any lady member on the Advisory Council now but I agree with Deputy Mrs. Rice that we should have more items of women's interests in <Col N="1198" /> Radio Éireann.  I admit absolutely frankly that apparently it has been impossible apart from the children's programme to provide a programme of interest to women as such.  That is a matter that will have the early attention of the comhairle.  I have nothing further to add except to thank Deputies for their very interesting observations.</P>
      <P>Vote agreed to.</P>
