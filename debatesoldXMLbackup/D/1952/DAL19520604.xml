      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will indicate whether any Department of State has been made responsible for the prevention of coast erosion and whether if there is at present no responsible Department he will, as a matter of extreme urgency, indicate the Government's intention in the matter.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of coast erosion rests, generally, with the owners of the property affected, who may be a private individual or concern, a transport undertaking or a local authority, and the only Departments of State which have any statutory or other responsibility in the matter are, first, the Department of Industry and Commerce, which in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Foreshore Act, 1933, is concerned only in so far as the removal of beach material from the foreshore may cause or accelerate erosion; and, secondly, the Department of Lands, in the limited number of cases in which the Land Commission administer trust funds for the maintenance of existing protection works, such as sea walls, or make occasional small grants and advances to assist in the carrying out of minor protection works where the security for their land purchase advances is endangered by coast erosion.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that erosion on the east coast is of such <Col N="438" /> immense proportions that it is impossible for the local authority, let alone the landlord, to take measures to prevent and correct it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of coast erosion has been frequently considered. The difficulty is that, generally, the cost of any effective works is altogether out of proportion to the value of the property that would be saved.  In particular cases it has been examined.  I do not know if the case that has been referred to has been examined yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>In Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that particular case has been examined yet in detail but I do know that other cases have been examined.  For example, the case in Lahinch was examined and the report that was given at that time, I remember, was that it would be far cheaper to take all the existing houses and rebuild the town on the hill rather than to undertake works the effectiveness of which could not be guaranteed.  It is very difficult to undertake this work as a national work.  The first thing that would have to be done in regard to it would be to have a survey, which would cost a great deal of money. There are about six places that have been indicated: four on the east coast, and Tramore and Lahinch are two others.  In regard to any particular one of these that has been examined the result of the investigations that have taken place has been that the capital cost is so enormous that you could not defend doing it on the basis of the value of the property that would be saved.</P>
      <P>If this work were to be done on a national scale, you would also have to get specialists to examine the whole matter but, in so far as it has been examined by the engineers at our disposal, the position is as I have stated, that in no one case that has been examined has it been found that the saving of the property would at all justify the capital cost.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the reports the Taoiseach has <Col N="439" /> are confidential or not but would it be possible to make the reports dealing with these four cases available or to publish them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in 1931, some time back.  I would not like to give a general promise.  I would like to know what the position was more completely than I do at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the origin of this question? Rosslare strand is seriously threatened and as a result of Rosslare strand being threatened, the whole of Wexford town will in time be threatened. As much as 72 yards of strand disappeared overnight a few months ago in the Rosslare strand area.  The position is very serious and the residents of Rosslare strand feel that they are unable to meet the expenses.  Although they are prepared in as far as it is possible to carry the weight of the expense themselves, they would like some State assistance.  The origin of this question really is that there is no State Department responsible for dealing with this particular situation and I would be glad if the Taoiseach would indicate if any State Department will be held responsible for it in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of trying to fix responsibility of that sort on a particular State Department, like the case of embankments, has been the subject of discussion on many occasions. The present position is that the local authorities and the private owners are responsible.  I should like to know&mdash;as a matter of interest, if the Deputy can tell me&mdash;what the local authorities have been doing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will give particulars of the cost-of-living index numbers (old <Col N="440" /> series: base July, 1914=100) at the months of February, May, August and November of each year from May, 1947, to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost-of living index numbers (to base July, 1914=100) for the months of May, 1947, and August, 1947, were 305 and 319 respectively, as published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> for September, 1947.  As this series of inder numbers was based on a completely out-of-date consumption standard, it was decided to discontinue it after August, 1947.  As a temporary arrangement, pending the completion of a family budget inquiry, the present interim cost-of-living index (essential items), to base August, 1947=100, was inaugurated in November, 1947.  It is considered that publication of the former cost-of-living index numbers for periods subsequent to August, 1947, in juxtaposition with the present official series, could only lead to confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for the information which has been given, the substance of which we all know, of course, but is the Taoiseach not aware that, in point of fact, in the last month figures based on the old cost-of-living index were given in this House in reply to questions?  Is there any objection to making these particular figures available for the purpose of comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty in regard to one type of comparison. The former index was 319 in August, 1947, and by a simple sum in proportion, or by multiplying by 3.19, you can from the present figure arrive at a national one, because that is all it would be.  Of course, if you want to find out what it would have been based on the old figures, you will have to work on the old wrong foundation. The figures on which that foundation was based had been discarded.  If you were to work on these figures it would simply mean that you were working on two sets of figures, one set of which was discarded because it was on a wrong foundation.  The only effect of having two sets of figures, as has been <Col N="441" /> pointed out, would be to create confusion in the public mind.</P>

      <P>What set of figures was wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time it was maintained to be wrong and a temporary basis was fixed until, as a result of the examination of these household budgets, a more accurate figure could be found.  It is quite clear it is wrong.  If you go back to 1914, the whole pattern of consumption has changed since 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the pattern of consumption has so often and so radically changed, perhaps the present figure is wrong too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach state why he refuses to give these figures to-day, when about a month ago he gave these figures in reply to another question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave one of them.  If a person asks for a particular set of figures it can be given.  A certain amount of calculation, weightings and so on would be required. There would be no point in giving two sets of figures which would confuse the public.  The point is that there is one set of figures, the official figures, to which we are adhering.</P>

      <P>Tea will be derationed from and including the 5th July, and it is intended to revoke the Order which prescribes a uniform price for all tea from and including the same date.  It is anticipated that a variety of blends of tea at varying prices will become available to consumers when, on the abolition of rationing, there is a return to conditions which will permit of competitive trading.  It is too early to make a reliable forecast of the effects of derationing on the consumption of tea or sugar.  The present anticipations are that there will be no appreciable change in consumption.</P>

These pensioners are being paid the full amount of pension appropriate to their salaries on retirement under the provisions of the Superannuation Acts without any reduction, and as the State is discharging its full statutory liability to these pensioners, it cannot be said that there is any gain to the Exchequer in respect of these pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Vote, it is singularly unfortunate that the Government Party should think it expedient from time to time to raise war scares because the fact is that so long as the Cominform functions in Moscow the danger of war neither waxes nor wanes.  If there is to be a third world war, it will be started by the Cominform at the time and in the place which the Cominform think holds <Col N="479" /> out the highest prospect of victory for them.  No ulterior event, no provocation, will precipitate it; no appeasement, no concessions, will postpone it by an hour.  Any sane Government in any free democracy in the world must in the times we live in so dispose itself to be as ready as its circumstances will allow every day, every week, every month, every year for the outbreak of war, must be coldly reconciled to the fact that there is neither waxing nor waning in the probability of that event, and that it is self-deception to imagine that propaganda appearances of slackening of international tension make the probability of war more remote.  It is highly probable that if war is to come it will come at a time when it looks least likely.  I would ask the House to remember that even before the Cominform appeared in the world, in the 1914-18 war, two months before it began, in the month of June, I think, it was said by a responsible statesman that the horizon of Europe was never clearer than at that time. I think it is also true that prior to the invasion of Prague, in March, 1939, there was weighty opinion for the view that international tension had been greatly decreased subsequent to Munich.  Yet, the Nazis started the war in September.</P>
      <P>It would be well for people in this House to remember that the Nazis and the Bolsheviks are two sides of the same coin.  Their methods are the same, their objectives are the same.  The only blessing the world can rejoice in is that we have reason to believe that the Russian Nazi Bolsheviks are not quite so efficient as the German Nazi Bolsheviks in their day.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I suggest to the House that, in considering the Defence Estimate, this Parliament and every future Parliament, so long as the Cominform functions, must make up its mind that we are employing our resources in the light of the possibility of war eventuating to-morrow, next week, next month or next year, with special emphasis on the possibility of war eventuating to-morrow or next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to sound unduly paradoxical yet I think it is true to say that <Col N="480" /> with 12,000 men Ireland could have the most effective army in Europe considering her circumstances.  Normal intelligence demands that in considering a Defence Estimate one has to ask oneself with whom one is likely to be at war.  I think it unlikely that Ireland will become involved in a war for the Gran Chaco in Bolivia.  The possibility of our involvement is remote.  When you canvass, as you might, all the possibilities, the plain fact is that, although I suppose it is not considered tactful to say so, the danger against which we must provide is airborne invasion by the Russians.  There is not any other danger.  The Americans are not going to invade this country and they will not let the British invade it. The Russians may.  The question is, what hope have we then of meeting such contingencies?</P>

Our business will be to put them out, as it would be our business to put anybody else out, and to fix with full, fair notice that our purpose will be to get them out.

That is perfectly feasible and it is because I believe it to be feasible <Col N="481" /> through the medium of our own armed forces that I give expression to what may sound a paradox, that Ireland is so circumstanced that, with 12,000 men we may have the most effective Army in Europe.</P>

      <P>I want only to suggest <Col N="482" /> to the Minister that inasmuch as it is true to say that much of the guerrilla tactics, which have so successfully preserved the sovereign independence of many States that were overrun during the world conflict, were taught to other countries by our people, it seems a pity that at this time when such tactics are the only recourse of small nations confronted with the aggression of great Powers, we should not bend our minds to that problem more closely than we appear to have done heretofore. There is no use deceiving ourselves that it cannot but cause derision amongest our people, when our own Army appears to desire to present itself as a force equipped with the heavy armament of a country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might remember that he is not now in the police court but in Dáil Éireann, and he might adapt his conduct to justify his unexpected promotion.  I suggest that the House might reasonably consider that the continued outlay of money on antiquated heavy equipment is a waste of money and that the proper procedure is to aim to make of our Army of 12,000 men, the most effective force we can, made up of what I would describe as commando guerrillas.  I suggest to the Minister that if our Army consisted of 100 cadres, strictly trained in commando guerrilla tactics and connected to a central headquarters by modern methods of peripatetic wireless communication and equipped with modern small arms, such a force divided up as military necessity might suggest to provide approximately four cadres, highly trained, in each county of the 26, no matter what power established a footing in this country, it would become manifest from an early stage that continued and effective resistance could be maintained in a way which would cause any attempted occupation of the country to be a matter of extreme difficulty for the Power which contemplated it.  If they <Col N="483" /> foresaw that in due course, there would arrive powerful assistance from other quarters before they could establish any claim to having secured the assent of the people of Ireland to their aggression a great many Powers that might be tempted to try their hand in the absence of such notification, would make up their minds that the game was not worth the candle.</P>
      <P>There are available, and I observe in pictures I saw in the papers that the Minister is in process of acquiring equipment such as automatic weapons and this machine for firing things at approaching tanks.  I understand there are developments of the Bazooka which are relatively inexpensive and very effective against heavy armoured vehicles.  It has to be borne in mind that an invasion of this country from the only probable source must be of an airborne character.  That implies that armoured support of such an invasion would be on a strictly limited scale.  I have always felt that, in addition to the actual physical resistance to attack, a very necessary requisite for the maintenance of morale in the Army is the assurance to the Army that our people believe in it and support it, not for appearance sake, but because they believe that the Army can do what it is intended to do and can do it superlatively well.  I cannot but believe that a great many of the officers of our Army are perfectly aware what many of our citizens know that they have not got the equipment and that they never will have the equipment to function as a continental army functions, with tanks, artillery and the like. Therefore, when you meet a dejected battalion of Irish soldiers going through the motions of manoeuvres suitable for a continental army, marching down the main highway of the Malahide Road, with twigs of trees on their helmets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was observing, one of the important things is that the Army should feel that it enjoys the confidence and the informed support of the population which it is its prime duty to protect.  So long as an obligation is put on the Army of conforming to the procedure, the manoeuvre and the training proper to a continental army heavily equipped it must itself feel that the civilian population look upon it as not conforming to reality.  Whereas, if the Army openly and avowedly eschewed, as beyond the reach of the equipment that they can have placed at their disposal, the tactical manoeuvre of highly-equipped armies and confined themselves to becoming masters of guerrilla warfare for the purpose of giving effect to the national policy of <Col N="486" /> maintaining resistance in the field for the maximum period of time against aggression, from wherever it might come, the people would feel that every penny laid out on the Army was money well spent and that whatever forces are brought against us in the hereafter our own Army would be adequate to maintain the vital period of national resistance requisite to maintain our status while the help of allies was coming to assist us to repel the physical aggression made upon us.</P>
      <P>I feel this so deeply that I think it is a matter of some urgency that public opinion should be intelligently mobilised behind the Army.  I feel a certain sympathy with civilian and Army observers who contemplate the present situation and are driven to the impatience of saying that money spent on the Army is money wasted and that it is more important to have men hoeing turnips than wearing uniforms.  I think such language is most imprudent, ill-informed and mistaken, but I cannot but feel that, so long as there is no evidence abundantly clear for all to see that the Army is training itself for the discharge of its function in a way that will be second to none in the world, it is legitimate for people to feel that the Army is training itself to do a job that it never can do because the State cannot afford to give it the equipment to do that job, and people will go on saying: &ldquo;Are we not wasting money on the Army?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that our Army should set for itself, as no doubt it desires to set for itself, a standard of doing what it undertakes to do as well or better than any other army in the world.  I do not think that we should offer them a task which they must always face with the feeling that they can only do it in a third or fourth-class way.  We ought to offer them an assignment calling for equipment within our means and capacity to supply it and then say to them: &ldquo;We expect from our Army nothing less than the best.&rdquo;  I am convinced that we can get it.  I am convinced that, in our circumstances, it is a very good best and it is a best which can effectively save and protect against all comers the fundamentals <Col N="487" /> which the Irish Army is concerned to defend.</P>
    <P>It must be a matter of great discouragement to men who give their lives to an Army career in this country to feel that the whole thing is a fatuity. How can an artillery officer here feel that his life is being most effectively spent in the service of this country when he knows perfectly well that, should the time come for him to conduct the defences of the country, he will not have any artillery; that it is not within the power of the State to keep abreast of the revolutionary changes that go on in the modernisation of artillery equipment and, even if we had artillery, that we would have to depend entirely on foreign ammunition wherewith to supply it and that, in a state of isolation, we could not keep the guns supplied beyond a very limited time?</P>
    <P>We can keep abreast, that is to say, our financial resources will permit us to keep abreast, of the most rapid development of small arms equipment. We can accumulate formidable stocks of what, for want of a better term, I will call the Bazooka equipment.  Let us not forget that when Great Britain stood in peril of invasion in 1941 it was Messrs.  Allbright and Wilson who provided her with 7,500,000 Molotov cocktails on which that country was very glad to depend while heavier armaments were coming to them, and which they were satisfied as recently as 1941 were the most useful defensive weapon against the scale of armoured assault that might be brought to bear against them by a power which did not command the sea.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not beyond our resources to produce ancillary equipment of that kind.  We have actually here a firm which manufactured the bulk of that equipment for Great Britain and there is no reason why they should not equip themselves with the materials to provide the State from our own accumulated resources with a not insignificant defensive weapon which would certainly be most useful in the hands of a highly-skilled, welltrained guerrilla army.  What is more stonishing is that I believe we have <Col N="488" /> actually got the raw materials, or a great many of them, with which to manufacture such armaments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have better facilities for doing it now.  In our special circumstances I do not think we should despise armaments of that character.  I think they will be more valuable to us than the importing of out-of-date tanks, artillery which has not been fired since 1938 and equipment of that kind because heavy equipment requires perennial replacement and that replacement imposes a strain upon our resources and makes it extremely difficult for us to give to our Army all that our Army is entitled to expect, namely, the equipment that will enable it to become the best army in the world within the assignment allotted to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that I make the argument that our Army should be avowedly and proudly a guerrilla army trained for these tactics, an army which the State will equip as well or <Col N="489" /> better than any army in the world for the assignment allotted to it.  We should dismiss from our thought altogether the mental reservation that money spent on the Army is money wasted.  We should feel that we are spending money on the best army in Europe.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to where I started.  It should not be beyond our capacity, paradoxical though that may be, to have the best army in Europe bearing in mind the special circumstances of the country that army is concerned to serve.  That is a modest submission.  It is one that should engage the attention of the House. The House is sometimes perhaps a bit reluctant to accept the fact that we should consciously, deliberately and proudly expect for our Army the assignment of guerrilla defence and eschew any attempt to identify our methods of defence with those of continental countries.  That is an act of mind that must be made before this problem can be properly approached. Once made, I think the Army has a valuable future and every man from the highest officer to the youngest recruit can feel that in giving of his best he is giving highly valuable service to the community to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>I think Parliament should not rest easy until it has created a situation in which it can say honestly and sincerely and without reservation that it is prepared to back the Army 100 per cent. and that it demands of the Army the highest performance of any army in Europe.  That is the proper outlook.  I have a horribly uncomfortable feeling ever since I have been in Parliament that a relationship has tended to grow between the Army and Parliament in which it is felt that we do not expect the Army to ask us for equipment they know we cannot afford and because they know that we do not expect of them very much more than a respectable front.</P>
    <P>I think such a relationship must in the long run beget demoralisation and make it virtually impossible for the officers and N.C.O.s who have accepted the Army profession as their life's work to get from the men, or indeed from <Col N="490" /> themselves, the quality of service they wanted to give when they first embarked upon that career.  I believe it is in our power to create a situation in which those who serve in the Army can have a full and useful life.  Given the facilities, we have in the Irish Army material which would do us proud in any company in the world.</P>
    <P>Very often when reform is urgent it is impossible to give effect to it because it would involve heavy expenditure and such a revolutionary change as to make it unthinkable within the time at our disposal.  The reform I now suggest fails on neither score.  First of all, instead of spending £800,000, or trying to spend it and failing to spend it because we are unable to get the materials which our present schedule of purchases envisages, we would probably find that that amount of money, or perhaps a little more, would make available to us the best equipment the Army could possibly require for a guerrilla purpose.  Secondly, the new training requisite to establish a very formidable body of soldiers is not of so revolutionary a character as to make it inaccessible to us.  There is the commando tradition in Great Britain. There is the ranger tradition in the United States of America.  Both of them are eminently adaptable to our Army and to its guerrilla tradition, from which both probably sprang originally.  As they have developed in Great Britain and America they are available for intensive study by the soldiers of our Army to-day and our soldiers are eminently equipped to adapt their methods to the special requirements of our circumstances.</P>
    <P>Can anyone doubt that if we had 100 bodies of men highly organised on these lines and properly equipped on these lines we would have a very effective and formidable defence force in this country?  It would require no explanation from anyone who wished to examine it or understand it; it would be eminently qualified to speak for itself in every conceivable contingency that might arise.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think that any responsible Minister for Defence ought to go to the Government of which he is a member and put them this question: &ldquo;I want <Col N="491" /> an appreciation from the Minister for External Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Government as to whence the probable danger comes because there is not the least use in my equipping the Army with armaments which on the morrow of war will be wholly inaccessible to us.  I must have present to my mind the maintenance of war supplies during the period of crisis and even if the equipment I get is from a source which lies straight in the path of probable danger if it is of a character which will permit me to use spares of ammunition to be derived from another source that is not so bad.  But there is no use in my buying armaments to fire 303 ammunition and then go up to buy ammunition from America or Great Britain only to discover that all I can get is .3 or .282 ammunition and that there is no .303 being manufactured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are 112 adaptations of that situation which will occur to the mind of the Minister and his staff, but it is wrong not to be in a position to tell the House that these matters are being reviewed and considered and that the best decisions are being taken in the light of them. Let us face the fact that if this country is going to be attacked by the only Power that is concerned to attack it, the Cominform of Moscow, Finland and Sweden will get it long before us. Let us look that fact straight in the eye.  If we buy Scandinavian armaments for which ammunition and spares cannot be obtained anywhere else then we are buying so much tripe and rubbish.  The only place which we can get armaments that are going to be of any use to our people is somewhere from which the Russians cannot cut us off or from a domestic source of supply.  I understand from the Minister that it is not the policy of the Government to manufacture ammunition or munitions of war on a large scale in this country.  I think there are powerful arguments for the Government's decision in that regard.  If we are to accept that as the settled policy of the Government then we ought if we wish to be realists arrange for sources of supply of ammunition from sources which will be open to us when the emergency comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a variety of methods of trying to get them made available.  If people want to eat beef you are entitled to say to them that they will have to buy it with armaments from you.  We are not so helpless in that matter as the Deputy may think.  We are in the position now that we have for sale a great many commodities which are in very short supply.  If you have a leg of mutton you are in a position to say to the other fellow: &ldquo;Unless you cough up you will get no mutton.&rdquo;  There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter.  After all we are seeking to buy something and are well able to pay for it.  That is a method worth trying.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that anything more futile than to buy armaments which to the certain knowledge of all of us must become unusable within a very short period if a crisis should come upon us is the worst form of self-delusion.  It is a criminal thing.</P>

      <P>In these circumstances I withdraw it.  I have made these submissions inasmuch as the Army's prime concern is to defend the nation and the civilian population.  I suppose it is not presumption on the part of the civilian to make certain representations in respect thereto.  It has been well known in every free country in the world that a civilian Minister for War is not at all a bad institution.  It has been established in most democratic countries.  The introduction of military personnel to high positions of control in policy making and in the direction of the Department of Defence is a dangerous experiment.</P>
      <P>I have intervened for the purpose of making submissions which I think have some value and of reiterating the principle that the Department of Defence and matters pertaining thereto should not and must not become in this Parliament the exclusive prerogative of ex-soldiers.  Their experience in the service of the Army will be valuable in considering matters in relation to the Army but we must bear in mind that men who have served in the Army and who have seen it function close up very often get a somewhat distorted view. The degree of distortion is, of course, proportionate to the soldiers' or officers' experience in the Army.  The claim of some of them to an exclusive prerogative in discussing the Defence Force is often commensurate with the Army's anxiety to see the end of their military career.  Bearing these considerations in mind, I am sure the House will be glad to hear not only the views of the most unlikely ex-soldiers but I would hope of the most confirmed and unrepentant civilian Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Running right through the speech which we have just heard from Deputy Dillon has been a gospel of surrender and defeatism. What is his suggestion for an army? It is that 100 units containing 100 men each should be trained as guerrillas and that they should fight just long enough for the British or Americans to come in, that they should put up a show and that the Americans or the British may fight our battles for us. The guerrilla tactics which he suggests are all right in their own place.  These tactics have generally been used by an army which has been overcome to the extent that a large part of its country is occupied by a hostile force. We had experience of guerrilla tactics in this country during the period from 1916 to 1921, when we fought a campaign by this means against a force which occupied our country.  During the last war, in France and in other countries which had been overrun, guerrilla tactics were adopted by patriotic bands.  Running right through Deputy Dillon's speech this evening was not the policy of an independent country maintaining its independence, but the policy of a country surrendering its independence and putting up a show, just as a temporary measure, until its new conquerors arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He tells us that Russia is the only country that may attack us.  He speaks thus, bearing in mind the fact that portion of our own territory is occupied by the armed forces of another nation and that, during the last emergency, it was occupied by the armed forces of two other nations who, he suggests, here this evening will be our saviours in the event of another world conflict. We remember the dignified protest made by the present Taoiseach when the American forces landed in part of our national territory during the last war without the authority of our Government. That country did not think very much about our protest then, but occupied our national territory in spite of it.  It is well known that there were periods of grave danger during the last war when it was possible that American forces might have crossed the Border and occupied the remainder of our country.  Yet Deputy Dillon suggests that we must look to those <Col N="495" /> nations for deliverance in the event of our being invaded by the Russians. Can we visualise the situation that would arise if the Russians started to land on our coasts or to land from planes in the sky?  What would have happened to France, to Belgium and to those other countries that are in alliance with Britain and America, not to defend Europe on the Rhine, but, in the event of war, to go right into the heart of Russia?  What would the situation be if the Russians were landing on our coasts or on our territory from the sea?  Deputy Dillon's 100 units of 100 men each would be striving to keep them back and to hold on until the Americans and the British, then beaten out of Europe with their allies, came in by the back door to save us. The whole situation, in the event of another world war, is too appalling for that sort of nonsense to be tolerated in this House.</P>
    <P>Whatever vulgar abuse Deputy Dillon may use against me does not, for one moment, affect me personally.  I do not mind it.  I have got so used to vulgar abuse over a number of years that the type I get from Deputy Dillon does not matter now.  Running right through the Deputy's speech this evening was a criticism of the Defence Forces&mdash;a criticism of the Army General Staff, a criticism of the officers of the Army who have devoted their lives to building up the Army, and a criticism of everybody that has been connected with its building up.  Personally, I am proud to have given a number of years of my life to the building up of the Army in this country.  There are men in this House who devoted their lives, not only to the establishment of the State, but to the building up of the Army, and I feel that it is a contemptible thing that a person like Deputy Dillon should express criticism in this House, in the manner in which he has expressed it, of the Army.  Having joined the Fine Gael Party recently, he dare not express openly in front of General MacEoin what he really thinks about the Army.  However, when he talks about the Army play-acting in their battalions in Malahide with sprigs of trees in their caps, it is criticism <Col N="496" /> of the Army in another way, and criticism which he hopes will escape General MacEoin's detection.  He criticises the arms that have been brought in here.  The preliminary arrangements for such purchases, it has been claimed, were made by Deputy Dillon's colleagues in the inter-Party Government&mdash;Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy MacEoin.  They were looking for armaments here, there and everywhere.  They said in this House, I do not know how true it is, that they made the prelimmary arrangements to send a mission to Sweden. The fact that that mission was successful has been criticised here by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is old enough to have served his country in arms on a number of occasions.  Deputy Dillon has never served it in arms and he has nothing but contempt for the people who have served it in arms.  During the last war he wanted us to give up our policy of neutrality and to come in on the side of Britain against the Germans.  Now he wants us to come in on the side of Britain and America, to become part of that partnership, so that if there is a third world war we will engage in it.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have been in this House for many years have heard that famous speech about the Cominform from Deputy Dillon.  It is almost a recitation with him now.  Most people in the world to-day who are alive to the seriousness of another world war, to the danger to civilisation and to humanity itself, are endeavouring to see by what means war can be avoided or stopped.  Not so Deputy Dillon. He wants us to give up our policy of neutrality, a policy which was carried through during the last war in spite of Deputy Dillon, and which I hope in the event of another world war, will be carried through by this country also in spite of Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>If there is a third world war, even if we decide on a policy of neutrality as being the proper policy to adopt, and even if that policy of ours is respected by the belligerents, it will be very difficult to avoid the consequences of the war.  If atom bombs are used, there is the possibility that atom <Col N="497" /> bombs dropped on the western coast of England may affect us, even though we are neutral, and even though our neutrality is respected.  It is a horrible prospect.  It is horrible to think that men, women and children in Dublin may be destroyed by atom bombs dropped in Britain, and not intended to fall on us.</P>
    <P>Statesmen everywhere should endeavour to see how war can be avoided rather than to adopt the line of Deputy Dillon that war is inevitable and that, if war comes, we must line up and must bear the brunt of atomic weapons.</P>
    <P>The nonsensical suggestion to have 100 units of 100 men each can be seen in its proper perspective if one looks far enough forward.  Deputy Dillon is not looking very far forward.  He has suggested here this evening that there is no hope of this country defending itself.  When physical force was suggested as a national policy by the Volunteers, prior to 1916, it was the idea of the old Parliamentary Party at that time that it was absurd.  Logically, of course, it could be proved that this country could not with any measure of success engage in a war with Britain.  Similarly, when we did achieve a measure of freedom, when we set up our own institutions and our own Army, we were told all the time by the know-alls, the Deputy Dillons of that time, that neutrality was impossible in another war.  We proved that Deputy Dillon and those people with him on that were wrong just as we proved that the older Dillons were wrong, prior to 1916 and in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>We can prove, too, that in the event of a third world war&mdash;which I hope will not eventuate&mdash;it would be possible to maintain a policy of neutrality. The world in the last 20 years has come to regard Ireland as a country that will keep clear of the warring camps. Switzerland is another country whose neutrality has been respected all the years.  Many wars have passed Switzerland by.  Switzerland's policy of neutrality has been accepted.  If the world does engage in a third world war, I hope that we will be able to keep out of it so that when it is all over <Col N="498" /> and when the world is a shambles, we will be able to do something to start it going again.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is less talk of war in Britain now than there was some years back.  Britain is beginning to realise her position if war should come.  The people of every city in Europe, particularly those that have experienced the bloc-bombing of the last war, have some idea of what atomic bombing will be in the next war.  Men of goodwill everywhere are endeavouring, or should be endeavouring, to see how war can be avoided and not on what side we will fight if war should come.</P>
    <P>I understood that it was the policy of the Department of Defence, the policy of the Defence Council, in all the years to build up the forces of this country on the basis that they will defend the country against any invader, in other words that they will establish and maintain a policy of neutrality.  To maintain a policy of neutrality requires just the same organisation of our manpower as a war policy would require.  In fact it would be much easier, if our policy were war, to organise our Defence Forces than it is to organise our Defence Forces to maintain a policy of neutrality, because in maintaining a policy of neutrality every individual in the country who is able to fight must be organised for that purpose.  We must make it clear to the belligerents on both sides that they just cannot walk in here and use this island as they would wish in their own interest. We must guarantee to both sets of belligerents that we shall maintain our neutrality and that we shall keep out not only one side but the other side as well.</P>
    <P>If our policy is to be simply a policy of war, then we shall do as Deputy Dillon says&mdash;enter into the North Atlantic Pact and guarantee them one division.  Probably they may not want even one division but we shall build up that division and contribute it to the joint forces of the nations organised under that particular Pact.  That is what Deputy Dillon suggests.  What he has suggested this evening is that we should base our defence policy on a <Col N="499" /> pretence of fight, while our friends from the United States under the Stars and Stripes are landing to protect us.  They did land to protect the South Koreans.  That unfortunate country has been torn upside down by war for the last couple of years.  If there is any civilian living in it now, I would be very much surprised.  We see these horrible photographs of young children and old men blasted to bits with bombs.  Is that the sort of thing we want?  Do we want to invite any nation in here to protect us, so that we shall be a target for every conceivable type of modern weapon that the other side can drop on us or explode against us?  I say that anyone who suggests that is suggesting a traitorous policy for this country.  We had in Norway during the last war men who thought in that way, who brought in their friends, the Germans, to take over control in Norway, to protect Norway against possible invasion by the British and the French.  History has provided a contemptible name for them&mdash;Quislings.  We want no Quislings in this country, no Quisling in this Parliament, and the sooner that is made clear the better.  Our policy&mdash; and it must be a specific policy&mdash;must be a policy of neutrality, the policy of maintaining our own civilisation in spite of the madness of the world and then, when it is all over, we may be able to contribute something to the reconstruction of what is left.</P>
    <P>I had no intention when coming in here this evening of speaking on these lines.  Had I such an intention I would have got my friend, Senator Hartnett, to prepare my speech as Deputy Dillon suggests.  I intended to speak just on a few matters and I shall mention them quickly now.  I have noticed in the columns of some newspapers circulating in this country for a long period now, aerial photographs of sections of the country.  I have seen these published in the <i>Independent</i> and in the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  When we were discussing the new Defence Bill, one of the matters which came up for consideration was this question of photography and the dangers inherent in photographs of particular features of the country.  What is the idea behind <Col N="500" /> the publication of these aerial photographs? Why are these aerial photographs of our cities, towns and harbours being taken and being published? Is there any ulterior purpose behind that?  I should like to know what is being done by the Department of Defence in regard to it.  If it is not an offence to take these photographs and publish them now, it should be made an offence immediately.  If it is an offence now, then the machinery of the law should be operated because I consider the publication of these photographs of our cities, towns and villages, and particularly important parts of our countryside, is dangerous and can be of tremendous help to a Power that might wish to invade this country, either as friends or as enemies.  I should like the Minister to deal with that specially when he is concluding.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister refer to the success of his recruiting campaign.  That recruiting campaign was necessary if our permanent force were to be built up to the strength that would enable it to provide the instructors required for the non-permanent force.  I was particularly glad of the decision of the Minister to recruit boys younger than 18 years of age.  I have seen these boys in the Curragh and in Athlone as I was passing through.  They are smart, intelligent-looking young men who will, I am perfectly certain, make excellent soldiers and instructors. For those who were in on the ground floor, as it were, when the Army was being started, it is a grand thing to see these young boys, many of them not so much younger than the soldiers who started the Army 30 years ago, not so very much younger than men who did their part in the fight against Britain a couple of years earlier, having all the qualities that will make for excellent soldiers.  I sincerely hope that every opportunity will be given to them to perfect their military knowledge so that they will become instructors and leaders in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the discussion of this Estimate in the past few years I put forward, and Deputy Major de Valera put <Col N="501" /> forward the suggestion to the Minister that officers who retire from the Defence Forces on pension should not have their valuable services and experiences lost to the country.  The Minister should make provision whereby those officers would be retained on the strength of the Defence Forces so that in the event of emergency their valuable services in specially assigned appointments would be available to the State.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the effect that war may have on this country, even though we are neutral and our neutrality is respected, I referred to the possibility of death and destruction in our cities coming from atom bombs dropped on Britain.  That situation must be faced up to.  The new civilian defence force which has been organised must make all necessary arrangements to avoid as far as possible the great number of deaths which would inevitably follow if no arrangements were made.  Military experts, I think, agree that there is very little protection against the atom bomb.  But, in the sort of situation where we would get the backwash, as it were, of atomic weapons, it is quite possible that deaths and destruction can be avoided by transfer of population. That is something which this new civilian defence organisation must study and make arrangements for.  If an atom bomb were dropped on Dublin City, no one can visualise what damage and destruction it could do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the horrible prospect of war.  That is why we ought to make it clear that we will not engage in a war and why everything we can do as a civilised nation should be done to persuade madmen in other countries not to plunge the world into war.  But, if we remain neutral, there is very little likelihood of atom bombs being dropped on us.  Our civilian defence organisation, however, should make provision for the protection of our people against the backwash of atomic bombs being dropped elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in very close contact with the Army over a great number of years.  I know that the officers and <Col N="502" /> soldiers have their grouses, as officers and soldiers elsewhere have.  But, looking at it in a broad general way over all the years, I know that our General Staff has now reached a stage when the officers who comprise it are the equal of any officers holding equivalent appointments anywhere else in the world.  Having read a considerable number of the authentic stories of what happened in the first world war and in the second world war, I have no doubt that our officers, in professional training and in sound common sense, will not be surpassed by officers of equal rank anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I believe that when they put forward their suggestions for the defence and protection of this State to the Government, the Government are getting sound advice from men competent to give that advice.  I am prepared to take that advice any day rather than the advice of Deputy Dillon, whose whole ambition seems to be to dispose of this country by sale to somebody, whether it was to Britain in the past or to America now.  I feel that as the people of this country had contempt for Deputy Dillon's views over the last 30 years they will have contempt for his views on this matter of the sale of the country now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that talk should ever arise in this Parliament about the sale of the country. It is no help to the defence of the country to make any such statement.  However, it is a free Parliament and we are entitled to express our views, and I suppose it is only reasonable that views will be expressed with which other people are bound to disagree.  I do not propose to follow up the speech which has just been delivered.  Deputy Dillon is capable of defending himself, if defence is required.  Therefore, I propose to address myself to the Vote before the House and to discharge what I regard as the primary duty of any Deputy, namely, that we get the best value for the money that is utilised in the defence of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to learn from the Minister's speech that, while he has increased the strength of the Regular Army, our Second and Third Line Reserves have diminished considerably.  That is a <Col N="503" /> pity, because I have no hesitation in saying that the defence of this country lies more with the forces outside the regular forces than with the regular forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean to rely on the loyalty of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and on the strength of the forces we can put into the field if and when required.  If the Minister for Defence and the Headquarters Staff are satisfied that 12,500 men are sufficient to give us ample protection, then I am satisfied that this expenditure should be on 12,500 men.  Of course, the Minister has not said that.  He does say that 12,500 are better than 5,700 or 7,500.  I admit that 15,000 would be better than 12,000 and 20,000 would be better still. From the way the Vote has been presented and because of the manner in which Government speakers have spoken we can take it that 12,500 is regarded as the safety margin and that anything below that figure is inadequate. That is the implication of the Minister's speech.  At a time when we had 7,500 men we had over 30,000 in the F.C.A.  That was a fairly effective force.  We had the Second Line and Third Line Reserve.  The Minister now tells us that these have diminished. Certainly the money that is being spent on them is considerably less.  I would prefer to see a Volunteer force in the nature of the F.C.A., and a reserve rather than any large standing Army.  Times change and individuals change with the times.  On one occasion I heard the present Head of the Government declare that this country could be well and truly defended by a Volunteer force costing no more than £1,000,000 and that it was a shame and a disgrace to spend a farthing more.  That was his view. I will not tie him to it to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting. I am paraphrasing.  If the Minister denies that was said I will get the reference, but the Minister can take it I am not saying something the Taoiseach did not say.  I hope that our Army will be as effective a defence force as the country can afford and that care will be exercised in the expenditure arising in connection with the training of that force.  I notice that transport costs have jumped by £65,000.  Petrol and oil show an increase of £55,000 over last year. These are substantial sums.</P>
      <P>There is a rather peculiar situation in relation to the Army.  At no matter what figure the military personnel stands, the civilian end of it always goes up.  It is still steadily increasing. There is one civilian for every eight members of the defence forces.  The expenditure upon civilian employment reaches the enormous figure of £770,000.  I admit the civilians are very efficient.  They ought to be.  Is not that a very extraordinary situation?  I was in the Army when we had 50,000 actually serving in it and we had not one-fifth of the present number of civilians. As the Army grows smaller the civilian side of it grows larger.  In the event of hostilities I do not know where those civilians will fit in.  They are not under military command.  We might find ourselves faced with the extraordinary position of seeing the Army march one way and the civilians march the other.  That does not commend itself to me.  Had I been Minister for any length of time I would have taken steps to have that situation reviewed.  If the soldier personnel received the same rate of wages as the civilian personnel because of being experts in a particular job, they would still wear the uniform.</P>

      <P>Yes.  On the question of neutrality, we all know that this country has no aggressive intentions.  It never had.  That is why we call the Army the Defence Forces. <Col N="505" /> We have no intention whatever of invading any country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Our Army is for defence only.  That is the most difficult role any army can fulfil.  If we had a policy of aggression we would have no trouble in finding allies to help us in defending ourselves.  It is not easy to get anybody to come to our aid, because no one will come merely for the love of us.  They will come to protect themselves in some particular way.  I do not subscribe to the view expressed by Deputy Captain Cowan that we would not accept aid if we were attacked.  I would be surprised to learn that that is the policy of the Government, or that it was their policy during the last war.  Of course we would be prepared to accept help from somebody else.</P>
      <P>Again, the present head of the Government is on record as saying that our policy of neutrality during that time was a friendly neutrality towards certain nations.  I think he was right in saying that.  Therefore, let us not be taken as accepting the view that was expressed here that we do not want aid from anybody.  We do, if we are attacked, but let us hope that the necessity will not arise.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost importance that the resources of the State should be mobilised to their full extent to defend our neutrality and to defend our rights against all aggressors, whoever they might be, and that our programme and policy would be such that they will have the support of all the people of the country, no matter what section, creed or class they belong to: that, no matter how we may differ amongst ourselves, if the necessity arises, each one of us can stand shoulder to shoulder as we did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let me remind the Deputy who has just gone out and who said that Deputy Dillon had never worn the uniform, that the head of the Government thanked Deputy Dillon for his part in the Defence Conference.  When Deputy Dillon offered to serve in any capacity that was thought desirable, <Col N="506" /> he was advised to remain in his civilian capacity.  I do not like to see a Minister of the State who has the facts at his disposal sitting and listening to an attack of that type being made upon a colleague of that Defence Conference which did so much good for the country during the last emergency. I think that a Minister should intervene when a member of the Council of State and of the Defence Conference was being attacked like that as if he had done something that was dishonourable or that was treacherous to the nation, particularly when that was not so.  I think the Minister should have taken steps to defend that person's honour, no matter what Party he belonged to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the Chair and not Deputy de Valera or the Minister.  I asserted before that Deputy Dillon is well able to defend himself.  I think I am entitled to express a view as to what I think should be the policy and attitude of the Minister and the Government in this House.  I can safely say that, on one momentous occasion.  I could have sat and not have done something, but yet because I thought truth and honesty demanded it, I did.  That was commended by everyone.  Very few, however, follow that example when it relates to others.  Is it not time, on the question of defence, that that spirit should prevail?  When small incidents arise from time to time I think there should be no mud slinging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the reduction of the First Line Reserve by 20 per cent.  I think the Minister should do everything possible to take up on the Second Line. I think the money voted for that purpose will be well spent.  Administration, I think, comes under this Vote.  On that, I think that the Minister and the Government, and the Army Headquarters if they had any responsibility for it, are to blame in connection with the demonstration which was given <Col N="507" /> recently of new equipment and bomb throwers that were purchased.  Invitations were sent out to the military personnel of other countries, the newspaper men and to all and sundry to attend that demonstration.  We had, on this side of the House, people who would like to see the demonstration as it related to something which they had done themselves.  Yet, no invitation was sent to them.</P>

      <P>With regard to this demonstration of new arms, my predecessor and myself had some part in the purchase of them.  I am not going to argue whether I bought them or whether the Minister bought them. They were purchased by the Army. When the demonstration was given, invitations were sent to the Americans, to the British and to the newspaper people.  There was no invitation to any member of the Opposition or to any member of the House.  We would like to know what improvements have been made since last year. The Americans know all about it now, and the British know, but Deputy Hickey, Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Cowan do not know the first thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if that is the right line to adopt?  I do not think it is one that Deputies should approve of.  I am seriously interested, and so is every Irishman, in the Defence Forces of this State as well as in its defence. I would like to take part in viewing <Col N="508" /> and in being informed, as regards the development of the new arms.  I am glad to know that these arms are a success.  They were paid for out of the last Vote and the previous Vote. Let us hope that the demonstration which was given to the Americans and the British was effective.  At least, they will know that they will have something to contend with if they, instead of people from behind the Iron Curtain, think of invading us.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Vote is being taken separately.  I suppose the other Votes will be moved immediately afterwards. There are many things to be said about military service pensions and disability pensions.  It was customary, I know, to debate all these things upon the one Vote.  This is the first time, in a long period, that the Vote for the Department of Defence has been debated separately, and I presume that the time will be made available to discuss the other matters.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if he is satisfied with the Army jumping team.  I feel it should have every consideration and attention from the Minister; it has helped to put the Irish Army on the map as far as the international situation is concerned.  I would be glad to know from the Minister if he is satisfied with the material in the horses and with the training they are getting.  Perhaps the Minister would give us more information on that subject.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying a few words on the question of war-like stores.  As my colleague, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, has said, the Minister has very great difficulties to overcome in this matter. We know what they are, and we wish him every success in overcoming them, because he has not got an easy problem. In my opinion, there is considerable overestimation for this item, in view of the fact that a very substantial sum has been paid on account out of last year's Estimate for some of the stores that might become available. I presume that the increases in various other items were necessary because of the increase in the Army personnel and that, therefore, we must accept them.</P>
    <P>We hope and pray that peace will be the order of the day.  During the <Col N="509" /> régime of the inter-Party Government both my predecessor in office and myself worked upon a programme of peace, up to a certain extent, and then, due to the pressure brought upon us by the then Opposition, that we should stockpile and put in more stores, we were required to change our tactics.  The present Government are working on the assumption that war is likely to come, and that they mean to be ready for it.  Let us hope they are wrong and that war will not come, and let us hope that our plan was the better one.  It is only a question of opinion at the moment as to whether it was or not, and time alone will tell. If war does come, then it is doubtful if we have made sufficient provision. On the other hand, if peace is maintained for any great length of time, it will have to be admitted that the expenditure was a very high one.  However, I assert that it was well worth it, because, at least, it was an insurance policy for the defence of the nation in so far as the State could afford it, and in so far as the Government of the day thought fit.  A nation that is made up of the Deputy Dillons, the Deputy Cowans and the Deputies on all sides of the House is our native country.  No matter what anybody may say to the contrary, it is astounding how, if the time came, we would stand shoulder to shoulder in its defence. May it ever be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to things being said in this House this evening which, in my opinion, should not have been said, as far as the defence and the safety of our country are concerned.  One would get the impression that we were all preparing for war, though against whom nobody could tell us.  Deputy Dillon told us that if another war took place it would originate with the Cominform.  I feel we should go back a little into history and ask ourselves who started the 1914-18 war and who started the 1939 second world war.  I think everybody will agree with me that it was not the Cominform who initiated either of those two wars.  If we have a third world war, I feel that it will be capitalism and its ramifications throughout the world that will be responsible <Col N="510" /> for it.  I assert that with the loyalty and determination of our people and with an efficient Army we can look to the future with hope.  I do not believe in having a big Army.  Rather do I believe in having the most efficient Army possible with a Volunteer force behind it and with every resource in the country mobilised to support and defend it, if the time should come when it would be called into action. I am opposed to spending a further £1,000,000 on our Army; if we were to spend a further £1,000,000 or even a further £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in providing food, houses and a better standard of living for our people I believe we would have very strong support for our efficient Army.  I do not believe there is any great case to be made for having 12,000 or 20,000 soldiers to defend our country.</P>
      <P>It is rather strange that we should be told that a third world war is imminent. There are some people who would try to get us into this war.  Two hundred and fifty thousand Irishmen volunteered to fight for small nations in the 1914-18 war; that was one in eight of the country's population; 50,000 of them were killed&mdash;one in 40 of the population&mdash;and the remainder of them came home.  We were then told that the freedom of small nations did not apply to Ireland.  Are we to be allowed by some people to be complacent enough to think that the next world war will be fought on behalf of small nations?  I think the less talk we have about the international situation and the ramifications of capitalists the better it will be for this country and for the people of the country.  Let us stand clear of all armies and do what we can for ourselves in our own way.</P>
      <P>When I hear all this talk from Deputy Cowan and from Deputy Dillon I begin to have still more regard and still more respect for the men who went out in 1916 to challenge the greatest empire in the world, and the more I salute the dead of this country and the men who are still alive&mdash;some of them Ministers and some ex-Ministers&mdash;who fought for this country in those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the inter-Party Government's <Col N="511" /> term of office Deputy de Valera was asking questions across the House as to what preparations we were making for war and as to what stores we were buying in.  On one occasion, when I told him that I never heard such bluff, he said, in reply, that he was calling my bluff. I want to be serious with the Taoiseach and with every member of this House.  Let us be serious with the Irish people.  Our Army is not strong enough but let us make it more efficient by building up a Volunteer force behind it.  Let us spend money in the provision of food, homes, and a decent standard of living for our people.  There are thousands of them homeless and without sufficient food. Such a state of affairs will not generate any great enthusiasm or loyalty in case we are attacked by any outside force.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate on the resources that should be developed instead of spending extra money on the Army.  I could say more but I do not consider that mention should be made in this House of how our Army is constituted.  Having regard to all the questions that have been asked about the Army, we should know by now how many buttons the soldiers have on their uniforms.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with the administrative side of the Army.  I received a copy of the Appropriation Accounts during the past week.  There is a note by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of sub-head T&mdash; Military Lands&mdash;to the effect that a dwelling-house with approximately two and a half acres of land was purchased in 1948 for the sum of £4,400, and was occupied by an officer from October. 1948, to November, 1949, when it was vacated owing to its bad state of repair.  The cost of rendering the building suitable for reoccupation was estimated at £3,000 and the work was not proceeded with.  I would like to know from the Minister when he is replying who are the people responsible for the inspection of these premises and if they are still in the employment of the Army or the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a paragraph by the Comptroller <Col N="512" /> and Auditor-General in respect of sub-head Y (2)&mdash;The Reserve&mdash;to the effect that negotiations for the acquisition of premises for the accommodation of a local unit of An Fórsa Cosanta Aitiúil were opened in September, 1946, but, owing mainly to delay in connection with the investigation of title, the purchase was not completed until May, 1950, when a sum of £950 was paid.  The paragraph states that the premises were reported to be structurally sound when examined in September, 1946, but, in October, 1948, the local authority complained that the walls at one side had sagged and subsequent engineering reports confirmed the existence of the structural defect.  In April, 1950, when it was estimated that repairs to permit of a limited use of the premises would cost £1,400, it was decided to dispose of them, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General states that he understands that an offer of £400 has been accepted.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister who was responsible for that type of work in the Army and if he considers that those who are responsible for reporting on buildings like that are worthy of employment in the Army or in the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will explain how these things can happen in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have something in mind for that, too.  Now I wish to raise a matter which I raised here prior to 1943, about the land in Fermoy for which we are paying £224 a year rent and on which the members of our Defence Forces cannot play football or hurling.  In 1939 the present Minister was prosecuted by a group of people known as the Fermoy Trust Limited for trespass because soldiers were playing football and hurling on this land. The case went to the Circuit Court and the Minister won it.  The case was appealed and the Minister lost the appeal and had to pay a fine.  I suggested at that time, and I suggest now, that the Minister should pursue <Col N="513" /> that matter to its logical conclusion. He should acquire the land and have it in the control of the State, so that the soldiers could play football and hurling on that land.  I suggest that that land, for which we pay £224 a year, should have been in the possession of the Government long before now.  If legislation is required to deal with the matter, the Minister should not hesitate to bring in the necessary legislation. I raised the matter and was told: &ldquo;The British had a lease which we took over.  It is not an agreement made by our Department and, if you like, it is a liability taken over by us from the British War Office and it is a question whether we will surrender the lease or acquire the land completely.&rdquo; I am suggesting to the Minister that it is time legislation was brought in to ensure that we have command of the land in Fermoy or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>Is it true that the money we are paying for that land, £224 a year, is a Napoleonic pension to somebody? I would ask the Minister to explain that because, if we have a feeling of pride for the men who sacrificed their lives, without expecting pensions or anything else, in order to secure the political and economic independence of the country, it is time these matters were rectified.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to indicate that the lands in question will be taken over by the State, so that we will not have to pay £224 for the use of this land, on which our soldiers cannot play football or hurling.</P>
      <P>We have an Army that could take its place anywhere in the world.  I am not prepared to admit that it is wise to spend the money we are spending beyond what we have been spending for the last number of years.  I am prepared to give the Army anything that they require to make them still more efficient.  In the matter of ammunition let us not depend on anybody outside the country, if we can make it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to understand why it is necessary to bring Americans, Britons or anybody else here to study our latest weapons of defence.  I am at a loss to understand it.  When we <Col N="514" /> fought the greatest empire in the world we had the loyalty and determination of the people behind us.  We can look with confidence to the loyalty and determination of our people. There should be less discussion of our Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate is due to the slight controversy between Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cowan as to the efforts that were being made in the past to secure a supply of warlike material for his country.  I am perfectly satisfied that all Parties in this House are anxious to defend or safeguard the freedom of this country.  I am satisfied that every effort has been made in the past to secure warlike stores from those countries from which it would be possible for us in the case of an outbreak of war to replenish our stores.  We should get down to facts in the House with regard to the limited opportunities we have at present of securing arms or warlike stores from Britain or America.</P>
      <P>I think we must accept it now that there is very little hope that this country can get, either from America or Britain, any decent quantity of war-like stores.  It is an amazing situation but that is the position as I see it. Ireland is looked upon as a country that is totally opposed to the régime that is at present in existence behind the Iron Curtain, and the present line-up in the world situation is that you are either for or against the type of rule that is imposed on nations behind the Iron Curtain.  In the event of another world conflagration, the struggle will lie between the nations on this side of the curtain and those subject to that type of rule which we all deplore.  It is known to the world that our sympathies are not with Russia and that we can be depended upon, if warlike stores are made available to us, to guard the liberty of this country to the utmost extent possible&mdash;but in spite of that being apparent to the nations in the West, and to America in particular, they still persist in their failure to supply us with the minimum amount of warlike material that would enable us to defend this country as it should be defended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I should like to put my views to the House as to the reasons why Britain in particular is not prepared to make available the equipment that we need. I think it should be quite clear now that the remarks of Mr. Churchill at the conclusion of the last war, when he spoke of Ireland's attitude during the war, govern Britain's position to-day. Mr. Churchill savagely attacked this country for the policy it pursued during the last war.  He was ably answered at the time by the then Taoiseach.  Mr. Churchill sought to suggest that it was the duty of this portion of Ireland which had achieved its freedom, to throw in its lot with Britain which still holds in subjection six of our counties.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any Party in Ireland was prepared at that time or since to accept the viewpoint put forward by Mr. Churchill, but it is quite apparent that the views then held by Mr. Churchill and his Party have not since changed, no matter what Government may have held office in Britain.  The belief is still present to the minds of members of the British Government and to the minds of British military heads that it is essential that Ireland be held in a weak position with regard to warlike stores, so that if necessity demanded it, on the part of Britain, she could jump into this portion of Ireland to-morrow morning and acquire airfields and ports for the use of her troops and her navy.  The sole reason why she is not prepared to make warlike stores available to Ireland is to ensure that, in the event of her being forced to take action against this country, we would not be in a position to use these stores and arms against her.  That is the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>In other words, the situation in this country to-day is just as dangerous as it was during the last war; it is quite possible that in our undefended state, this year, next year or the year after. Britain, if she felt like it and thought she would get away with it, in the event of a world war would attempt to land her troops here in Ireland and take over our airfields and our ports. It is the duty of this House to ensure <Col N="516" /> that all possible steps be taken to defend this country in the event of such action being taken by Britain or America.  That is why I endorse some of the remarks which I heard from Deputy Hickey.  If it is impossible to get warlike stores from abroad, then it is our duty, if we can possibly do so, to produce here in Ireland the type of equipment that would be useful for our defence.  I refer in particular to the manufacture of small arms and ammunition.  I think it is quite possible, even with our limited resources, to provide our full needs in small arms and ammunition.  I know that it is an impossibility for us to produce heavier armaments and we should forget about that, but I think that the possibility of setting up a factory here for the production of small arms should be seriously considered by the Government, in view of the fact that it is impossible to get proper material from outside sources.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say whether it was wise or otherwise to purchase warlike materials from Sweden.  I have not any information at my disposal in regard to that matter, but there is a rumour abroad that the particular source from which the present warlike stores have been procured has now dried up and that there is little or no possibility of getting extra supplies, replacements or further quantities of ammunition from that particular source.  It has been further suggested that the type of ammunition for certain of the weapons imported is not suitable for the type of armament at present being used by the United Nations. If that is the case, then the amount we have purchased would last for a very limited time, and I think we could throw all the weapons and the war-like materials we have procured on the refuse heap.  However, I should like the Minister to assure us that in the purchase of these stores, from Sweden in particular, steps were taken to ensure that a continous supply of supplementary material would be made available, if we desired to purchase it.</P>
    <P>The question of the type of training suitable for our Army was mentioned by Deputy Dillon.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon has any actual <Col N="517" /> experience of Army training but, whether he has that experience or not, he is quite right in suggesting that our Army should train to a great extent on guerrilla lines.  If we have a standing Army of 12,000 men and are subjected to an invasion by air from any part of the world, that invading force will consist of the toughest troops in the world armed with the most modern weapons. In addition to that, it is likely that heavy artillery, heavy tanks and so forth can be dropped here by air overnight. Is it seriously suggested that a small but well-trained and efficient Army should face that type of invasion <i>en masse</i>?  We must forget here in Ireland thinking in terms of divisions and armies.  We have not got the men or the heavy material to equip them.  If we have not got the men and the material, then we shall have to improvise and adapt ourselves to the situation.</P>
    <P>I think that old soldiers in this House will agree with me that guerrilla tactics in the past in this country proved very successful, and it is to a great extent on guerrilla tactics that any hope can be held out that this country can save itself or hold the enemy off until suitable help from outside arrives.  I am speaking now from practical experience, even though I was a very junior member of the Army. I often felt rather foolish during manoeuvres when we talked in terms of divisions, of the battalion on your left, the battalion on your right and the battalion in reserve.  Very often you had ten men in the battalion in reserve and one man representing the battalion on your right.  That is not facing facts, and is not helpful to troops on manoeuvres.</P>
    <P>I actually had an experience during one set of manoeuvres of having the duty of laying down mines over a certain area.  I must confess that the type of work I was engaged in was the setting of 25 lb. anti-tank mines over a large area of tactical positions.  I had a number of lorries under my control which were filled with circular blocks of timber with a cross painted on them, which represented 25 lb. anti-tank mines.  The troops under my control took these off the lorries and placed <Col N="518" /> them as they were told.  That, to my mind, is very foolish.  I hope that the Minister will not take me up wrongly when I bring these things to his notice. I hope I am doing so in a helpful spirit, because I hate to see that type of sham taking place.  Let us deal with facts, not with myths so far as the size of the Army and its training are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You would expect that the mines would be available for use.  It was quite possible to lay down as many of these dummy mines as you liked without having regard to the number of real mines which it would be necessary to put down.  In addition to that I should like to direct the Minister's attention to a type of training which has taken place in the Army since 1940.  We always seem to be in the position that we want to imitate what the British Army does. I do not think it is wrong for our officers to go abroad on training courses.  That is necessary so that they may have the most up-to-date knowledge of developments in Great Britain, France, and elsewhere.  But I do think that when we start to train our own troops we should pick the most suitable aspects of that training given to our officers abroad rather than accept in full the type of training in operation in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to give concrete examples of that to the Minister.  When the so-called commandos were formed in Great Britain they were all the rage there and proved highly successful. The training that these men got was harsh in the extreme.  Our Army authorities decided to find out all about this commando training and a number of officers were sent to learn the full details of the type of training and tacties involved.  When the first commando course was held in Ireland I had the doubtful privilege of being on it and I had the doubtful privilege of acting as instructor on most of the courses afterwards for officers and N.C.O.s.  The hardships that had to be endured at that time were such <Col N="519" /> that to-day many of these men are crippled with rheumatism and similar complaints.  A number of doctors have told me that the majority of their patients were ex-Army men.  Commando training at that period was so harsh that the officers and men were expected to undergo conditions similar to those in actual warfare.  They were expected to stay out for days without suitable clothing, to swim rivers in the middle of winter and to run for miles like greyhounds; and they did it. They responded magnificently to that training and I do not think you could get a finer body of men in any army. However, the craze for that type of training died down.  In Great Britain it was found that it was a wrong thing to put men to the utmost limit of endurance except when under actual fire or when the necessity arose.  It was a wrong thing and no man should have been asked to give his utmost until the crisis came.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the position further discussed with the legal advisers and they are strongly against the amendment suggested here.  They say that if the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is used in this Bill some ambiguity may arise. From a legal point of view, in order to <Col N="520" /> eliminate the risk of ambiguity, it would be necessary to define the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the Bill and that would be very objectionable.  The normal practice here for a number of years past since the enactment of the Constitution has, in fact, been to use the expression &ldquo;State&rdquo; in legislation. The name of the State is, of course, Ireland, and there will be no problem whatever of the kind the Deputy thought might arise in directing tourist publicity so as to attract or advise people to spend their holidays in Ireland.  If we were to amend the section it would be necessary to make various consequential amendments throughout the Bill because the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; is also used in other parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I may say in this connection that the previous Government circularised all Government Departments and statutory bodies advising them to use the term &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; wherever the State was being described, and wherever that term could be used without risk of ambiguity, and to use the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; wherever there was a risk of ambiguity.  I think that was good advice, and it would be well not to complicate the practice now by introducing a change at this stage.  There are numerous statutes in which this patricular phrase is used for the precise reason that it is used here.</P>

That matter was under discussion on the Committee Stage.  I can find in the Bill no statutory provision enabling the board to appoint an agent in that way.  On the contrary, there is in the Bill a provision by which the board may act through its advisers, servants, etc.  In those circumstances, I submit we are entitled to put down <Col N="521" /> this amendment for the purpose at any rate of getting the position clarified.

That matter having arisen in that way on the discussion, surely I am now entitled to relate it by tangible means to some section of the Bill.

      <P>In page 14, Section 48, to delete line 23.</P>
      <P>I am sure the majority of the members of the house will agree with me in proposing that between the hours of 12 and 3 on Good Friday, which include the hours 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock mentioned in the original Bill, it is only right and proper that no public-house should be open for the consumption of drink, and no holiday camp or indeed any place where drink is consumed.  I feel that the Minister will accept the amendment. I have no objection to the other hours mentioned.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to pose as a spoil sport and neither do I want to pose as a purist.  It would be wrong and immoral, I think, to encourage the consumption of drink between the hours of 12 o'clock and 3 on Good Friday.  Most of us in this and in other countries profess to be Christians.  It was during those hours on Good Friday that Our Lord said: &ldquo;I Thirst.&rdquo; Therefore, I suggest we should not encourage the consumption of drink in any camp on Good Friday.  I hope the Minister will agree that between 1 o'clock and 3 o'clock on Good Friday there will be a complete close down.  I am not making any proposal with regard to St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Day or the other days mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment in respect of which I will be influenced by the opinion of the Dáil.  The position is that under the existing law an hotel can serve drink at any time on Good Friday to a resident.  The holiday camps to which this section refers are a form of hotel.  I was merely proposing to give them a limited right to serve drink on Good Friday, that is to persons who are having lunch in the camp on that day.  The effect of the amendment is to prevent residents of holiday camps getting drinks with a lunch on Good Friday.</P>

      <P>The proposal here is to <Col N="525" /> give the holiday camps, by a simplified procedure, certain restricted facilities for the sale of drink which they may get under the existing law by a more elaborate procedure.  It is true to say that a holiday camp is just a form of hotel.  Convenience and justice would suggest that the same law should apply to both.  I will admit that I was not applying the same law to both.  If there is a strong feeling in the House to get this amendment carried I will not resist that feeling.  I want to be frank with the House and say that is so because I think that, in practice, very few holiday camps will be open on Good Friday.</P>

      <P>In supporting the amendment, I would ask the Minister and the House to realise that two wrongs can never make a right.  The hotels, we are told, have the right to serve drink with a meal on this particular day which, so far as Christianity is concerned, is the outstanding day of the year.  We have no means of getting at the hotels under this Bill. At the same time, we should not extend whatever facilities they have to holiday camps.  I would ask the Minister to consider that the amendment is offered in the spirit that there should be no extension whatever of the facilities in respect of hotels to holiday camps.  Even in the case of hotels we know the abuses that can be committed when what is called a substantial meal is served.  As regards tourists coming to the country, I think we can claim that we have never tried to impose our religious belief on anyone.  As a nation, we have been tolerant in that respect.  I think that everyone in this country who respects the Christian ideals of life, irrespective of what religion they may hold, will agree with us when we say that tourists or others coming into these holiday camps should not have the opportunity of being able to get drink on Good Friday between the hours of 1 and 3 p.m.  That should also apply to residents in those places.</P>

      <P>On that question, there were one or two queries put to me during the Committee Stage discussion to which I should like to refer now. Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sweetman suggested that the use of the term &ldquo;expenses of formation&rdquo; in relation to local companies might have the effect of preventing the board from paying grants for purposes other than expenses arising directly from compliance with the provisions of the Companies Acts.  I am advised that the expression &ldquo;expenses of formation&rdquo; has no precise legal meaning in relation to the Companies Acts, and that the section as it stands will not preclude the board from giving grants to cover formation expenses such as printing, advertising, legal costs, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question was also asked as to whether the provisions of the Bill for separate pensions schemes for the staffs of An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte might affect the interchangeability of staff as between one board and the other.  I have considered that matter with some care.  First of all, may I say that I am satisfied that the legal interpretation of the Bill as it stands would not prevent the interchangeability of staff between the two boards and that nothing in the pensions schemes that may be provided under the Bill need have that effect?  Whether or not it was desirable to make a more precise and definite provision in relation to interchangeability was a matter that I considered and, on the whole, I hardly <Col N="527" /> think it is necessary or desirable.  Presumably, in the main, the staff of Fógra Fáilte will be experts in publicity work, chosen because of their competence in it and are not likely to be transferred to An Bord Fáilte for the work that the board will be engaged in, namely, hotel registration and other such matters.</P>
      <P>Similarly, those who are chosen as hotel inspectors for grading purposes are not likely to qualify to undertake the publicity work of An Fógra Fáilte. The position would only arise in connection with subordinate staff, such as typists, clerical workers, and so forth. There is nothing in the Bill which is going to prevent the complete interchangeability of staff on promotion from one section to another.  If there is any danger that the pensions scheme might work out to that effect indirectly I will take steps to make sure that there is nothing like that when the schemes are submitted for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is now going from us and the Minister knows, as far as we are concerned, that we consider Fógra Fáilte to be unnecessary and that it would have been possible for the Minister to have framed his Bill and his scheme without bringing it in.  However, Fógra Fáilte being included, I feel the Minister will agree with me when I say that, if the scheme is going to succeed to the fullest of its ability, it is essential that the work of An Bord Fáilte, of Fógra Fáilte, of the Irish Tourist Association and of the other local organisations should be knit together as closely as possible.  The Bill, as such, does not include any statutory provision in regard to a consultative council, and, therefore, though I am not allowed on the Fifth Stage of the Bill to urge that there should be such statutory provision, I feel I am permitted to urge on the Minister that a scheme for the development of the tourist business can only operate to the fullest and to the best advantage if there is the most complete liaison and harmony between An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Association and any other associations of a similar nature <Col N="528" /> throughout the country&mdash;associations which are doing good work, such as the Inniscrone one which was mentioned in this House on the Committee Stage of the Bill, and the Sligo one, which was also acknowledged here.  It is because I feel that so very strongly that I urge on the Minister to do all in his power, first of all, to ensure that there is no danger of the staffs of An Bord Fáilte and of Fógra Fáilte getting the feeling that they are working in different watertight compartments.  If they do not accept the point of view that they are all doing the same work for tourist development, then I am quite certain that we will not get the co-operative effort that is essential. As the Minister is aware, one of the objections I have to this Bill is that it is going to be difficult, by means of it, to keep the Irish Tourist Association alive.  Unless it is kept alive the country is going to lose one of the most invaluable methods of helping the tourist industry and the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister does a great deal, as did every other Minister who has been in his position, by his attendance at the annual ceremonies of the Irish Tourist Association.  However, in my view something more than that is needed.  I feel it would be extremely desirable if there were some discussion, at least once a year, between the members of An Bord Fáilte, the members of Fógra Fáilte, the directors of the Irish Tourist Association and the representatives of the large tourist associations throughout the country with the Minister presiding as chairman at the initiation of these discussions.  I feel it would do a lot to keep interest aroused in the Irish Tourist Association and in those other organisations.  I think the Ministers and the members of the two boards for which we are providing here would, in that way, get a slant on tourist business which, in the ordinary way, they would not get working purely from what I might term the official angle.  I have no doubt that a good many schemes would be put up that would not be entirely feasible. Yet, I feel, that a satisfactory percentage of what would be thrown up at a meeting like that would be worth <Col N="529" /> while.  One or two worthwhile suggestions would, undoubtedly, go a very substantial way towards ensuring that there would be harmony between all the various bodies and would bring them to the full realisation of the fact that they are all sectors of an industry travelling along the same road, and not trying to pull each other asunder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is a matter for satisfaction that, apart from the differences of opinion that developed amongest us on the desirability of having this joint board to direct tourist publicity work, the Bill as a whole has been favourably received by the Dáil. If we are going to get the effective development of the tourist trade, it will be because there is no disagreement amongest any section as to the advisability of doing so.  To a very great extent, the success of the development of the tourist industry depends upon our succeeding in convincing the people of this country that it is not merely practicable to develop that industry but also worth while doing so.</P>
      <P>I realised there might be some risk in our having two separate organisations; an element of rivalry might develop amongest them.  However, while I did not contemplate that rivalry as taking the form of any friction between the staffs any more than if these staffs were just separate parts of the organisation operated by one board, I thought there might be some disposition on behalf of each board to take over functions that might properly be the concern of the other and that there might be some pulling between them on that account.  I have tried, in personal discussion with the boards, to make it clear, and, in order to remove any misconception that there was, put into the Bill a section which says that Fógra Fáilte will direct its publicity activities in accordance with the general policy of An Bord Fáilte&mdash;the board that is responsible for the major strategy of the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Tourist Association, I invited the directors of the Tourist Association to regard themselves as having, apart from other functions, <Col N="530" /> the responsibility of acting as critics of An Bord Fáilte, Fógra Fáilte and, if needs be, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; to be ruthless in their criticism where they thought that that was required, either to stimulate these organisations into greater activity or correct any wrong trends that seemed to the Tourist Association to be developing in their work.</P>
    <P>I asked them also to regard themselves as the channel by which the views and suggestions, criticisms and proposals of the public, and particularly of the local authorities from which they draw their main strength, would be conveyed to the Minister and to these official organisations.</P>
    <P>I think that there is always a danger that statutory boards such as we are setting up here, such as we have under other legislation, may withdraw within themselves and have insufficient contact with the general body of the people and that it will be a help to these bodies here, just as it might be a help to other statutory boards, if they have regular contact with such an organisation as the Tourist Association, an organisation which has directors drawn from the local authorities and can hear from them what the public are thinking of them and their work. That is why I would hope that the Tourist Association would continue to function, would continue to get the support of the local authorities and so develop as to regard it as its major function in the scheme of things to stimulate public interest in this whole business of tourist development and then, by their contact with the public, act as the official critics of the statutory organisation.  I think the Tourist Association have a useful job of work to do in that field and that, if they do that job of work, it will help the whole scheme of tourist development.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the type of training in the Army during the emergency period.  I indicated the very harsh courses that officers and men had to undergo at that time.  I mentioned that to show that the Army have scrapped that line of training and have adopted a new one without any sound reasons for so doing.  During the emergency period the tactical training for troops and F.C.A. was excellent.  The key words for the training exercises were &ldquo;cover&rdquo;, &ldquo;crawl&rdquo; and &ldquo;observe&rdquo;.  On the command, &ldquo;cover&rdquo;, all troops immediately took cover, whether behind a furze bush, wall, cliff or by lying flat on the ground.  The next order was &ldquo;crawl&rdquo;.  They had to keep their heads down so that there would be no loss of manpower.  The third order was &ldquo;observe&rdquo;, so that when they would move they would be able to pick out the position of enemy machine-guns or snipers.  These were routine orders, and troops were trained to carry out those commands quickly and efficiently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth was &ldquo;fire&rdquo;.  We now have the position that orders are given to march forward. You ignore the enemy's machine-guns; you ignore the artillery of the enemy because, according to the rule book, your own artillery and heavy machine-guns have laid a big barrage on the enemy position, and the enemy positions are being blasted out of existence; and that, in addition to the heavy artillery on your rere, you have hundreds of aeroplanes divebombing the enemy troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That type of training has been adopted in Ireland because it is in operation in Britain and America.  Our officers were sent over to Britain and elsewhere to study the latest tactics <Col N="532" /> and have come back with a new idea that the solution is firing-power and that you march forward irrespective of loss because the enemy is pinned down with the heavy fire that your supporting troops can bring to bear on him. That type of training, no doubt, is excellent in America and Britain, where they have unlimited quantities of armaments, the most modern heavy artillery and the finest of divebombers, heavy bombers and fighter planes, but I submit that that type of training is not suitable for the Irish Army.  One of our objects is to contain the enemy or drive him back and in so doing to conserve our manpower because we have little enough men without wasting them.  Apart from that, we have not got the artillery, the aeroplanes and the heavy armaments that these countries have.  Our training, therefore, should be based on the material at our disposal.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I subscribe to the view that both the Regular Army and the F.C.A. should get a first-class training in guerrilla warfare.  Methods of war have changed.  There is no need for me to elaborate on the fact that in case of war, everybody to-day is in the front line.  There is no question to-day of merely recruiting battalions of men and sending them to the field to fight for us.  The man at home, the woman of the family, the worker in the factory or the field, must all play their part if war should come in future.  I think it is the duty of all able-bodied men to be trained to the utmost in order to be able to help if necessary in the defence of the State.  It is unfair to suggest that the brunt of the battle should be borne by purely volunteer elements, such as has been the position in the past.  This must be one of the few countries in the world to-day that depends entirely on voluntary efforts for our defence.  I am not going to suggest to the House that you could have immediately compulsory military training.  I do not think it would be practicable, to begin with, and I think the cost of it would be prohibitive, in view of the limited resources at our disposal, but I do think that the position should be examined with a view to ensuring that <Col N="533" /> every able-bodied man in the country is fit to take his place in the front line, is fit to fire a rifle, to use hand grenades, and is capable of erecting a road block.  I think that that responsibility should be imposed on every able-bodied citizen.</P>
    <P>To my mind we have an ideal Army or the nucleus of it in the F.C.A., but again I do not think the F.C.A. are getting a fair chance in this respect. It is all very fine to take these boys and give them a fortnight's training in the year and then send them back to the rural areas to their work on the farm or in the factory, whatever their usual avocations may be.  They are not getting suitable training in modern methods of warfare.  I wonder how many of the F.C.A. to-day would be able to lay anti-tank mines?  How many of them are able to fire submachine guns or even to handle them? I think that our Army officers or those in charge of the defence policy should make the F.C.A. familiar with all types of weapons at the disposal of the Army.  There seems to be a feeling in this country that it is dangerous to allow out rifles and ammunition to the F.C.A. in general.  I think that is a wrong spirit.  It shows a lack of confidence in the leadership of the F.C.A., by either the Army authorities or those responsible for defence policy. I should like to see the F.C.A. getting. a better chance and a greater effort made to induce men to join the F.C.A. There are various methods by which more men could be induced to join the F.C.A. without actually paying them. The question of attendance at meetings and parades should receive further investigation.  Even if a small gratuity were paid to good attenders at parades and training meetings, it would induce many more able-bodied men to join the ranks and it would be cheaper than taking them into the Regular Army.  You would have part-time soldiers available in their own localities and that is the ideal arrangement in regard to the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Minister will answer some of the arguments put forward by various speakers in regard to the Regular Army and that he will say that it is not intended that the 12,000 <Col N="534" /> men of the Regular Army should constitue a purely attacking force against whatever enemy may land in this country. I take it that the Minister's idea is that the standing Army should be increased in the event of a crisis, within the shortest space of time, by men drawn from the Reserve and the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it would be advisable to retain the F.C.A. within certain areas in the event of mobilisation.  If you have battalion commanders and several F.C.A. captains and lieutenants with the rank and file in a particular county, they know that county inside-out. They know every road, every ditch and every point of vantage in it and they are vital to the defence of the State if an attack should be launched.  These men would be most useful in the localities with which they are familiar and, when things became tough in any particular county, the Regular Army could be brought in to assist and reinforce the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like again to draw the Minister's attention to the question of establishing factories here for the production of small arms.  I should like him to elaborate to the House the difficulties involved, if there are difficulties to be overcome, but I am sure he would have the support of the House in setting up such factories. The Minister must now realise that it is waste of time asking some of the outside nations to provide us with these necessary means of defence.</P>
    <P>The previous Government as well as the present Government have time and again sought from foreign Powers warlike materials.  I understand that a number of our Army officers have been frequently abroad asking for assistance in that regard and that their efforts have not been as successful as we had hoped for.  In view of these circumstances, how can we ever hope to get sufficient material here to defend the nation?  Is it not essential, therefore, that we should take all possible steps to try to provide the necessary materials within the State?  That is what I am asking the Minister to do if it is feasible and, if it is not feasible, to give us the reasons which prevent it being done.  They must be very strong <Col N="535" /> ones indeed and I hope he will give the House the benefit of his views when concluding this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks, mainly in relation to the F.C.A.  force.  I agree with the previous speaker that more encouragement should be given to that force because for a number of reasons I think it is the type of army which this country can best afford, as an F.C.A. member costs just a fraction of what a regular soldier costs the country in the year.  Another reason which the previous speaker referred to is that if our Defence Forces have to undertake guerrilla tactics in the event of our being attacked, the F.C.A. would be the eyes of the Regular Army, as they would have intimate knowledge of the terrain over which they might be fighting.  In addition, the F.C.A. enables every man of suitable military age to equip himself for the defence of the country if the need arose, and not every man can join the Regular Army.  If this country were called upon to defend itself tomorrow it would need the assistance of every man of military age.  In the F.C.A. there is an opportunity to train the personnel, even in an elementary way, in the rudiments of warfare.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker thought that the system of training adopted by our Army during the emergency was not the one best suited for this country. While I agree that in the last resort any defence in this country must necessarily be one of guerrilla tactics, at the same time no one could expect a well trained Army not to be versed in every particular sphere of military tactics.  Even though they may be taught things which they would not be called upon to put into practice, it is necessary that they should know what tactics are adopted by those against whom they may be fighting. For that reason it is necessary that the Regular Army should be trained in all kinds of tactics, so that they may be as up to date as any Army in the world, and I believe they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the F.C.A. is concerned, there is great difficulty in attracting young men to it who should be attracted to it.  During the emergency, <Col N="536" /> when things were more exciting and danger was more imminent, it was quite easy to get a full attendance on parade of the L.D.F., as it was then known.  When the clouds of war cleared away they lost interest, although we might expect that the opposite would take place.  The people of this country seem to be more ready to fight when danger looms ahead.  That certainly applied to the various struggles which have taken place in the past.</P>
    <P>As was proved in the last war-despite all the modern weapons which science has brought into being, the principle weapon is the service rifleand it is likely to remain so for years to come.  If we can train the F.C.A. in the proper use of the ordinary rifle we will be achieving much.  During the emergency we were told that one of the first necessities required of a good solider was to be able to shoot straight.  If the F.C.A. are to be properly trained in the use of the ordinary service rifle, more ammunition will have to be placed at their disposal for training purposes.  We found it difficult to train a large number of men on the limited quantity of ammunition allowed per man per year for range practice.  I understand that that position has considerably improved.  I think that not merely should the men have the annual range practice, but that they should have shooting contests for trophies during the year which would not merely teach them to use the rifle properly, but also stimulate interest in the force and attract others to it.  That can only be done by placing at their disposal a good quantity of live ammunition and giving them the necessary facilites for practice by taking part in shooting competitions.</P>
    <P>Uniforms have been mentioned on a number of occasions.  If there is any thing which mitigates against the success of a force like the F.C.A. it is the badly fitting drab uniforms that are sometimes issued.  Battle-dress has never been an attractive uniform. Young men who are interested in soldiering are taught to be very careful about their appearance.  The present uniform issued to the F.C.A. has not <Col N="537" /> even got padding in the shoulders.  It invariably looks slovenly, and the members of that body do not take the pride they should in it.  They frequently wear it during their day's work.  It makes the force look somewhat ridiculous when one meets a man dressed in F.C.A. uniform hauling a load of turf.  Admittedly these uniforms are made of excellent material and cost the State a considerable sum of money and it is not right that they should be abused.  Their abuse tends to discourage others.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should consider giving certain facilities to brighten up the social life of the F.C.A. in every parish.  This force is an important adjunct to the Regular Army. The members of it have knowledge of the local terrain.  That would be very important in the event of hostilities, because guerrilla tactics will require local geographical knowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the success of the recruiting drive. A highly-trained small army will always be the nucleus of a more expansive force should the necessity for expansion arise.  Our Army at the moment is a nucleus capable of expansion at the shortest possible notice in order that we may put our most effective strength into the field to defend the freedom we won so dearly at the expense of so many lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to pursue a policy of increasing the size of the Army but it is unfair to the men to continue so increasing it when we are not in a position to equip them properly. That approach is wrong.  I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of compulsory military service for all youth between the ages of 18 and 20.  Boys are then leaving school.  They are physically fit and they have not lost the art of study. They can apply themselves to military strategy and military technique.  I think they are eminently suitable at that age for any army training.  In that way the State could build up successive drafts of effective soldiers should the necessity arise to put a large army in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention <Col N="538" /> to a defect in the present Army Pensions Acts.  Certain sections of the Army are exposed to greater hazards than are others.  The Air Force is a more hazardous occupation than that of the ordinary man who stays on the ground.  If the engine fails while a pilot is instructing new personnel he has very little chance of saving his life.  Admittedly, his crew is in the same position, but in most cases the pilot will be a married man with a wife and family.  The scale of compensation for his dependents compares very unfavourably with the standard of living to which he and his family were accustomed.  Therefore I would like to see the Army Pensions Acts altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible to devise some kind of insurance scheme which would provide cover, if that cannot be arranged in the normal way, so that compensation could be paid.</P>
      <P>As regards our policy, I think it should be to ensure having an adequate number of professional soldiers who would be capable of leading the Army. Our Army has, I think, more of the rank and file type of individual than of those who would be leaders in the event of an emergency.  For that reason I would prefer to see the youth of the country trained so that they could go into service under the guidance and direction of professional soldiers.  The prospect of promotion for the rank and file is very limited. If men were encouraged to go into the Army and take it up as a profession I think it could be more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe myself that the F.C.A., in the event of an emergency, would be our real defence.  It is on those men we would have to depend.  We could only depend on our Army to guide the <Col N="539" /> members of the F.C.A.  It is the F.C.A. which would provide the numbers we would need if the necessity for defence arose.  For that reason I think we should pursue a policy of exploring all possibilities in the matter of organisation for the F.C.A., training, and so on, so as to enable those men to be effective if called upon.  I will ask the Minister to examine the possibility of improving the facilities to be made available to the F.C.A. in the matter of training and organisation. There should be encouragement in that direction.  I do not propose to say any more on the Estimate.  I hope at a later stage to get an opportunity of asking the Minister about this question of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps only on small points that Deputies differ in their discussion of this Estimate.  All of them, I think, approach the defence of the country from the same point of view.  When discussing this Estimate and the amount of money involved, not only this year but in the year that has passed, the first thing that I think we should consider is the treatment of N.C.O.s and of privates.  A number of Deputies have referred to the fact that at the end of the emergency a large number of men were most anxious to leave the forces.  We know, too, that even during the emergency a number of young men who were trained in the Army and became excellent soldiers left and went across the Border to wear the uniform of another country&mdash; a uniform which the majority of us do not wish to see Irish nationals wearing if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that our aim ought to be to have an army here which we can say we are proud of.  In order to get that, we must have contented men and contented N.C.O.s.  If those who join the Army find that the conditions are such that they are satisfied with them, then we can say that those in the Army are happy and proud to be with the Colours.  We know quite well that when men left the Army after the emergency, and even during it, they had complaints to make.  When their neighbours heard those complaints <Col N="540" /> they began to wonder why it was that such complaints should be so freely mentioned.  I believe, myself, that many of those complaints were justified, and that many of the complaints were due to the fact that the senior officers in the Army, very excellent men against whom I have no intention of saying anything, had got into a certain groove, and were inclined to follow a set-up such as you will see amongst officers in a certain foreign army.  I do not know who was responsible for that, whether it was the Minister at the time or those directly in charge of the Army.</P>
    <P>There is that danger, I am sorry to say, that the top-rankers in our Army are inclined to follow that type or that set-up.  For many years we saw those officers of a foreign army down south.  They were in occupation here, unfortunately.  We know what their autocratic bearing was.  We realise, however, that the officers in our Army, while they are plain and democratic, are obliged to keep up a certain high standard.  For example, if an officer is travelling on duty in the country and requires to get lunch, he is compelled to go to a first-class hotel.  We must understand the type of men who gained for us whatever measure of freedom we enjoy to-day.  We have to consider, too, the younger generation who at all times have been ready to give their services to the country. I wonder is it necessary that we should oblige those men to maintain those high standards to which I have referred?  We accept the fact that these men had a certain code of honour and discipline, and that they never set out to ape the standard of conduct set by the armies of other countries. For that reason, I feel it ill becomes our Army that these views should be changed to the extent that they have been changed a while back.  Senior officers have complained to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>When we place the figures available at the present time against those for 1938 and 1939, we can honestly say that our Army is completely top-heavy as regards ranks.  There are more colonels lieutenant-colonels and commandants in the Army at the present time than was the case in 1938 and in <Col N="541" /> 1939.  While it is true that, owing to an expanding Army during the emergency, it was necessary to have large numbers of officers, that does not hold for the present-day Army.  Unfortunately, it is just the old system of not wishing to get back to normal conditions. Time and again in this House and outside it, we hear the viewpoint expressed that we should try to get back to normal conditions.  As far as the Army is concerned, it is my view that they are the body least desirous of getting back to these normal conditions. If we compare the figures set out in the Appropriation Accounts in 1950-51 for Army pay with the sum allocated for this purpose for the coming year, we will see that there is an increase of £449,362.  That in itself indicates, as the Minister will tell us, the increased number of personnel.  If we were to examine that sum, I wonder how much of it would be allocated to the privates and N.C.O.s in comparison with the amounts given to the higher ranks?  As I said at the outset, if we are to make a success of our Defence Forces, and if we hope to get young men to join up, we must realise that it is not going to be very beneficial for them to know the number of colonels, lieutenant-colonels and commandants has increased, and that they have got proportionately more increase in pay than the rank and file.  I am not blaming the present Minister for that.  I believe that the present Minister is just continuing the policy which was in operation.  Deputy Major de Valera told us that that policy was more or less inaugurated in 1936, and that no Government since has varied very much in their approach to it.  Yet it is true that every Government and every Minister for Defence is prepared to see the ordinary private and N.C.O. going up the ladder at a much slower pace than the higher ranks of the Army.  This is bound to create discontent, and to bring about the situation where these men would be comparing their pay with the pay given to armies in other countries.  We must realise that there are a certain percentage of our countrymen who are prepared to join the army of any country in Europe, some of them because of a spirit of adventure.  Men <Col N="542" /> who are trained here are prepared to join other armies because of the better conditions operating in them, and this country is at their loss.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a few points about married officers living in official quarters.  It is the custom that such officers should be entitled to an orderly. In my view the work set by the officer for such orderly should be such as would be completed in a matter of a few hours.  Instead, what is happening, unless I am misinformed, is that the officer and his family are making a male servant of the orderly.  In many instances, these men are even expected to till the officer's garden.  That, in my opinion, will bring us to the position where there will be a greater gulf between the rank and file and where a superiority complex, on the part of the officers, will be seeping in, as has been the case in other countries.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about the conditions operating for pensioned Army personnel.  I do not know whether it is correct or not, but I have been told that those who get employment from local authorities are in danger of losing part, at any rate, of their Army pension.  It is interesting to note that that does not apply in the case of officers or ex-officers switching to the Electricity Supply Board, to Bord na Móna or to other State concerns; they are entitled to their full Army pension. Why should that not be so in the case of Army personnel employed by local authorities?  Why is it that their pension will be reduced if they get such employment?  If such a state of affairs is in operation, I feel it should not be allowed to continue.  In my view, there should be no discrimination between the men employed by local authorities and those employed in State organisations, such as the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir. I will not touch on it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points in connection with this Estimate to which I would like to draw attention.  The Minister has set himself the task of increasing the Army.  His ambition is <Col N="543" /> to bring it up to a strengh of 12,000 men or over.  It is interesting to recall the actual position which resulted from the 1946 recruiting drive.  The Minister said in this House, in reply to questions, that he was very satisfied with the results of that recruiting campaign. According to reports at that time, he said that it even exceeded his expectations.  I should like to know from the Minister what were the reports at that time submitted by the recruiting officers?  Why was it that these recruiting officers were asked the reason why the recruiting drive was not a greater success?  I would like to know if it is correct that there were reports from these recruiting officers stating that the various complaints mitigated against the recruiting drive, such as I have already mentioned, about unsatisfactory conditions in the Army.  These reports were made. There were reports of certain political victimisation.  I am not trying to bring politics into this debate.  I am drawing attention to reports of which I have been informed.  If the recruiting drive was not satisfactory at that time, it is better that we should realise why it failed.</P>
    <P>While we are hoping to have a larger Army.  I notice that in respect of marriage allowances the estimated figure, as compared with 1951, shows an increase of £40,019 14s. 8d.  Having regard to the cost of living, we should be prepared, if possible, to increase that figure, at least in the case of the ordinary soldier, taking into account his present pay.</P>
    <P>In regard to the item in the Estimate for transport of troops.  I notice that the increase is £9,591 6s. 3d. During the emergency more money was squandered on Army vehicles and motor-bikes parading around the country than on any other Army activity.  Time and again, empty lorries were driven around the country when there was no need.</P>
    <P>We are told, and I believe it to be true, that the Department of Defence officials, like the officials in all Departments, do their utmost to see that <Col N="544" /> expenses are cut down to a minimum. In respect of the transport of troops. I consider that the Estimate could be cut down, because the so-called barracks in many parts of the country are so obsolete that it would be better not to transport troops to them at all. Some of them are death traps.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which the Minister will probably explain with reference to the question of clothing and equipment.  There is a large increase there&mdash;£261,367 12s. 3d.  The Minister may say that these figures are due to the anticipated increase in the Army as a result of the recruiting drive, but on examination of the Appropriation Accounts one sees that in many cases orders were late or were not delivered in time, that materials were not available.  That seems to occur every year.  There is no sense in having in the Appropriation Accounts year after year items that should have been expended and which were not expended because the equipment or material was not available or was not delivered in time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, although there are many figures in the Estimate that I would support in normal circumstances, because I believe the responsible officials will not overestimate, it is quite obvious that there are many items being carried over because the materials or equipment, although ordered, are not available.  There is certainly something wrong in the procedure.</P>
    <P>There is the item of general stores and warlike stores.  It was interesting to read in to-day's paper about some of the new equipment we have got from Sweden and Belgium.  Of course, we do not know at this stage what amount we will be able to get.  In present conditions it is difficult to judge.  I know that it is impossible, from an accountancy point of view, to estimate the full amount that will be available to us in a given year.  There must be a certain amount of overlapping, but when we realise that in the case of warlike stores, within two years there is an estimated increase of £805,222 11s. 4d., that is something that we must question.  I question it because, when we read the Official Report of the debate on the Estimate <Col N="545" /> for Defence in 1948, we notice that members of the then Opposition, perhaps in good faith, stood up one after another and pointed out the danger of the policy of the Government at that time.  I believe that they meant every word of what they said.  They expressed the view that there was a danger that within six months of that time&mdash;which was 1948&mdash;war might be upon the world.</P>

      <P>It was said by them that we were living in such a period of the history of this world that it was fantastic for us to assume or to be so hopeful as to expect a 12 months' peace.  Again in 1949 they had the same worry.  Again, perhaps, they were justified in their view which some of us considered to be a pessimistic view.  Times have changed.  From 1948 to 1952, thanks be to God, we were lucky in having peace in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to adopt the financial policy of the then Opposition Party and to spend the amounts of money which the then Opposition wished we should spend, we would have spent in the last four years an extraordinary amount of money on the defence of this country. The irony of it is that when we ask for recruits, we paint glowing pictures of Army life in the national newspapers while at the same time, some of the barracks which we use to house these troops are veritable death traps. There are certain forts in Cork harbour which I have known from boyhood, not <Col N="546" /> that we got very near them when there was another flag flying over them, but we know that it would be totally unfair to put Irishmen into some of these forts unless we are first prepared to spend an extraordinary amount of money in improving them.  When we are told of the necessity of recruitment, we should remember that it is essential to have decent barracks to house our recruits. I might mention that in one of these old obsolete forts in Cork harbour, there was machinery in the workshops second to none in this country and that during the emergency years it supplied valuable materials to various posts and barracks in the country.  Yet at the end of the emergency, before there was any thought of a change of Government, the machine shop was scrapped in that fort.  I do not wish to go back on old sores, but these remarks are all coupled with our approach to the general question of defence.  There is little use in speaking of the necessity for recruitment unless, first of all, we have buildings suitable to house recruits.</P>
    <P>There are a few items to which I should like to call the Minister's attention before concluding.  One of these items I have already mentioned, the question of barrack maintenance and minor repairs.  Under that heading there is an increase shown of £14,951 13s. 4d.  There is a note in the Appropriation Accounts to the effect that certain costs were incurred for dredging at Haulbowline and it states that this was offset by saving on repairs, renewals and maintenance.  I should like to stress in the strongest possible manner the importance of avoiding that particular phrase in the future&mdash;&ldquo;savings in connection with repairs, renewals and maintenance&rdquo;. I believe, from what I know of some of these places, that that policy in the past has been a policy of a penny wise and a pound foolish.  It may look all right from the financial point of view or from the point of view of satisfying responsible officials, who like to think that they can work well within their estimates in the case of repairs and renewals, but if these officials were to go around and see some of the places on which their cheeseparing policy had been carried out, I know they <Col N="547" /> would be the first to admit that it certainly is not a satisfactory policy.</P>
    <P>Another heading to which I should like to draw attention is that of incidental expenses.  When we consider that there has been an increase of £33,959 as against the 1951 figures, I think it must be admitted that it does not represent a satisfactory state of affairs.  Even though we may be told that the numbers in the Army are such that incidental expenses are bound to be very high, I still believe that items such as I have mentioned could easily be cut down.  Again while the Minister may be able to offer a satisfactory explanation for it, when we realise that £41,407 2s. 8d. more is estimated for the office of the Minister in salaries, wages and allowances comparing the two years, 1951, as given in the Appropriation Accounts and the 1952-53 figures given to us in the Estimate, it certainly does seem an enormous increase.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to repeat what has been said by so many Deputies about what is due to those who have served in the Army, in the L.D.F and in the present F.C.A.  I consider that even if we can only have a small Army, a full professional Army, if we are prepared to make it a life-time job, to provide decent conditions and a decent standard of living and decent pensions on retirement for those whom we propose to recruit, then we shall get better types for our Army than we are likely to get if the conditions are not satisfactory</P>
    <P>What I propose to say now I am not saying by way of disparagement, but it is our duty to give expression to what we think.  I know of young lads who have joined the Army as a result of the recruiting drive.  Many of them are very decent boys just coming into manhood, who have come from decent homes.  But we all know that mixing with various types in this world tends to make changes in young men, which very often we would not desire if they belonged to our own families.  I have seen young lads belonging to the Army knocking around the streets in Cork. It may be that they will develop into fine soldiers yet.  If these young men make the Army their career they will <Col N="548" /> have the advantage of the military training and discipline which is essential in an army.  They will have advantages which will help them in later life.  But I see a danger in regard to those who have only joined for a few years, and who when they leave the Army will be looking for employment. There is the possibility that when they leave the Army they will not be willing to adopt the standard of life attaching to employment in rural Ireland.  There is therefore the danger that the wanderlust may take possession of them, that they may join the army of another country or seek employment there, just because the environment in our Army was so different.</P>
    <P>After having been trained in the Army here they may leave the country where they may be needed, and be of a benefit to another country after the training they received here as soldiers. I therefore consider that in order to make a success of our Defence Forces it is important for us to try and make such service a full period job with a decent pension at the end.  In my opinion that would be a better approach to a satisfactory Army, especially from the point of view of the strength of the Army, than any other approach.</P>
    <P>I should like again to draw attention to the necessity for making life in the Army a little more comfortable and a little better financially for the soldiers and N.C.O.s.  We could do with fewer &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo; in the Army, fewer of those who are always ready to tell us and to write articles in newspapers about the dangers of war in other countries. We do not know whether war will come or not, but the men who fought for freedom in 1920 in this country had very few &ldquo;brass hats&rdquo; to tell them what they should do, very few colonels and majors to direct operations, very few lorries and motor bicycles to take them around the country. They depended on the old type of guerrilla warfare.  If there is another war, even with all the modern equipment, all the anti-tank guns and the various other appliances which we are so anxious to get in the international market at present and for which we are being forced to pay prohibitive <Col N="549" /> prices when we can get them, I believe that in the long run the only defence possible for this country is a defence which proved successful against an empire and which will again prove successful against any invader in the future, whether from the West or the East, namely, guerrilla warfare such as was carried out in the 1920 period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it is that the policy with regard to the defence of this country is not clearly understood and an approach made with regard to how the Department of Defence shall, so far as is possible, implement through its activities the policy of the nation.  Deputy Desmond made many references to details and, in conclusion, expressed his own policy, his policy in a sense being that, in the event of this country being invaded by a nation of much greater strength, in spite of the ability of the people within the territory to attempt to defend it such equipment as we have would be useless because it would be obsolete or outweighed by the equipment used against it.  I conclude that the suggestion was that we should not waste money on these expensive items of equipment.</P>
      <P>For a nation such as ours which has paid such a heavy price over so many years to re-establish itself as a free nation I cannot see why there should be any doubt as to the wisdom of our manhood being trained as far as it is possible for us to do so within our means.  The first step in that direction is to have a specialised force, as large as possible, of trained regular soldiers properly officered, including &ldquo;brass hats,&rdquo; to whom objection has been raised, so that in the event of a conflict these trained people would be the technicians to train larger numbers of those who might have had no training at all and so be able to master the situation in a comprehensive manner. No one, I take it, believes, if we had an Army of from 12,000 to 20,000, that in the event of this country being involved in war through invasion our soldiers would to the limit of their numbers strike a blow and, if they went under, that would be the end of our attempt at resistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is either fear of the possibility <Col N="550" /> of war or there must be an assurance that there will be no war.  When we discuss the position here, seeing as we do the portents and omens elsewhere, and when Deputies put their opinions and their conclusions before the House, we invariably discover that those opinions are either misunderstood or deliberately misinterpreted.  Deputy Desmond suggested that Fianna Fáil in 1948 criticised what they described as lack of development in Army matters and in the policy of the then Government in relation to the Army.  It was suggested that spokesmen of our Party believed that war would definitely take place within six months and that the Coalition Government was deliberately ignoring the situation.</P>
    <P>Nothing of the kind was said and I think it is only fair that I should read from the Official Report what was said shortly prior to the outbreak of the Korean War.  At column 849 of Volume 110 of the Official Report, Deputy Major de Valera said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can say, however, that there are two definite blocs of Powers in this world who, to say the least of it, are not on the best of terms and to that extent we find ourselves in a situation comparable with the situation from 1936 to 1939 rather than the other.  How long there is before us is anybody's guess.  I want carefully to refrain from anything like alarmist statements. I should like to hope that it was not there at all, but we have to be realists.  Therefore now is the time to profit by the experiences of these years, to accept the recommendations of the General Staff which examined this problem with care and with, I assure you, due regard for economy, knowing the force and importance of the economic factor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not by the wildest stretch of imagination could that be interpreted by anybody as a statement forecasting war within six months.</P>
    <P>In the same debate the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, said, at column 921:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Obviously that is a matter which ought to engage the attention of the Government.  I would <Col N="551" /> urge that in the actual position of world affairs, as it seems to me now&mdash;I do not think I am an alarmist, but we have lived through one crisis during which I think no imputation could be made upon us that we lost our heads, just as I do not think it likely that we shall lose our heads in any crisis that may arise in the future&mdash;it would be very bad policy on the part of the Government to ignore that which other nations think is threatening. It would be very foolish on our part to adopt that policy.</P>
    <P>Anybody who studies world affairs must realise with a great degree of certainty that there is even now a situation which can very easily develop into war.  To use an old phrase, it is not wise to wait until the drums beat to sharpen one's tusks.  We must have a long-distance preparation, if you like, so that if there is a war in which our interests are affected and our principles are threatened the nation will find itself in a position in which it can defend itself to its utmost.  It may find itself on one side or the other, or it may be neutral.  In any case, the foundation of all defence is that you will set out to defend yourself to the utmost of your power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two statements made by two important members of the Fianna Fáil Party, by persons who had actual experience, in one case over a long number of years, and in the other case in the immediate situation through which we had just passed.  I think everybody will agree with that.  They could not be regarded as people who did not know what they were talking about.</P>
    <P>What is the best thing to do in present circumstances?  I have always understood the policy of this Party to be that we must have a certain number of our people so trained that they can study and improve on military technique and strategy in order that they can be the teachers and the leaders of our people in the event of actual strife. We have heard a certain amount of <Col N="552" /> criticism as to the manner in which our Army appears to operate.  Deputy Desmond spoke about empty lorries careering around the country for no obvious reason.</P>
    <P>If we have an army and if that army has certain equipment, that equipment must be used so that the personnel will be familiar with it when occasion arises and they must use it.  It would be very foolish to have a fleet of lorries in some barracks with a notice: &ldquo;Do not touch until war breaks out.&rdquo;  We could go from one extreme to the other.  I do not believe that there has been this waste.  Indeed, I think criticism could be levelled in the other direction.  The funds at the disposal of the Department of Defence are not wantonly dissipated, and I have yet to meet any member of the Army who would admit that it is easy to dissipate Army funds. There is a strict control over all the moneys placed at the disposal of the Army.  I believe that any equipment that is being used is being used with the full knowledge and consent of those who have responsibility for ensuring that those under their control are trained in the use of such equipment for the ultimate benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made that some items in the Estimate are misleading because there has been a refund to the Exchequer of moneys not spent.  The reason why such moneys were not spent is because equipment was either unprocurable or was not delivered within a particular financial year.  We all know that one of the difficulties we have had to face since the end of the last war has been the difficulty of getting supplies.  We had even greater difficulty during the war. We are now living in a period in which nations all over the world are spending huge sums in a rearmament race&mdash;such a race as has never been witnessed at any time in the history of the world. We enter that race as a small nation. We find it difficult to get supplies. Therefore we can only provide the money so that when supplies become available to meet our requirements in whole or in part we will proceed to look for them and be in a position to take delivery of them.  I notice that <Col N="553" /> we have paid in whole or in part for certain items in advance in order to try and secure delivery.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any criticism can fairly be levelled at the Defence authorities in that regard.  We are all agreed that they are doing their best to get these items.  It has been impossible to get them and it would be unfair of me to say that the three years which preceded the present change of Government was the cause of that.  It was not.  It was due to world conditions. I believe that if our predecessors had been able to get supplies they would have taken delivery of them.  Our predecessors may not have had the same policy as this Government. I am satisfied, however, that Deputy Desmond expressed a view with which we all agree, that the Army is the Army of the nation and not of any particular political group in power at any time.  I hope it shall always remain so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the delivery of materials, we have to take what is available to us and what, in the opinion of our experts, are most suitable to meet our requirements in connection with training, and usable in the event of conflict.  We have also to arrange for taking into our regular forces and auxiliary forces the largest number of people we can get, so that at least they will be trained.  When we look across the water, or across the Atlantic, we see countries joining together. They have their mutual defence arrangements with understandings and agreements and with subsidies from each other for the production of warlike stores and materials.  What we must ensure is that our people, in the event of a conflict, will not be hamstrung in any way, and that, if necessary, they will be prepared to go out and offer themselves in defence of their country.  It is all very well to say that we should go back to guerrilla tactics, or that we should not adopt the policy which has been adopted since this country recovered its freedom.  I heard an aside not far from me: &ldquo;Is there somebody who wants us to go back to the bow and arrow?&rdquo;  We must go forward and bring ourselves up to the level of other <Col N="554" /> peoples, with the knowledge, equipment and training necessary to understand how to meet a particular kind of force.</P>

      <P>The Headquarters Staff are responsible for designing the plans.  Of course, I once said, not here in the House, that it was very difficult to know when your Headquarters Staff is doing the right thing or the wrong thing.  We do know that when the last war came many headquarters staffs, en bloc, were dismissed because when war started it was discovered that they did not have the know how. Men who had been critics before came in and tried to repair the mistakes they had made.  I do not think that anyone can criticise our Headquarters Staff.  Speaking generally, I believe they are doing their best.  I do not believe that much better could be done, no matter how much we searched.</P>

      <P>I am not standing up here as an expert on military matters. Deputy MacEoin could certainly claim to have a great deal more knowledge in that respect than I have.  We do concede, however, that we have a Headquarters Staff composed of men who are able to make up their minds as regards our plans and requirements. It is up to the Government and the House to make available to them the means to enable their plans to be implemented.  There is no criticism here of plans or arrangements.  We can discuss, of course, the type of uniform our soldiers wear, the housing of them, their rates of pay and pensions and so on.  But we have got to make available to our Department of Defence a certain amount of money, so that they will be able to implement their decisions with regard to their plans for training and for defence generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention to the Minister for Defence a system which was <Col N="555" /> tried out some years ago, and which, in my opinion, was one of the greatest successes ever attempted in our Army. For no reason that I can understand it was dropped.  There was the intake of men to the Army under what was known as the sergeant pilot scheme. Up to the advent of that scheme, only the officer class were trained in the piloting of aeroplanes.  This sergeant pilot scheme was on an experimental basis, organised from a limited number of carefully selected candidates.  In time it was shown that some of these ordinary men who went in as noncommissioned officers proved their worth in the world of flying, not only here but throughout the world.  Some of them are in employment abroad, and are bringing credit to the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot say why that scheme was abandoned, whether it was due to bad planning or bad decisions by the commanders-in-chief.  I see no reason why the sergeant pilot scheme should not be reintroduced.  In every country in the world you have, side by side with the officer class, a sergeant pilot scheme, enabling ordinary men of the rank and file to become pilots.  The ordinary members of those armies can volunteer for this service.  Both in war and in peace they have shown themselves to be equal to the best that can be found in the officer classes.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that I feel very sore about.  I think no explanation can be given as to why it was abandoned. The explanation cannot be that there is a shortage of the necessary training and equipment.  I do not think any excuse can be given that will stand examination.  I think that if our Army is to have an attraction in certain directions this training should be available to our ordinary people first in the Air Force Services and afterwards as a means of livelihood.  I think it would be most undemocratic if vast numbers of our people were to be deprived of it.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask, in conclusion, whether there is anybody here prepared to say that we have reached a stage of affairs in the world where wars are forever over and forgotten. I think that, in the present state of <Col N="556" /> affairs, one would be taking a very serious risk, either here or elsewhere, by adopting the attitude that at last civilisation had overtaken human beings and that we are living as we should live.  We must face facts. Whether it is to-day or whether it is to-morrow, or whether it is six months or ten years' time, it is quite obvious that the clouds are gathering, and one must conclude that before these clouds can be dispersed, whether it be local outbreaks or localised outbreaks such as we have in Korea, ultimately a great war is bound to follow.  We must, therefore, be quite clear in recognising our responsibility to this nation.  If we were to conclude that there is no fear and that there is no danger of war, and that even if there is a war nobody is going to interfere with us and that we are not going to make even a token resistance, then we would be committing a grave error for which future generations would not forgive us.</P>
    <P>I feel we must be prepared to have our position made quite clear to whatever Powers may be engaged in a world conflict if and when it should arise.  We will not enter into war of our own choice and if we are dragged into war, due to the occupation of any part of our territory by any outside Power, then we are going to resist that Power as far as we can.  Let the world then know that, small as we are, we are determined, and the only way in which our determination can be translated, so that we be understood by outside people, is by our willingness to make available materials in the shape of equipment and training for our young men so that the best and the greatest number of our people will be able, if such occasion should arise, to do their part, not without knowledge, training or direction, but with understanding, proper guidance and proper plans.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have this question of the sergeant pilot scheme examined.  I do not expect him to give me a reply this evening or to-morrow. I would like the Minister to find out the numbers that were taken into this service and what has become of them. It will be found that there are a few <Col N="557" /> who served this nation in our own air services and it will be found that there are a few who served abroad.  As I said before, they served foreign countries and foreign air services in a manner which made people inquire where they got their training.  It is a great credit to our little Air Force that it was able to train these young people to such an extent.  I assert that if the scheme is not reintroduced we are denying to the finest types of our young people an opportunity of training in this particular sphere of modern life, and we are denying them the opportunity which, as the result of their training, they would have of getting proper and suitable employment when their time comes to leave the service of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proper that this Estimate should be availed of by Deputies to pay tribute to the Army, its personnel, its tradition and its outlook. This opportunity has been availed of by Deputies over a number of years on the discussion on this Estimate.  It is gratifying that we should find the expression of opinion given to-night by Deputy Briscoe from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  Our Army is the Army of this nation, and it is due to the Army that, despite the vicissitudes in the past, we have retained our nation and that we are discussing here to-night the annual Vote for the Army. Apart from the personnel of the Army which we are necessarily discussing, we are also discussing the policy of the Army to-day and its future policy.  Our discussion should not be confined, as Deputy Briscoe seems to suggest, to the types of uniform that the soldiers should wear; that is a matter for the soldiers' girl friends.  Our concern is with the policy the Government should enforce in connection with the Army, and it is in that connection that I want to express my concern that we did not hear from the Minister any clear expression of policy so far as the defence of this country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is good enough for a Minister for Defence to introduce this annual Estimate on the basis that: &ldquo;We are providing for an Army.  That is the Army and that is that.&rdquo;  I think this Estimate should be availed <Col N="558" /> of by the Minister to express the Government's policy in relation to defence.  A policy of defence indicates the action to be devised by any country in complete isolation or insulation from the circumstances occurring outside the country; a policy of defence has to take into consideration the general trend of world events and matters of that kind. I feel it is important that the people of this country should be told for what purpose the Army is being maintained and provided for in this Estimate.  If it is to be a purely defensive force, the people should be told against whom it it is to defend this country.  Is it to defend the country against possible invasion from Britain, from America, from France, from Germany or from Russia?  These are circumstances which should be discussed here calmly and deliberately by the Minister and by Deputies of this House.  There is a remarkable aversion to anyone mentioning either America, Britain, France or Russia.  There are vague references from time to time to certain foreign Powers.  I think that is absurd.  We had the appalling spectacle here ten days ago of the Minister for Defence making reference to vague threats from a foreign Power against, apparently, the independence of this country.  On examination, it transpired that he was not quite certain what Power was involved or what threat was used.</P>
    <P>In relation to defence, it is important, particularly in world circumstances as we know them to-day, that the people of this country, through the Minister for Defence, should be informed of Government policy.  We know, of course, that the Government, the Minister and the Army have no doubt at all with regard to the situation that they have to face.  In this morning's newspaper, the people were able to see Swedish arms being tested by Army personnel under the inspection of the Military Attaché to the American Ambassador to this country. That, of course, is as it should be.  It is proper that, in the present situation, things like that should take place.  Why should there be any secrecy about them?  Why should we refrain from discussing these things openly?  It is well known that the Irish Army personnel avail of training facilities from the British Army and, again, why <Col N="559" /> should not that be discussed here?  I do think that the country is entitled to know on this Estimate exactly what plans and arrangements are being made in relation to the broad question of defence policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of defence, there is no one on any side of this House who has any doubt that we should, to the best of our ability, maintain a force that will enable the country to defend itself in the event of attack.  But we should not do that on the basis that we are the only country in the world.  We should not do it on the basis that all the world is ranged against Ireland. That is not so.  We know that if we were to be attacked the most probable source of danger is Russia.  That is a fact that is known to all of us. Many Deputies, apparently, are not prepared to state that but that is a fact which is accepted, I think, by almost all Deputies.</P>
    <P>Approaching the question of the defence policy on that basis, we must consider what kind of force we should maintain, assuming that our role in the event of war is to be purely defensive and that our Army is to be maintained purely for the purpose of protecting this country in the event of any attack from the other side of the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I think there is a major difference in policy between the present Government and the Opposition.  The major difference that I see is that we in Fine Gael do not and cannot dissociate the major requirements of this country in relation to its economic and general situation from the question of defence.  I do not think that we can isolate the country's defence policy from its other requirements.  We in Fine Gael believe, as we believed when in Government, that the primary concern of this country in time of peace or in times such as we have experienced since 1948 is production; that, subject to that, we must maintain a defensive force but that whatever Defence Force we maintain must not impede or retard the production which we require should any new emergency come upon the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> Accordingly, in the last four years, despite the suggestions of imminent war and imminent danger, the Government at the time ensured that young men were available on the farm and in the factory and generally so as to enable greater production.  That continued for four years and undoubtedly added considerably to the economic strength of the country. That was done at a time when we were told&mdash;I want to make this quite clear &mdash;by members of the present Government, in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951 that a new war was then around the corner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, in 1948, the Leader of the present Government expressed his opinion to be that a new European war was just around the corner.  In 1949, 1950, 1951 Question Time in the Dáil each day was largely concerned with questions from Deputy Vivion de Valera with regard to our defensive measures.  The atmosphere created by the then Opposition was designed to convince the country that a new European war was almost upon us and that we had to go into a huddle, to design some panicky emergency measures and generally to inflate our Army personnel and build a new Army.  That was the policy and propaganda indulged in by the Opposition from 1948 to 1951.  They may have believed that but the belief was not shared by the then Government. The Government in office at that time <Col N="561" /> and most sensible people in the country realised that there is no one in this particular country or, indeed, in Britain or America who can express himself as being definite with regard to the imminence or otherwise of a new war.  People just do not know.  It is impossible to be definite and it is impossible to lay down any time limit.</P>
      <P>That being the position, while great Powers like Britain and America may, to use the old saying, while hoping for the best, prepare for the worst, and while that is a particular policy that their resources enable them to indulge in, unfortunately, it is not a policy that a small country can afford to follow.  We cannot accept as normal the maintenance of an emergency Army.  We cannot, year in and year out, regard with equanimity preparation for war.  If we did that the country would suffer considerably.  It is far wiser for the Government to have the courage to decide that war will not come this year or next year or that at least we will act on the basis that it will not; that this year we will turn every man on to the land and into the factory in order to produce as much as we can, so that if a war comes in 18 months' time we will have sufficient to carry our people over some part of that emergency period.  That is a policy more suitable to this country than the policy at present being followed.</P>
      <P>Since the change of Government there has been a reversion to the idea of preparing for a war just around the corner.  There has been a reversion to the idea of recruiting young men into the Army, taking them from employment that would have been of benefit to the country, taking them from the land and, indeed, from the factory, turning them into barracks, keeping them there.  That is a net loss to the country.  It is a bad policy and it has meant a considerable loss to the country in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said by other Deputies in relation to the recruiting drive.  I should like merely to say that the criticism expressed by Deputies from country <Col N="562" /> areas with regard to the recruitment of potential agricultural labour is merely symptomatic of the effect of the policy being followed by the present Government.  It points to the difference between this Government's policy and the policy pursued by its predecessor, because prior to this Government coming into office the men at present being recruited to the Army would have been available for the production drive.  As the result of the recruiting drive, they are not available, and criticism is being expressed by country Deputies in that connection.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Deputies in referring to the position of the F.C.A.  I regard the F.C.A. as potentially the greatest weapon of a defensive kind that this country possesses. I regard it as a force completely in keeping with Irish history and tradition, a force completely in keeping with Irish requirements to-day.  In my view the Government and the Minister would serve this country far better if they devoted more time and attention to the F.C.A.&mdash;to its development, to its planning, and to designing a proper policy for using the F.C.A. in future. I do not think it is possible to have a local Defence Force of a voluntary kind, such as the F.C.A. is, if at the same time there is concentration on a standing Army.  I think the maintenance of both forces is not possible simultaneously.  The Minister expressed the view that the F.C.A. would be used, and should be used, in times of emergency as some sort of force auxiliary to the Army itself.  I think that is wrong.  I think it would be far better and far wiser if the Minister concentrated on the development of the F.C.A. as a local Defence Force, as the framework of a force spread throughout the country and available to the country in time of emergency.</P>
    <P>We cannot maintain a standing army and I do not think we should. I think that would be quite outside our ability, quite contrary to our traditions, and certainly present conditions would not make it possible.  We can maintain an entire nation of riflemen. We can maintain throughout the country, scattered in different parishes and in different towns, a force that would be available in time of <Col N="563" /> emergency if we set about doing it now.  The former Government undoubtedly did considerable work in building up this local Defence Force. I know in doing that they did experience a certain antipathy from the Regular Army personnel towards the F.C.A.  That particular feeling of suspicion has been experienced over a number of years back by people associated with the F.C.A., but I think that it is dying.  I think that even the most conservative Regular Army officers in recent years came to recognise the need for a force such as the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in the last 12 months the F.C.A. seems to have been put into a back seat again.  That changed outlook has undoubtedly been responsible to a certain extent for the very marked decrease in the available strength of this force.  I think it should be a matter of major concern to the House that the actual strength of the F.C.A. in the last 12 months has dropped by some 12,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence, in introducing this Estimate&mdash; I am quoting from column 332, No. 3, Volume 132&mdash;said, in relation to the F.C.A.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this arm of the force there has been a decrease in strength from 33,000 to 21,000 all ranks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> It seems clear that the Minister is reporting to the House that, in the past 12 months, the F.C.A. has been reduced in strength by over 11,000.  I regard that as a matter of major concern.</P>
    <P>When I said that, the Minister interrupted to ask me to what period I was referring.  If the Minister says now that the F.C.A., in the last 12 months, has not decreased by 11,000 or any figure of that kind, I shall be very happy to hear it.  As the Minister has not intervened, I must assume that that is the position&mdash;that, in the last 12 months, this country has lost 11,000 volunteer soldiers who were members of the L.D.F.  I think those have been lost because the Regular Army mentality is in the saddle.  Once again, under the chairmanship of the present Minister, people are controlling the Defence Forces, who believe, rightly or wrongly, that what this country should have is a standing Army.  They can see no use whatsoever in the local fellow down in the village parading around as a soldier; they regard him only as a nuisance.  That is a pity, because, if any danger should come to this country, if we were invaded&mdash;I take it that is the only danger we have to discuss&mdash;the local &ldquo;village nuisance&rdquo; who is wearing a uniform will be a very important addition to our Defence Forces.  In a time of emergency, no matter what kind of standing Army we may have, be it 30,000 or 40,000, if we were invaded, this country would revert automatically to the type of warfare which, through hundreds of years, enabled this country to make occupation by a foreign Power a very uneasy business.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies who are far better equipped to talk about that kind of warfare than the younger Deputies are.  But the warfare which was waged in the movement which led to the formation of this House was not a warfare of one standing army fighting another.  It was a fight carried on by men who had formed a local defence force available at all times for any situation that might arise which could never be contained or engaged or wiped out as a standing army might be.  It was a warfare waged by a <Col N="565" /> small trained personnel that had the support in every village, hamlet and parish of the people of the country. That is the type of defence that will be available to us and can only be available to us if an invasion or occupation did take place.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister should be neglecting the F.C.A.  I can see no sense in anyone suggesting that because our standing Army is now some 2,000 or 3,000 more than it was 12 months ago therefore we are better able to defend ourselves.  That is nonsense. From the point of view of the standing Army it is absurd to be discussing whether an army of 8,000 or 12,000 is the better defensive weapon. If we had to defend this country with a standing Army we all appreciate that we would be looking for hundreds of thousands of personnel.  We cannot afford a large standing Army.  We can afford a large force scattered and based on the different areas throughout the country.  It is a pity that we should be so obviously neglecting that, and I therefore suggest that more attention should be paid to the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the question of promotions in the Reserve. I am told that there is some criticism by officers of the Reserve with regard to that.  I am told that some members who went on the Reserve from the Regular Army find on reporting for annual training each year that they are in a particular groove.  They never get promotion, while younger officers who joined the forces long after them are promoted over their heads.  There is a certain amount of criticism of that, and I ask the Minister to investigate that particular complaint.</P>
    <P>May I say in conclusion that we on this side of the House welcome any effort to build up our Defence Forces? We differ from the Government as to the manner in which they should be built up.  Our policy is not any different in principle, but merely in regard to method.  We think that there should be a greater concentration on what used to be called the L.D.F. rather than trying to build up a standing Army which is still far short of the strength required from the point of <Col N="566" /> view of a standing Army for the defence of the country.  In holding that view we realise that the recent recruiting drive has undoubtedly hampered to a certain extent production in the country.  That might have been excusable if the F.C.A. had not been reduced in strength.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months the defence position of the country has deteriorated. On the credit side, the Minister can point to an increase of some 3,000 or 4,000 in the standing Army.  On the debit side, he has to report a reduction of 11,000 in An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  In addition, he has to contend with the fact that people throughout the country, who 12 months ago were beginning to look on the F.C.A. as a thing they should like to join, have been discouraged.  That should be a matter of major concern to Deputies. The Minister should ensure in the coming 12 months, if he is there for that period, that there will be a drive made to build up the F.C.A.  It is in the L.D.F. that the real defence of this country will lie, and if we neglect that then undoubtedly our defensive position will be weakened.  We in the Opposition, particularly in the Fine Gael Party, will give the Minister every possible support because we would like to see in every parish a local company of the F.C.A.  We would like to see our young people joining that body, getting there the training it provides, and playing their part in the Defence Forces of the nation without hampering the drive for production on the land or elsewhere.  If we can establish a strong L.D.F. of that type the country would be as well defended as it could be within its own resources should the necessity arise.</P>
    <P>The general principle with regard to defence has, of course, been accepted by us.  We do not oppose the Estimate. We have certain criticisms to offer in regard to the methods adopted by the Minister but, apart from that, we support the Estimate.  We suggest the Minister, now that he has recruited his standing Army, should concentrate in the coming months in recruiting for the F.C.A.</P>

      <P>From one point of view there is much in what the last <Col N="567" /> speaker has said, but to some extent I feel that there is a misunderstanding. Perhaps the last speaker is closer to the Government in his view on defence policy generally than he might suspect. I am sorry to say&mdash;perhaps it was not intentional&mdash;that the objectivity in his approach to this matter was slightly marred by a sense of political consciousness. Nevertheless, it is welcome to find that we are agreed in principle at any rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins referred to a number of matters which I shall deal with in due course.  There were several remarks in his speech, particularly with reference to the F.C.A., that I think we could study with profit. I shall come back to them in some detail later on.  It was a happy omen to find his approach to this Estimate when he was on these benches, with perhaps some exceptions, identical with the approach we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of some statements that were made, I think it is now opportune to consider once more the situation we have to face.  Some Deputies blew hot and cold.  We must face the fact at the outset that we must make our estimate of the situation in relation to defence and abide by that estimate thereafter.  Some of us have been trying to do that for some time past.  The first question that arises is how much attention does defence need from the Government, from the House and from the country?  That may be a hard question.  It is a serious question.  It is a question affecting, if you like, a problem in national insurance. It is not sufficient to look casually at a paper and jump to one conclusion or the other, or rely on a hunch.  One must try to assess the position.  I have tried on other occasions to make that assessment here.  I am sorry to say now that attempts have been made to completely misrepresent that assessment. But that is neither here nor there.  It is unimportant as to whether or not I have been misrepresented.  It is not unimportant to try to get as accurate an estimate as we can of the situation before we embark on any <Col N="568" /> policy, just as a board of directors will try to assess the economic factors before deciding on a particular line of conduct in relation to their firm's business.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  Up to 1948&mdash; and we can give chapter and verse&mdash; it looked as if there might eventually be a return to peace, but towards the end of 1947 nations began to get restless. There were certain signs on the horizon.  Those of us who spoke at that time spoke from a simple appreciation of the news as we read and heard it coming in every day.  Perhaps we spoke fairly vigorously because the inter-Party Government in 1948, or at any rate some members of that Government, were making a point of economy in the Army.  If the battle had not been fought by us on behalf of the Army then, the Army would have suffered more seriously than it did.  I am compelled to make that remark because of the twist that has been given to certain of my statements.  I would prefer to deal with this Estimate in an objective way.</P>
    <P>The facts are that early in March 1948 the Scandinavian countries sounded the alarm.  There were conferences between the Swedish General Staff and the other Scandinavian countries. That was the first positive and definite action indicating that we were heading into a situation of crisis or difficulty. That was followed by Britain's action within a few months.  If Deputies want to attack us for the attitude we adopted at that time let them look at the record.  Within a few months Britain had to reverse her policy.  Deputies will find proof of that by reference to Hansard, Volume 456, which records the debate that took place on 23rd September, 1948, and a statement of the then Minister of War in the British Cabinet.  A number of other quotations will be found at column 2010 of Volume 114 of our Official Report. At that time the British went into reverse. They went all out prepared for war again.  Mr. Eden, at that time, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I thought that there would be difficulties and I thought there would even be sharp disagreements at times, but I did not anticipate that <Col N="569" /> our relations would have deteriorated so far and so fast.  That is a melancholy fact, but it is one of which we have to take account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was talking in opposition.  It was the then Government in England which had taken over.  If one traces the records one will find the situation sometimes, apparently easy, and sometimes apparently menacing.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, and as I think I pointed out myself a couple of years ago, that is a feature of all such situations. There is that uncertainty about them.  There is a steady trend and a steady pressure characterised by two things: unrest, and the expenditure of money and effort on armaments and warlike preparations.</P>
    <P>These are the infallible signs that tension is there, the political signs if you like.  Sometimes they look threatening and sometimes they look as if they had eased.  Sometimes, when you look over the papers for a period you feel inclined to say that things are all right, but to-morrow when you look at the paper you feel that you may have war soon.  But underneath there is this hard current of expenditure, of effort and of money on armaments and preparations for war.  There is that essential tension in the areas concerned. That means that there is a certain danger at any time, and that situation will ultimately result in the cost of lives.</P>
    <P>Following on from that we had the development of the Korean crisis.  Incidentally, there is one thing that we had better get clear now.  Let us face this defence situation on common ground.  Where are we?  Sometimes people will say that they agree with the Government in their defence policy while others will say that the Government are alarmists.  They will say that the speaker does not believe there is any danger, that, in fact, if the speaker was pressed he would say that he did not think there was any danger at all, and that we were wasting our time and money.  I think it has even been suggested that we forced the last Government into taking action on defence. Well, I think that would be an extraordinary situation if a Government was going to be forced against <Col N="570" /> its judgment into doing something merely by pressure of that nature.  It would not speak very well for the Government concerned.</P>
    <P>However, the fact is that at the time of the Korean outbreak there was a certain economic difficulty here.  It was the Taoiseach in the last Government who himself, I think, at Wexford&mdash;I have sent for the reference&mdash;painted a very alarming situation.  It was in these latter years that Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy MacEoin agreed that the situation was sufficiently serious for action to be taken.  I am merely referring to these matters in the hope that, not so much Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy MacEoin, but that certain other Deputies can see that we were pretty definite on the basis on which we faced this.  It will help us all to know just precisely on what basis we are facing it.  We have had, however, that steady development in the position and who can say that things have eased?  I think it was two years ago in the debate on the Estimate&mdash;the reference will be found in Volume 120, Nos. 4 and 5, of the 18th April and the 19th April, 1950&mdash;that some of us went into considerable detail in regard to preparations and expenditure by foreign Powers.  I do not intend to repeat all that, but the fact is that even at that time there was a considerable amount of energy and money being expended.  I have here the data relating to the various countries which I then gave, showing the reactions of such countries as Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, Portugal and Spain.  All these countries were straining themselves to the limit, quite apart from the big armament programmes of the principal Powers of the world and those which were actually committed in Korea.</P>
    <P>That situation has not essentially eased.  The various programmes for the development of forces in the European countries, large and small, continues at a high pressure.  The expenditure on defence in these countries continues.  Let anyone take, for instance, the British Estimates for this year.  It is significant that the Opposition in England, having been a <Col N="571" /> Government, as well as the Government, are at one on this: that it represents a very big strain on the British economy.  The expenditure and effort in the United States is certainly almost of a disturbing nature.  While we read about that in the newspapers we know that the international tension has been masked by certain features.  The first factor that tends to be masked is that there is no very significant change anywhere. The mere repetition of the deductions to be drawn from the development of the armament drive is not news in the sense that it is merely repetition and does not attract the people's attention.  Consequently you have the peculiar factor of an economic situation in the world which at the moment is attracting a certain amount of attention and which, in some respects anyway, has the appearance and the dimensions of a slump. These factors are masked behind all that.</P>
    <P>You have, as we have read in the last few days, an unresolved situation in Korea, a threatening situation in Germany, a steady development in regard to Western defences as far as that can be achieved, and the upsurge and continued development of armaments with requests for larger and larger sums in the principal manufacturing armament countries.  I have taken at random a week's file of an English newspaper.  You find there a variety of opinions.  There is a note in it about an increase in the reserve strength of the British reserve forces. It is just a small paragraph but it shows a substantial increase.  Within that file I also find a reference to the development of civil defence, a reference to and a photograph of atomic explosions, on the one hand, and of atomic military tests in America on the other.</P>
    <P>Now, from all these varied facts, one thing seems clear&mdash;there is an underlying tension and, to use the words I used in 1948, when that tension will reach breaking-point, if it does, is anybody's guess; but it is there.  There is unrelieved effort and there is a situation in regard to the relations of the <Col N="572" /> two blocs which is certainly not normal and has all the appearance of being in danger of a military rupture.  That particular estimate is borne out by the fact that the small countries and the neutral countries, as well as the countries that you might regard as the active members of the bloc, have all found themselves constrained to spend proportionately large sums of money on national defence, for instance, Switzerland and Norway, and at the same time to put a strain on their economy, which it undoubtedly is, the type of strain that we have heard mentioned here, but which is not felt here to anything like the same extent as the strain on countries in which compulsory military service has been introduced.  I could tell the House, as I have done on previous occasions, but I do not see the sense in repeating it&mdash; it has been said on a number of Estimates when I was on the other side of the House, and I see no reason for changing my point of view now that I am here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not yet broken out, but let us hope it will not. It would be a very rigid thing to commit oneself in this respect.  It is merely a personal estimate.  I may be completely wrong in that but I will deal with the time factor in a moment, if the Deputy will allow me.  I have a purpose in saying this which, admittedly, I am a long time coming to, but I would like to substantiate my allegations.  If you consider for instance the extension of terms of conscription, the introduction of wider conscription in countries all over Europe, you will agree that the estimate that things are not normal and that there is a certain tension is a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us look at what we are doing about defence.  One would think, to hear some of the things that were said in this House, that we were making an extraordinary effort in money, in energy and in the commitment of our national resources towards defence at <Col N="573" /> the present moment.  The hard, solid fact is that we are probably unique amongst the nations of Europe at the moment in merely making what one might call the normal peace-time effort of a country under normal peace-time conditions, because that is all we are doing.  Do not let us fool ourselves that we are making an extraordinary all-out defensive effort.  We are doing nothing more than making what one might call the ordinary provisions for defence, the ordinary insurance provision that a country would make under normal peace-time conditions such as obtained in the early 1930's.  Look at the ratio of our defence expenditure to our national income or our budgetary effort.  It is big to us, I agree, but examine that ratio&mdash;I have given the figures for the years I mentioned&mdash;in regard to comparable ratios for other countries at the present moment where they are making an extraordinary effort; for instance, the case of Spain which is around the 30 per cent. mark. There are others, but I have taken that one at random from memory.</P>
    <P>With regard to the forces we are providing and their equipment, we are actually doing nothing than would be, as I have said, normal peacetime insurance. It has always been accepted, the world being as it is, that even in peacetime as we used to know it in the days of the 1930's, one of the duties, or responsibilities if you like, of an independent nation was to make some provision towards its own defence.  It was usual in those days to reduce that provision to the minimum necessary. In fact, in our case we reduced it very much below the minimum.  I have asserted, and I repeat and reiterate it, that we are doing nothing more than making normal peacetime provision, and let nobody remain under the illusion that we are spending money excessively on a special effort in regard to defence, in the light of the particular situation threatening at the moment. We are merely making a normal effort &mdash;an effort that we would nearly have to make and should make if there was no immediate threat or tension there at all.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to appreciate this.  I can speak with a certain <Col N="574" /> amount of personal knowledge&mdash;and Deputy MacEoin, having been in headquarters and having been Minister, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was before him, will know the details of this history as well as I do now&mdash;when I say that the situation was this: that in 1944-45 the General Staff was told to prepare for peace.  I was a member of that staff engaged on that particular work at the time.  We thought we were preparing for peace and the direction of the Minister and the civil end was that it would have to be done as economically as possible.  The Army knew that and that the task was to provide a normal defence insurance under ordinary peacetime conditions. That requirement was worked out; it was threshed out with the civil department, with the Department of Finance, and ultimately at Government level.  The establishments that were brought out after the war are still the establishments.  The establishments that resulted from that situation were the establishments, as I say, for normal peacetime and there has not been any alternation, even in face of the most serious threat and tension that is there at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I have thought it necessary to emphasise that, because the way some people are talking you would think the Government here&mdash;and when I say the Government the same remark could be applied to the last Government sitting here&mdash;was making every effort to strain the economy of the nation to make extraordinary provisions for defence. Admittedly, the provisions were greater than pre-war.  Why were they greater than pre-war?  During the emergency we were very favourably placed; we met a crisis in a situation and under certain circumstances which proved to be extraordinarily favourable and the repetition of which could not be counted upon in any similar emergency in the future.  Even under those conditions the provisions made for defence pre-war were found by experience to be totally inadequate.  What we advocated in 1948&mdash;and this was on the record, and if Deputies are interested objectively I would suggest that they read the record&mdash;was objectively to learn the lessons of those days in <Col N="575" /> the spirit of thankfulness that we could learn such lessons so painlessly.</P>
    <P>However, in the nett, I might summarise it thus.  Taking a standard of normality&mdash;if you like a rather difficult thing to define; it is, perhaps, in the long run very hypothetical&mdash;and equating our position to something like that in the very early 30's or any normal peace time, we have certain facts emerging&mdash;that the present international situation and more locally the situation in the part of the world in which this island is situated is one of tension, be it great or little; but there is indication of considerable tension when measured by the measuring sticks I have mentioned&mdash;expenditure of effort, the development of armaments, the expenditure of money and so forth. In that same situation we in this country are only making a normal effort towards defence.  Let us be clear on that.  I am not going to go any further on that road at the moment. If I were to advocate more.  I could very well imagine what some people would say about me.  It is time enough to consider the other matter afterwards. Let us bring our normal defences to the highest possible pitch of efficiency.  It is there, I think, we are all fundamentally agreed that the provision should be made.  Deputy O'Higgins has suggested that there is a difference of viewpoint between us in regard to the distribution of forces. He suggested that we were prepared to see a strong standing Army and F.C.A., and that his outlook would be to forget about the standing Army and concentrate on the F.C.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is slightly exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  It is an exaggeration to say that that is the Government's view, if it is exaggerated. The fact is that it is a mistake to try to isolate the three elements in the forces and deal with them separately. We have got to regard our forces as an integral unit as I will try to demonstrate in a moment.  In order to be logical and to attempt to deal with the development of our Defence Forces at <Col N="576" /> the moment, I propose to deal with strength first and armament afterwards and then other things.  If I deal with any particular isolated matter I want to guard myself against being just taken in an isolated manner.  I want it to be realised that equipment and all these things are essentially tied up in the end with one another.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that I was very glad to see Deputy Dr. O'Higgins's appreciation of certain factors in regard to our strength and also the fact that we have largely in this country to rely on what he called individual strength.  At column 357 of the Official Report, Volume 132, No. 3, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to give a reality to the force and I think the situation is sufficiently serious and sufficiently permanent to impress on the Minister, on the Army and on the Dáil that we are never going to have an Army equipped as a modern Army is and should be and that we have got to rely on numbers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, I interpret that as a certain emphasis on the importance of the individual and with that general sentiment I would, to a large extent, agree.  I also want to say that by way of qualification&mdash;and here I agree with General MacEoin&mdash;that I think it is a mistake if we try to become technical experts.  I want to try to guard against that completely as far as I can myself.</P>
      <P>First of all, we have not got the information. We have not got the facilities of a staff.  We have not the up-to-date information in regard to methods, weapons and so forth.  In other words, we are not equipped to do the staff work.  I think it is a mistake for us to go too far into detail and to pontificate on what way the Army should be organised and what way the Army should do that.  I think that is a matter on which the Minister or the House will get more sure advice from the Army.</P>
      <P>In certain general terms I think it is good for us to discuss and to appreciate some of the wider ideas involved if we are careful just not to fall into the trap of becoming altogether what is sometimes called an &ldquo;armchair soldier&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Let us look at the position with regard to strength to see actually the three elements you need.  You need the permanent force for reasons that I will outline in a moment.  It is absoluately indispensable.  You need the First Line Reserve for reasons I will outline in a moment.  Then you have the major part of the voluntary force in the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>I will agree that, perhaps, sufficient emphasis has not been laid in the past on the training and development of that element and that, in fact, it will be a very large element in the Defence Forces of the country but if you have not the First Line, too, you will find it impossible to organise the F.C.A.  One has to ask oneself, therefore, what are the proportions?</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about a particular figure of 12,000.  As I pointed out before, that figure is very simply resolved.  Having considered the potentialities, proportions and requirements, the Government, on the considered recommendations of the General Staff and having threshed out with the civil Department the ratio for a workable Defence Force which would be largely dependent on the F.C.A.&mdash;the bulk of the total Defence Force was to be composed of the F.C.A. and an efficient F.C.A. was a <i>sine qua non</i> to an effective force in the long run&mdash;decided that the minimum establishment of the permanent force would have to be 12,000.  That is the whole, simple story.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy General MacEoin, as Minister, read the relevant memorandum which was prepared by the Government at the time.  He will have read all the documents. Having been previously a Minister, he knows, as well as the present Minister himself does, what the factors were and what the basis of that recommendation was.</P>
    <P>The first point is that our Defence Forces, from the viewpoint of general defence, are ones composed of these parts, and these parts are interdependent on each other for their efficiency and effectiveness.  One part is largely futile without the other.  To that extent, Deputy O'Higgins is perfectly right.  A force of 12,000 men, <Col N="578" /> with nothing more, may have a certain value in a particular locale.  However, from the point of view of national defence, it would mean relatively little.  It is equally true that a force of 100,000 F.C.A. men could not be effective unless there was an adequate cadre of regular force to supply certain wants in relation to them and in relation to defence generally&mdash;wants which I will outline in a moment.  Therefore, do not let us get confused or sidetracked by the suggestion that we are facing the Defence Estimate on the basis of, say, one side of the House advocating a large volunteer force of F.C.A., and on the basis of another side of the House advocating a small standing Army and no F.C.A. force. There is no such issue involved.  The issue involved, if there is any issue, is the actual minimum strength of the standing Army necessary to support the F.C.A. and to meet the other requirements which I indicated that I would outline.  The General Staff, after due consideration of certain conditions which I roughly outlined a few months ago, and which the Minister, when in Opposition, and others in Opposition who are in the know have reiterated over a period of years, to the extent that they do not need reiteration again, arrived at the conclusion that there should be a certain minimum standing Army.  That minimum was accepted, on the civil side, not only by the Department of Defence, but also by the Department of Finance and by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do the answer to that one. The fact is that it did, as it very properly should.  I mentioned the Department of Finance to show that the matter was very thoroughly examined, as that Department is very efficient in such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not lead me up an avenue other than the one I wish to follow.  That is the best answer I can make.  Another point has been <Col N="579" /> made here, and there is a certain amount in it when put one way but, when related to the actual over-all position, it does not mean anything. I do not want to misquote Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, but I think I heard him saying: &ldquo;What is the difference, does it matter whether it is 12,000, 10,000 or 8,000?  What is 3,000 in the difference?&rdquo; I heard Deputy MacEoin making the same suggestion at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No. That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were talking about a standing army as an isolated factor and there were nothing more to it, there would be a lot in that point. When we have to face the issue as the General Staff and the Government had to face it on the basis of: &ldquo;What have we got to provide for defence?&rdquo; it is another matter.  Having answered that question and finding that they have a local defence reserve of so many units and so much equipment for them, they have to find out how many whole-time maintenance men, and so on, will be required.  After that, it is desirable to have a certain minimum to perform certain jobs, which I promise to outline in a moment.  When we know the numbers that perform duties methodically, we establish a certain figure as a minimum. If we go below that particular minimum, we have to scrap the whole scheme and get a more economic and restricted one.  The scheme having been decided and, as far as I know, approved by both Governments&mdash;the inter-Party Government, during their period of office, made no show or attempt to alter it&mdash;we have got to have a minimum force of permanent, whole-time personnel to make the scheme a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason for having the permanent force at the strength at which it is.  I will come to the details which will make definite the idea I am trying to put over.  I am not dealing with peacetime; we have got to base our efforts on the fabric of an emergency, but even in peacetime a certain force is required.  Having agreed to the F.C.A.  Force which Deputy MacEoin wants, it is necessary to <Col N="580" /> maintain that force effectively, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins pointed out, speaking from his own experience. There are certain passages of his speech on this Estimate with which I am in agreement.  I agree with him that to maintain that force a certain number of regular, whole-time personnel is necessary.  One of our big difficulties in the past was that we were never allowed to have sufficient whole-time personnel attached to our volunteer reserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the case, even during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and for that reason I say there are certain points as regards this matter on which I am in agreement with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  I was a member of an equivalent force&mdash;the Volunteer Force &mdash;and one of our great difficulties was that it took us a long time to make it felt that such assistance was needed, and we did not get that assistance until towards the end.  I am speaking from my experience in the Volunteer Force from 1934 to 1939.  On a number of occasions in the past, on the opposite side of the House, I tried to point out that there is a limit to the size of the volunteer force that can be maintained and that that limit is set by the strength of the permanent force.  If my recollection serves me correctly, I went into that matter before.  If an effective force of 100,000 F.C.A. men is to be maintained it must be considered whether it should be supervised by a certain number of regular officers and N.C.O.s, both for training and for administration purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are serious about the point that the F.C.A. is to be the effective force Deputy MacEoin wants it to be, we must commit ourselves, straightway, to a substantial number of personnel. In other words, to make all such reserve units effective, particularly Volunteer Reserve units, a certain cadre of a permanent force is necessary.  My own personal opinion is that we have always been in want of that in this country and that we have always been prone to underestimate the strength of the cadre required and to underestimate the demands that <Col N="581" /> would be made on it, both for administration and for training.  Not only that, but we have the whole question of the supply; that is, the local units. On top of that there must be a superstructure. Look into it and you will find that it will be impossible to supply that superstructure in the ordinary way on a voluntary basis, the nucleus of that superstructure, anyway, planning staffs, supply staffs, maintenance staffs, etc.</P>
    <P>When you go into that requirement you find that you have committed yourself to a substantial number out of your establisment, but that is not all you want out of your defence force. Visualise what can happen on the outbreak of an emergency or when danger threatens.  You have the question of local security, of installations, of communications, and over all the question of mobilisation.  The question of local security first of all means that you must have certain regular units.  It will take you a time to mobilise your volunteer units, even locally, into their positions.  If the State is to have any measure of protection it must have a certain amount of immediate protection and that can only be provided by a certain number of regular units.  Take the City of Dublin, take Government Buildings, take the protection of important installations like Poulaphouca or Ardnacrusha; you need a certain number of regular troops who will be always ready to be called upon. In addition, it is highly desirable to have a small force available for immediate action anywhere in the country. I do not want to go into too much detail because this is really a technical matter for the staff, but the fact is that some fighting forces are immediately necessary, however they are to be distributed. That presupposes a certain strength in the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>Actually, if you sum up all the requirements you find that you are committed to a lot more than the number in the regular establishment. That difficulty will be overcome by the First Line Reserve.  You must have regular units under establishment with vacancies to be filled immediately on mobilisation by reservists.  You then have those units ready made and formed <Col N="582" /> in all their parts provided they are of sufficient strength and that again puts a minimum to the establishment you can maintain.  If you have a First Line Reserve they can quickly and easily be brought in and their units are much more highly trained and mobile than local units.  By means of the First Line Reserve device you can make the regular Army go a lot further than it could if you have not this First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out on previous occasions on this Estimate these Forces are required and it is surprising how they can be absorbed.  Take 1940.  We had an Army of 14,000 men but that Army had absorbed a good deal of the Reserve.  We obtained that number because we mobilised 19,000 men in the previous September.  Some had been exempted but the balance had been incorporated for nine months afterwards and were virtually regulars by that time.  When the 1940 emergency came, when local security requirements had been met, when the cadres had been distributed to mobilise the emergency army, out of that army of 14,000 men there were only approximately one or two company columns left for what you might call general combat duty.  The others were committed to local protection, mobilisation and garrison work.  When sufficient men had been found for those purposes out of that army of 14,000 men in the end there was only a company column or two available for operations.</P>
    <P>With that lesson in mind, it is quite obvious that our number of 12,000 is insufficient. The only justification is that that Army of 12,000 brought up by an adequate Reserve would give you a better hope than in 1940 and, from that position, would enable you to form your Second Line Reserve into what would be an effective First Line Reserve.  I am pointing that out because the <i>sine qua non</i> for efficiency both in the Regular Army and in the Reserve&mdash;and when I talk of the Reserve I mean the F.C.A., which is the major part of the Reserve nucleus and is of equal importance with any other element in the Forces&mdash;is that you have a nucleus, a cadre, of the Regular Army up to strength and able to fulfil its duty.  It is the skeleton upon which the whole <Col N="583" /> framework of the defence body is built and upon which its efficiency depends. Then there is the question of the First Line Reserve.  Its primary importance is that it must fill up the Regular Army and bring it up to a ready-formed sizable strength.  You might also have a number of First Line Reserve units as we had during the last war.  Certain battalions, I think, were mobilised which were practically all Reserve units at the beginning of the last war, and the country owes something to them.  I can think of one Regular Reserve Battalion, the members of which were not young, but which did trojan service at Portobello in 1940, the 7th Reserve Battalion; the 11th Volunteer Reserve Battalion was another.  I mention those because I had a certain amount of personal acquaintance with them.  There were others in the country, I know, in the South and in the West which had an equally creditable performance.  If we had enough reservists there is a lot to be said for that type of unit.</P>
    <P>The first thing, however, is to fill the Regular units, but our First Line Reserve is falling.  Why?  Our First Line Reserve was fed from our Regular Army.  As I pointed out three years ago, the flow to the Reserve depends on the flow to the Regular Army, which, in turn, depends upon the terms of service and on our effort to keep the Regular Army up to strength.  Deputies opposite saw that the Reserve was falling.  As early as 1948 I, myself, warned the Minister who then sat on these Front Benches that the danger of the Coalition policy of cutting down on defence was a drop in the strength of the Reserve.  Two factors were involved. I would not say that the drop in strength was completely responsible because the terms of service were involved as well.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan has given notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 24 on the Order Paper of 29th May last. The Department does seem to have some responsibility in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> payments and on that account I am allowing the matter to be raised. The Deputy, of course, will confine himself to that part of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give the facts of this matter and then appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to use the powers he has to make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to these fishermen for the loss they have sustained as a result of the operation of the 1939 Fisheries Act which came into force in 1948.  I put down a question to the Minister for Agriculture last week asking:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether or not he is aware of the grave hardship imposed on the islanders of Lough Ree as a result of being deprived of their licences for net fishing; and, if so, whether in view of the fact that fishing is their principal means of livelihood, he will have their case investigated with a view to making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the islanders concerned under the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951, or taking other suitable steps to alleviate their position.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that it was no political purpose that urged me to put down this question.  That should be plain to any member of the House and to the Parliamentary Secretary, because this calamity, as I describe it, happened outside my constituency and there are no votes involved for me personally.  I believe, however, that there is a grave matter of principle involved, and I propose, in the short time at my disposal and in my own way, to make the facts clear to the House.  I do not think it is necessary <Col N="585" /> at all for me or for anybody else to be an authority on the Fishery Acts in order to establish the case which these islanders have.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is humane enough not to wish to see an injustice done to a section of the community who have very few to speak on their behalf.  Consequently, I want to make it clear to him that the question of political capital does not arise, so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>The position briefly is that, in the past six or eight weeks, three young men from one of the islands on Lough Ree went to prison rather than pay a fine for having been allegedly in possession of trout caught on the River Shannon.  These young men, as a matter of principle, refused to pay the fine imposed on them in the local court, on the ground that they had netted on Lough Ree all their lives, that they had fished for their livelihood in the same manner and in the same waters as their fathers and grandfathers before them, and that the fishing they carried on was the mainstay of their livelihood.  These men's families have not got farms to enable them to make a living and to rear their children, and from time immemorial they have depended solely for their livelihoods on the fish they netted in the waters of Lough Ree.  Due to the operation of the 1939 Act, which came into force on 1st January, 1948, these fishermen were prohibited from carrying on fishing in these waters.  I want to make it clear that when ownership of the Shannon waters was being transferred to the present authority, the Electricity Supply Board, a special clause was inserted which set out that the existing rights must be respected or due compensation paid.  Is it not quite clear to everybody in the House that if the fathers and grandfathers of the men who live on the islands of Lough Ree fished in those waters for the past 100 years, their sons to-day have a similar right to fish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back 1,000 years, if you like.  Is it not also clear that if they were deprived of that right to fish, suitable compensation <Col N="586" /> should have been given to them?  When this prohibition came into effect, claims were made on behalf of these fishermen for compensation.  These claims so far have been ignored.  I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary last week to the fact that the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board, Mr. Browne, declared in no uncertain fashion that he believed that the fishermen who live on the islands of Lough Ree were entitled to suitable compensation for the loss of their livelihood. No mention has since been made of compensation for these men, and to-day there is one young man still in jail.  Two were released last week when their time expired.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied to one of my Supplementary Questions last week in these terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the matter of the Shannon, compensation has not been paid for the reason that it has not been shown that the Electricity Supply Board in fact permitted these fishermen to fish in Lough Ree, and, in the absence of such permission there is no power to pay them compensation.  If it can be shown that they were in fact fishing with the permission of the Electricity Supply Board the question of compensation will then arise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Just imagine that statement from the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;If it can be shown that they were in fact fishing with the permission of the Electricity Supply Board the question of compensation will then arise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These men were fishing on Lough Ree before the Electricity Supply Board or the Parliamentary Secretary were heard of and their fathers and grandfathers fished in those waters before Cromwell came to this country. Because they had not the permission of the Electricity Supply Board to fish in those waters, they are now deprived of their means of livelihood on the one hand or suitable compensation on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to realise that there is a serious principle involved in this, that perhaps due to a slip-up in administration or legislation, this tragedy has taken place but that is no excuse for this House allowing that position to <Col N="587" /> continue.  The Parliamentary Secretary should remember that other issues have been raised in this House in the past and even raised throughout the country.  These things may have started in a small way, but when public opinion gathered force behind a really good case the Government in power was forced to act in accordance with the wishes of the people.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should tackle this problem before a similar situation arises in this case.  I can assure him that there are many people and many organisations at the present time interesting themselves in a very serious way over the problem of these unfortunate fishermen who have been deprived of their livelihood by the State.  This House should tolerate no delay in having their grievance rectified.  Such barefaced robbery and such contempt for the rights of the people could not be paralleled outside the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>Let me put it this way.  These fishermen and their families depended on the netting of salmon, trout and eel on Lough Ree for a livelihood. That was the method by which they reared their families.  But supposing that to-morrow morning the State acquired the house of some public representative, took it over in the interests of the State and handed it to the Electricity Supply Board, without compensation to the owner, I would expect a queer uproar in this House. Supposing the State acquired a man's farm of land, his means of livelihood, and handed it over to the Land Commission and gave no compensation to that man, there would be a queer uproar in this House in order to have that grievance remedied.  Yet here we have the position that a small group of defenceless fishermen have been deprived of their livelihood by State interference and no compensation whatever is offered to them for the loss of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House on this particular matter as there are other Deputies here who, I am sure, wish to raise other points in connection with it.  I want clearly to say to <Col N="588" /> the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not a political issue and I hope that no attempt will be made to make it one.  It is a question of right to see that this terrible wrong done to these individual families will be corrected. I can promise that, as far as I am concerned, if no steps are taken I will travel around that county and other parts of Ireland to organise and see that pressure is brought to bear on whatever Government is in power to remedy a wrong like that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will find an example in Galway City which he knows perfectly well.  Along the River Corrib, and at the famous Salmon Weir Bridge, all the rights of fishing for salmon, eel and trout belong to one individual, an alien. Those rights are worth thousands of pounds, but as soon as those rights are acquired by the State that individual is going to be suitably compensated&mdash; make no mistake about it&mdash;and rightly so, from the point of view that it is from that he has made his livelihood, even at the expense of hundreds of people in the locality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely referring the Parliamentary Secretary to that aspect of it, that that man will be compensated for his loss when the rights are acquired from him.  Surely the State will see that justice is done to a group of Irish fishermen who have been deprived of their livelihood, their right to net salmon and trout, and that the State will give them suitable compensation.  I look on the Parliamentary Secretary as an honourable man who will not allow his conscience to be overruled in this particular matter, a man who will not try to hide behind the evasive tactics of the Electricity Supply Board and the Department of Agriculture in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, it has been a matter in which the Electricity Supply Board say they have no function.  The Department of Agriculture say they have no function, that it is a problem of the Electricity Supply Board.  Between the two bodies concerned, the unfortunate fishermen are left without compensation.  There <Col N="589" /> is only one body which can finally adjust matters and there is only one man in the position at the moment to take immediate steps to remedy this grievance.  That man is the Parliamentary Secretary and I look with confidence to the efforts he will make to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene to say that the facts of the case have been stated by Deputy McQuillan very fully.  There is one point I want to stress, that prior to the present time the fishermen were divided upon the question as to whether they would accept compensation, whether they could be compensated for the loss of their livelihood.  They have now decided that compensation is the only thing they can get.  The facts are that their livelihood has been taken from them or is in the process of being taken from them and the only way they can be dealt with is by giving them ample compensation.  I agree that it is a big question, but the compensation must be such that it would be adequate to meet the loss they have sustained.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House.  I rise to support Deputy McQuillan in his appeal to the Minister.  I was in the House when this measure was passed and I think Deputy MacEoin was also here.  At that time we all understood that if there was an injustice perpetrated or found out it would be remedied. Deputy McQuillan is merely asking for ample compensation, and if that compensation cannot be paid that the rights be restored to the persons concerned.  Deputy McQuillan says they have been fishing there all their lives and that their fathers and grandfathers were fishing there for hundreds of years.</P>

When the case is made as it has been made by the two previous speakers, it is up to the House to see that the wrong perpetrated and now discovered will be set right immediately.  I know that at the time the Act was passed there was a number of points involved.  I remember <Col N="590" /> a time when the Electricity Supply Board were looking for a certain privilege&mdash;they are a monopoly, as we all know&mdash;and they got this privilege.  Now that they have got it and that it has been discovered that an injustice has been done, it is up to the Minister to introduce legislation immediately that will remedy the present position.</P>

      <P>I should say that if there is any happy side to this particular discussion it lies in the fact that I can agree with everything that has been said on this subject &mdash;strange as it may seem.  What I was trying to do for Deputy McQuillan when he questioned me very closely on this was to indicate to him that these people were aiming at the wrong target.</P>
      <P>I could not convince them of that, but that is the position.  It has been sought to make the public believe that the prohibition on fresh-water netting which came into operation on the 1st January, 1948, is the enactment which took the livelihood away from the people of Lough Ree.  Will Deputy McQuillan or Deputy General MacEoin assert here that the Electricity Supply Board had not prevented netting for trout in Lough Ree before the 1st January, 1948?</P>

The Electricity Supply Board came along and, in my opinion, deliberately broke the law.  Revolver shots were fired, and so forth.  The Electricity Supply Board gave a general permit to fish until the time for the compensation to be paid under the Act expired.</P>

If Deputy General MacEoin can now come forward and satisfy my Department that these men were netting trout in the Shannon with the permission of the Electricity Supply Board, they come within this Act.  I am afraid Deputy MacEoin's information is not correct and that he is confusing two things.  I should like to reassert the position again in case Deputy General MacEoin does not appreciate the significance of what he has said.  If they were fishing for trout with the permission of the Electricity Supply Board until the time the national prohibition became operative, the case is settled.  We can pay them compensation.

Here is what the Act says: Deputy McQuillan and Deputy General MacEoin were in the House when it was passed as recently as the end of last year.  It says: &ldquo;... where nets for the capture of fish were lawfully used.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; is the operative word.  The only proof the legal advisers of the Department will accept is the proof submitted by the Electricity Supply Board that, in fact, they were netting trout with the permission of the Electricity Supply Board.  That is the only proof that will satisfy that section.  If we can get the proof, we can pay the compensation.  When the netting was stopped I understand that claims were made by a number of the fishermen&mdash;I do not know if claims were made by all of them&mdash;and that the Electricity Supply Board did not, in fact, pay these claims.</P>

      <P>That is what it means. We must be guided by our legal advisers as to the form of words that goes into these provisions.  If we leave out the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; every man who casts a net in this country will be entitled to compensation.

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy McQuillan, and I hope he will let me talk now without interruption. This continuous series of interruptions seems to suggest to me that my case is much stronger than even I had thought.  We have not much time left to explain this difficult matter.  For Deputy Byrne's information, an attempt was made by my predecessor to restore some of the rights which had been taken from these men.  On 12th <Col N="595" /> August, 1949, the Minister for Agriculture made a by law legalising the use of nets in Lough Ree for the capture of coarse fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened?  I take it that it was done on the advice of the person nominated in the fishing interest to the Electricity Supply Board by the same Minister, now Deputy Dillon, who made the by-law. The Electricity Supply Board refused to give permission to the men of Lough Ree to catch coarse fish&mdash;in spite of the fact that the Minister had made a by-law.  Now, if Deputy Dillon was unable to get for the Lough Ree fishermen the permission of the Electricity Supply Board to catch coarse fish&mdash;in spite of the fact that the man who was advising the board was his own nominee, recently appointed&mdash;is it not obvious that the same position exists for me and that, <Col N="596" /> in effect, and in fact, the Shannon fisheries have been made a several fishery vested in the Electricity Supply Board to the exclusion of even the fishery authority?  We cannot force the Electricity Supply Board to give permission to use nets even for coarse fish.</P>
