      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation to take such powers as are necessary to ensure a guaranteed standard of article or quality of produce supplied from our industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1946, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is required to formulate specifications for such commodities, processes and practices as the Minister for Industry and Commerce may from time to time request, and the Minister may by Order declare the specification to be a standard specification.  The Minister is also empowered to prescribe by Order a mark for use in connection with a specified commodity to indicate that it conforms to a particular standard specification.  It is hoped that the machinery thus set up will, aided by the force of public opinion, in time have the effect of ensuring that goods for which standard specifications have been prescribed will conform to those standards. I have urged manufacturers of goods for which standard specification Orders have been made and who wish to have the quality of their goods established beyond controversy, to adopt the practice of using the standard mark.  I hope that an increasing number of manufacturers will follow this practice.  For the present, I am not satisfied that any further legislation is necessary in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The flour subsidy is not paid direct to flour millers.  It is paid to Grain Importers (Éire), Limited, the central body set up in 1939 to deal with wheat imports.  Imported wheat is distributed to millers by that company at such a price as will enable millers to sell flour of 85 per cent. extraction at the controlled price.  The losses sustained by the company in so doing are repaid to the company at regular intervals out of the Vote for flour subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a slowing-up of production in certain tanneries owing mainly to the temporarily decreased demand for leather by home footwear manufacturers and other users.  In view of this position, I have decided that export licences should be freely issued for such leathers as can be sold abroad.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the name of the representative of agricultural interests on the Cork Harbour Board and if, in view of the unfair harbour dues charged by the Cork Harbour Board on artificial fertilisers in comparison with those charged on other commodities imported, the interests of which are directly represented on the board, he will either make representations to the harbour board to reduce the dues charged on this essential agricultural commodity or appoint a second representative of agricultural interests on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Harbour Board is constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946.  The Act does not provide specifically for the representation of the interests to which the Deputy refers, and the basis of representation is designed to secure efficient harbour <Col N="452" /> administration as well as the provision of adequate portal facilities for all classes of traffic and for all users of the port.</P>
      <P>The maximum rates for fertilisers at Cork were fixed by Order in 1941.  The harbour commissioners have discretion to charge rates lower than those prescribed in the Order.  It is open to agricultural interests to approach the harbour board for a reduction in the rates levied on fertilisers if it can be shown that the rates charged are in fact excessive.</P>

      <P>Whatever Deputy Dillon may have heard or may not have heard as to what the Irish Ambassador said in Manchester on the 24th February, there was certainly nothing in his speech which could give even the most flimsy excuse for the slanderous statement made by Deputy Dillon regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ambassador based his speech on articles in the December number of <i>Studies</i> which reviewed the material progress here between 1921 and 1951. He pointed out that in spite of a great deal of thought and hard work and a great variety of schemes to encourage and improve production, the fact <Col N="457" /> remained that since 1921 there had been no increase in the output of agriculture commensurate with the great increase in industrial development, fuel and power production, international trade and sea communications, etc.</P>
    <P>What was the reason for this, he stated, was difficult to say, and as he was not an expert he would not venture any opinion.  One thing, however, was certain, he said: the standard of living of the Irish farmer was much higher to-day than it was ever before. He gave some particulars regarding rural electrification, growth in the use of tractors, etc., and pointed to a spirit of scientific interest and economic awareness among farmers which was a very important augury for the future.  The Ambassador did not say anything even remotely approaching the statement that &ldquo;agricultural output is the same to-day as it was 50 years ago&rdquo;.  Indeed, it was in Ireland that this statement was made and by Deputy Dillon's former colleague, Deputy Norton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's information is not quite correct.  The amount of work recently available for outdoor weavers of Gaeltarra Éireann has declined owing to seasonal slackness in the trade and current demand for intricate cloth-designs for which home looms are unsuitable.

      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that during 1951 Gaeltarra Éireann kept their weavers working at a capacity which other industries were unable to equal.  In the meantime, there has been a filling-up of orders and a little interim period which it is hoped will soon pass.  As well as that, some of the orders which Gaeltarra Éireann had to fulfil had to be completed by the end of 1951 with the result that there was no chance of a carry-over in order to fill this period which is normally a slack period.</P>

They visited the Department in the past few weeks to try and get over this difficulty and even now it has not been adjusted.

      <P>I am aware that conversations have taken place between the county engineer and other officers of the Kerry County Council with the officials of my Department in this matter of suitable plans for rural houses in County Kerry.  I have stated in my reply that there are already seven different plans approved by my Department, any or all of which could be used by the county council for the erection of cottages.  I understand that an effort is being made to provide a further plan to meet all the different points of view that have been expressed. I take it from the fact that seven plans have been approved the council could scarcely contend that there was any impediment in the way of getting ahead with the erection of rural cottages.</P>

    <P>In line 31 before &ldquo;make&rdquo; to <Col N="474" /> insert the following words &ldquo;after consultation with the board and the association as hereinafter defined&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is quite obvious and I need not speak at length on it.  I feel that the Minister is taking very great power under this section to deal with the fishing industry and I think we should ensure that that power is, as far as possible, not left open to abuse.  This amendment will not bind the Minister in any way to follow the wishes either of the board or the association.  All I have suggested is that, before making any regulations, the Minister should consult the board and the association so that the wishes and views of both of these bodies can be had on the proposed regulations.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment because, as I said, I do not think it will bind the Minister when making regulations in any fashion and will ensure that the body which is to work the regulations and the association which is vitally concerned with the industry will have had an opportunity of putting their views before the Minister prior to the regulations being made.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill we are setting up a board and an association to advise the board and we shall stultify any advice which the association may give the board if we give the Minister power to make regulations without doing so in consultation with both the board and the association. After all, the association is merely advisory and if we are tying the hands of the board in advance by the Minister making the regulations himself, then the association will be absolutely useless and will not serve the purpose which the Parliamentary Secretary intends.  I therefore support the amendment and ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept it.</P>

We do not know who will constitute the board, whether it will be a team of civil servants or land lubbers who will constitute it.

      <P>The first observation I want to make about this section is that it is in common form.  If you examine any other provision for the making of regulations, you will find that it is worded exactly as this one is.  I have no objection to making an exception in this case if the Dáil or any considerable section of the Dáil so wishes, but I should like to observe that it is possible to visualise, particularly in relation to the fishing industry, that it may be necessary to make a regulation without having sufficient time to have the consultation provided for in the amendment and we could allow an abuse to develop simply because we are hamstrung by the necessity for calling the association together and consulting them, especially as I am not bound to accept the advice given at the consultation.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to accepting the amendment, but I think that Deputies will agree that it would be most unreasonable to ask me to accept a provision imposing compulsory consultation with the board and the association upon me.  The association will have to be called together.  I do not know how many hundred or thousand members there will be.  If I have to call them together and consult them to deal with an unforeseen contingency of an urgent character, it is quite conceivable that the industry may be placed in a difficult position.</P>

These regulations are to bind the board and those who are under the board, the body of fishermen in this country, and they will not have any say in regard to these regulations which will affect them in their daily lives.  I think it is a very unwise thing to do. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment.  We have no reason for putting down this amendment except the practicability of the matter.  I see no hurry and the Parliamentary Secretary has made no case for hurry with regard to the operation of this Bill.

      <P>My point was that the section, as it is, gives absolute power to the Minister.  It seems to me to be inequitable to hand over every advantage to the board or any member of the board.  For example, it might happen that the transport would be put under the care of Córas Iompair Éireann and the storage put in the board's premises.  It is not very easy to procure Córas Iompair Éireann transport without prior arrangement, for instance, in places like Helvick Head, Dunmore Passage and parts of County Cork and along the Cork coast. If such a decision were made it would put off the road private hauliers who are now hired to carry out the work. I think that that should be prevented. However, in view of the assurance now given, that the board will be consulted before any regulations will be made by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister and that any regulations made will have to go before both Houses of the Oireachtas I am satisfied.  Once I have drawn attention to the wide scope of the Section I feel I have done my duty by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), paragraph (a), line 48, after &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or a company incorporated prior to the 1st day of February, 1952, under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, whose objects are connected with sea fishing or unless the vessel is replacing, substituting or in exchange for a vessel which on the 1st day of February, 1952, is registered in the State under the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this amendment was to ensure that, should a company with a certain number of shares held outside Irish control be operating in Ireland on a given date, it will have power to continue its boats in operation here.  Should any boat be lost or damaged in such a way as to be capable of replacement by the insurance company, I would like that the company would have the power to continue operating a <Col N="478" /> boat which would be substituted for an existing boat and which comes within the scope of the Act.  I think it is not intended that the outside companies who are operating here at present and whose boats are damaged or rendered unseaworthy will be provided with any new boats.  I feel that the result of this amendment would be that a good deal of the boats which are financed by outside interests would be kept in operation.  It is in the interest of Irish nationals that the boats should operate.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that it was unintentional that this section should operate to prevent these boats being replaced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that what the Deputy seeks to achieve might be achieved by another method.  We want to secure full Irish ownership for our fishing fleet in this country.  It appears to me that there are very few cases that can be put forward that would be affected by this section.  The question should be resolved rather by tackling the problem from the point of view of ownership and qualifying a company to come within this section.  If this amendment were accepted it would open the door fully to the exploitation of our fishing industry by foreigners. I do not know whether the Deputy has had the same experience in this matter as I have had.  There were a great many foreign companies having shares who were doing simple people out of large sums of money and the operation was repeated many times.  While I have no obligation upon me to safeguard the money of private English citizens, I think it is desirable, from an Irish point of view, that the ownership of our boats should be 100 per cent. Irish.  I do not think the Deputy can make a case of real hardship arising from the operation of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention or no wish to promote the operation of boats in this country other than those under Irish control.  However, in so far as certain boats operated by outside concerns have been introduced into this country it does seem proper that if those boats continue to operate for the next 30 years they should be replaced should one of them become useless or <Col N="479" /> be lost at sea.  If the boats are allowed to operate the Irish market will be supplied and employment given to Irish fishermen.  We are not asking for additional boats for these companies, only just that the same number of boats as there are operating at present will be allowed to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Deputy anticipates some early loss to one of these boats, I feel that any company affected by this provision will have ample time for putting their houses in order and be in a position to continue fishing operations as they are at the present time.  The Deputy's method of meeting the problem, which he seems to think is a serious problem would open the door wide and would defeat the purpose of the section.  If he could find any less dangerous method of meeting the problem we might accept it.  However, his present method is quite unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does away with a good deal of competitive business elements in fishing.  If a person who is the owner or part owner of a vessel is directly engaged in the sale of fish then, although he can buy fish or obtain it from any other vessel he cannot get it from the one in which he has got a financial interest.  He would be most anxious to have his fish at the market by the quickest means possible and would take an interest in his own business by endeavouring to sell fish at the highest competitive price possible.  Business would be seriously affected.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; makes the law imperative and drastic. It is believed that this clause is mainly inserted because there was in Dublin during the emergency a certain trawling business, I will not mention its name, <Col N="480" /> which gave all the fish they had to their own retail shops.  If it is the intention to prevent such a thing happening again, I would like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is another section which defines the keel length of a boat which would automatically put that particular firm out of business.  There seems no justification for that.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the southern areas and those along the west coast of Ireland where a good fisherman induces a number of people to finance a boat. Most of the people in the area take shares primarily to have an industry established there with very little hope of ever getting a very substantial profit from their shares.  The man most interested in a boat in the fishing areas is the man who sells fish in the area. He is interested not so much in getting profit from the shares but rather in the fact that if the fish comes in he has the first claim.  If you are going to prevent anybody engaged in the fishing industry from having shares, you are going to put a stop to a good many boats engaging in fishing at all.  I must, in all fairness and in protection of the interests of the people concerned, oppose such a section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that type of person can be dealt with.  The section was devised to deal with the problem that exists in Dublin.  The Department approached this question from two angles.  A case was submitted by the retailers in the course of repeated representations that the retailers in Dublin were not getting a fair share&mdash; I think they stated in regard to prime fish&mdash;and that some of their competitors were in a very privileged position.  Apart from representations from retailers, we also received representations on behalf of the inshore fishermen mainly on the east coast that a part of the market was excluded from them and that a certain part of the market was already supplied before their fish appeared on the public market.  These two interests are being served or can be served by this provision.</P>
      <P>If the wording of it will be examined closely, it will be noticed that two alternatives are given to the board which are set out under (a) and (b):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The catches of the vessel shall be delivered for sale to the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The alternative is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Or disposed of according to the directions of the board.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The section covers the entire industry and there are various aspects of it that require considerable attention lest we do an injustice in this regard.  As distinct from people who had boats to increase their supply of fish for their own retail shops, there are people in this country who have boats of their own and deal with fish wholesale, that is to say, supply it to the local markets in Dublin <Col N="483" /> and elsewhere and export it to England.  What is their position under this section?  It would be really unworkable. I assume that these people are allowed to remain in business because I take it that under sub-section (6) (b) they may be empowered as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The catches of the vessel shall be delivered for sale to the board or disposed of according to the directions of the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is an implied alternative in that sub-section of disposing of the fish otherwise than giving them to the board.  Does that imply that people who are private owners at the moment, who have landed fish in their private boats having put considerable sums of money into their purchase, and have been supplying fish wholesale to Dublin and other towns and exporting them abroad, will be adversely affected? Will they be allowed to operate and to remain independent?  I would like to know what is the meaning implied in the alternative in the sub-section? That is to say, there is an alternative. What is meant by the alternative?  Are you going to allow other people to land fish and deal with them and dispose of them in whatever way they find suitable to their trade and which they have been carrying on always over years in the past?  This is not a question of to-day or yesterday.  We are handicapping those people.  Are the fish to be sold to the board or disposed of otherwise?  That seems to me to create an impossible situation from every point of view.  If these people are allowed to land fish at all, will they have to wait until instructions come from the board by which time the fish will be unsaleable and unfit for human food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This thing will have to be done in a matter of hours.  It would be a drawback to any business organisation if one were required to go back to get authority.  You might have to go for authority to &ldquo;A&rdquo; and if you could not get authority from him you would have to go to &ldquo;B&rdquo;.  That procedure would be all right where the goods involved were of an unperishable nature but we <Col N="484" /> are dealing with highly perishable goods which must be packed and iced immediately they are landed and put on the train in order to catch the boat that evening if the fish is for export.</P>
    <P>I should like to have that matter fully explained and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to be candid about it.  I should also like that this thing be made as flexible as possible so that the men in question would be in no way handicapped and that the machine would work automatically.  It should so work that the moment the fish are landed they could be packed and iced, put into a lorry and brought to the train which would catch the boat that night.  It must be the evening of the morning on which the fish are landed.  How is one going to consult a board sitting somewhere in Dublin on a matter of that kind?  You cannot do it.  The thing is utterly impracticable. It would mean, in practice, putting these men out of business; they could not carry on the fish business under conditions of that kind. As I say, that cannot be done because it would wipe the floor with them immediately.</P>
    <P>Apart from the section, perhaps thé Parliamentary Secretary might give us information on these matters.  I thought we could have heard his reply on Second Reading but, as the Parliamentary Secretary wanted to have the Second Reading gone through, we wished to accommodate him on that matter, but we are up against it now and this is the only opportunity we have of dealing with the matter.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate fully the implications of this entire section, particularly sub-section (6) (b).</P>

      <P>This section, to my mind, is the section which differentiates this Bill completely from the Bill introduced by the last Government. Under the last Government the scheme proposed was that only sea fishermen would be allowed to land fish.  Under the present Bill it is proposed to allow sea fishermen to land fish plus licensees who are going to be allowed to land fish.  I understand that the position was that the Parliamentary Secretary did not reply on the <Col N="485" /> Second Reading.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary, at this stage, to give the principles, if any, under which licences are going to be granted under this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is the section which is giving the most concern to inshore fishermen. The whole purpose of this section is to safeguard, as far as possible, the rights of the inshore fishermen.  It is well known that the trawlers can be a great source of danger to the rights of the inshore fishermen.  Under this section, the Minister is going to give power to grant licences which could, if the rights were abused, invalidate all the safeguards given under this Bill to inshore fishermen.  I would be glad, when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, if he would state the principles under which these licences are going to be granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is different from that of Deputy Costello because, on Section 5, my worry is not in regard to abuse of the licences but I feel that somebody following in the Parliamentary Secretary's place might take it into his head to impose some impossible restrictions or impossible conditions before granting the licences.  I believe there should be some safeguard for the public.  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider altering that and give the right of appeal to some higher authority, such as the district justice.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Parliamentary Secretary will impose impossible restrictions but is it not our duty to have a safeguard and are not the courts the proper authority to which a right of appeal should be made?  If impossible conditions and restrictions are put in, it would be wise that the right of appeal should be inserted in this clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that there was a previous Bill before the House and the intention was to limit the actual catching of fish to sea fishermen. Everybody was aware that the problem adverted to by the Parliamentary Secretary a few moments ago was one that was creating trouble at <Col N="486" /> that time.  It was quite clear to anyone familiar with the problem that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to that and that the whole of Section 9 is an attempt to get round that particular problem.  We are dealing with the question that we desire to have the catching of sea fish confined to Irish sea fishermen.  We know we have already got within the country an Irish trawler company which under the operation of the previous Bill was going out of existence.  The provision in respect of licences appeared to me to be fairly rigid.  I gathered from the Parliamentary Secretary that was designed to meet a particular problem that revolves around the existence of Irish owned trawlers.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (6) deals with the special problem that exists in Dublin.  The fish are brought in and the pick of the catch is reserved for a particular section and the remainder is made available on the public market.  Quite clearly, one of the purposes of the Bill is to ensure, in respect of the operations of any trawlers in this country, if they are going to operate, that they are going to operate under control and that the catch is made available for the distribution trade and the general public.</P>
      <P>Section 9 has been evolved to meet a problem and it seems to me that it was a very fair attempt to deal with the problem.  It does ensure that, in respect of the operation of Irish trawlers, there will be safeguards for the disposal of fish and that the disposal of fish will be on a certain basis.  Under certain conditions it must be landed and controlled by the board to which we are giging the general supervisory powers in respect of fishing.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy McMenamin on Section 9, sub-section (6) (b), line 15&mdash;&ldquo;... or disposed of according to the directions of the board&rdquo;&mdash;I take it that the direction of the board will be given in advance as to the disposal of fish at particular ports during particular periods and that there will not be a question of obtaining the direction of the board on the morning the fish are landed, as Deputy McMenamin <Col N="487" /> stated.  I take it that the direction will be given in advance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It will be completely discretionary so far as the board are concerned.  I wish to make a few remarks on sub-section (7) of this section.  The sub-section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A licence for a vessel shall be valid only if and so long as no person, other than a person named in the licence or his legal personal representative, is the owner, charterer or hirer of the vessel.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that when the licence lapses on the death of the owner of the vessel only the legal personal representative may obtain a new licence.  Pending the rearrangement of the estate of the late owner, what is to become of the vessel? She cannot be used for fishing purposes as there is no licence in existence to qualify her for use for that purpose. Could the Parliamentary Secretary amend the sub-section to enable an <i>ad interim</i> or temporary licence to be granted in respect of the vessel pending the giving of an annual licence to the legal personal representative so as to enable the vessel to get back to sea and join the fishing fleet immediately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see the section, the board appears to be empowered to give a licence to anybody for the purpose of fishing.  I do not say they would do it but there is nothing in the Bill to stop them from licensing anybody to have maybe half a dozen fishing boats and thus to create vested interests.  This Bill is supposed to protect the interests of the inshore fisherman. Surely, if the board is the sole arbiter in the matter of the issue of licences to all and sundry there is <Col N="488" /> nothing to stop the development of the state of affairs which exists at present whereby you have a fleet of trawlers, operated maybe by one person, doing all the fishing.  That person may have plenty of capital behind him and may be in a position to wipe out the inshore fisherman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not dealing with trawlers at all.  I am dealing with the inshore fisherman.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply to Deputy O'Donnell does not meet my objections. According to him, the directions should be given in advance but, of course, the directions will be discretionary.  Surely this House will not ask anybody in this country to invest money to get boats built to land fish and then tell them that it will be discretionary whether they can land fish or not. Such a person should have the right to land fish&mdash;either that, or we dispose of his existence altogether.  I am talking of the type of man who has been traditionally fishing with his own boats and landing fish and disposing of them wholesale.  That covers the expression &ldquo;whether he disposes of them internally or exports them.&rdquo;  It should be his right to do so and it should be clearly understood.  There should be no discretion about that.  That discretion should not be allowed to obtain because no man could be asked to carry on business under such conditions.  I should like a clear and explicit statement from the Parliamentary Secretary that these men who have put years of saving and of work and of the landing and selling of fish into getting another boat built so that they may now have a fleet of 6, 8 or 10 boats&mdash;having built up their own organisation efficiently and successfully&mdash;will have their rights. I am concerned about their rights.  The position must be clear and explicit.  I should like it to be definitely stated here so that people of that kind round the coast of Ireland would have their position clearly laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept a statement by the Parliamentary Secretary on the matter provided it safeguards the interests of people of that type.  These men have had standing crews all over the years and have a considerable amount of money invested in their <Col N="489" /> industry.  They have been doing their work efficiently and effectively.  It would be a very bad thing to let these men down now.  Are we now, under this Bill, going to convert them into mere fishermen and break up their organisation?  As I say, they have their boats and crews and even in a small way&mdash;though that does not matter because it is only a question of degree&mdash;they have their own lorries at the small landing places around the coast.  At these points they land the fish and transport them immediately to trains for Dublin and elsewhere. Even at night, when a catch of fish is landed and packed, the lorries rush off to Dublin with the fish.  What is to happen to all these people?  I should like an explicit statement from the Parliamentary Secretary that these men will not be left in the air when this Bill becomes law but that they will know whether they are in or out or under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a restriction that I dislike as much as any Deputy who has spoken.  It is only the sheer necessity of trying to meet this problem in some reasonable way that compels us to use this form of words in the Bill.  Another solution of this problem was contained in the 1950 Bill. If this can be termed &ldquo;drastic&rdquo; there is not a word in the language to describe the other provision because it simply swept them off the sea and put them out of business completely and without compensation.  We felt that&mdash; particularly in view of the fact that we are importing fresh fish&mdash;to put out of business with one stroke a fleet of boats which contribute to the national supply of fish, thereby reducing the home landings and increasing the imports, could not be justified on any grounds.  If this is an interference with the rights of private citizens surely it is very pale in comparison with the provision which it replaces.  We retain these other boats in operation and the employment which they give.  We retain for the Irish people their catches of fish.  The limited restriction which we place upon them has, in fact, been approved by some of those people who are affected by it.  Only yesterday I met a delegation of some of those <Col N="490" /> people affected by it and when I explained the provision they said it was all right.</P>

      <P>Deputy D. Costello raised the matter of the general principles on which this section is based. I do not know exactly what type of information he wants when he asks me about the principle which is involved. If he wishes me to make a comparison between it and the 1950 measure I would say that one principle enshrined in this Bill is to allow the greatest possible amount of personal freedom and initiative.  We are restricting only to the minimum the initiative of Irish citizens who want to engage in the fishing industry.  We have, as a fundamental objective, in any event, the maintenance of the present inshore fleet on the most profitable basis possible. That presents a very complex problem.  We feel that by acting fairly by all interests, including the consumer and the public who are going to finance the whole project, we are adopting the fairest and least hurtful method of achieving that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem now, which is becoming characteristic of the fishing industry in peace time, when fish is being marketed in Western Europe on a fairly plentiful scale.  That is that we find there is a decline here at home. The numbers engaged drop, and the quantity of landings drops.  We are now attempting to ensure that there will be some method of checking that decline <Col N="491" /> and of putting the industry on its feet. It is hardly to be expected that the inshore fishermen will be able to engage in the various fields of development such as the exploration of new fishing grounds, the trying out of new methods of fishing and various new methods of handling, fish refrigeration, fish meal, canning and all these other things and it is felt that a central authority should be established to do that work.  When they have carried out the experimental work, if private enterprise is prepared to come into the field and take over, the board will be only too pleased to hand over to them and give them the benefit of the experience they have gained.</P>

      <P>Section 10 is not the section in which the Minister will have the greatest power to impose conditions on applicants.  That power will arise principally under sub-section (5) of Section 9.  He has only to lay down conditions which will make it impossible for the applicant to carry on his licence.  I support the Parliamentary Secretary in so far as the section is generally concerned but I do think he might have said that the purpose of the section was to retain control over the question of trawlers and to prevent the intrusion of too great a number into the fishing industry and, secondly, to deal with the local problem in Dublin.  Having got these powers, I think he should bear in mind that, much as we have regard for him, he may not be always there to administer sub-section (5) and that it would be possible for his successor to lay down all sorts of conditions in regard to methods of sea fishing, places of disposal of catches, etc.  I would suggest that there should be some provision that if an applicant complies with the opening conditions that are required for the protection of the inshore fishermen <Col N="494" /> and to restrict the undue engagement of sea trawlers in the industry, the applicant should be afforded some protection against arbitrary discrimination. He is entitled to the right of an appeal to the court or to some other body that would measure whether or not the application of the section was fair or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I still think that the Minister's power to refuse is limited by Section 10.  With regard to sub-section (5) of Section 9 perhaps I ought to explain to Deputy Larkin what is intended to be achieved by it. Occasionally, you get complaints from fishermen around the coast that a particular bay is being over-fished.  You say to the fisherman: &ldquo;Why do you not go out fishing elsewhere and give the place a rest?&rdquo;  The reply you get is, why should they do so when their neighbours will not do so.  They say to you then: &ldquo;Make a general prohibition that will keep the whole lot of us out and we will agree.&rdquo;  It will be a hardship, if you like, but it will be applied all round.  That is the type of thing that is sought in sub-section (5).  Take Dingle Bay with, say, ten boats in it.  You give those people a licence along the Kerry coast to fish, but you say to them: &ldquo;You are not to fish for the next 12 months in Dingle Bay.&rdquo;  That gives the bay a rest and it revives as a fishing ground. The next year, if you think that the place can be profitably fished, you give a licence subject to the prohibition on fishing in Dingle Bay being removed.</P>
      <P>This licensing power may be required for the benefit of fishing in any particular place.  Sub-section (5) does not empower the Minister to refuse a licence.  I know that it does seem to give the right to put so many vexatious conditions in the licence, such as those suggested by Deputy Larkin, as to make the licence practically useless. I submit, even though it is not specifically set out, that what any Minister would do would be to consult the board.  If there are any safeguards, in reason, which the Dáil wants I am prepared to give them, but I do not think that an injustice is being inflicted on anyone.</P>

      <P>In a general way, I would be inclined to agree with the Deputies who suggest that there should be the right of appeal to the court.  I can see, however, that as regards the type of provision which the Parliamentary Secretary is thinking of, the courts would probably be useless to deal with it.  I cannot see, for example, how the court could decide on such a matter as the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned &mdash;the restriction of fishing in Dingle Bay.  I think that you would get a better decision on that from the Minister or the board.  At the same time, I think that the wording of the sub-section is very wide, and that it is a matter that the Parliamentary Secretary might look into.  If he would agree to do so, it might help to remove some of the objections which have been raised.  I take it that the objection is not to the type of conditions which the Parliamentary Secretary referred to but rather to the phrase which says: &ldquo;a licence may be granted subject to such conditions as the Minister thinks fit&rdquo;.  It then goes on to include certain things.  There is no limitation as to what the Minister may think a fit and proper condition.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would have the section redrafted limiting the type of condition to be laid down.</P>

      <P>This paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to purchase, store or sell fuel and lubricating and other oils for use in the running of sea fishing boats.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board is being given the power to do what is set out in that paragraph. For the past 20 years sea fishing boats have been run on fuel, lubricating and other oils and people have set up businesses along our sea-board for the purpose of supplying oils to these fishing vessels.  In this paragraph it is proposed to give the board power to set up a rival business and to wipe out long established businesses which have been obliging fishermen in this way. There is no proposal to give compensation <Col N="497" /> to the people whose businesses are being wiped out overnight.  I think it should be no concern of the board to sell fuel and lubricating oils for boats. I know of a case on an island off the Donegal coast where a gentleman fought for years for the right to obtain a licence to sell petrol.  It was only after considerable trouble that he obtained the licence or, rather, a quota of petrol from one of the distributing companies, and then he established his business.  That man's business will be wiped out overnight if the board set up an opposition store without compensating such an individual in some way or another.  I think that the amendment should be accepted.</P>

I am not assuming that they will proceed on a commercial basis to erect fuel pumps all round the coast of Ireland.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say that in cases of the kind dealt with in this amendment these people would not be interfered with by way of competition from the board; that they only propose to do this where there are no supplies at present or where new stations would be erected under the direction of the board where there is no accommodation for the storage of petrol and oil for fishing boats?</P>

      <P>The fact is that this power has been available to the Sea Fisheries Association as at present constituted and has been there since 1931, and I do not think that they have given any cause for objection by any trader interested in this trade.  It is not proposed that the new board will do anything more than the Sea Fisheries Association has being doing in the past in relation to this power.  As a matter of fact, the list of powers given to the new board I believe is very common and there is nothing unusual in what is set out here in comparison with any other board being set up for the purpose of carrying on business.  In any event, there is an omnibus clause at the bottom which I believe is meant to cover everything that the draftsmen <Col N="498" /> forgot to mention, or perhaps it was because the alphabet was exhausted and they decided they would have to put in an omnibus clause to cover all the other powers which it is usual to give.  Let us take the type of case for which this power might be required.  It is only to cover remote possibilities.  Let us assume that you develop fishing in some part of the coast in which these facilities were not available.  If these facilities were not available, would it not be a pity if your activities in that remote place were held up because the board could not supply them?</P>

    <P>The paragraph is intended to give the new board the same rights to vary the contract, alter the contract or renew the contract as the old body had.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that, without the addition of the words I propose to add, they would not be given power to do so without the consent of the other party to the contract? I suggest that this amendment would be a safeguard for these people.  With this addition, no alteration could be made without the agreement of all parties after its execution.  If the matter were allowed to stand as at present, the board could alter any binding contract or agreement as and when they wished and no contractor would have any security.  For example, the board could enter into a contract for <Col N="499" /> the building of a boat and when the boat was built they could say they were altering the contract and not taking it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 16 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  During the period of five years beginning on the commencement of this Part a licence shall not be granted for a fishing boat unless the following requirements are satisfied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that it is not less than 40 feet or more than 70 feet over all in length, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that neither the owner, charterer, hirer or master is engaged in any other business connected with the sea fishing industry.</P>
      <P>(2)  The requirements stated in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) shall not apply to the board.</P>
      <P>(3)  The requirements of sub-section (1) shall during the period specified in that sub-section attach as conditions to a licence for a fishing boat.</P>
      <P>(4) (a)  The Minister may, if he thinks fit, issue in favour of the owner, charterer or hirer of a fishing boat a certificate exempting him during a specified period from compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> (b)  a certificate shall not be issued in favour of a person who is engaged in the distributive fish trade,</P>
    <P>(c)  the Minister may at any time revoke a certificate.</P>
    <P>I submit this amendment because a large number of people fear that the operation of this Bill giving powers to trawlers to fish will destroy their livelihood. For that purpose I put down this amendment confining the largest size boat to 70 feet in length so that we will definitely exclude anything of the trawler type which could go out further to sea and could land as many fish in one day, if it were lucky, as would do a countryside for a week or a fortnight.  I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's views on the matter.  These people fear this encroachment on their livelihood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, if accepted, will destroy the usefulness of this Bill in my opinion.  I must say that I am surprised Deputy McMenamin put down this amendment, because on the Second Reading he opposed the Bill because it goes against private enterprise.  He says that the fishing industry in Ireland will never be given a chance to develop properly unless it is put in the hands of private enterprise.  This amendment of his would certainly discourage private enterprise in a very effective way.  He said also that we were voting the taxpayers' money for what should be a huge industry able to acquire capital and stand on its own legs as a private industry.  I feel that if Deputy McMenamin's amendment were accepted that the objective which he indicated in his Second Reading speech could not by any means be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer followed him on the same lines eulogising private enterprise. He told us that there was a plentiful supply of fish when we had no Sea Fisheries Association and that possibly our own native Government interfered so much that the fish turned tail and went elsewhere.  In this Bill we have sought to keep out State interference as much as possible consistent with the interests of the inshore fishermen so that we will get the best possible <Col N="502" /> return from the fishing industry as it is organised in this country.  I cannot on any account accept this amendment because it would destroy the whole structure of the measure.  In any event it is not quite clear to me as to how this amendment could be operated.  I suggest that instead of being inserted before Section 16, this amendment should have been inserted before Section 10.  Section 9 makes licences for boats of 35 feet and over a necessity.  This amendment would require that boats over 40 feet should be licensed.  I wonder what would happen a boat of 38 feet in length if this amendment were to be accepted. However, that is a detail.</P>
    <P>What I am puzzled by is that in sub-section (4), paragraph (a), the Minister would be authorised, if he thought fit, to give an exemption certificate to an owner, charterer or hirer, that is, exempting him during a specific time from compliance with the requirements set out in sub-section (1) of the section. It indicates in paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) that a certificate shall not be issued in favour of a person who is engaged in the distributive trade.  The people who are in the distributive trade, for the purposes of this measure, are set out in the description of the first page and when you exclude them, what I am interested to ascertain is what categories of people associated with the fishing industry could qualify for an exemption certificate.  However, these are difficulties which would arise if the amendment were accepted.  It is a measure that would put people who are already in the industry and who have, to use Deputy McMenamin's and Deputy Palmer's own words: &ldquo;Brought their private enterprise into play in this industry and have for long years been producing fish and giving employment,&rdquo; out of business and their employees out of employment and would reduce considerably the home landings of fish, necessitating an increase in the importation of foreign fish.  I do not think anybody in the position in which I find myself could accept that amendment and the consequences which would flow from it.</P>

      <P>I would support the objection for two reasons.  Here we are endeavouring to create a criminal offence for the breach of a civil contract and I question very much if the board could come into the civil courts and sue for breach of contract on foot of a contract entered into by them without first invoking the criminal law. I think it is a well-known principle of law that, before one can proceed on the civil side, one must come in on the criminal side, and bring the criminal to justice.  A case would first of all be required to be brought under Section 16 prior to bringing any legal proceedings on the civil side.  Our civil courts are quite capable of dealing with breaches of contract.  Why should the board be placed in a superior position to the ordinary citizen who may only invoke the civil law when there is a breach of the civil law?  Here we are giving the board the power&mdash;I would not say giving them the power because we are making it compulsory for them&mdash;to invoke the criminal law prior to the operation of the civil law.  It may be that it is essential that the criminal side should be brought under Section <Col N="504" /> 16 before the board is sued on the civil side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to me to be cockeyed.  When did it become law that a civil contract becomes a criminal offence?  Is the board going to seek a criminal and civil remedy for the same offence? Can they found a criminal action on a civil contract?  If they can it is quite new to me and I have never heard of it before and I have had a lot to do with this sort of thing for quite a considerable time.  I certainly would like to know if the board can ask for a conviction on the criminal side for a matter arising out of a civil contract. In whose brain did that originate, because I have never heard of such a proposal?  Can a person be brought into court on a criminal conviction on a civil matter?  The whole thing seems preposterous.  A double remedy is being sought for the same thing.  In no other law can one get a double remedy arising out of a single cause. You must elect what you are going to take and when you have elected, you are bound by the one you elect and cannot proceed with the other one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the object of this thing at all, nor can I understand it.  I have never seen nor heard of such a thing. I feel it is quite an innovation in the law.  Take a case arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, which would seem analogous, and which is a case of a dual remedy.  You can take action on the civil side of the court or you can take proceedings under the Workmen's Compensation Act, but the moment you have elected you are bound thereby and you have only one remedy.  What is remarkable about the matter is that a civil action is taken for a man, or a woman who suffers an accident.  However, under this Act the board is to have one criminal action and another civil action arising out of a civil matter&mdash;the recovery of a sum of money.  How are we going to link that up with the criminal law, or how are we going to justify it?  How are we going to get a <i>locus standi</i> in the court to initiate these proceedings on the criminal side?  I would like to see it tried out but, in my opinion, you <Col N="505" /> could not get into court proceedings of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me that a mistake has got into this section. I cannot speak as one who has a wide knowledge as to the difference between criminal and civil law, but I would like to know the basis on which the board is given this privilege.  We are dealing with an agreement in this case between the board and the people who purchase boats and gear. If the people who get the boats and gear fail to carry out the terms of the agreement they are liable to criminal prosecution and to a fairly heavy fine. What are the special circumstances in which the board should be protected in its ordinary civil relationship?  Take the question of local authorities who have to dispose of the houses they build under a hire-purchase agreement. If the tenant fails to keep the contract the local authority cannot bring him into court.  The Electricity Supply Board enters into a hire-purchase agreement with a person who buys an electric fire or an electric cooker, but if the person who gets these articles does not honour the agreement, he cannot be brought into court.</P>
      <P>Why is it that the board should be placed in a different position from the bodies I have mentioned above and why should it be given a special advantage? Why is it that a body of citizens who are engaged in a very hazardous occupation and in very arduous work and who are making a contribution to the development of one of our most important native industries should be looked upon as criminal if they fail to keep a civil contract?  I suppose everyone in this House has broken a civil contract from time to time&mdash;in other words, the payment of an ordinary commercial debt within the powers laid down by the person to whom we owe the debt.  That seems to me to be extraordinary and there must be very strong reasons for it.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service mind is all right, but it should not operate so as to discriminate against one <Col N="506" /> section of the community, especially a section who are engaged in a very hazardous work.  The ordinary tenant who enters into a tenant purchase house or the consumer of electricity who buys an electric fire for his own comfort and convenience is in a very different position from the fisherman. Everybody is aware that the difficulties are enormous in the fishing industry. It is, therefore, peculiar that we should set out under this Bill to make them liable to a criminal offence if they fail to honour the terms of their agreement with the board.  If they are convicted, an even greater fine is imposed on them than is imposed on other sections of the community who may have committed a more grievous and more detrimental offence against the State.  The fines imposed on them range from £20 to £60 as against £5, £10 and £15 on other offenders.  There is a definite discrimination there.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to justify this marked discrimination before the section can be accepted in its present form.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy asked who was the genius who was responsible for this.  I can assure him I am not the genius.  As a matter of fact this is taken word for word out of the 1931 Fisheries Act.  Deputy McMenamin said that it was an innovation&mdash;that it was never heard of before.  Actually it was passed by Dáil Éireann and was taken word for word out of the 1931 Act and has been available to the Sea Fisheries Association for the past 21 years.  We may be blamed for being bad copyists but, in fact, we are very poor inventors in so far as this charge is concerned.  It has been described as being quite novel, but I do not think it is quite as new as Deputies suggest.  I remember as a young lad road contractors being prosecuted in a civil court.</P>

I assumed that when it was done 21 years ago power of this sort was necessary.  Suppose you give £5,000 worth of a boat&mdash;and that is not a very big boat nowadays&mdash;to a fisherman in any part of the coast and he enters into a contract with you to fish that boat.  Suppose you turn over his fish to the board so that they can make appropriations from the sale of that fish against the boat.  Then suppose he uses that boat for some other purpose and is making money hand over fist, but is doing it in such a way that you cannot make any appropriations. In that case, he uses the boat almost in a criminal way and, as far as public money is concerned, what remedy has the board?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall not apply to any person holding a licence by virtue of the provisions of the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Under the Auctioneers Act, 1947, any person wishing to engage in the business of auctioneering must go to the trouble and expense of applying to the District Court.  First of all, he advertises his intention in the Press. Then he goes to court, employs a solicitor to act on his behalf, and obtains from the district justice a certificate of fitness to enable him to carry on the business of auctioneering.  He then must obtain a £10 licence from the Revenue Commissioners and must enter into a bond with an insurance company and pay a premium thereon.</P>
    <P>Under the 1947 Act, all those things are necessary and successful applicants are put to that trouble and expense but the sale of fish is excluded from the 1947 Act.  It has been the custom in this country, on the first sale of fresh fish landed, that an auctioneer's licence is not required by any person who may auction the fish.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to exempt successful applicants under the 1947 Act and people who have obtained licences under the 1947 Act from the further necessity of coming to the Minister and applying for a further certificate of fitness and a further licence to comply with Section 34 (1) of the Act.  Even if that is done it will still make it necessary for such applicants to register under Section 39 (1). It will be necessary for him to register under Section 39 (1) but he will be exempted from the expense and the necessity of applying for a licence under Section 34 (1).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (1), lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;one of whom shall be chairman&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five of whom shall be ordinary members (one of whom shall be chairman) and one a managing director,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The First Schedule is one of the parts of this Bill to which I have a very strong objection.  I indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill that I could not see how a body of men, constituted as this board will be constituted, could, under any circumstances, make a success of this industry.  The more I reflect on it the stronger is my conviction that my opinion is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear to anybody who is acquainted with business affairs that no man of any business standing, and with any regard for his reputation as a businessman, will undertake this project for a period of two years because, no matter who he is or what ability he may have as a businessman, he cannot make a success of the project in such a short time as a period of two years.  Therefore, a good businessman will avoid accepting this position because it will only diminish his reputation as a businessman.  One feels, therefore, that the Department will be driven to the appointment of gentlemen who are utterly reckless as to whether they succeed or fail but from whose record it will be obvious from the beginning that the matter will end in failure.  That is my thesis or this matter and, though it may be argued against, my argument cannot be displaced.  Experience proves that it is <Col N="512" /> true and that there is no exception to it.  For these reasons I am fundamentally opposed to the provisions of this Schedule.</P>
    <P>I was rather taken with a similar provision in the 1950 Bill which struck me as having the essence of success. It provided for a board and for continuity in the person of a managing director.  That man should get a permanent appointment.  He should be selected after close scrutiny and examination of his reputation and character as a businessman.  Then he should get a substantial period of ten or 15 years &mdash;subject to good conduct and the efficient carrying on of the business&mdash; and be paid a good salary.  Let the Parliamentary Secretary make no mistake, he will not make a success of this project and he will not get a good man for the job unless he offers him a good salary&mdash;and a good man will be cheap at a good salary.  Cheap men are no use for anything and certainly they will be no use for this industry which this House and the country in general hopes will be put on its feet and made a success of.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that, after all the chopping and changing, we do not put this industry in a position to enable it to be successful.  We cannot and will not make a success of it unless the machinery that operates it has in it the ingredients of success.  In my opinion you cannot make a success of the industry without appointing a good man&mdash;call him what you like: he was called a &ldquo;managing director&rdquo; in the 1950 Bill&mdash;and giving him a good salary and the prospect of continuity of employment. Such a man cannot be got under the present procedure.  No man of any standing or ability in the business life of the country would take on that job for two years and then relinquish it because he knows that he could not make a success of it in that time.  He would require at least five years and, I should say ten years, to do his job well.</P>
    <P>What will the members of this board be?  They will be a collection of junior apprentices&mdash;not apprentices at all but junior apprentices.  When they go, at the end of two years, another bunch of <Col N="513" /> junior apprentices will be marched in. We are trying to fool ourselves in this House that, under such machinery, it will be possible to make a success of this industry.  There is not an earthly hope that, under such conditions, it will be a success.  Whether or not I am a member of this House, or whether I have passed from this orb altogether, I can guarantee that this Act will prove a fiasco unless the board is constituted on some other basis and unless you have some person there in a permanent position&mdash;some person who has outstanding ability though not necessarily in the business of handling fish.  What we require is a man of outstanding ability who understands thoroughly the importance of organisation, advertisement, distribution and all the other branches of the fishing industry, which is a very extensive business and which could prove of real value to the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that between now and the Report Stage there should be further consultation on this matter with a view to setting up some other form of machinery in respect of this industry. There is not a million-to-one chance that the machine to be established under this Bill will make a success of this industry.</P>

      <P>The only thing I see wrong with the matter is that the period of two years may prove to be too long.  If we get weeds on the board, we may be very anxious to get rid of them at the end of two years. The Parliamentary Secretary could amend this sub-section (3) to read: &ldquo;...each member shall be appointed for a period of two years or more.&rdquo; That will give the Parliamentary Secretary an opportunity of retaining good men on the board and of getting rid of the weeds.</P>

      <P>If we could amend this section in the manner I have suggested, the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to retain those members of the board whom he considers suitable.  I am aware of the fact that under the Bill as it stands the members of the board can be reappointed, but it would be far better if they were given some fixity of tenure and if they knew that appreciation would be shown for the work they have done on the board.  If you said two years or more it would avoid the necessity of the Parliamentary Secretary reappointing for two years.</P>

      <P>I am amused at Deputy McMenamin's arguments because he was one of the people who put me on the spot on Second Reading in regard to the dictatorial board that I was setting up&mdash;not he alone but others too.  I think I fairly anticipated that type of criticism when I did not include the managing director in this set-up.  It is bad enough to have a dictatorial board of six people but six dictators are not as bad as one, if they have equal authority.  I am requested now, having set up the dictatorial board, to canalise all power through the medium of a managing director into the hands of one person. It is for the purpose of ensuring that no one man will dominate the board that a managing director is not being appointed.  I do not think it possible to get all the requirements in the possession of one individual to meet the fishing problems that one meets with from month to month in the fishing industry.  There is an arrangement at present whereby there is a manager.  He is, in fact, a member of the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association.  The manager will not be in this case a member of the board. He will be there, I take it, on occasions when the board require his presence to take part in their deliberations but he will not have the right to vote.  We are not going to set up any one individual person as a Pooh-Bah to override the others.  We want to ensure that the six people will be <Col N="515" /> equally independent, having nobody to overawe them in the deliberations of the board.  I am convinced personally that it is a far better arrangement to ensure that you will have six such people on the board rather than to try to dominate it by a person who is placed in a superior position.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary a few moments ago paid a compliment to the chairman of the Sea Fisheries Association.  I should like to join with him in that.  I have some experience of the manager to whom he refers and I think he was a most efficient gentleman. I should like to pay tribute also to the civil servants who have served as directors of the Sea Fisheries Association but I am going to attack them, not in their personal or individual capacities, but on account of the official view which they bring into the associations and boards of which they become members.  I say that the Sea Fisheries Association since its inception has been stifled by official directors and that any good work that has been done has been done by the directors elected by the fishermen.  Unfortunately, the official point of view and the majority point of view has offset anything which could have been done by the directors elected to the Sea Fisheries Association.  If you are now going to appoint a board, the majority of whom will consist of civil servants, I say you will be as far back as ever.  After all, what practical experience has a civil servant of sea fishing?  Has one ever stood on board ship, other than on a short tour of inspection?  Has he ever fished or handled a seine net or a drift net?  One requires practical experience of all these things to become a director of an association dealing with fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the board will consist of representatives of fishermen and of representatives of the wholesale and retail trade.  Is there an official who <Col N="517" /> has practical experience of the retail or wholesale fish trade?  I would respectfully ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to confine the Civil Service members of the board to not more than two.  By doing that he will have a liaison between himself and the board.  At the same time these members will be able to report to him the various steps which are being taken by the board but they will not have power to overawe and curb the good work which the directors elected by the fishermen are endeavouring to carry out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because, in the next amendment, I am trying to deal with the same problem in a more general way.  I repeat what Deputy O'Donnell has said that I have no personal animus against the civil servants who have been associated with the Sea Fisheries Board, but I do think it is a dishonest practice for Governments and Ministers to establish what are intended to be, in the main, independent boards to carry out specific functions and then retain complete control over the day to day working of those boards by virtue of the nature of the appointments which they make.  Now, the work of the Sea Fisheries Association at the moment is, as everybody knows, largely determined by the civil servants who are associated with its work in one way or another.  I do not question for a moment their efficiency so far as the discharge of their duties is concerned, but it is well known that no decision will be taken by them unless they already know what the mind of the Minister is.  If that is the case, why not let the Minister do the job himself? As a result of the present position we have endless circumlocution, delays and annoyances created because we have a board charged with authority and responsibility which, time after time, waits to see how it should make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my main objection in regard to the way in which the board is to be constituted under the First Schedule. The other point made by Deputy O'Donnell in regard to the need for members of the board having practical <Col N="518" /> knowledge of the commercial distribution of fish, seems to me to be equally important.  May I point out that, in the whole framework of the organisation which this Bill is setting up, it is quite clear that a most important part of the machinery is found in the Second Schedule when we come to deal with the composition of the committee of the association?  We there go to great pains to determine that not merely will the members be representative of the various interests in the practical carrying on of the fishing industry but we determine their actual numerical proportions. In a further amendment, the Minister is taking steps to ensure that the thing is exact.  If it is important that, in respect of the association, there should be adequate and proper representation for the persons who are engaged in and have a practical knowledge of the industry, it is surely more important that the personnel of the board, which is to direct and govern the main machinery of the whole Bill, should in its composition equally reflect the practical working of the industry.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be associated with the board, on the basis of the viewpoint of the Minister regarding their capabilities, individuals who have a knowledge of administration. From that point of view, possibly civil servants or former civil servants cannot be excelled.  I think, however, that there should be some limit placed on that type of representation.  The matter should not be left open, as it is in the Schedule at the moment.  We know from actual experience, not in relation to the Sea Fisheries but of other boards, that while we have honest and sincere members appointed to them, by reason of their whole background or their official position in other spheres, they find themselves not free to exercise their judgment or to apply their capabilities in the manner required.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that I am being asked to approach the question of the selection of members of the board entirely on the basis of representative capacity.  I do not know that <Col N="519" /> that is essentially sound.  It may, by chance, work out all right, but it is not an unerring guide to the selection of the best people.  I have known people whom I have tried to induce to go forward for election to the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association because of their practical knowledge of some aspect of the fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you not agree that one of the reasons why they would not go forward was that they knew the officials had a majority of the directorships, and so could out-vote and outrule them on every occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to put to the Deputy was this, that the men were honest enough, they were good men and knew the fishing industry, but, as they put it frankly to me, they felt that they would make the poorest possible administrators.  A man who is a good fisherman does not always make the best administrator.  I do not think there is any possible class of representative that could be suggested in this House that someone would not criticise.  We have heard that already. Somebody gets on, he has no intimate association with the fishing industry but, possibly, he is a good administrator. You are then told that he knew nothing about the industry, that he would not know a herring from a cod. That was one type of criticism.  The other was of a person who had been associated with the industry all his life, and what was said of him was this, that he was a fellow who had an axe to grind and that he was playing his own hand.  That has always been so. When a civil servant was appointed, you were told that his only interest was to draw his pay.  If you approach this from the point of view of representative capacity, I cannot see any type suggested that will not be subject to some criticism.  We are going to have people associated with the industry on the advisory committee.  They will be there as watch dogs.  We certainly do require good administrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the best approach to the selection of members of the board is that we should try and get people who <Col N="520" /> are best qualified to make good administrators.  As regards specialised knowledge, for example as to the best type of net for use in the Irish Sea or the best type of engine to put into a 36-foot boat, or what sort of engine you would put into a 50-foot or an 80-foot boat, I do not think that specialised knowledge of that sort is absolutely necessary.  If civil servants were to be ruled out from appointment to this board it is possible that the very best person we have in the country for membership of the board would be disqualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I should accept the principle of selection on a representative basis.  In any event, this two-year period of office is, I think, a pretty good safeguard and if, in fact, we put any duds on the board we will not have to wait too long to get rid of them.  I myself have, for a number of years, been on the committee of directors of the Sea Fisheries Association.  I have also had experience as a member of the local authority. Therefore, I know that it is necessary to ensure that you will not have too much delegation of business to officials, that in fact the board will be able to deal with the largest volume of business to be done by the board, and therefore it is necessary that we should have people available for meetings not less frequently than once a week.  Very often the business of this board may necessitate meetings more frequently than once a week.  Therefore I do not want to tie my hands in such a way that the board will have to delegate a lot of its business to officials or postpone its business to other meetings. For that reason I think the Minister should retain the power to select the people on their personal merits rather than on their representative capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 22, after &ldquo;district&rdquo;, to add &ldquo;including veterinary services, technical advice in respect of feed production and cow testing, and where the Minister directs, shall make participation in an approved scheme a condition for the registration of premises under the Act of 1936, the Act of 1941, and this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because I think that the Bill we have before us, which is designed to create some kind of permanent arrangement in regard to the supply of liquid milk to our cities, also confers material benefits on the suppliers and, in regard to a great many branches of the agricultural industry, I think it is reasonable to suggest that, if it is a scheme into which people can come or out of which they can stay if they want to, it is fair to say to them: &ldquo;If you want to partake of the benefits of price maintenance and machinery to deal with losses that you would sustain in time of surplus if the machinery were not there to relieve you, you have a corresponding duty to put your best foot forward to bring down the cost of production and to do all that you yourself can do to increase your own profits and your own returns.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did establish in connection with the Dublin milk supply area an insemination centre at Grange.  We provided a special assistant to the Dublin Milk Board to help the farmers to develop grass ensilage so as to simplify their problem of winter feeding.  We all know in regard to milk producers, whether it be for the supply of liquid milk for human consumption or the supply of milk to creameries, that one of the great difficulties which confronts every Minister for Agriculture, and indeed every producer, is that the producer does not know the yield of his own cows.  Not knowing the yield of his own cows, it is impossible for him intelligently to collaborate with any Minister who is trying to supply him with the kind of a cow that will provide an economic and remunerative <Col N="523" /> return for the feeding which the cow receives.</P>
    <P>We also, under the general powers of the Minister, provided both in the Dublin milk supply area and in certain other areas in the country a variety of special veterinary services covering anti-abortion, vaccination, treatment for parasitic diseases, and certain other veterinary services, all designed to protect the producer from losses which we knew he was sustaining and which materially abridged his profits. But in the promulgation of all these schemes the Department of Agriculture is habitually harassed by the fact that when the scheme is inaugurated you have no guarantee that the total number of suppliers, or, indeed, that a majority of them, will collaborate <i>ab initio</i> in carrying out the scheme. They will be waiting for everybody to join in.</P>
    <P>That is notably true in connection with cow testing.  There is nobody who has ever been a Minister for Agriculture who has not felt that what the creamery and the liquid milk industry ought to do is to maintain effective cow-testing associations in which every cow would be enrolled and regularly tested.  The fact is that we have never succeeded in getting much more than 10 per cent. of the cows in the country tested.  I feel quite certain that Dáil Éireann is right in saying that compulsory powers must not be invoked against farmers except in a national situation which would justify similar compulsory powers being invoked against professional men, trade unionists and every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>When you reach a situation where the Oireachtas is prepared to legislate for the purpose of protecting the interests of a body of people who come within the scheme of protection on a purely voluntary basis, I think the Oireachtas has the right to say: &ldquo;Now, here are the benefits which every person who is prepared to enter the scheme will enjoy.  Here are the conditions for securing access to those benefits.&rdquo;  We do that by saying to anybody who wants to produce milk for human consumption that he must <Col N="524" /> maintain a particular standard in his cow-house, and that in order to retain his position as a licensed producer of liquid milk for human consumption his cow-house is liable to inspection so that certain standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>I feel it would not be any hardship to lay down certain other conditions for those who wish to be registered. In my view, one reasonable condition would be that a supplier should be a member of a cow-testing association operated by himself and his neighbours. A further reasonable condition might be that, when the voluntary services are reorganised on the lines which, I understand, the Minister has in contemplation, licensed persons under this Act should be required to take a certain degree of collaboration in the voluntary services provided for their protection and for the protection of those who would ultimately consume the milk.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to have the requisite feed production to increase the supply.  My mind travels back to the parish plan.  If we could get a group of men with common interests and provide them with a technician to give them technical instruction, a much more fruitful return would come from the technician's work than if he had to travel from one farm to another without any bond between the several farms in the business of acquiring the highest technical skill in the production of the kind of feed which the producer of liquid milk requires. The House will remember that there are a particular group of persons who are not free, by the nature of their contract, to confine their milk production to summer production only as the creamery supplier can do.  The man who supplies milk for human consumption and who has contracted to do so for the 12 months of the year must, during the winter months, provide his cattle with the highest protein food so that they will be enabled to produce the maximum supply of milk when there is no grass growing.</P>
    <P>It seems perfectly clear that the most economic way to do that in this country is to provide ensiled grass or ensiled crops.  The technique of ensilage is perfectly simple, provided one has the know-how.  One cannot learn the knowhow <Col N="525" /> unless one gets the requisite technical instructions.  I feel the Minister would be justified saying to people who want to engage in this business of milk supplying: &ldquo;The plain fact is that you cannot efficiently provide a supply of milk the whole year round unless you have technical instruction in the matter of ensilage.  I am prepared to put at your disposal adequate technical instruction. I am entitled to say that if I provide the amenities which it is anticipated you will enjoy under this Act, I am entitled to require collaboration on your part with the technician I will provide as a condition of continuing to be a licensed producer for the purpose of this scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For that reason, I put down this amendment, which I hope commends itself to the Minister&mdash;not necessarily in the precise form in which I put it forward.  I trust that some proposal of that kind will appeal to him as an improvement on the Bill as originally presented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this amendment, on this point, does not go very far.  The provisions in the Bill will cover most of the matters which Deputy Dillon has in mind.  Deputy Dillon has on this occasion, as on another occasion, referred to voluntary services and referred to inspections of premises.  Deputy Dillon took an opportunity in this House to make a most vicious attack on the Cork milk suppliers.  I would like to get as much publicity for what I have to say as Deputy Dillon got for his scandalous and libellous statement on the Second Reading of this Bill.  Deputy Dillon suggested that the Cork milk was filthy and that the Cork milk suppliers were afraid to disclose the results of the examinations carried out by the Cork health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Cork milk is the best milk in Ireland.  It can also be said, without any fear of contradiction, that the inspection carried out in Cork is the most efficient and the most conscientious inspection carried out in any area in this country.  The attack made by Deputy Dillon on the Cork milk suppliers and on the Cork veterinary officers did not bring any credit upon him from anybody who had any <Col N="526" /> knowledge of conditions as they operate in Cork.  The position is that we have in Cork the most hard-working and the most intelligent milk producers who sell the highest and the best quality milk at the lowest prices in Ireland.  We have the closest inspection and the most effective and the most energetic of veterinary officers.  I feel it is wrong that they should be attacked in this House&mdash;either the officials of the public health authority or the suppliers to Cork City.  In Volume 129, No. 6, Deputy Dillon said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made reference to it and he will find it in the report when he reads what he said. The position is that in Cork last year there were 1,800 samples of milk taken and of those 1,800 samples of milk there was only one that could be described as very dirty, and even though certain officials have suggested&mdash;and I think the Minister has suggested&mdash;that half of the milk was dirty and produced under bad conditions, there was less <Col N="527" /> than 6 per cent.  I do not want to labour that point but I do want to take this opportunity of denying, and saying that the people of Cork resent in a very definite way, the groundless charges made in this House on the Second Reading.</P>

This amendment is superfluous and unnecessary and I believe that everything required to be done will be done, except the dictation that he wants to impose on milk producers in Cork.  I do not agree with dictation from Deputy Dillon any more than I would agree with dictation coming from Deputy Smith when he was in the chair of agriculture, but there is sufficient incentive in the Bill already without the dictation that Deputy Dillon would like to impose on it.</P>

      <P>As regards the inspection of the Cork milk supply, recently the Cork County Council had agreed to appoint a wholetime veterinary inspector for the inspection of the source of supply of milk to Cork City. I do not think that any one of the Cork Deputies made any serious complaint about the quality of the Cork milk supply.  Our big grievance was and is that we cannot get a twice-daily delivery in the hot summer months and that even though milk of good quality is delivered, the person delivering it cannot be prosecuted for the condition of the milk at the time. That milk is generally morning and evening milk mixed together and sours before people are able to use it.</P>

      <P>I wish to intervene in this debate to prevent this amendment from being bogged down by Cork, more Cork and still more Cork. I want to pour a little oil on the troubled waters and to make a few comments on this amendment.  We know a number of counties&mdash;and I am not referring at all to Cork&mdash;in Leinster which are known as the Dublin milk supply area.  The farmers in this area enjoy certain advantages, and I think they acknowledge that they do enjoy advantages and are prepared to co-operate as far as possible with this legislative Assembly to ensure that the best return is given to the State for the privileges which they enjoy.</P>
      <P>I think most farmers would be anxious to co-operate in a general scheme to make cow testing universal. There may be some complaint in regard to cow testing as carried on at present inasmuch as some farmers regard it as too elaborate.  It might be desirable to have a more simplified form of cow testing, but there is a general feeling amongst farmers that we ought to have universal cow testing at least in the area covered by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great number of advantages <Col N="529" /> to be gained by knowing exactly and proving exactly the yield of each cow.  There is an advantage to the cow-keeper and there is an advantage to the community in steadily improving the breed generally in the country. In addition to whatever privileges are given to milk producers under this Bill, it would be desirable that if we have cow testing universal in the milk supply areas, the A1 scheme should operate so as to ensure that the best quality dairy bulls are reserved for the cows that come up to a certain standard and that cows that are absolutely hopeless in regard to milk yield, if they are not eliminated, at least will be reserved for the big breeds of bulls.</P>
    <P>Cows which produce under 500 gallons should be reserved.  The beef breeds of Hereford and Aberdeen Angus cattle colour mark their calves. These calves cannot be confused in the future either with the Irish Dairy Shorthorn or any other breed.  For that reason, this amendment should receive sympathetic consideration.  If it is unnecessary, there is no need to write it into the Bill.  There is also the disadvantage of writing into a Bill a provision which is covered in some other way inasmuch as the adding to the Bill of an amendment might, perhaps, in some other way limit its scope.</P>
    <P>I think that the Dublin Milk Board &mdash;I am not talking about Cork because I prefer to keep away as far as I possibly can from Cork&mdash;should have far-reaching power in so far as the improvement of dairy herds in the area is concerned, in so far as the improving of veterinary services is concerned and in so far as the improving of types of herd management and feeding is concerned.  I think there should be very, very little limit to their powers so far as they are concerned with rendering services to the producers and production of milk, making it more efficient and, therefore, more economic.  I think there should not be any definite limit to the powers of the board.  So long as the board continues to act in that manner, it will have the co-operation of everyone who has the interests of the dairying industry at heart.</P>

      <P>I do not know what technical advice in regard to food production and cow testing the farmers will get from this board.  It would take a lot of technical advice to change the conditions of affairs existing in this country and under which the herds of cows were reduced by 104,000 in two years.</P>
      <P>In 1950-51 you had a reduction of 19,000 cows and 33,000 in-calf heifers. You had a reduction in 1951-52 of 38,800 cows and 14,000 in-calf heifers. When you have the disappearance of roughly one-tenth of the total milk herds in this country during the last two years of Deputy Dillon's reign, it is hard to know what technical advice-can do in the way of improving the situation, having regard to the fact that the Department's journals at present tell us that you pay something like 2½d. more for the foodstuffs that produce the extra gallon of milk than you will get for the gallon of milk when it is produced.</P>
      <P>The farmers at the present time have got rather hard in view of the different advice they got during the last 20 or 30 years.  It would take very good technical advice to turn a cow, which has been bred for beef for ten generations, into a decent milking cow to-day. That could not be done.  There is very little use talking about the technical advice that is going to be given by a Department, which set its face against giving any assistance in the way of bringing into this country decent dairy herds.  That is what you are up against and it is just as well to face it.  The farmers did not reduce their dairy herds by 104,000 in two years for nothing.  That was not done for the fun of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the advice we have received, our farmers, at the present day, will not listen to the sneers and insults that are poured out here by trumped up, moryah elected representatives telling them that they have dirty cows, dirty milk, and dirty herds and all the rest of it.  That is slapped at them in public and plastered in the public-Press. They are not going to put up with that any longer.  It is just as well that we should have some realisation of the position in that respect.  People <Col N="531" /> should not take advantage of their position in this House to black ball the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I want to know what shape the technical services proposed in this amendment are going to take, whether they will take the shape of food production instead of feeding production and cow testing?  I want to know what that advice will consist of? Will it be on the lines set out in the last Government's White Paper?  Will the cost be on the same lines as that in the last Government's White Paper?</P>
      <P>The answer to those queries would make rather interesting reading for the farmers.  Will the technical advice take the lines followed in the Department's journals which tell us the quantity of concentrated feeding stuffs required for every gallon over two gallons?  When you endeavour to ascertain the cost of those concentrated feeding stuffs required you find that they are going to cost you something more than you get for the gallon of milk than the one gallon you get for it.  Those are some of the things I suggest Deputy Dillon had in mind in regard to those services.  I do not know what he means in regard to the veterinary surgeons which he advises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> In regard to cow testing, I do not know what the position is in Dublin but when supplies run short in the Cork Milk Board area, where you have to supply a definite quantity of milk, the same in the month of December as in the month of June, the farmers have to go to Messrs. Marsh and purchase cows bred under the approved plan of the Department.  When you bring such a cow home you might get one and a half gallons of milk for the first week if it is well fed; after that, you will be lucky if you get half a gallon &mdash;and a good goat is better than most of them.  That is the condition to which the Department have brought the dairy herds of this country.  Often we are told to compare our agricultural industry with that of Denmark or Holland.  Take, for instance, a country like Holland where the average yield per cow is 800 to 900 gallons of milk.  When we read these figures we wonder what is wrong with this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the main section of the Bill and is the real reason for its introduction.  This section enables the milk board to expend its money.  This amendment is restrictive and compulsory. It is restrictive in the sense that it is confining the board to the expenditure of its money on three items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment states three items&mdash;veterinary services, technical advice in respect of feed production and cow testing.  There is no mention whatever of artificial insemination there, and there is no mention of soil testing.  Other new schemes may be introduced from time to time, and the board might like to <Col N="534" /> expend some of its money on these new schemes.  If we accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Dillon, then we restrict the action of the board in respect of the expenditure of its own money.  Up to the present the board had no authority to spend money on the production of milk; it had authority to spend money on the consumption of milk.  All we are asking in this section is power to enable us to expend moneys on production.</P>
      <P>I said that the amendment was restrictive, and it is restrictive in the sense that it is totally opposed to one of the principles underlying the section, which is, that a board can use its funds, with the Minister's consent, towards any scheme designed to encourage the increased production of milk in the production district.  It is not the intention that any scheme should be forced upon the producer to the extent of putting him out of business if he does not wish to participate in it.  If, for instance, a milk producer who supplies milk to Dublin does not wish to participate in some of the schemes he need not do so&mdash;but Deputy Dillon has already stated that if he does not then he should not be registered.  That is compulsion.  From past experience and from listening to Deputy Dillon in this House I know that if there is one thing that he hates and dreads it is the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;. I do not want to compel anybody under this Bill to do anything he does not wish to do.  I am not asking to compel anybody.  I am allowing every person who contributes to the funds to participate in any schemes put forward by the milk board.  Therefore, I see no necessity for this amendment and I think that Deputy Dillon, on further consideration, should withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is under two misapprehensions.  Certainly no restriction is advocated here because, if the amendment were accepted, the section would read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The board for a joint district may, with the consent of the Minister, bear the whole or part of the cost of any scheme designed to secure the increased production of milk in the production district, including <Col N="535" /> veterinary services, technical advice in respect of feed production and cow testing, and where the Minister directs, shall make participation in an approved scheme a condition for the registration of premises under the Act of 1936, the Act of 1941, and this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite mistaken if he regards my amendment as restrictive. It merely provides that, in respect of certain schemes adumbrated by the board, if the Minister so directs&mdash;and only if the Minister so directs&mdash;participation in these schemes can be made a condition of registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to join the cow-testing association.  I agree that the cow testing should be carried on on the modified scale which the circumstances prove to be adequate for the purpose of ascertaining a cow's average annual yield of milk.  It would not have to be conducted on the more elaborate scale that is requisite if you are trying to grade up your cow under the Department registered diary cow scheme but on the modified scale designed to do nothing more than provide the producer with the essential information which very few farmers in this country have at present, and that is the true yield of the cows in their own byre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> We might as well face this fact.  It is not a popular thing to say but I do not give a fiddle-de-dee about that. One of the grave problems of milk production in this country is the vast number of uneconomic cows which are being used by farmers for the production of milk.  There is only one way of putting an end to that chronic problem which has frustrated the best efforts of succeeding Ministers for Agriculture in this country and that is by devising means of getting the farmers informed of the character of their own cows.  I think the Department of Agriculture has demonstrated to satisfaction that they do not regard themselves as discharging their liability to help farmers, once they have got the farmers to realise the deficiencies in their own cows, because in the parish of Bansha where the whole cow population was examined and the uneconomic cows pointed out to the farmer, every farmer in that parish was offered an in-calf heifer in exchange for his uneconomic cow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, the Minister seems to think it a grave trespass on the freedom of farmers to suggest that if they voluntarily elected to join the organisation of a joint district milk board that they should comply with certain prerequisites for registration. I am pointing out that it is no trespass on a man's freedom to say: &ldquo;There is no obligation on you to join this at all.  You can send your milk to the creamery or you can feed your milk to live stock on your own holding but if you want to send it for sale as liquid milk in Dublin (1) it is reasonable to provide that you should take precautions to ensure that it will be fit for human consumption, and (2) inasmuch as it is the Minister's duty every year to determine finally what the price payable for milk shall be to the supplier, it is reasonable for the Minister to say to the supplier: &lsquo;When I come to that decision, I have got to have regard to what is an economic price for the consumer and I am obliged to take cognisance <Col N="537" /> of the fact every year that half the producers for whom I am fixing prices are trying to make a living for themselves and their families out of cattle that will not give them a living. All I am concerned with is to provide that if I have got to take the added responsibility of fixing a price which will give the farmers a living, the farmers will facilitate me in making available to them cattle which will provide an annual milk yield sufficient to enable me to fix a reasonable price for milk and yet be satisfied in my own mind that the producers are getting a reasonable return for the work they do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is no infringement on a farmer's freedom to get his cows tested, more especially if that obligation put on him carries with it the understanding that where the test shows the cows he has to be uneconomic the Minister for Agriculture is prepared to replace them with economic cows and accept in exchange for three-year-old heifers about to calf, young cows in-calf to a double dairy bull, tested and proved to be non-reactors to the tuberculin test and inoculated against contagious abortion.  I know it sounds irrational that every farmer confronted with an offer of that kind does not jump at it but the facts are that they do not jump at it.  The facts are that you cannot get farmers to operate a cow-testing society.  The facts are that every person in this House, who has any regard for the future of the agricultural industry and more especially for the milk industry, knows that the root of the whole problem is cow testing and the elimination of the uneconomic cow.  Every Deputy in this House knows that for 25 years Ministers for Agriculture of every Administration have tried to devise plans to assist our farmers to eliminate the uneconomic cow.  I am putting the proposition, not that there should be a general right in the Department to go into any man's holding and to impose cow testing on him but that where the farmer desires to engage in a branch of agriculture which involves the Minister for Agriculture in an annual obligation of fixing the price which the consumer must pay, the Minister should be entitled to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon that it is a perfectly sound proposition to expect every farmer to be a member of a cow-testing association, or at least that he should test his own herd to his own satisfaction.  I am satisfied, too, that every farmer worthy of the name knows the difference between a beef cow and a milch cow, and knows that because of the policy adopted by the Department over all the years he had no choice but to keep beef cows.  Years ago, when Deputy Dillon was in opposition, he acknowledged the fact and made other suggestions as to how we could produce more milk, but when he became Minister he went over&mdash;head, neck and heels&mdash;to that policy.  I suggest that there is sufficient power in Section 3 and that there is no necessity for the amendment.  We have, added to that, the guarantee by the Minister which I expect he will repeat on the section and say that he is prepared to produce for the dairy herds in the milk board areas the services of dairy bulls, through the scheme of artificial insemination, to increase the production of milk in those areas.  The amendment is not necessary because all those schemes put up by the boards will have to be sanctioned by whatever Minister is in power.  That will be the time to debate this question.</P>

      <P>A letter was read here from the Cork Milk Board, and I should like to tell the House that the Cork Milk Board agreed with the first part of that letter.  With regard to the second part of the letter which was quoted by the Minister and which referred to Section 4 of the Bill, I do not think that was brought before the Cork Milk Board at all.  The Cork Milk Board greatly appreciates the attention the Minister has given to the <Col N="543" /> matter and the Bill in its present form will allow of the best handling of the milk supply problem.  The position was that the Cork Milk Board agreed to this section of the Bill on a very definite undertaking of the chairman of the milk board that Section 4 did not mean what Deputy Dillon asserted the Bill did mean.  Deputy Dillon, I understand, was the father of this Bill.  The Bill was produced while he was in office.</P>

      <P>As a member of the milk board, I know a letter came from the Department in May, 1951, in which it was stated that the Bill was there. The point I want to make is that we were told in Cork that Section 4 of the Bill did not mean all the things which the Minister who drafted the Bill and who initiated the Bill said it did mean. On that undertaking, the milk board sent this letter which was quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>If I am wrong, I apologise to the Deputy.  I shall, therefore, refer to the Bill which was prepared in the Department in May, 1951.  The point I want to make clear is that if Section 4 contains what Deputy Dillon asserted on the Second Reading it does contain the Cork Milk Board were misled when they sent the letter quoted by the Minister in his reply on the Second Reading.  Personally, <Col N="544" /> reading the Bill as well as I can, without having the legal knowledge necessary to have regard to all the aspects of it, I believe that the Bill does not contain the dangerous clauses which Deputy Dillon suggested on the Second Reading it does contain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I am not very happy about the section, as amended.  I was not very happy about the amendment I put down.  So far as the difference between the Minister's amendment and my amendment is concerned, I think it is better in a case like this to have the Minister's determination rather than the court's determination. There is no difference between the Minister and myself on that aspect of it.  I am not, however, a bit happy that the section, as amended, does not give the board much too wide powers.  I confess that I could not find any form of words which would meet the difficulty that there is undoubtedly in regard to a surplus during the flush period.  The only thing which makes me suspicious about the whole performance is the way the Minister met the deputation of the farmers which went to see him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had sat down and discussed the matter in a calm way with them I would certainly feel far less inclined to try to parse every word of the section to see where is the catch, but when the deputation went to see him, the Minister, far from being co-operative, seized his staff of office and proceeded to belabour them with it as quickly as he could and as soon as he got them sitting down in his room.  Then having done that, for the Minister to introduce the amendment makes me wonder what is at the back of it and it makes me suspect that this amendment that the Minister has now brought in in the guise of peace must conceal some method of making war.  I want to say that if the Minister really means what he said in the Seanad and here, as regards what he wanted the board to have powers to do, then it was very unfortunate <Col N="545" /> that when the farmers went to see him as a deputation he left them going out with the realisation, with the knowledge and with the impression that they had merely been kicked around his room and that he refused to co-operate with them in any way at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is absolutely wrong in connection with the deputation coming to see me.  I pointed out when I met that deputation that there was nothing objectionable in the Bill, section by section. Many of them did seem to be under the impression that Section 4 was a very damaging section as far as the milk producers were concerned.  I told them they should have no fear.  Due to the constitution of the boards, Dublin and Cork, there was no need for any fears regarding this Bill.  They had a majority on those boards.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not need them. I have them already.  Many of the people who came to see me on the deputation believe that we are putting something into this Bill that was harmful to them.  I pointed out to the deputation that if they feared a strike that we already had powers.  That is not the purpose of this Bill from start to finish.  The purpose of Section 4 was to bring all these powers in under the one section.  There are a number of emergency powers and as far as the milk board is concerned, any powers that it had in that regard they wanted them covered in this Bill.  That was the <Col N="546" /> reason why we had any trouble with the deputation.  As far as any other matter was concerned there was no difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of giving the Minister these powers, but I think it is very shocking that the Minister should do what I cannot help feeling the Minister for Agriculture is doing now, and that is, misleading the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is designed to give powers to the board to buy and sell milk.  He wishes to put beyond doubt the legality of the procedure adopted in certain circumstances. I think that any Government, in the event of a milk strike in a rural area and if it became necessary to collaborate with the county council to maintain minimal supplies of milk for infants and other vulnerable sections of the community would have to take action.  So far as I know such steps were taken.  The legality of those steps was gravely open to question in retrospect. When the row started in Cork last Christmas 12 months, it was suggested that similar steps would have to be taken in collaboration with the Mayor and Corporation of Cork to maintain central milk supplies to protect vulnerable sections of the community such as infants and delicate individuals against absolute famine.  It was in that context that it was decided that it was necessary to put the legality of this procedure beyond doubt by legislation.  I believe that is the origin of Section 4 which I did not draft but which, had I remained Minister for Agriculture, I would have drafted in its amended form and brought to this House and recommended it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is becoming when you have a difficult recommendation to make to the Legislature, to try to get the Legislature to enact something by persuading the Deputies that they are not doing what they are in fact doing. There is no doubt that Section 4, as amended, is meant to deal with a situation in which the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="547" /> perfectly legitimately may say: &ldquo;I apprehend a shortage of milk in the Dublin City sales area.&rdquo;  Having declared the apprehensions present to his mind, Section 4 comes into operation and the milk board may buy and sell milk.  Now, if that was not the purpose that was present to the Minister's mind why does he seek power to bring Section 4 into operation not only in a situation of surplus but in a situation of shortage as well?  I think the Minister should have these powers and would not be capable of discharging his duties if he had not these powers. I do not agree with those who suggest that he has some intention in his mind of suppressing the milk suppliers.  I think that is all cod.  The Minister for Agriculture is the Minister for the milk producers, and will in every conceivable contingency that arises be the Minister who will defend the interests of the milk producers against a variety of powerful interests that are often arrayed against him.  But apart from his duty of defending the farmers and milk suppliers he must also arm himself with powers to do unpopular things if it becomes necessary to do them. Certainly if I were Minister I would seek the powers the present Minister is seeking.  It is not right, however, to ask the House to give these powers under false pretences, and the Minister ought to admit to the House that in a situation of impending shortage arising out of a milk strike Section 4 would be invoked by him to authorise the milk boards to act in order to maintain supplies which were indispensable.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the matters raised by Deputy Dillon in connection with Section 4.  The power which we are embodying in this Bill was in existence under the Emergency Powers Act.  If there is a shortage of milk in the future the milk board is empowered, acting on the instructions of the Minister for Agriculture, to obtain a supply of milk.  That position will arise and, no matter what Minister is in office, he is going to have that power, and he will exercise it if the necessity arises.  Reasons <Col N="549" /> other than a strike may cause a shortage of milk.  It may arise for diverse reasons, for instance, transport difficulties or weather conditions.  Therefore, the board must be given power to buy milk should there be a shortage in any part of the city, or to distribute it if there is a surplus.  The board must be empowered to deal with shortages or surpluses.  That is all we are asking for.  I moved this amendment in order to meet the wishes of Deputies Cosgrave and Sweetman, and I am asking the House to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me a little information on this? Am I right in assuming that the amendment, as it now stands, means that the Minister must certify in writing his opinion that verbal direction is not sufficient?

      <P>That is a wrong attitude to take up regarding a Bill which is not introduced for that purpose at all.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that what the Minister has said has, to a great extent, clarified the position.  Deputy Dillon is endeavouring to be mischievous by suggesting that the Bill can confer powers on the board, if there is a strike or a general withdrawing of milk by the producers. Everybody will acknowledge that if there is a withdrawal of milk by the producers there are certain essential services which will have to be carried on by the operation of some emergency powers.  I will put it to the House that the producers of milk would be satisfied and would be desirous of seeing those services carried on, but these services would not have the effect of breaking a strike.  The supply of milk to the consumers in this city could be carried on under emergency conditions which would be provided by the milk board or any other body of this kind carrying on the distribution of milk.  Such a body would step into the gap in the same way as did the Army lorries during the transport strike.  The purpose of this particular section, as I see it, is to ensure that nobody would die for the want of milk.  If the powers are used there will be a certain amount of inconvenience, but the inconvenience will result in consideration being given to the producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not only the question of the producers.  There is also a question of a strike among the <Col N="551" /> distributive milk producers which might arise in just the same way.  It would operate from the other side.  I can see that farmers would have milk which might go to waste.  What I am still worried about is this: I cannot understand why, if the Minister intended this amendment in the spirit in which he has put it to the House to-day, he was so damned insolent and rude to the deputation who came to see him.</P>

      <P>Nobody is quarrelling with the fact that certain powers are being given under Section 4 which are absolutely necessary.  Why should we get cross over them if Deputy Cogan wants to justify himself?  We are giving these powers deliberately, as responsible people, to the Minister. We feel they are necessary but Deputy Cogan's contribution from that point of view was a rash one.  If, as the situation may arise, there is difficulty on the producers' side that calls for direct intervention by the Minister, he should have these powers.  Deputy Sweetman has pointed out what might arise on the other side.  Deputy Cogan spoke about the power to break strikes <Col N="552" /> but circumstances may arise under which it may be far more important to see that milk is given to the people rather than see what the rights and wrongs of an individual hold-up may be.  I think we should not apologise for giving these powers that we, as responsible Deputies, feel would be necessary in certain circumstances. But I feel that if the Minister had come into the House like a man and asked for those powers he would have got them.</P>

      <P>I might mention to Deputy Collins that if Deputy Cogan reads the debates he will find that the Minister and his colleagues spent their time in the Seanad tearing a passion to tatters and protesting that Section 4 did not mean what they now admit it does mean.  They got the Bill through the Seanad by swearing before Heaven that such an impious thought had never occurred to them and that only a person with a bad mind would put that interpretation on it.  They said that this was a Bill that the Minister had inherited from his predecessor and that he was coming in like an innocent ewe lamb and putting it before the Seanad.  When somebody suggested that this other intention was meant, hysterics is a mild word to describe the state into which the Minister and his colleagues got in the Seanad.  I do not blame certain Deputies, who heard rumours that there might be a general election before or immediately after the Budget, building up all kinds of half milk and water alibis to which they can refer. If the Minister so conducts himself he must not blame his motley army if they assume the raiment and conduct of their general.  That is why I would urge the Minister to approach these matters in future with the dignity and sense of responsibility that the very high office he at present holds requires a man to have if he is to be worthy of his job.</P>

Testimony of a very specific character has been given by Deputy Lehane, setting out his version of his recollection of a <Col N="555" /> very important report on milk samples which were taken.

He gives a version of the report which does not tally with that of Deputy Lehane&mdash;Deputy Lehane's version of the report having been used as a peg on which to hang a brisk denunciation of me.  Then Deputy Corry leaps into the fray, report in hand.  I asked Deputy Corry to read the report so that we might hear the true version, but Deputy Corry will not do so.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are being taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pressing amendment No. 13 fundamentally as a protection for the Parliamentary Secretary himself.  I have no doubt in my mind but that the best interests of this board will be served by a broad membership as distinct from a Civil Service membership.  I do not say that in any spirit of reflection on the permanent Civil Service but rather with the idea of getting the best general picture of a situation in which you must have interests represented on the board as distinct from a purely Civil Service representation.</P>
      <P>I wish to put it on record that I am genuinely afraid that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, or whoever sets up this board, is going to nominate officials out of hand.  That is something that we urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary should not happen. We have deliberately framed this amendment after consideration in this Party.  We feel that the Bill, in general, goes far enough in the enlargement of State control without allowing the board to become constituted solely of officials or former officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any real objection by the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister to this amendment.  It is an amendment which must commend itself to them, as it leaves the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister a wider choice, which must inevitably afford an <Col N="559" /> opening for a better type of board.  I seriously urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that he should recollect his own views when he was a Deputy and try, so far as he can, in conformity with Government policy, to exclude too much of the Department's mind from the board.  I suggest that, to extend the activities of civil servants on the board, virtually as an adjunct of the fishing section, would defeat the best purposes of the Bill and the best interests of the board itself.  We urge that it is definitely in the interests of the fishermen and of the fishing industry that the board should not have more Civil Service members than two.  We shall not object if the Minister is anxious to have power to nominate one of these as chairman, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to take steps to ensure that this board should have a broader constitution than that of civil servants alone.  I urge this view in a very serious and earnest way.  I feel quite honestly that the hope of any really good work by this board will be based on a personnel drawn from all sections of the fishing industry and with due knowledge of the fishing industry.  If we have a number of members of the board, without what one might call the Civil Service or official approach to their problems, I think you will get a board with more vision, more initiative and one that is very much more likely to be of lasting benefit to the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has met the amendments to this Bill in, if I might use the term, a very decent way.  He has accepted very many of them.  We have discussed these amendments from a non-Party point of view, but I regret very much that I must press him to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down amendment No. 14, I did so with the intention of trying to elicit the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary as to the possible composition of the board.  Having listened to his reply to the speeches in favour of the amendment before the adjournment, it seems to me to be all the more necessary to <Col N="560" /> get a clear decision as to what we have in mind.  One of his criticisms of the various speeches made is that he did not think he should be asked to base the composition of the board on representative lines.  Nobody is suggesting that.  As a matter of fact what we are trying to do is to prevent the Parliamentary Secretary making it absolutely a matter of a representative basis, in so far as the representation is going to be confined almost exclusively to civil servants.  He speaks of the need to have persons on the board who have experience of administration rather than practical experience of the fishing industry.  That is a clear indication of the way in which his mind is working. He speaks also of having persons readily available for weekly meetings. Again what type of person is more likely to be readily available than the civil servant who has merely to cross from one side of the street to another to attend a meeting?  So that when it is suggested in the amendment that the personnel of the board should not contain more than two civil servants it is not this side of the House that is seeking to lay down rigid lines of a representative character.  It is rather the Parliamentary Secretary who is definitely attempting to constitute the board along very narrow lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also pointed out that there should be a protection against the danger of developing the delegation of powers to any great extent.  My main objection to the possible composition of the board, in so far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, is based on the fact that there is a complete delegation of powers because we have found from experience&mdash;and in saying this no reflection is intended on the personnel of the board who are civil servants&mdash;that although there are civil servants sitting on the board it is the Minister himself who makes the decision.  Not alone is there one system of delegation, but there is a duplicate system in the sense that first of all, it passes from the present committee to the fisheries section and from the fisheries section back to the Minister in the Department of Agriculture, so much so, that it is not an unfair description to say that in many instances the members of the committee are almost afraid to scratch <Col N="561" /> themselves without asking the Minister's consent.  In regard to the most petty matters, the decision has to come from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Now, if that is what the Parliamentary Secretary wants, why not abolish the board altogether and let him exercise the powers under the Bill through one of his senior officials who will be directly responsible to him?  But is there any sense in establishing what we are to regard as an independent board and expect the members of it to carry out the exceptionally onerous and difficult task of placing the fishing industry on its feet, with an assurance of a proper standard of livelihood for the men engaged in it and the provision of a proper supply of fish to the public, and then find that this independent board is in fact to be run possibly by a group of men who are not masters of their own decisions because of their official and professional positions and who must in effect wait, with a certain amount of uncertainty and temerity, until word comes from the Minister as to whether they shall move or stand still?  If that is the viewpoint we have as to the way in which the board is going to operate, then, as I have said, it would be far better to scrap the board altogether and deal directly with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other argument, as to the value of having members on the board who have practical experience of catching fish and of the distribution of fish, and as to whether or not there is any value in having on it a man who is able to handle a net and say what type of engine should be put into a boat of a particular size, is, of course, a lot of poppycock.  It is quite clear that what we are seeking here is a balanced board.  Nobody doubts for a moment that one or two civil servants on the board with their knowledge and experience of administration, their ability to weigh up the pros and cons of the reports coming before them and of measuring all that against the practical knowledge and experience of members directly engaged in one or other branch of the industry, would make for a valuable type of board from which we could hope to get the results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> The amendment is put forward against the overloading of the board. Even its terms allow for a type of board which could readily meet the needs of the Parliamentary Secretary, and one which, at the same time, would not give rise to what is well known, from past experience, to be one of the weaknesses of these boards.  I feel that on this matter the Parliamentary Secretary, as he has already done in the case of other amendments, should re-examine the position, and see if there is any point of view to be conceded in so far as it is put forward from this side of the House.  He has already met us on a number of amendments in a practical and conciliatory manner.  This amendment is a more important one than any we have dealt with so far, because if we do not get this particular matter settled the whole purpose for which we are passing the Bill will be frustrated, and we will be leaving an ineffective set of machinery to tackle the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was arguing this case more or less in an academic sort of way when the amendment was moved. I was trying to indicate, from the point of view of theory, that what was sought to be achieved by the amendment might not, in fact, be achieved. I want to say now that there is nothing further from my mind than to allow the operations of this board to be dominated by any narrow Civil Service attitude.  I do feel, however, that the choice of the person who is to select the people to be members ought not to be cramped, and that he ought to be allowed the widest possible choice in finding people who really are suitable for the job.  If that man should happen to be a civil servant, or a retired civil servant, or to be in any other capacity removed from fishing, and if in my opinion he would be a good man to direct the administration of the fishing industry, I feel that I ought to have the power to test out such a man.  After all, the period of membership is only two years.  I think that offers sufficient scope to correct a bad appointment.  Nothing would please me better than if I were in a position to get the entire membership outside the Civil Service, but, unfortunately, <Col N="563" /> it is not easy to man a board of this sort entirely of people who are, shall I say, engaged in the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>No.  For instance, if we say there is a member from Donegal, a member from the middle west and one from the south, it is obvious that you will not get weekly attendances from these three.  In any event their presence on the board would be sufficient, even if their attendances were infrequent, to check any undersirable tendencies of an important kind.  What we do want to ensure is that the day-to-day executive matters will not be neglected simply because a quorum of members cannot be found. That is a practical difficulty.</P>

      <P>The amendment, as drafted, is limited to two civil servants. If you extend that number to three, then I think the position would seem to be that there is no real difference of opinion between us.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Opposition would agree, I would be prepared to bind myself, so long as I am in the position of advising the Minister, that I would not have more than three civil servants, but I do not think that that ought to bind whoever will be in this position after me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something more than the Parliamentary Secretary's personal position in this.  The difficulty is that we have a practice which is becoming fairly universal in regard to the boards of semi-State bodies.  We set up an independent board and, presumably, give it the powers laid down by statute, and yet the Minister is there still effectively, if not in person, like Hamlet's ghost.  With all due respect to civil servants, many of whom are amongst the most competent men in the country, and I have always defended them in every respect, it would be too much to expect civil servants to exercise, not merely the same independence of mind, but the same determination to reach decisions and have effect given to them as a member of a board who is completely removed from the official atmosphere. After all, no matter what Department a civil servant is working in, he has to have a certain degree of respect for Ministers.  He cannot go throwing his weight around like the rest of us. One of the results is that there is a very ordinary human inclination to make sure that the man on top will approve of what is going to be done before a person commits himself to a decision.  Being a civil servant, he is more directly answerable for what he does on a board than the independent member from the point of view of the principle involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think that there should be either an agreement on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this matter on the Report Stage on the lines indicated by Deputy Collins or that we should seek to have the matter settled now.  While we can accept the Parliamentary Secretary's personal undertaking, we have been told by him on many occasions, and by other Deputies in his Party, that undertakings of that personal kind, while fully accepted in regard to individuals, <Col N="566" /> are not of any value when dealing with legislation.  Political life is full of changes, and it might be only a short time until the Parliamentary Secretary will be over here and somebody else over there who would not place the same value on the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 7, to insert the following new sub-paragraphs before sub-paragraph (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Every person who immediately before the date of commencement of this Act was an officer or servant of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, Limited, shall as from such date become an officer of the board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is acceptable to me because the first portion is what I am mainly concerned with.  So far as the first portion is concerned, the purpose is to secure for the officers and servants of the existing board the same consideration and protection as we are providing in Section 27 for the property of the board.  In many Acts passed through this House it has been a common feature, when we are dealing with bodies which have an existing staff, that it is accepted on all sides of the House that the existing staff has certain rights which should be protected, and that where the functions of a board are being transferred to a new body, whether there is merely a change of name or a change in functions, the position of the existing staff should not be overlooked; that they should be regarded as being automatically taken over by the new body without in any way prejudicing or weakening any claims they might have in respect of their employment, their status, or their rights in regard to salary, superannuation, etc.  It is a remarkable fact that in a Bill like this where we are devoting more than a page to securing that nothing untoward shall happen with regard to the property or the moneys of the board or in respect of the contracts to which they are a party, we have completely forgotten the human element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to why this was overlooked.  I take it for granted that the intention is that the existing staff will be taken over, but the employees of the board are entitled to have an assurance, not from the Minister or from the board, but from the House which is responsible for making the statutory changes, that their position is not being overlooked, and that in the legislation they are given the statutory assurance to which they are entitled. Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary has an explanation as to why this matter has not been covered, because <Col N="568" /> in other Acts we have been careful to do it.</P>
    <P>If there is any reason why it has not been put in, I would be glad to hear it. Otherwise I must press him to put in this elementary safeguard.  So far as the other portion of the amendment is concerned, that flows automatically from the assurance which would be given to members of the staff if the amendment now standing in my name was accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Larkin's amendment because it is of the utmost importance that the livelihood of the people employed in this particular department of industry should be guaranteed to be taken over when the new board is set up.  That is only justice and it probably only requires an assurance from the Minister that that will be done.  But we would like to see an assurance given in this House that the people who will be directly concerned by the formation of this board will be guaranteed continuity of service.  Unless such an assurance is given in the Dail we will, in the interest of these people, feel ourselves compelled to force this amendment.</P>

    <P>(5)  The board shall pay to the Local Appointments Commissioners out of the funds at its disposal such expenses in respect of the selection and recommendation by the commissioners under this paragraph of persons to fill situations in the service of the board as shall be fixed by agreement between the board and the commissioners with the consent of the Minister for Finance or, in default of such agreement, by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied with the amendment.  My purpose in referring to the paragraph as a whole is because I had an earlier amendment down in regard to superannuation which was ruled out of order.  I hope the Chair will bear with me if I transgress. Paragraph 7 deals specifically with the question of the payment of officers and servants of the board.  In sub-paragraph (3), the board is given power to pay their officers and servants such remuneration and allowances as the board shall permit.  My submission, in so far as conditions of employment are concerned, which include both remuneration and allowances, is that one of the most important of those factors that go to make up general conditions of employment is superannuation. As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, the question of a <Col N="571" /> superannuation scheme for the staff of the existing committee has been a particularly burning one for a very long period.  In the Tourist Bill which is at present before the House there is a provision for a superannuation scheme which I copied exactly in submitting my amendment.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be most peculiar that there is not a similar provision in this Bill.  In so far as the Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to submit an amendment on the Report Stage to deal with the question of the continued service, might I ask him to consider the possibility, even at this late stage, of including in this Bill similar provisions to those included in the Tourist Bill about a superannuation scheme?  I think it is only fair that those officers who have given very good and loyal service should be given what one would expect from an ordinary employer.  This merely calls upon the board to submit proposals to the Minister for his sanction.  This is a very urgent matter.  It is one which, I think, the present committee agreed should be continued.  It would be lamentable if we allowed this Bill to go through without making such provision.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Larkin is aware that the committee of the Sea Fisheries Association did, in fact, commission an actuary to examine this problem of finding a suitable scheme.  It is hoped that a scheme will eventuate from the efforts of the actuary.  I am sure Deputy Larkin must realise that, even if I could accept this amendment of his, which was ruled out of order by the Chair, it would not give any guarantee that a scheme would, in fact, be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I suppose it would give more moral backing to it.  I feel that the prospect of getting a scheme is not in any way vitiated by the fact of the Chair not accepting this particular amendment.  In any event, the position I am in is that this is of such an important character that unless it had, in fact, been considered by the Government I could not commit the Government to it in this way.  However, I have not the decision to make because of the ruling of the Chair.  I want to assure Deputy Larkin that I have the utmost sympathy with the intention he has in mind in relation to this amendment. If the actuary can produce a scheme, in so far as I can assist in having such a scheme brought into effect, I shall do so.  In fact, I have recommended such a scheme myself in speeches from both sides of the House on the annual Estimates for Fisheries, and I fully approve of such a scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been submitted as a result of conversations which took place in the fisheries branch with the representatives of the wholesale trade.  The wholesalers who deal in fresh fish felt that they were a separate category of persons in the fish industry, and that they should have been specifically provided for in representation on the committee.  We felt that by reducing <Col N="573" /> the representation of the retail trade to one, we were not doing them a great injustice&mdash;that one representative will be effectively able to safeguard the interests of the retailers on this committee.  On many occasions representatives of the wholesalers will be on their side and, very possibly, on other occasions representatives of the fishermen will be with them.  Then there are the undefined categories of persons who would be entitled to two members&mdash;curers, canners, and various people of that sort who are undefined, and who represent a very large interest in the industry.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>On paragraph 7, sub-section (5), might I say that I believe that there should be a right of appeal from the decision of the board to an impartial tribunal such as a court, either circuit or district?  I think it is only reasonable that some safeguard should be included there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Paragraph 7, sub-section (5). If a person is dissatisfied with the decision of the committee he may appeal to the board to decide the question and the decision of the board would be final.  I feel it is important that, if a person has a grievance and having appealed to the board, feels that his grievance has not been remedied, a further right of appeal should be established.  In fact, I am a firm believer in the fact that a person has a right to appeal to a court where he has a grievance and I feel that should be enshrined in all legislation as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would try to visualise the question that may arise for decision, I think he would <Col N="576" /> have second thoughts on referring the matter to a court.  Assuming that somebody applies for membership to the association and says he is a fisherman and that the fishermen's representatives on the committee say that he is not a fisherman and the board decides on the representations of the fishermen's representatives, that this man has no right or title to be registered as a fisherman, he can take the case further to the board.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the board would be in a better position to assess the value of the committee's decision in the matter than would a court.  I think you might get a very warped type of decision from a court of justice in a matter of that sort.  It is unlikely that if a man has a genuine claim to be registered as a fisherman the fishermen's representatives will not see that. They will be the first to see it, and if they turn it down you may be sure that his claim is a very flimsy one.</P>
      <P>The same would apply to a man wanting to be registered as a retailer. If the retailers' representatives decided he was not a retailer of fish, and the matter goes further to the board, the board making all the necessary inquiries, there is very little danger of an injustice being done to the applicant. I am convinced that a court of an justice would not be the most competent body to do justice in the matter. I do not think that the Deputy need have any fears in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make this clear in case the Deputy would have any fears.  If there was something of a serious nature, such as an expulsion or a case in which a person felt he had a genuine grievance, the fact that no appeal is listed in the Act would not prevent the ordinary machinery of law from coming into being on his behalf, if he wanted to take such an action for declaration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with that.  Might I continue on paragraph 8 in regard to the system of listing different counties?  As to the method by which representatives are selected from different areas, paragraph 8, sub-section (2) (i) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Electoral Division A, comprising the Counties of Dublin, Louth, Meath, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow; and (ii) Electoral Division B, comprising the Counties of Cork, Kerry and Limerick.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would suggest in all fairness that Waterford and Wexford should be included with Cork, Kerry and Limerick because they have in actual fact very rarely succeeded in getting a representative chosen because of the particular group they are in.  I would suggest if the Minister would regroup the counties so as to include Wexford and Waterford in B Division&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly from a geographical point of view Waterford should be with the B Division, but if you were to do that, it would mean that you would not have as fair a distribution of the membership as between those two divisions, the A Division on the east coast, and the B Division on the south.  At the present time I think the total membership in <Col N="578" /> the A Division is 821 and on the south it is 1,100 odd, that is the area comprising Cork, Kerry and Limerick.  If you put in Waterford, not to mention Wexford, the membership in the B Division would be something in the region of 1,600 and it would be down to the 600 mark in the eastern division.</P>
      <P>It will be down to the 600 mark in the eastern division so that you would not have a fair distribution, having regard to the fact that it is on the figures of members that these electoral arrangements were first made.  I do not know what practical advantages are being lost to the Wexford and Waterford men by the present arrangement of the areas.  The Deputy can see that the present arrangement gives you a better distribution.</P>

Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that it is over 12 months when the person thinks of making a correction.  We are making that right in this Bill.  It might happen that the clergyman who baptised the child would not be there, and this is to provide for the fact that the person who baptised <Col N="580" /> the child might have been transferred to another parish or was dead, in which case the person who would be there then could make the change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been asked that I should convey, through the Minister, to the House the question as to the accuracy of birth certificates.  Under the present regulations, the Registrar of Births is not entitled to demand any proof of the accuracy of the information given to him by persons registering births and he has to record whatever he is told, even though it might be false.  Provision should be made whereby the registrar should have power to have the persons <Col N="581" /> registering births attest on oath and a severe penalty should be imposed on any person giving false information. The doctor or the midwife should also be required to give some form of identity which should be produced when registering.</P>
      <P>A number of cases have occurred where particulars were so completely false that a good deal of birth certificates would not now stand examination. I wonder would the Minister consider that point and let me know if there are any precautions taken at present and could he state whether precautions will be taken in future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not altogether right in saying that there is no obligation on the person to tell the truth and that there is no penalty. The person who registers the child must sign the registry and can be prosecuted if he gives wrong information. I do not think that occurs very often, if ever.  I think the elaborate machinery outlined by the Deputy would be a bit difficult for these registrars to adopt.  I am afraid we will have to leave it as it is.  There is a penalty if wrong information is given.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where such regulations provide for the issue of more than one form of certificate or for the issue of alternative forms of certificates, the Minister may by regulation also provide that each particular form of certificate may only be issued for particular purposes and to certain specified persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that what I am seeking in this amendment is already provided for in the Bill.  The whole purpose of the Bill, so far as the alteration in the form of the birth certificate is concerned, is to provide for the issue of a short form of birth certificate which will provide the minimum amount of necessary information required for ordinary use, at the same time making it possible to obtain the longer form of birth certificate when fuller information is required.  As the Bill stands, it appears to me that while the Minister is given power by regulation to deal with the question of the entry in respect of births, marriages or deaths on a certificate containing such items as may be specified in the regulations, it is not clear whether the Minister will have the power which I think he requires&mdash;and to which he referred himself on the Second Reading&mdash;to enable him to ensure that as far as possible the shorter form will be generally used.  I think that the general view of the House would be that while the provision for the issue of the longer form of certificate must be retained it should be confined to persons such as officials of courts, solicitors and other persons who will be duly and properly entitled to obtain such longer form of certificate in respect of certain legal or statutory requirements.  It was beyond my capabilities to undertake the task of defining the various categories of persons, but I tried to meet the situation by putting down this amendment to give the Minister power to decide by regulation the particular purposes <Col N="583" /> for which the longer certificate may be required, and the particular persons to whom the issue might be made&mdash; leaving it to the Minister and his advisers, on the basis of the Minister's statement, so to indicate and define the purposes for which the longer certificate might be issued.  In that way we would, in effect, achieve the purpose which we are all anxious to achieve, namely, the common acceptance and usage of the shorter form of certificate, and make its use not merely common but effective as well, so far as our main purpose is concerned.  I do not know whether or not the amendment is necessary, and perhaps the Minister will guide us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be extremely difficult to deal with this matter by regulation, that is, to confine the use of the short certificate to certain purposes.  I am afraid that, as the law stands, we cannot change it. A person has a right to inspect the register.  It often happens that a person is not exactly sure of the day, month or even year of his birth.  By paying a small fee he is entitled to inspect the register.  There are other reasons why a person might have to inspect the register.  Naturally, in looking for his own entry he will find other entries as well.  I am afraid, therefore, that there is no possibility of keeping the matter secret because you would create a great hardship for other people.  All we can do is to make the shorter form of certificate cheaper and easier for a person to obtain than the longer one and in that way help to make the shorter form more popular.  Birth certificates are required under various Acts for a variety of reasons.  For instance, they are required for examinations, for entry into certain occupations, sometimes for the receipt of some of the social services, and so forth.  In all such cases I think the shorter form of certificate might be sufficient.  However, it might be necessary, for instance in a legal case, to issue the longer form of certificate. The best we can do is to make the shorter form of certificate cheaper than the long one.  I will give the House an idea of how difficult it is, sometimes, to identify a person unless <Col N="584" /> the particulars as to parents are given. A quarter was taken at random, ending 30th June, 1944.  During that quarter 47 Mary Murphys were born in this country and nine of them in Cork City.  If there was any dispute about a Mary Murphy born in that quarter in Cork City the only possible means of identifying her would be to get the parents' names.  A lot of such difficulties arise.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I could not make regulations to provide that a particular form of certificate would be used for particular purposes and, as Deputy Larkin says, to certain specified persons. I might refer now to amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy MacBride which is on the same lines.  I would say to Deputy Larkin that the amendment would not serve any purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister assure us that the shorter form of certificate will be accepted for examinations and such other cases?  I understand that the position at present is that even the ordinary cheap certificate which is issued in respect of children's allowances, widows and so forth&mdash;but children's allowances especially&mdash;will not be accepted by the educational authorities as sufficient evidence even though the very same particulars are contained in the dearer certificate.  The only difference is that the dearer certificate has a stamp on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the short certificate it will not be effective no matter what is done, whether it be cheap or dear, because a person who is entitled to the long certificate will get it, fearing that the fact of his not having it may denote something derogatory.  Therefore the person who is entitled to the long certificate will look for it; I do not care what price you put on it.  The British tried to get over that problem in their Act by providing that, when an application is made for a birth certificate, the long and the short certificates are both issued at the same time, but the short one only is used.  The person, however, applying for the certificate gets both.  That applies in Northern Ireland as well.  There is no doubt that the failure to devise some method of getting over the difficulty does impose very great hardship and distress of mind upon a certain type of person in this country.  While I am in thorough agreement that everything that can be done should be done to <Col N="586" /> meet that, at the same time when you have this other method you are going to exaggerate the distinction and make it positive that the person who would normally use the short certificate will have attention drawn to him because it is the short certificate he has.  I think that the object which it is desired to secure cannot be achieved by the new method.</P>
      <P>I was told here on Second Reading that I was a bit of a Pharisee and a violent attack was made upon me by the Minister.  I should like to point out that the law relating to the registration of births, deaths and marriages was part of the canon law of the Church practically from the time of the inception of the canon law in the third century, and it was only in the year 1837 that the British Government brought in a Bill to take over civil control of the registration of births, deaths and marriages.</P>
      <P>Strange as it may seem, the law they adopted was identical with the canon law and the canon law still stands as the law of the land here.  There is a baptismal certificate laid down in the canon law which is a short certificate and the Minister has that power already under the existing law, if he would adopt that short certificate. What I am not at all satisfied about is making a regulation relating to the issue of birth certificates in the future.  It is only going to draw attention to certain facts.  If I turn up for an examination with a short certificate, I am immediately classed as a certain type of individual whether I am or not.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with that.  In the instance which I was aware of, I think it was due to pure snobbishness on the part of the people who rejected the birth certificate that was produced, which was a baptismal certificate.  In the case that I am aware of where the certificate was produced, there was no need I believe to ask for any further certificate but as I say snobbishness, or what the Minister calls the uncharitable mind, <Col N="587" /> refused to accept it on the ground that such certificates were not good enough. As I have not moved my amendment, I want only to point out that if this could have been got over prior to this by the canon law or the civil law, you would not wait until 1952 because nobody can charge the Church with being lacking in the virtue of charity and anybody who tries to do so, does not know what he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the points made by Deputy MacEoin on this matter very intriguing.  The idea of a short certificate is to provide something that will be used for the purpose of authenticating age, to establish age. That is what it is for.  If it is sufficient legal authentication of age that is all that is required.  You do not want the family history as well.  That is what I find General MacEoin suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, almost the whole family history.  We do not want that at all.  So far as the general volume of opinion is concerned, it is sufficient to prove age by a short simple certificate which is evidence of age.  Perhaps, after a short while, all these objections that are raised now <Col N="588" /> and all the terrific things that are foretold will happen if we change the form of the certificate for general use, will not happen at all, and future generations will wonder how any intelligent person could have objected to the inauguration of such short certificates.  Deputy MacEoin knows that when the old age pension came out at first, many people would not take it because they thought they would die very soon.  That whole idea has changed.</P>
      <P>There were many other beneficial things that were introduced and people would not have anything to do with them, but after a few years everyone accepted them.  Now, there is no moral point in this, and there is no conflict with any canon law in it. What we are doing in this Bill is what we are entitled to as a Parliament.  If the Minister spoke severely about Deputy MacEoin on the Second Reading it was because Deputy MacEoin set himself up in this House as an authority on the moral law and the canon law.  That was the attitude he adopted and took up, and it is right, when any Deputy takes up that attitude in the House, that he should be clearly told that he has no right to adopt it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We naturally must be guided by the Minister when he tells us that, even if given the power set out in the amendment, he would find it difficult to make effective use of it.  If that is the case, he surely can give us a little more information as to what ideas he has himself which would <Col N="589" /> bring about a position in which the short form of certificate would become generally acceptable and effective.  He has already replied to Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, pointing out that, under certain regulations a particular form of certificate is required by him as Minister for Health, and that he has not the power to change the requirements which these bodies now insist on.  In what way can he with our support take steps to achieve the object for which this Bill has been introduced?</P>
      <P>We are all anxious to ensure that the short form of certificate will become generally acceptable for such simple purposes as Deputy Cowan has referred to&mdash;proof of age, place of birth and for ordinary commonplace purposes. Not only those who have to get certificates in relation to themselves but those to whom the certificates will have to be produced, will accept the short form.  I am doubtful if the position is going to develop in the way Deputy MacEoin says.  First of all, without in any way making it impossible or extremely difficult to obtain the long form of certificate, we can make it much easier to obtain the short form and, secondly, we can hold out the inducement of a reduced price.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, from the point of view of the Minister, he is setting out to achieve a very laudable object. We all wish to support him in that. It is not sufficient, however, merely to hope that the short form will become generally acceptable, particularly if there is any weight to be attached to the viewpoint of Deputy MacEoin. Therefore, if in any way the granting of the powers set out in the amendment could be of any help to, and could be utilised by the Minister on any future occasion when the problem arose, I think it would be better for him to accept those powers, even though at the moment he may not feel ways and means of using them.  It would be lamentable if, later on, any difficulties arose which could be overcome by the powers set out in the amendment if the Minister had not those powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see from the Bill in <Col N="590" /> its present form, the Minister has not got the power to limit in any way, no matter how justifiable or how reasonable, the purpose for which either the short or the long form of certificate may be issued, or the persons who may be entitled to obtain one form or the other.  Clearly, if he has not those powers at the moment, I do not see any reason why he should not be willing to accept them even though he is convinced that he will never be able to use them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, in certain circumstances there is available at the present time a short form of certificate which gives the person's name, the place of birth and the date of birth.  As far as I remember, and I think I am fairly correct on this, an insurance official who wants to check ages with the registrar of births has merely to go in and present a form to him, giving the name and the place of birth with an approximate idea of the date of birth. That is checked by the county registrar who puts his name to the form. That is sufficient as evidence of age for the insurance company.</P>
      <P>I wonder will this particular change introduced by the Minister be as effective, or bring the great blessings, that many members of the House think it will.  I think that, in a big number of cases, there will still be a need for the long form of certificate.  The Minister mentioned the 47 Mary Murphys born last year.  Well, we have quite a number of Jim Ryans in Wexford Town and of Larry Walshes, Michael Morans, James Doyles, John Furlongs and Peter Murphys.  We still have a big number of old-fashioned baptismal names.  In view of that, I do not know if the short certificate is going to be the great boon people pretend it is.  We will still need the long form for children's allowances and for widow's and orphan's pensions, and for any young fellow under 18 who wants to play minor football or hurling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy MacEoin is altogether right in his summing up of the position in England and the North of Ireland. They have had the long and short <Col N="591" /> certificate going there for some time, and the short certificate is much more widely used than the long one.  We have that knowledge to guide us, and we may get the same results here. With regard to Deputy Larkin's amendment, even if I were to adopt it and make a regulation, I do not see how I could bind, let us say, the Minister for Education not to ask for the long certificate if he wished to do so for the intermediate examinations. What I intend to do is to ask the Departments to adopt the short certificate.  If the short certificate is cheaper than the long one, I think we will find that the schools generally will agree to take the short certificate, and that it will satisfy their conditions.</P>
      <P>As far as the Department of Social Welfare is concerned, I think that the short certificate will be quite sufficient in most cases.  There may be something in what Deputy Corish has said in regard to children's allowances.  It is a very important thing to know who the parents are.  There may be some difficulty, but I think that we should be able to get over it, in adopting the short certificate.  With regard to Deputy Larkin's amendment, I do not see how it could be used to any great effect.  I think that any sort of compulsion would be bad.  I think it is better to try and persuade the Departments in particular to adopt the short certificate and in that way to popularise it.  It will be cheaper and that will be a big inducement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it is not necessary to go back again to the history of these things.  I am told that nearly all law comes down from canon law, not only this, but practically every law.  There is one thing I am certain of and it is that there is nothing in canon law against the short certificate, and there is nothing in canon law that when issuing a birth certificate you must mention the parents' names.  We need not worry about that.  No one will find any fault with us.  As far as the schools are concerned, I am quite sure they will adopt the short certificate if they can get it cheaper than the long one.  There will not be any objection from them.  Therefore, I appeal to Deputies not to press these amendments <Col N="592" /> which are either giving me power to compel its adoption or limiting me in regard to the charge which may be made for one certificate or the other.</P>

What I fear is that a Minister for Health&mdash;not the present Minister&mdash;at some stage can make a regulation altering what is to be put in the long register.  Therefore, when you come to get either a long or a short certificate you may have very meagre information.  The Minister admits that there are two or three Departments in which the long certificate is required to prove which of the Mary Murphys was born on such a date and the only way they can prove that is by saying who were the father and mother of that Mary Murphy. Not only that, but as it stands at the moment it sets out what was the occupation of the parents and who was the informant, and so on.  In my opinion the Minister without this Bill has <Col N="593" /> power to amend the regulation under which these things are inserted in the record.</P>

      <P>I am saying that what is in it should be still in it.  I assert that the requirements which are there are necessary for practically every purpose.  Be that as it may, if at some future date the Minister says that all we require to be stated on a record is that Mary Murphy was born on such date, that she had brown eyes and black hair, and that we should put a clip on her &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am arguing that a Minister in future can do all these things, that he can make a regulation as to what shall be entered.  Then the new regulation under this is simpler, because when the new regulation is produced and you go to see what is in the long one it is practically the same. That is what I want to guard against. It may appeal to some people to have it made that simple, but I think that they should not make it that easy for a Government or a Minister to alter what has been a long and well-established practice and which is necessary for the good order and well-being of the community.  If the Minister has not that power, then I admit that much of my argument falls to the ground.  But I assert that he has that power at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more concerned with the regulation to be made under sub-section (2), the type of regulation that the Minister may make.  One can conceive certain circumstances in which a long certificate might be necessary for a Department, but it is only in very rare cases that that would be necessary, cases in which for one reason or another doubts might be expressed. Some of the officers investigating some particular claim, for instance, under the widows' and orphans' pensions code or the new social welfare code, where there is a doubt, might insist on getting the long certificate.  For that reason, I suggest to the Minister that in the proposed regulations under this section for general use in other Departments it should be laid down that only in cases where there is some doubt should the long certificate be required.</P>
      <P>If you do that and charge four times the amount for the long certificate, I can assure the Minister that you will very soon popularise the short form of certificate.  For instance, if the long certificate cost £1 while the short certificate would be available for 3/-, I am sure the short certificate would very quickly become popularised.  In the vast majority of cases the short certificate will suffice.  Other Departments will only be concerned in some doubtful cases in which they might insist on the long certificate being furnished. I think the Minister can ensure that the short certificate will be in general use in a very short time if he sets about it in these regulations.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment. Paragraph (b) of Section 10, as it stands, could be interpreted as taking away the functions of superintendent registrars in relation to the appointment of assistant local registrars, where the public assistance authority becomes the superintendent registrar. This is not desired.  That paragraph, as it stands, could also be interpreted as requiring the public assistance authority when acting as superintendent registrar to submit the form of accounts on which the individual superintendents are at present paid fees.  The submission of such accounts will not be required from the public assistance authority.  These points are being cleared up by amending this paragraph.</P>

We would like to have them removed and have the position regularised.  I would find it very hard to draft a proper amendment.  The best solution I can see, if the House would agree, is this, that if they let things go, when we approach the local authorities to take matters over we will say to the local authority: &ldquo;If the person who was acting is depending upon it you are quite at liberty to employ that person.&rdquo;  I believe that is the best way to cover it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Within three months after the passing of this Act the Minister shall appoint a representative of labour to the board, and he shall hold office on the terms and conditions prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point to the fact that the Tourist Board is of great importance. While we may not be able to prove that certain interests are represented on the board, it is quite obvious that the tourist people and the hoteliers have, if you like, an indirect representation on it.  While the Bill was under discussion here on the Second Stage the Minister said he did not agree there should be a representative from a certain organisation on the board.  I am not asking that that <Col N="602" /> be done in any strict sense.  However, I do say this.  We are dealing with such a question of vital importance where there is such a large content of labour and the need for good relations between hoteliers and the trade union organisations, that I feel it would be desirable if we had a representative of labour on the board.  I feel it is not necessary for me to elaborate on that fact.  We are satisfied that it is advisable to have representatives on boards of many semi-State organisations. What are the qualifications of some of the people on these boards?  I am at a loss to know why these people were selected and what they represent.  We have them in the sugar company and in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>There is a large labour content, as I have already said, in the tourist industry who are putting their skill, their energy, and their collective ability at the disposal of the trade. They should, therefore, have somebody representing them on the board. The tourist industry is one where there are many conflicting interests involved. I feel that the labour representative might be taken from the Congress of Irish Unions rather than from the particular organisation to which the Minister objected in his statement when this matter came before the House.  I would suggest, for more reasons than one, that the Minister should agree to appoint a representative of labour on the Tourist Board.  There is need for a better understanding between the people who are on those boards and those who are engaged in the ordinary day to day occupations in the whole industry.  It is very desirable to have a representative of labour on those boards.  It is not necessary for me to elaborate on that.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter and appoint a representative from labour. He need not appoint a representative from the particular organisation to which he objected here but he can make a selection from the congress to which those men are affiliated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I know that the Minister is definitely not unsympathetic because, in response to a recent request from the parliamentary Labour Party, he did indicate <Col N="603" /> his sympathy with the idea that there might be a representative of labour on semi-State boards.  He did, of course, indicate&mdash;and I think the members of our Party would fully subscribe to his view&mdash;that it would not be desirable to have workers, who would be actually working in an industry, as representatives on the board which controls that particular industry.</P>
      <P>I think that this is an admirable opportunity to have labour representation on a semi-State board.  I indicated in my speech on the Second Reading that, as far as the tourist industry is concerned, anybody who could represent the views of the workers from the point of view of promoting the tourist industry would be a very desirable asset.  Anybody who would represent the views and opinions of hall porters, waiters, waitresses, the various people who make up the staffs of the hotels, and anybody who represents the views of the railway porters and those people who are on the staffs of Córas Iompair Éireann, would be able to make a good contribution so far as the improvement of tourist facilities in this country are concerned.</P>
      <P>We have workers representing us on the board of Córas Iompair Éireann at the present time, and possibly on one or two boards for which the State is in some measure responsible.  I think the Minister ought to seriously consider this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the suggestion put forward by Deputies Hickey and Corish.  Now especially I think something ought to be done quickly because if there was a representative with labour tendencies, not necessarily a representative associated with the business, he might be able to prevent a repetition of what has been going on in Dublin for the past six months.</P>

      <P>I am taking the lead from the two Deputies who spoke. They very properly did not touch on the matter, nor do I wish to do so in detail, but if there was a man or <Col N="604" /> woman with labour tendencies on the board who could put forward the views of the workers it would ensure that a decent living wage was paid to the people and thus avoid what is happening in Dublin to-day, where so many of the hotels are idle.</P>

      <P>I see what is behind the amendment but, honestly, I do not think it is the type of amendment that ought to be put forward by the Labour Party.  They take the line of having one representative from labour on this board.  My view would be that the board should be entirely composed of people with labour ideals.  This sop business of just looking for one seat is all my eye.  What we want to get is the most efficient people.  That is what we want.</P>
      <P>My experience is that some of the most efficient people in this country are people who are considered to be members of what is described, in a broad, general way, as labour.  One has got to consider where one is to draw the line.  A young boy goes in, say, to the hotel service.  By efficiency, he rises to the top to control a hotel or hotels. When does he cease to be labour?  At what stage?  Is not that a point that must be considered?</P>

      <P>Now let us be honest.  We did that in regard to a couple of other boards. Of what benefit has it been?  Has it prevented strikes?  It has not.  Has it improved the conditions of the workers?  It has not.  Let the Labour Party fight as it should fight on principle for control and not for these sops.</P>

      <P>I can see many cases where it is desirable to have upon these State boards people with a labour background who can give advice and suggestions from their experience, but I am objecting now&mdash;and will always object&mdash;to putting on a person who is described in the terms of this amendment as a representative of labour just as I would object to putting on these boards a person who would be described as a representative of hotel owners or any other class of interest.</P>
      <P>We are setting up here an executive board, not a conference.  A conference of representatives may be desirable or necessary for particular purposes, but for the purpose contemplated here you need an executive authority.  The persons comprising that authority should be chosen because of their individual ability and suitability for membership rather than because of their representative capacity.</P>
      <P>May I say this also, arising out of Deputy Byrne's remarks, I do not think that Bord Fáilte should have any function whatever in the matter of employment conditions in hotels or in relation to the negotiations of agreements between hotel proprietors and trade unions?</P>
      <P>Personally, I think there is very great need to set up some industrial council or other body that would introduce into the industry peace and harmony and ensure the existence of a practicable method of avoiding disputes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Deputy Byrne says: &ldquo;Do it now.&rdquo; If there is any request to me from the Labour Party or from any responsible representatives of labour for the Government to come up and do these things, I will do them.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I will say it again that you cannot have the Government and other people doing it as well.  If the Government comes in to regulate labour conditions and wages in any occupation it will do it alone and not as a number of people trying to do the same thing.  I do not think that will be of benefit to anyone.  I do not think it will be a desirable development and I will not encourage it.  Here, we are dealing with a board which will have no function of any kind in that field and which should not be allowed to intervene.  I will agree that when one comes to consider the personnel of a board of that kind&mdash;and the advice and knowledge and experience that persons can bring to aid its counsels &mdash;one has to have regard to a variety of factors in an endeavour to ensure a properly balanced board that will be able to review questions from every angle.  I urge that the selection of that board be left to whoever has responsibility for it and that those comprising it should not be described, or asked to regard themselves, as representatives of anything but of their own opinions.</P>

I replied, as Deputy Corish indicated, that while I would never agree to the appointment on these boards of a person who was a representative in any sense of the workers employed by them, there are many cases where, in my view, persons with trade union experience and a labour background would be suitable for membership, and <Col N="607" /> that the selection of such persons, on occasion, would be a wise course.

      <P>In supporting this amendment I would ask the Minister not to drift away from it as Deputy Cowan has done.  There is no suggestion whatever in this amendment of appointing a man on behalf of labour in the sense that some people are trying to imply.  The Minister will be appointing people who will be representatives of hoteliers.  It will be because of their experience that the Minister will appoint them.  All that Deputy Hickey asks is that when consideration is being given to the selection of the personnel of this board a person shall be made available from the working staffs, and that such a person, with the experience of a large number of years behind him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A representative of labour and of the workers.  It is not customary to class them as professional people.  They are classified as workers and ordinary labour.  Surely the voice of a worker representing these people could be considered in this connection? Certainly, his experience and advice would be as valuable as that of anybody else on the board, whether representatives of hoteliers or of transport. A person who, in his or her everyday life as a worker has experience of the hotel business or of transport, and so forth, would be of vital importance to the Tourist Board.  That is what this amendment asks for.  It is no use to say that it can be left to the Minister to consider that matter.  I believe that if consideration, and nothing but consideration, is given to the labour and staff side of the workers&mdash;if consideration <Col N="608" /> only, and no representation is given&mdash;this board will not be a success.</P>

      <P>The question I was going to ask has really been answered by the Minister when he said that it will not be a function of the board to enter into the administration of hotels. I was going to ask which particular function of the board&mdash;from Section 4 to Section 14&mdash;would require a labour representative.  I do not see that any sectional representative is needed at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not representing any sectional interest.  All that I am asking is that a man who, as the Minister says, has a certain labour outlook and administrative capacity, shall be appointed a representative to the board.  I claim that there are such men in the labour movement. I wonder how the representatives of the Sugar Company, the Shipping Board, Bord na Móna and other concerns were selected and what were their qualifications?  I suggest that a most suitable place for a labour representative would be on the Shipping Board, as I now suggest for the Tourist Board also.  The Minister could appoint men on that Shipping Board who would be more suitable than some of the people who, I am quite satisfied, were selected more because of their big bank balances than anything else.  I am looking forward to the appointment to the Tourist Board of a man with a wide knowledge of tourism and of its administration in this country.  I am quite satisfied that there are men in the labour movement who would be able to give valuable assistance on this board&mdash;more valuable assistance than that which might be afforded by some people drawn from certain interests which are very closely associated with the hoteliers in this country.</P>

Surely, in the carrying out of such work, there is some executive job which must be done either by an officer acting under the board or by the board themselves if they so wish? Surely a person who has actual experience of hotel work and who would be a representative of the people employed in those hotels would have some influence and a direct bearing on the matter?  A number of us on these benches pointed out that in the grading of hotels a lot of points are taken into consideration&mdash;with the single exception, apparently, of the housing conditions of the employees, the wages which they are paid and the hours which they work.  Surely Deputy Sheldon cannot be right when he says that the board has no function in relation to the administration of hotels?</P>

      <P>The Deputy made an assertion, that in the recital of the functions of the board from Section 4 to Section 14, he did not see any function for the Labour movement or the trade union movement. It seems to me that the one qualification which one would need to be appointed to any of the public boards in this country is that one should not be in receipt of a weekly salary or wage.  Here, however, in Section 5, which sets out the functions of the board, I find one paragraph dealing with a function in which a representative of the trade union movement could be of great assistance.  Sub-paragraph (e) states: &ldquo;to provide and assist, financially and otherwise, in the provision of schemes for the training of persons for work in relation to tourist traffic&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> Does Deputy Allen and the Minister not see that a person in the trade union movement who had been used to negotiating with employers and dealing with employees, such as in Córas Iompair Éireann, could make some useful contribution in the formulation of schemes to do the things provided in sub-section (e)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a board there now on which there are five members. If a vacancy arose one would have to have regard to all the circumstances, including the special qualifications of the remaining members.  Mr. Christenberry's report says that the Minister must have regard to the following fields of endeavour: Hotels, restaurants, catering, transportation in all its phases, public relations, publicity, advertising, the promotion of banking and financing&mdash;<i>pace</i> Deputy Hickey&mdash; architectural construction, merchandising, cultural and professional, etc. Undoubtedly anybody making a selection of a person to fill a vacancy on the board would have to have regard to all the fields of endeavour as well as the labour field, and would try to select a person likely to add to the competence of the board by reason of the special qualifications he had.  I am not saying that a person with all the qualifications required could not be found from amongst those with experience of the trade union movement.  What I am objecting to is putting in a condition in the Bill that the Minister must have regard only to his representative capacity as a spokesman of labour.  That is what the amendment seeks.</P>

      <P>I say that because the trade union movement is based on voluntary co-operation.  We do not have guns, police or an army of any kind to enforce discipline or to carry on administration in the trade union movement.  I feel that there should be no narrow interpretation of the term &ldquo;workers&rdquo; in this connection.  A man who works in an office and devotes his services to administration is as valuable to me as the man who goes out with a shovel on the roadside.  I claim that when you are appointing representatives on this board, one of the first to be selected should be a representative of the workers who has shown his ability in administration in the trade union movement and who can be relied upon to deal with the problems which will confront him on the board.  Taking a long survey of the people who have been selected and appointed to public boards or to semi-State boards, I want to say that I consider it a great injustice that people were appointed to these boards who had big bank balances or a stake in vested interests rather than any qualifications of a representative character. I know men engaged in certain vocations or men engaged in industry who are much more capable of acting as directors of such boards than many of the people who have been selected on these boards.  I would, therefore, urge that the Minister should appoint men with administrative capacity on these boards.</P>

Obviously, we must go further than that.  We must put persons on the board who are equally representative of other interests. Is it not far better to leave to somebody in the position of a Minister the responsibility of selecting seven persons to represent these interests than to tie his hands in advance by an amendment of this kind?</P>

Obviously, the duty of the Minister should be to appoint persons who are best qualified. I do not say that that always happens and that the best men are appointed as members of the board.  I know that within what I might term the working people of this country, which I think is a little wider in its connotation than the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; which was used here, you have the efficiency of the country.  What I want is a board composed of these efficient people who are representative of the workers, not the drones or the big guns whom Deputy Hickey looks for.  What we want is to get people of that type to control and run these State boards.  I think it is a shocking admission of failure to be looking for one seat on the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I gave notice to-day to the Chair that I intended to raise a matter on the Adjournment to-night. Because of the importance of that matter, I want to tell the Chair that the Ceann Comhairle has informed me that I am not entitled to raise it on the Adjournment and the only reason I am not raising it now is because the Ceann Comhairle has ruled that I cannot do so.  I shall, however, take the earliest opportunity of raising it, which I think will be within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27th March, 1952.</P>
