      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House is aware that the Dáil has agreed every year since 1947 to extend the life of the section of the Trade Union Bill which empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to relieve Irish trade unions in certain cases from the obligation to maintain in court the full amount of deposit required by the Act of 1946.  The Bill which was passed last year to maintain the life of that section is due to expire on the 8th July and it is proposed in the present Bill to continue the section further.  The only difference between this Bill and previous Bills is that I am not putting in a time limit in this Bill.  The practice up to the present has been to introduce a Bill extending the section of the 1946 Act for a further year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House, I think, is aware that there is a need for the recasting of trade union legislation following a decision of the Supreme Court, and that certain discussion have been proceeding with a view to deciding the <Col N="1512" /> form which that Bill should take.  It is impossible to forecast when these discussions may lead to the submission of proposals to the House, but it is a reasonable certainty that until that is done nobody will propose to alter the position which now exists under the Act of 1946 in respect of the unions which have been permitted to operate with reduced deposits.  Therefore I think it is better to leave that position without period in point of time until the matter has been reviewed by the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill on the Second Stage many of us expressed the hope that it would be an advance on the existing legislation dealing with housing.  Having raised various points and having seen that the Minister was prepared to introduce some amendments himself, we hoped that, while it could not possibly be expected that it would be an ideal Bill, it would at any rate be a progressive step in housing legislation. In view of the opinions expressed by the Minister on this particular section last night, it now strikes me that this Bill is not going to give us any of the advantages which we had hoped for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this section, the Minister laid stress on the necessity for at least a certain amount of conservatism. <Col N="1513" /> I believe that as it stands this section is completely conservative and nothing more, and I further believe that it is a direction to local authorities to be conservative on the urgent problem of housing.</P>
    <P>Doubt still exists about sub-section (2), the question of every member of a family.  The Minister tried to convey that local authorities when considering the application of a single man may not consider the other members of the family with regard to wages or salary.  On the other hand, when a single man applies for a vacant cottage or house, down the country at any rate, the county medical officer and housing superintendent are obliged to check on whether other members of the family are living with him.  He cannot be considered suitable unless his father, mother, or other members of the family are living with him.  If that is the case, surely the Minister cannot tell us that in investigating the financial position of a single man who applies for a reconstruction grant, the local authority officials must adopt a different system.  If an applicant who is a single man has two or three brothers or sisters living with him, and they are earning, that fact will be considered in assessing the earnings coming to the family during the 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is no use, perhaps, again to condemn the means test introduced in the section.  Unfortunately the House has decided on it.  Unfortunately the House has decided by a majority vote to take what is, in my opinion at any rate, a retrograde step.  One advantage which we saw in the Bill when it was introduced was the increase in the reconstruction grant.  We hoped that that would benefit rural Ireland, but what advantage will it be to an applicant for a reconstruction grant if a means test is to be adopted?  What is the use of our saying that we will give more money when we are bringing into the Bill something which may prevent an applicant from getting not alone an increased grant but perhaps any grant at all?</P>
    <P>We decided on that last night and I had thought that the Minister might have considered the views of the members of the Government Party who, <Col N="1514" /> from their own local knowledge, could see the difficulties but no, it is a question of take it or leave it.  If that is the Minister's policy it will simply mean that people in the country will not get the advantages we had hoped for and we must face that fact.  We must face the fact that the housing code is not what we should like it to be.  We did not ask for any revolutionary changes in this Bill; we asked for advances which we thought would at least be helpful.  When the Minister for Local Government himself tells us that local authorities should be conservative regarding housing what can we expect from them but conservatism? Surely the incentive should come from the Government and from the Minister.  Surely they should encourage local authorities completely to abandon the old-fashioned idea of conservatism. Surely one of the outstanding complaints in this country was that in past years conservatism played too great a part in local affairs. The Minister's approach to this section will ultimately mean that local authorities will not advance one step regarding housing.</P>
    <P>In his defence of that attitude he said that local authorities had not availed sufficiently of Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  If that is so, should the Minister not try to encourage them and tell them that they were remiss in their duties as public representatives in not taking advantage of such an important measure?  We realise the limitations of the 1950 Act but now we are faced with greater limitations and restrictions in this Bill.  Surely we should advance, not go back in our housing policy.  This section completely takes the good out of the Bill no matter what the Minister may say.  It makes local authorities realise that they have the full support of the Minister in adopting a conservative policy on housing.  I regret that we must now oppose a Bill which otherwise we would have had great pleasure in supporting, limited though it might be in its scope.</P>
    <P>Last night, the Minister drifted into other sections and mentioned the advantages to be given to applicants for county council cottages.  Of course, these grants have been given before <Col N="1515" /> whether the Minister wants to admit that or not.  On no occasion am I prepared to drift from the matter under discussion to another matter to suit myself.  We can discuss the other matter when we come to it.  When, instead of encouraging local authorities to respond to the invitation offered in the 1950 Act, he has directed them to be conservative, he has come down to their level, to the level of those local authorities which refused to cooperate. It is a poor prospect for local authorities if their members do not realise that they are obliged as local representatives to advance even in a revolutionary manner with regard to housing the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane mentioned that it would be more advantageous to have one central grant.  I do not propose to go into that now, further than to say that, while we would be very much in favour of a higher State grant, we realise that there is no use in local authorities trying to throw the burden completely on to the central authority, because, if the central authority were prepared to double the present grant, it would mean that the local authority would ultimately get more in the way of rates, would have its position eased in respect of the housing of the people and, at the same time, not be facing up to local responsibilities.  That is why I believe it is imperative that local authorities should prepare the way for housing and should be ready to accept their responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are many who can never hope to get the benefits of this section.  Those of us who are members of local authorities realise that only a small proportion of the people will be able to avail of the full grant and only a small number will be able to avail of even the second or third grade grants on the basis of incomes under £312 and £365 and also incomes under £416.  We know that we will still have to continue to provide houses for people who always have been anxious to build for themselves, if they can get the necessary facilities. There is no use in arguing, no matter what Government may be in power, that everything must come from the Central Fund, that the central <Col N="1516" /> authority must do everything for local authorities, and I believe that the attitude adopted by the Minister is one which is relieving local authorities of their responsibilities and encouraging them not to provide for people who are anxious to build their own homes instead of being tenants of local authority houses.  Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy McGrath and many other Deputies know that there are many such people.  What are they to do? This Bill will not give them the protection they desire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan last night mentioned the Local Loans Fund and the securing of advantages under the Small Dwellings Act, but we are faced with the position that, unless these applicants get two sureties, they will not get such a loan.  What are they to do?  They will have to continue to apply for local authority houses, and local authorities for years to come will be compelled to provide in their rates for such housing because these houses cannot be let at an economic rent.  Members of local authorities and managers know well that most successful applicants for tenancies of these houses are not in a position to pay the economic rent by reason of low wages and the general cost of living.  That being so, a continuing burden is placed on the rates to make up the deficiency between the rent paid and the economic rent.  I believe it would be more advantageous and much better policy if, instead of adopting a policy of limited conservatism, the Minister spoke out more boldly and freely to local authorities which have not co-operated in the past, and put it to them that it would ultimately be to their advantage and to the advantage of the people living within their administrative area to embark on a revolutionary policy in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the lower income groups, we have the problem of the middle income group, the white-collar worker.  Surely we have a responsibility to these people as well.  We cannot expect the ordinary white-collar worker to be able to build his own house without financial help, and if he cannot avail of the Small Dwellings Act, where does he stand?  Is it going to be suggested that if such a worker, <Col N="1517" /> rearing a young family, gets a full grant of £275, he will be able to carry all the burdens involved in providing that house for himself?  Under existing laws, these people will be entitled to apply for the tenancy of what we call down the country non-municipal houses, village or town houses, if they are living in condemned houses.  But we want to give these people that truer sense of individual independence which they are entitled to, and if they are anxious to build their own homes, surely our policy should be to help them to the very utmost to do so. What will the local authority lose by it?  Will they not get the rates every year from that person, and will the advantages accruing to the local authority not completely outweigh any advance the local authority may give by way of grant?  Yet these people are to be denied these advantages, and a person hoping for a reconstruction grant will now have to undergo the narrow and restricted means test embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is hard enough for us to have to listen to some members of local authorities who are ready to put before us such a policy as is here in Section 10, and hard enough for us to combat such a narrow, restricted view as may be put forward by these people, but when persons with incomes over the figures set out here, persons a little better off than those specifically provided for in the section, are to be denied these rights which we were told were being offered to them under the Bill, then I believe this section damns the Bill.  It prevents people who for the past month or so had hoped for advantages from the Bill which were not available in the past from securing these advantages.</P>
    <P>It is essential for us to be honest in our outlook with regard to such measures as this and I believe that it is important that we should be prepared to take the matter of housing completely out of the realm of Party politics.  In so doing we still have an obligation to the people we represent. If we are not prepared to condemn a measure which we believe is restrictive we are failing in our duty to these people.  Unfortunately at this stage <Col N="1518" /> I am forced to speak in such a manner against this section because I believe that people down the country who had hoped they would get advantages from this measure will be disappointed, because I do not believe what has been published in the newspapers about the advantages given under this Bill, and because a large number of would-be applicants who thought they would get benefits under this particular section will find that they were under a misapprehension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having already expressed my views on the limitation set out in the first sub-section, of which the section is explanatory to an inadequate degree, I will not reiterate my views on these questions.  However, I feel that conservatism in housing has been responsible for the fact that such slow progress has been made by some local authorities and by one in particular. I am referring to Cork Corporation, of which I am a member.  Their conservatism now gets a new name; it is called prudence.  It all boils down to this: &ldquo;You are curing one problem. You are creating another problem.  Let us hold on for a while and prices will come down.  You will be creating a labour problem.&rdquo;  The result is that nothing is done; prices have gone up; the obligations of the local authority have mounted year by year; the people are left without houses; two problems are left unsolved, the health problem of the nation, due to improper housing and the expansion in the rateable value of local authority housing, which expansion must be further provided for. I feel that the worst word the Minister could use is the word &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; when the health of the people and the provision of houses for them are under consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond, perhaps inadvertently, went outside the section because it is specifically stated in sub-section (2):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if his family incomes exceeds £208, but does not exceed £312, 62? per cent. of the relevant grant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That can only apply to this section and not to the other provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister that anything <Col N="1519" /> that tends to delay housing or any expressions of his used in this House which may be used by managers down the country to hold back the activities of the local authorities is a bad day's work for that particular branch of our activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the views expressed by Deputy MacCarthy, but it is very difficult to follow the stand taken by Deputy Desmond.  One would imagine that the Deputy, being a member of the Labour Party, would be particularly concerned about ensuring that people in the lower income groups would secure the maximum assistance towards providing them with housing accommodation.  The whole purpose of this particular section is to ensure that the assistance given by the local authorities is confined to those in the lower income groups.  We all know that the finances and resources of local authorities are not very extensive, that if there were no means test provided in this section the funds at their disposal to subsidise housing would be eaten up entirely by the wealthier section of the community and that the people in the lower income groups would be left unassisted.  That is exactly what Deputy Desmond is advocating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What person with an income under £208 per annum can build his own house?  We are only asking for a ceiling of £600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are asking to have the ceiling raised.  The ceiling in the Bill is under £8 per week.  As the Minister has said, he is approaching this matter in a conservative way by trying to confine this assistance to those with an income of under £8 per week.  Having dealt with that deserving section of the community under this Bill and having satisfied their needs, it may be possible, at a later stage, to raise the ceiling a little higher.  At the moment, the purpose <Col N="1520" /> of the Bill is to ensure that those in the income group under £8 per week will get the benefit offered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are only getting part of the benefit&mdash;33? per cent. of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister was not wise in using the word &ldquo;conservative&rdquo;. In this country that word has an unpleasant meaning.  We associate it, perhaps, with the Conservative Party in Great Britain.  However, in this particular section, what the Minister is trying to do is to conserve the funds that are being provided by the local authorities for the lower income groups.  He is seeking to provide that such funds will not be swallowed up by people in the higher income groups.  I do not think that this policy will be described as conservative. If you like, it is a policy designed to ensure that the people who can least afford to build their own houses will be assisted in so doing.  In my view, the first task of the local authorities should be, as it was in the past, to provide housing accommodation for those who are unable to provide it for themselves.  It should not be the function of the local authorities to subsidise wealthy business people, High Court judges and the like in the building of their houses.  The main function of the local authorities should be to help the people in the lower income groups in this way.  If, as a result of experience, we find that the limit is not high enough after having dealt with those people, then, perhaps, at a later stage, it may be possible to raise it to a certain extent. Our first concern, however, is for the poorer sections of the community as far as housing accommodation goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was quite wrong when he said there was a possibility that this section might exclude people in the lower income groups from getting a reconstruction grant.  Of course, there is no restriction whatever in this <Col N="1521" /> Bill on people applying for and obtaining a reconstruction grant.  The provisions under that particular scheme are as heretofore, except that the amount of the grant has now been raised. Therefore, I feel that we should accept this section and give it a chance to operate.  I think nothing was more undesirable than the position which obtained in the past year in which some local authorities set out to give 100 per cent. grants to all and sundry irrespective of means but only allocated a limited sum for the purpose of making those grants.  The net result of that would be that a limited number of wealthy people would swipe the entire sum set aside and the poorer sections of the community would be left unprovided for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say on this section that I have been somewhat surprised by the criticism of it. When this Bill was discussed on Second Reading, Deputy Keyes, the former Minister for Local Government, speaking for the Labour Party, welcomed it and paid a very generous tribute to the Minister for introducing it.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees that this State is making a very fine contribution towards the building of houses right through the country.  Anyone who travels through the country will be surprised by the tremendous progress that has been made in housing in the last 20 years.  Persons who went abroad 25 years ago and who returned have been amazed at the change in the country.  Buildings have been erected in every county and in every area that are a credit to the people residing in them, and a credit to the country.  We have reached the position in regard to housing in rural areas that very little extra push will complete the whole housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night when dealing <Col N="1522" /> with the amendment, we in Dublin are faced with this same problem that has been mentioned.  Under the provisions of the law as it stands, and under the provisions that this Bill intends to continue, a maximum housing grant of £275 is being made available absolutely free by the State to any person who builds his own house.  I think everyone will agree that that is a generous and a very desirable provision in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the 1950 Act we, in Dublin, could have provided an additional £275 for every person who built a house in Dublin for himself. Having considered the matter, Dublin Corporation came to the conclusion that it would be undesirable to make such a provision in Dublin. Apart entirely from the cost involved, which would be very substantial, and apart entirely from the burden that would be placed on the ratepayers by so doing, which would be very substantial, we had to face the position that every person in Dublin who is anxious to build his own house realises now that it is necessary to have a deposit of approximately £200 or £250 to enable him to build the house himself.  Everybody realises that.  We felt that if we were to add £275 from the corporation to the Government grant of £275, making a total free grant of £550 in respect of housing, that extra £275, would go right into the pockets of the builders and that the financial provisions, in so far as they affected the individual buying the house, would be exactly as they are at the moment&mdash; that he would still be expected to provide a deposit of approximately £200 himself and that the other figures would be worked out in such a way that he might have some reduction in the amount of the loan he would borrow under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The fact is that he would still have to pay his £200 deposit and the bulk of the additional money that would be provided by the Dublin ratepayers would go into the pockets of the builders.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Dublin Corporation decided not to avail of the provision in the 1950 Act that would entitle them, if they so desired, to give an <Col N="1523" /> additional grant of £275 in respect of each house.  That provision operated all over the country.  Deputy Cogan has very clearly stated&mdash;I am sure Deputy Desmond would agree with him &mdash;that local authorities throughout the country provided a sum of money for the purposes of these additional grants, and the bigger the additional grant was the less people benefited from the provision they made.</P>
    <P>That was not desirable.  The situation, as everybody knows, was not desirable.  The provision that was made by this House was not operating satisfactorily.  Of course, it is the easiest thing in the world for us in the Dáil to say that local authorities may grant £500 if they wish.  There is no trouble at all in that.  We could do that in a minute, but I think we have got to face up to realities, and the reality is that the central authority itself is giving a maximum grant, in proper cases, of £275.  Nobody can say that is ungenerous or mean.</P>
    <P>Instead of simply saying that local authorities may grant an additional £275 or £ for £ with the central Government grant, this Bill tries to put the position in such a way that there will be a headline for local authorities which says where the family income does not exceed £4 per week and a man has the courage, in those circumstances, to build his own house, you may, if you wish, give that man a grant equal to the amount of the central Government grant.</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy must realise that that is a desirable thing, and the Bill provides that different amounts may be granted to persons whose income does not exceed £8 a week. What Deputy Desmond wants is this. He wants to wipe out the headline that is set out in the Bill and simply to say that, if the central authority grants £275, the local authority may grant an additional £275 to any person whose family income does not exceed £12 a week.</P>
    <P>Housing, as I have already said, has made substantial progress.  This Bill, if it is operated by local authorities in the way it is intended by the Minister <Col N="1524" /> that it should be operated, will encourage people in the lowest income groups to build their houses by guaranteeing them a grant from the Central Funds, and by guaranteeing them a sliding scale grant, depending on their income, from the local authority if the local authority will make the provision.  I do think that our people and local authorities are what one may term house conscious.  I do not understand the situation that has been mentioned in Cork by Deputy Desmond.  As I understand it, in other parts of the country, local authorities are anxious in every way to encourage the building of houses, and this section sets the headline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, it does not.  It sets restrictions.  If it set a headline and gave the local authority power to go over the headline, it would be a very different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look at it in this way, that it does set a headline for local authorities.  I believe that local authorities will adopt the provisions in the Bill, and that there will be uniformity of practice because of the headline in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We discussed housing in 1950, just two years ago, when we brought in a Bill.  We find it necessary, two years afterwards, to amend and extend that Bill, and to bring substantial amendments to it.  If a genuine effort is made by the local authorities who operate this Bill in a satisfactory manner it may be that pressure from local authorities may convince the Minister and convince the Dáil that there should be certain alterations or improvements in the position in the future.  I think that where a genuine effort is being made to deal with the problem and to encourage local authorities all over the country to operate this additional provision to encourage the building of houses we ought to give it a trial.  If we do that, I am sure we will have satisfactory results.</P>

    <P>I think that if the central authority were to give £275, as they are doing, or the maximum grant to persons entitled <Col N="1525" /> to it, and if the local authorities, in a reckless sort of way, were to give £275 also, or the maximum grant or whatever it should be, that would not be the best way to deal with the housing problem.  I believe that, if you are going to create the correct spirit of ownership, the person who owns the house, as he will under the provisions of this Bill, should put something into it, however small.  If he does not put anything into it, he will not have the same spirit of ownership at all.  I think that, in the matter of housing, it is the duty of the Government and of the local authority to encourage as many people as possible, by the generous provisions that are in this Bill, to become the owners of their houses, but I think it would be entirely wrong if so much financial provision was to be made that instead of persons desiring themselves to become owners one would find some group of builders advising people to become owners not so much for the benefit of the individual himself as for the special benefit of the group of builders or of the individual builder concerned.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to look on this Bill as a genuine effort to help in the building of houses all over the country. I think if it is looked on in that light, it will be seen to be a beneficial Bill. It will be seen to be a Bill that does not deserve the criticism or condemnation that it has received here from Deputy Desmond, who should really be concerned with the lower income groups whom the Bill seeks to assist.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to say anything on this section this morning, having said what I wanted to say last night, but for Deputy Cowan's speech.  It seems to me that the Deputy is building on an entirely false and incorrect premise.  He first of all tells us&mdash;I am not going to argue with him on it because I am prepared to accept it that the point of view he puts forward as a member of the Dublin Corporation is their view&mdash;that the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation came to the conclusion that no person could build a house without having to deposit £200.  In the next breath he talked about this section <Col N="1526" /> being beneficial, despite the fact that in certain cases the 100 per cent. grants are limited to people with £4 a week.  How are people with £4 a week going to be able to put down a deposit of £200?  What it means is this, that, on the figures which the Deputy gave, this section, so far as the 100 per cent. grants are concerned, is not going to be of the slightest use to the Dublin Corporation whose line, I am sure, will be to say that it is not worth bringing in a scheme at all under the section.  That is if the figures given by Deputy Cowan are correct.</P>

It may set a headline for those counties that have not already adopted <Col N="1527" /> a scheme, and are not prepared to carry through and complete on the same lines the scheme they have already in operation, but it does not set a headline for those countries where there is a scheme in operation that is better than this section, and in respect of those counties where the housing authorities are prepared to carry on a scheme that is better than this section, with the wisdom or perhaps with the lack of wisdom&mdash;I am not going to argue that&mdash;that the local housing authorities may have.

      <P>We certainly do not say we were wrong and the Minister must remember that when he is making a case for this section he must make a consistent case.  At one moment he makes the case that he wants to bring this section in because it is the most he can expect the general run of housing authorities to put into operation and because he is not prepared to ask the general run of housing authorities to do more.  At the next minute he makes the case that he is introducing this section because those housing authorities who formulated more generous schemes are now anxious to retract and retrace their steps.

At that time the Bill had not been circulated and we knew our power was expiring on the 31st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>About 50 per cent. of the type of person for whom the housing authority were bound to provide and about 50 per cent. of the type of person for whom the housing authority were not bound to provide. On the original applications the estimate that we were given by our officials was that following the Minister's circular the Local Loans Fund grants would be for half the £20,000. About £10,000 would be granted from the Local Loans Fund and about another £10,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is somewhat different.  The amount we provided was £3,895 from the Local Loans Fund, and the amount to be provided by the council's treasurer was £21,376.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The original information given to us by the housing officer at the initial meeting of the county council was that he expected the figures to be approximately half and half.  Apart from that, even supposing the position was as stated, if the Minister's own case was right, it is further evidence that so far as Kildare is concerned this section is not going to be the slightest use to us.  It is further evidence, if the Minister's case is right, that under this section there will be no applications worth while at all for a scheme that restricts our county in the manner in which it is restricted here.  I make no secret of the fact, and I made no secret of the <Col N="1529" /> fact last night, that when the income limit in the Kildare scheme came before the council the proposal I put to the council was a lower income limit than the one that the council ultimately adopted but it was very much higher than this.  So far as this limit is concerned, the position is perfectly clear that in regard to our county the effect of this section will be that we might just as well not have any scheme at all. I tried to find last night when I went home a relevant minute; I could not find it but speaking from recollection, I think that the original scheme brought in by the county council was increased by 50 per cent. at a meeting of the council as a result of a proposal put forward by a very prominent member of the Minister's own Party in the county council.</P>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's point of view that there are some areas for which this section would be a sound provision, but there are some areas for which it is not a provision at all.  I am thrown back again to the point of view that I have already expressed and about which I did not intend to annoy the House again were it not for the speech of Deputy Cowan. It is no good trying, on a very limited income basis, to make the same provisions in respect of places as different as the County Borough of Dublin and the western seaboard.  It is no good trying to suggest that the conditions are the same in Kerry as they are in Kildare.</P>
      <P>You have in Part VI of this Bill a provision by virtue of which you can have one set of circumstances in the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork and a different set of circumstances in the rest of the country.  That does not entirely meet the argument that I put forward but it does go a substantial part of the way towards meeting it. It would be much better that there would be a difference between the county boroughs and the country areas rather than that there would be, purely for the sake of uniformity, purely for the sake of streamlining, a similar provision for every part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said that this section will <Col N="1530" /> apply differently to different counties. The limitations set out in Section 10 are, in my opinion, inevitable when one considers the application of Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  At the time the 1950 Act was submitted to the local authorities I remember it was only out of sympathy for those with limited staffs who would have to administer it and out of consideration for the administrative difficulties which it was bound to raise that we decided not to have a means test in the application of that section in so far as we adopted the scheme.  In fact, most of our members were in favour of a means test and it was only to avoid the administrative difficulties that we foresaw that we agreed, when the section enabled us to do that, to go the whole hog, so to speak, and adopt the 100 per cent. scheme.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that as time went on it became obvious that some means test should be applied.  A local housing authority is concerned mainly with those who are most in need of housing. In Donegal, at least&mdash;I am sure the same does not apply in a wealthy county like Kildare&mdash;the majority of our people are living on uneconomic holdings, 75 per cent. having a valuation of £5 or under.  These are the type of people who in many cases live in the small thatched dwellings which are, on an average, 100 to 180 years old.  If they are to replace these houses they require substantial assistance from the local authority and the central housing authority.  In so far as the section will benefit these people, we welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the section sets any limitation to the grants payable, one can only say that there are not unlimited funds available for anything in this country, let alone housing, and if we are to tackle the problem of housing, it is only natural that we should start with those who are most in need of a grant.  I am afraid that under Section 7 of the 1950 Act many people whose houses were not quite so bad but who felt that there was provision available that they might never have an opportunity of getting again, were encouraged to do a little <Col N="1531" /> building and to take advantage of the section while the going was good. In that way, a good deal of money that was available for housing was diverted to the pockets of people who could easily afford to build within their means and with the assistance of whatever limited grant would be available from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The question of the ceiling has been discussed.  No matter how high the ceiling would be raised people would be left on the margin who would not be satisfied.  When one considers ability to repay a loan, the ceilings arranged in the various categories in Section 10 permit of those people taking advantage of a loan which they would be in a position to repay over the prescribed period.  In that way it does not act unfairly against the people in those income groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in so far as it has a very definite rural bias and tends to conserve the funds available for the people who are most in need of housing.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which the Minister should have taken cognisance of in the section, in so far as it applies to Gaeltacht housing.  This Bill makes provision for the Gaeltacht which the 1950 Act omitted but I would like that the limitations set out in Section 10 should not apply to people building houses in the Gaeltacht, for this reason, that in many cases people, on retirement, go to live in the Gaeltacht so that the members of their family may gain a competent knowledge of Irish.  I refer to people such as retired Civic Guards and schoolteachers. They are inclined to build in the Gaeltacht.  That applies in Donegal.  Such building would take place to a greater extent if houses built in the Gaeltacht were not subject to the limitations expressed in Section 10 of this Bill.  In that way people would be encouraged to move into the Gaeltacht in greater numbers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the tendency is for the young people who are reared there to move out.  It is only those who are anxious to take advantage of the facilities for learning the native language, <Col N="1532" /> and those who can afford it because they have some pension or income on retirement, who are inclined to move in.  Fortunately there is a number of people who do that.  It would be a great encouragement in that direction if the limitations in Section 10 did not apply in the case of building in Gaeltacht areas.  I am sorry the Minister did not see fit to make that provision</P>
    <P>Otherwise those of us who have had experience of administering Section 7 of the 1950 Act must regard Section 10 as inevitable.  I know that various local authorities will always find fault with the ceiling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how high it is raised, some persons will be left out.  The line must be set somewhere. People will always complain that the ceiling should have been £100 more so as to bring in a particular group.  As far as it applies to some of the western seaboard counties, such as Donegal, it will not set any brake at all.  It will reserve the funds so that the local authority may concentrate on the most necessary type of building, which would be for the purpose of slum clearance and clearance of the thatched cottages that have been standing for a century because the owner, out of his uneconomic holding, was not able to carry out reconstruction or rebuilding.  I think the Bill will mean the end of that type of house.  If so I cannot agree with those who say that it will not be a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in very general agreement with Deputy Brennan.  We do not always agree in the local authority on matters, including housing, but we have had the same experience of the section in the 1950 Act and I must say that I agree with him that, from that point of view, these limitations were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view is that in so far as a local authority has to pay anything out of the ratepayers' money towards housing, that must be limited to the provision of houses for those for whom the local authority is normally supposed <Col N="1533" /> to provide.  These provisions are designed to assist a local authority in carrying out the duty of providing houses for certain types of people.  It is very often difficult for a local authority to proceed with many of its schemes and sections such as this will help by making provision for those who do not have to wait for the local authority to go the whole hog and provide the house.  There will be people who, with some measure of assistance, can begin themselves.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I must say that I still find myself in this much disagreement with the section that it will put an intolerable burden on the administrative staff of the local authority.  The determination of means in categories such as these four will mean a very great deal of work and, as I said earlier, I doubt if the Minister's Department would care to undertake such a means test themselves in the administration of the State grant. However, it is easier to say that than to find some way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>On balance, I find myself in agreement because I think it is very wrong that the ratepayers' money should be handed out to those who are not in real need of it or that the local authority should be asked to contribute from the ratepayers' money to the provision of houses for those outside the classes that a local authority is by law expected to provide for.</P>
    <P>If I might make a slight reference to Section 11, I do not quite understand how the provision made in Section 11 will tie in with the provision in paragraph (iv) of sub-section (1) of Section 10.  It appears to me that persons whose family income exceeds £416 will, under Section 11, be able to get a 50 per cent. grant, whereas those below £615 and above £365 will be limited to a 33? per cent. grant.  That may not happen but at a glance it seems it could happen.  You could easily have a person living as a tenant in a dwelling provided by the housing authority whose family income is £416 and that person will now be entitled to a grant from the local authority of 50 per cent., whereas if his income was <Col N="1534" /> between £365 and £416, and he was not a tenant of a house provided by a local authority, he would be limited to a 33? per cent. grant.  Whether that is a fact is a point which I should like to hear the Minister explain.</P>

It is an advance on Section 7 of the 1950 Act because Section 7 was adopted only by certain county councils.  One of the points mentioned to me by a few people in my constituency had reference to the desirability of raising the ceiling, as has already been urged on the Minister.  I suppose no matter how high the Minister may put the ceiling, somebody will be left out.</P>

Another point on which I should like some information is whether children's allowances will be taken into consideration in the means test.  I do not wish to delay the House longer as the Minister is desirous of getting on with the work but I hope this Bill will be obligatory on all councils because it was left to the discretion of each council as to whether they would adopt Section 7 of the 1950 Act and the result was that only a few councils adopted it.</P>

      <P>In the computation of income under the preceding section, deduction shall be made for all charges which are proper to be deducted for income as assessed under the Income Tax Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained the case for this amendment last night when we were discussing sub-section (2) of Section 10.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he is not prepared to accept the amendment in the form it appears here, he would give greater freedom in sub-section (2) of Section 10 on the Report Stage to make it quite clear that the local authority itself can define what they mean by &ldquo;family income&rdquo; in their scheme. The difficulty of the position as I see it is that, though a local authority may wish to define &ldquo;family income&rdquo; in a certain way, the officials of that authority, when it comes to the administration of the scheme, may be afraid that they are limited by the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 10 and that they are not entitled to pass a grant made under the scheme because the scheme may be in contravention of the statutory authority given in sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he wanted to give a certain fluidity to the local authority and I agree that that is desirable, but I want to be sure that the fluidity is such that there will be no danger at a later stage of the auditor coming along and saying that the scheme contravened sub-section (2) and that the local authority was not entitled to interpret income in the way it had decided to interpret income, because of the provisions of sub-section (2) of the section we have just passed.  I would be quite happy to have it done either way, by the local authority or here, so that there would be no doubt about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A farmer may, if he so desires, elect to qualify for a grant by the housing authority on the basis of family income, as computed under the preceding section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another amendment to meet a case which I put to the Minister on the Second Stage.  I think the Minister will readily agree with me that a farmer with a valuation up to any of the limits he suggests&mdash;let us take the top one of £34&mdash;and who holds that farm unencumbered, is in a much better position than the farmer who has a load of debt upon him.  I want to provide some way by which such farmers of the latter type can take advantage of this Bill.  We provided in our scholarship scheme in County Kildare a way by which a farmer could deduct from his means mortgage interest so as to equate so far as we can the farmer who held his land unencumbered with the farmer who had a bank debt on it.  The only way in which I could do it within the framework of the Minister's section was to give the farmer concerned the option of going either on the valuation or on income.  If he had a load of debt on the farm, then the interest on that debt would be deductible from his income, and in that way he would be able to get an advance, because obviously if he had a heavy debt on the place in relation to its size he would <Col N="1537" /> not be in a position to take advantage of Section 9, even within the low limits suggested by the Minister.</P>

      <P>There was a character in my county who went to a fair to sell a sow, and the man who came to ask him the price said: &ldquo;Is she with young?&rdquo; The seller was not sure whether the intending purchaser would like her to be with young or without young, and his reply to the query was: &ldquo;If you like, she is, and if you do not, she is not.&rdquo;  In putting down this amendment Deputy Sweetman is trying to achieve a position that I do not propose to permit him to achieve, namely, that a farmer can, if it suits him, be described as a wage-earner or <i>vice versa.</i>  The recognised rule for applying the means test is the method of valuation.  We all know of its weaknesses.  If we were to adopt what is suggested in the amendment it would not only be a complete and absolute departure from the procedure in the past but it would create complications that it would be impossible to overcome.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Its object is to prevent a person whose family income exceeds £365 but does not exceed £416 a year and who is eligible for a supplementary grant under Section 11 from being rejected for a grant under that section on the grounds that his income limits render him eligible for the grant in paragraph (iv) of sub-section (1) of Section 10. <Col N="1538" /> Under that paragraph the supplementary grant payable is 33? per cent. of the State grant whereas the supplementary grant payable under Section 11 amounts to 50 per cent. of the State grant.</P>

      <P>This is also a drafting amendment.  It arises from the deletion of Section 8 which prohibits payment of a supplementary grant under Sections 9, 10 or 11 of the Bill to a person living in a local authority house where the house has been sold to him by the local authority.  It was not the intention that such a person would be prohibited from obtaining a grant under Section 9 or Section 10.  For drafting reasons, it has been decided that it would be neater to clarify Section 11 and delete Section 8 rather than amend Section 8.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the position, a person who is a non-vested tenant as a result of amendment No. 16 can now apply for his grant and get it under Section 11.  Before this he was eligible for a grant under Section 10 and, even though he did not apply under Section 10, he was ruled out from applying under Section 11. The position now is that a non-vested tenant of a cottage comes in under Section 11 and does not come in under Section 10 at all.  Is the position limited purely to the tenant himself? For instance, if there is overcrowding in an existing local authority house the extra families that are in that house are sometimes eligible for consideration for another local authority house.  Will they now be entitled to apply under Section 11 or are they thrown back on Section 10?  It says here: &ldquo;the occupier on a monthly or lesser tenancy&rdquo;.  Does the occupier mean the occupier of the whole house provided by the local authority or does it mean the occupier of any portion of a dwelling provided by a housing authority?  I understood Section 11 was for the purpose of giving greater ease to a housing authority by enabling them to have a somewhat wider scope in giving higher grants to people to whom they would normally have responsibility for housing rather than the people that are mentioned in Section 10.</P>
      <P>I took Section 11 to be more in ease of the person whom the housing authority would normally be required to house, and that by giving a 50 per cent. grant, even though such person may be slightly over the limit for the grant provided in Section 10, the housing authority would in that way lessen the demands made on it.  If that is so, surely one should include not merely the occupier of the whole dwelling but also the sub-tenant of such occupier, who is really a local authority non-vested tenant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I appeal to Deputy McGrath, who is so intolerant when he believes anyone is saying anything against a Minister in his Coalition Government, to treat this matter objectively and not be jealous of the fact that this was conceived by a colleague of his, Deputy Hickey.  As I understand the section it proposes to give what is in effect a blank cheque in relation to borrowing powers.  I have already indicated the position to the Ceann Comhairle.  He said he would facilitate me in raising the matter on <Col N="1543" /> certain sections of this Bill.  I have already indicated that it is my desire and that of my colleagues to ascertain from the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, the effect on the cost of building and on the rents to be paid by the prospective tenants of local authorities which the increased rate of interest will have following the coming into law of the Finance Bill. The Finance Bill which was passed by this House on Tuesday last gives power to the Minister for Finance to raise the interest rates on loans by 1½ per cent.  The existing rate of interest charged by the Local Loans Fund to the local authorities is 3¼ per cent.  I do not pose as a financial expert but I have it in writing that if £1,000 is borrowed by a local authority under the existing regulations it means that at the end of a 50-year loan period a sum of £2,030 will be repaid in respect of the £1,000 which was borrowed.  That means that, under the existing interest rate charged by the Local Loans Fund, more than half the economic rent paid by the tenants of houses built by local authorities, if they pay the economic rent, goes on the service of interest.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy McGrath will defend the system whereby local authorities buy land, develop the housing site, pay architects' and engineers' fees, pay the cost of material for building the houses and the wages to workers for building the houses, and whereby that valuable service will be less than 50 per cent., whereas a few gentlemen who sit down in Foster Place and who, apparently, have the right under existing conditions to regulate the rates of interest, are going to get 50 per cent. for the service of printing Treasury notes which help to pay the workers and all concerned for the erection of those houses by local authorities. That is bad enough but it will be much worse on the coming into operation of the Finance Bill, when the rates of interest will be increased by another 1½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a financial expert.  I can be corrected by the Minister and his financial advisers and experts in this matter if I am wrong, but I am informed that if 1 per cent. is added to <Col N="1544" /> the existing rates of interest by the Local Loans Fund for a house costing, in round figures, say, £1,000, it will mean an extra charge of 2/4 per week to the tenant who pays the economic rent of the house.  If the existing interest rates are increased by 1½ per cent., I am informed that it will mean an extra 3/6 per week in rent to the tenant of a house built in the future by a local authority.  That is a frightful state of affairs.  I am not a member of a local authority but I study the operations and activities of the local authorities.  Under every Government for a long period of years past these local authorities have been doing their best to provide the houses so badly needed, not alone in my constituency but in every other part of the country as well.  The Minister and his predecessor in office know that there is an agitation in several centres throughout the country by organised bodies of tenants occupying local authority houses against what they regard as the excessive rents they are called upon to pay, either under the differential rent system or under the standard rent system.  That agitation has been going on for some time past in several towns in my constituency.  I do not want to exaggerate the position but, as I see it, the effect of the increased loan charges upon the cost of building and upon the rents that must be paid arising out of the higher cost of building will be worse in the future than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Previous to 1939 I was informed&mdash;and it is on the records of this House&mdash;in answer to parliamentary questions, that the average rent paid by a tenant of a house built by a local authority represented roughly one-eighth or one-ninth of the weekly income of the head of the family.  Deputy McGrath knows more about this than I do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be hard for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the position is in Cork but it is a fact that in certain cases in my area the rents are now so high as a result of the increased cost of building&mdash;in Portlaoighise, Birr, in particular, and Edenderry, <Col N="1545" /> to mention but three towns&mdash; that some of the workers occupying houses built by local authorities and let to them in the last couple of years are paying as much as one-third and one-fourth of their weekly income.  I do not blame the working class tenants of local authority houses for their annoyance at that position.  I may be wrong, but as I see it the position is going to become much worse.  The increase in the rates of interest which will very likely be charged in the future to local authorities for whatever moneys they may have to borrow under this section will have the effect of putting up the cost of building and of putting up the rents that will have to be paid as a result of the increased cost of building.  I say seriously to the Minister that the increased rate of interest is going to provide money to bankers over whom this House has very little, if any, control.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 28, after &ldquo;direction&rdquo;, to add &ldquo;provided the local authority concerned is satisfied that the rent being charged is a fair rent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our views are again at variance with the Minister's but are on somewhat different lines from those which we expressed last night and this morning. We believe that it is essential that local authorities should have a vital say in this respect.  Other Deputies will bear me out that there could be extraordinary abuse if the section is allowed to go through as it stands. We have had cases in Cork of people building and applying for grants.  The section says that there could be an appeal to the Minister and that can be a great danger.  When we did not see our way to give the full grant to these individuals we knew, of course, that they had the right to appeal to the Minister and that they took advantage of that right, but the reason that we did not agree to give the maximum grants was the rents charged to the tenants by these landlords&mdash;in fact, we gave the very minimum grants.  We <Col N="1551" /> know that the law is such that we have to give them a grant, but we also know that some of these individuals went to the very last extreme to get the maximum grant from us.  Are we now to say that a person building a house and letting it to a tenant is to get the maximum grant, notwithstanding the fact that he, a new type of landlord which is cropping up in this country, can charge as much as £3 10s. per week in rent?  It is unjust that we should give them such facilities as a maximum grant when they charge such prohibitive rents.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to leave the decision to the local authority. Members of local authorities know local conditions and they are not extreme in their attitude with regard to these matters.  They are willing to say that a person building and renting a house is entitled to a fair return, to an economic rent from the tenant, and if such a landlord is charging a fair rent, we say that, in all justice, he is entitled to the maximum grant, but we certainly do not agree with these people charging exorbitant rents to people who are not in a position to build houses for themselves.  There are certain people who will not be able to build their own homes because they may be in employment which involves them in being changed from one area to another.  There are many such people.  They have no hope of building a house, say, in Cork when, within a few years, they may be transferred to some other county.  The difficulties involved for these people are immense and they have no alternative but to rent a house.  If the people building and renting these houses are so materialistic in their outlook that they are determined, because supply cannot meet demand, to charge exorbitant rents, I say that the local authority should not be compelled to meet their demand for the maximum grant.  That is why I ask that the local authority be allowed the right to decide whether the rent being charged is a fair rent. This is a burden which is being placed on the local authorities and on the ratepayers and if Deputy Cowan, who pleaded this morning on behalf of <Col N="1552" /> the ratepayers, is genuine in his arguments, he will agree with this amendment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies tried to suggest that the views expressed by me as a member of the Labour Party were in favour of the higher income classes rather than in favour of the working-class people in the lower income group, but it is because we realise our responsibilities to all sections that we are prepared to argue the amendments which we have here.  All sections must be catered for.  We believe that it is only a particular section of the community that will be able to rent some of these houses, and even though some of these people may have incomes of £10, £12 and £13 per week, we know that with present money values and the present cost of living&mdash;not merely for the past 12 months but for some years back&mdash;these people cannot possibly pay up to £3 10s. per week on rent and keep themselves and their families.  We consider that any rent as high as some of those which are being charged is not just or fair and we are not prepared to hand over the right of a local authority to a Minister or any other executive authority to decide whether a person who appeals is to get the full grant or not.  Where is local authority when the Minister for Local Government in the Custom House in Dublin can come to a decision against the wishes of the combined members of a local authority and can decide that an aggrieved person shall get the maximum grant, although he may be an extortionist in the matter of rent?</P>
    <P>We believe it to be a fundamental principle in local government that when a combination of the members elected to local authorities, together with the manager, decide that they will not give the maximum grant, their views will be properly considered.  We do not intend to surrender the right of the local authority to such an extent as to agree that a person in County Cork or in any other county can, in defiance of the wishes of that authority, get an Order from the Minister saying that he must get the maximum grant.  We are prepared and anxious to give the maximum grant but only on condition <Col N="1553" /> that the landlord is not charging an unduly high rent to the tenant.  We are willing to give the fullest co-operation in this respect and to do everything possible to help people by giving as high a grant as possible, but only on that condition.  Who will say that greater wisdom can be brought to bear on the matter at the centre of Government in Dublin as to what is a proper rent in various counties than can be brought to bear on it by members of the local authority?</P>
    <P>This right of appeal may not operate to any great extent in many parts of the country, but there are areas where the difficulty will arise, and it is because we realise our responsibility and are prepared to face up to it as members of local authorities that we say the right of deciding the question of a fair rent should be left to the local authority.  Deputies have pointed to the danger that some well-to-do people may get too much from local authorities and that, if local moneys are to be expended in such a way, we will not be able to meet our commitments in respect of other people.  If that is true in regard to other sections of the Bill it must be much more true in this regard.  How could anybody in this House say that such a person should get the maximum grant?  We are aware, of course, that those who advocate that policy produce the line of argument that ultimately the State will benefit through rates.  In the long run that may be true.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the problem of dealing with present-day difficulties with regard to housing.  What protection has the tenant of such a house? If the tenant is paying the landlord an exorbitant rent, what is the former's position with regard to the payment of rates?  We want to ensure that the tenant, who is already paying an exorbitant rent, is not saddled with the burden of high rates, because there are such instances.  If the landlord will get the advantage of a maximum grant, it means that the full rate must be paid.  However, in very many cases, it is not the landlord who pays the rates, but the tenant.  It is no use saying that agreement can be made between the landlord and the tenant as <Col N="1554" /> regards the payment of rates.  We are not going to discuss something that may happen.  We are faced with the discussion of something which we have before us in print.  We feel that the local authority should pay the maximum grant to the landlord only when they have ascertained that the rent being charged is a fair one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I agree with Deputy Desmond about Section 10, I certainly disagree with his attitude with regard to this section. I believe this is a very necessary section due to the attitude of local authorities, especially Cork County Council.  We had the case of people building houses in the Cork County Council area for letting purposes.  They were very expensive houses, to suit a certain type of people, many of whom were described by Deputy Desmond as a floating population, people who were transferred from time to time&mdash;bank clerks, insurance officials and the like. Such people would not go to the trouble of building houses themselves because they were never sure of a permanent residence.  Some persons built houses to suit this category or to suit any other person who wanted a decent house and could pay a decent rent. They applied for a letting grant to the Southern Committee of the Cork County Council before I became a member of it.  Instead of paying them £40 a year, the council allowed them 5/- a year.  If such action is not ridiculous on the part of a local authority, I do not know what to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Afterwards, when I was a member of the county council and when cases came before us, I pointed out that the people who would get the letting grant would not be entitled to the remission of rates allowed to people who ordinarily built houses and that two-thirds of the money would be recouped by the Department.  It was decided to refer the cases to the assistant county manager and to have his engineers and officials examine the costings of these houses and determine what would be a fair grant in a particular case.  The officials agreed that a grant of £35 a year should be given instead of the grant of 5/- a year which I mentioned <Col N="1555" /> above.  The local authority were not losing ¼d. by that.  They did not contribute anything.  I feel it is hardly acting within the spirit of the Act designed to encourage house building to have assessed the letting grants they made so that they would not lose anything. This matter has led to a lot of arguing on the part of some local authorities.  I can understand people who are used to paying 1/6 per week for cottages or 4/- per week and 10/- per week for houses coming to the conclusion that £2 10s. per week or £3 per week seems an exorbitant rent. When the interest which people have to pay on borrowed money and other matters were inquired into, it was clear that there was no exorbitant profit and that if the people concerned had put their money into any branch of industry they would have received a very much higher rate of interest.  I believe that those people who are building houses for letting would be much better provided for if the Minister gave them the ordinary grant of £275 and the remission of rates for a period.  I feel that, at the end of ten years, the builder would have benefited much more by the lump sum of £275 and by the remission of rates than he would by receiving a letting grant of £40 a year for ten years.  Then we would not have any of these ridiculous discussions in county councils and elsewhere.  However, bearing in mind the fact there is no such provision in the Bill, I feel that people who put their money into the provision of houses for certain sections of the people and who have to raise such money should be afforded protection and that there should be some means of ensuring that they will be given the benefit of this Bill.  When an appeal is made to the Minister, I feel sure that the officials of his Department will inquire into costings, into rents and so forth, just as did the officials of the South Cork Committee of the county council.</P>

      <P>I would not expect that any information I might be able to <Col N="1556" /> give to the Deputy would be likely to alter his point of view.  To put it another way, any information I might be able to give would not alter his approach to this matter.  Section 19 of the 1948 Act was inserted in that Act by the late Deputy Murphy, who was a member of the Labour Party.  When that section was inserted in that Act all these industrialists and commercial people were circularised, encouraged and urged to provide houses.  Regulations were made under that section enabling a Minister for Local Government to adjudicate on any appeals from the decisions of local bodies in regard to these grants.  My immediate predecessor, who was also a member of the Labour Party, made certain decisions on certain appeals that came from County Cork.  The legal advice that was secured by Cork County Council would seem to suggest that there was not any power to make such regulations under Section 19 of the Act of 1948.  I am merely seeking to have it established beyond doubt that the invitation extended by a Labour Minister and the decisions given on appeals by a Labour Minister will be honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was dealing with the general question of the amounts paid as pensions to members of the Old I.R.A. and to the widows of members of the Old I.R.A.  I had made the point that in relation to 1923, when these pensions were originally fixed, the same amounts paid now, in view of the increased cost of living in the meantime, <Col N="1557" /> are entirely inadequate.  I instanced certain persons specifically.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the case of the widow's pension of 17/6 a week fixed by the 1923 Act and not altered since.  There are quite a number of anomalies and quite a number of matters to be rectified. We have the extraordinary position in regard to a widow of a man who was wounded and died of wounds after 1924 and prior to 1937 that no pension is paid in that case.  That is in the case of a person who was married after 1924 and prior to 1937. A gratuity of £112 10s. is payable in that case but if the wounded Old I.R.A. man married since 1937 no pension at all is payable to his wife when he dies.  That is certainly unfair because a husband or a father with a disability which entitles him to a pension cannot make provision by way of insurance for his family.  Obviously, being in receipt of such a disability pension, no insurance company would take him.  If they did insure him they would only do so at a premium he could not afford.  In the circumstances a very grave hardship is caused to the widows and families of those Old I.R.A. men who are in receipt of wound pensions and who have married subsequent to 1937.</P>
      <P>Even where a marriage allowance is payable, when the percentage of disability increases there is no increase in the marriage allowance.  I put it to the Minister&mdash;I am sure that in this matter I will have the entire support of the House&mdash;that there is a good case for removing the anomalies and the causes of grievance in regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>Then there is the case of a person with a disability aggravated by service and where, as a result, a person loses a limb.  There is no provision whereby an artificial limb can be provided for that person.  I think that is something that ought to be remedied.  If a person loses a limb as a result of a disability aggravated by service, an artificial limb should be provided for him by the State free of charge, and he should be maintained during the period he is learning to use the artificial limb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further cause of grievance <Col N="1558" /> in the case of those pensioners whose pension award is made final.  Where the award is made final the recipient is not entitled to hospitalisation and the State will not contribute to the expenses of his hospitalisation.  We all know that special hospitals and special hospital facilities are provided for men from this country who served in the British forces.</P>
    <P>I think we owe that much at least to the members of the Old I.R.A. who are in receipt of pensions for wounds and disability.  Even after their pension award is made final they should receive any necessary hospital treatment and hospitalisation free of charge and at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>Special hospitals or a special hospital in proper surroundings should be set aside wherein those veterans of the War of Independence could be treated and where they could have, during the period of their treatment, adequate recreation or rest rooms.  They should have grounds or parks in which they could walk around to enjoy themselves as best they could during the period they were in hospital.  I think every member of the House, and every member of the public, would support the Minister if he were to provide hospitals for the treatment of those men who served the State in their younger days without counting the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Vivion de Valera have asked the Minister to put an end to the abatement that is made in respect of military service pensions. Where a person served in the Old I.R.A. and is in receipt of a military service pension, his pension is abated, or reduced, if he should happen to draw money from the State or from a local authority.  We have instances of individuals who served in the I.R.A. and are in receipt of military service pensions working side by side with individuals who, at the same period, served in the British forces and are now in receipt of British pensions for that service.  In the case of the man who served in the British forces, he receives his British pension in full without any deduction, whereas the man who served this State has a deduction <Col N="1559" /> made from his pension under the authority of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The amount received by the State under that abatement has been variously estimated.  I understood the figure was something about £27,000.  I endeavoured, by means of questions to the previous Minister for Finance, and the previous Minister for Defence, to ascertain precisely the amount involved, but apparently it was not readily obtainable.  I was informed that it would be too difficult to ask to have a return prepared giving exactly the amount by which the State benefits as a result of this abatement.  Deputy MacEoin yesterday put it at a figure not exceeding £35,000.  Whether it is £27,000 or £35,000, a good case has been made to the Minister and the Government to have those abatements abolished.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will be encouraged by the expressions of opinion that have been made from all sides of the House to have this abatement, which is in the nature of a nuisance, wiped out.</P>
    <P>As regards the ordinary administration of it, there are complaints from men entitled to military service pensions that their pensions are held up because the local authorities by whom they are employed do not send proper returns to the Department of Defence in time in regard to their remuneration. As a result, payment of the pensions to which those men are entitled is held up until such time as the local authority thinks fit to send the information to the Minister's Department. There is that little bit of annoyance added to the general feeling in regard to the abatements.  We must also understand that, although the abatement is administered by the section which deals with pensions in general, there must be some cost to the State to administer this particular section. Therefore, on the grounds that cost can be avoided, that it is an annoyance and that it is inequitable and unfair, the Minister would have good grounds for abolishing this abatement.</P>
    <P>Another problem with which the members of the Old I.R.A. are faced at the moment is in connection with their service in Government Departments <Col N="1560" /> or with local authorities.  Men who served in the I.R.A. between 1916 and 1921 or 1923&mdash;quite a number of them&mdash;obtained employment in the Civil Service or with local authorities. They find now, reaching as they are the age limit for retirement, that they are not entitled to the same Civil Service or local authority conditions as to pension as if they had served in the Civil Service or with a local authority, instead of in the I.R.A., during those years.</P>

      <P>It probably is.  I just want to mention it as part of the case that I am asking the House and the Minister to deal with.  I think I have just said sufficient, and would appeal to the Minister to consider that particular case.  The Old I.R.A. have submitted memoranda to the Minister in which that point is dealt with.  I would ask him to consider it with the Minister for Finance and the members of the Government sympathetically.</P>
      <P>I and other Deputies have asked the Minister to consider also a very small section of men who served in the Casement Brigade.  The surviving members of that brigade now hardly exceed 20. They feel they are entitled to special consideration and that their services in a difficult situation should be acknowledged by the State now.  I know that the Minister has difficulties in regard to that particular section. They themselves appreciate the difficulty but they do feel that their service to Ireland in the Casement Brigade ought to be acknowledged and honoured by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy General MacEoin yesterday dealt with the Referee under the Military Service Pensions Acts and, as I gathered from him, he made the case that it was wrong in principle that a person who had decided a case should be, as it were, the appeal tribunal in regard to that case.  Everyone would agree that in general the principle as stated by General McEoin is a sound and a fair principle.  Like other members of the House I know the <Col N="1561" /> Referee appointed under the Military Service Pensions Acts.  I know that the Referee is anxious to carry out the duties with absolute impartiality and with fairness and I am perfectly certain that he considers all the evidence that is put before him in a fair and impartial way.  I am also perfectly sure that in looking into this question of what one might term appeal cases, he would be influenced by the new decisions of this Parliament in regard to the consideration of the factors that entitle a man to a military service pension.</P>
    <P>However, there is undoubtedly a danger that persons who are disappointed, who have been turned down before and are turned down again, may say that they did not get a fair crack of the whip or that their case was not heard and considered fairly and impartially.  It is undesirable that anyone should have that apprehension.  It would be wrong that anyone should have that fear but there is danger that it will be there and perhaps the Minister might consider whether it would be possible to have a different Referee to deal with the new cases as distinct from the cases of appeal.  For myself, I would have much preferred that there was some different machinery as the final court of appeal in regard to those cases.  I certainly would have liked to see an appeal tribunal consisting of men who had rendered service at the very highest level during the Old I.R.A. days deciding those cases finally.  I certainly would like to see, as I am sure the House would like to see, an appeal tribunal consisting of the Minister himself and, say, the Minister for Education, Deputy Moylan, and the former Minister for Defence, General MacEoin.</P>
    <P>In England, dealing with British Army pensions, they have specifically laid it down in regulations that in determining pensions, whether a person is entitled to a pension or not, there must be a bias in favour of the applicant and that he must get the maximum pension he is entitled to; where there is a doubt as to whether he is entitled to that higher pension or lower pension, the doubt must always be resolved in favour of the pensioner. <Col N="1562" /> I believe that that is a very human, a very sensible and fair way of approaching it.  That is why I say I would have liked to see a tribunal, such as I have mentioned, of men who would, knowing them as I do, in the ordinary way resolve the doubt always in favour of the applicant for a pension. It should be laid down by the Minister for the guidance of the Referee that that is the way this House and the Government and the people would wish these Acts to be administered.  In England, too, they have a person who is known in a general way as &ldquo;the soldier's friend&rdquo;.  He is a person who makes a study of all these Pensions Acts, who understands them and understands how and in what way an applicant can benefit by the proper presentation of his case.</P>
    <P>We ought to have here some person of that kind who would be experienced in these Acts and in their administration, who would be an adviser to every applicant and who would appear with him if he was so required to present the applicant's case in the best possible way to the Referee.  It is our experience that the better a soldier was in the old days the less likely he is to pat himself on the back now.  In investigating claims one finds hesitancy and shyness on the part of the applicant to put his case in the best way in his own interest and as a result of that many people have been treated unfairly.  By the assistance of the sort of friend I mentioned we could and everybody else could be satisfied that an applicant's case was put in the very best way to the Pensions Board, and that he would not lose his right to a pension simply because his case was badly presented.</P>
    <P>The old pensions code is a very difficult code to understand.  I do not know how many people outside of those who are actually engaged in the investigations under the Acts understand the Acts.  They are involved Acts from the way they came in&mdash;Acts, amendments, amendments, new Acts, new amendments.  Perhaps, even at this stage it might be desirable if the Minister were to establish some sort of committee to examine all these Acts and see if they could not be simplified <Col N="1563" /> and made much easier to understand. What is really required is some committee to rationalise all these Pensions Acts and pensions legislation.  I would recommend that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one final matter that I want to touch on.  It was dealt with, in fact, very fully yesterday evening by Deputy Major Vivion de Valera&mdash;that is, the question of members of the Air Corps who lose their life on active duty.  I would support Deputy Major de Valera in the strong case he made to the Minister for an examination of the position in regard to the Air Corps and in regard also to those officers and soldiers who are engaged in specially dangerous duties.</P>
    <P>The whole country has been shocked by the revelations that have been made by different local authorities who have taken up what is well known now as the Captain Ryan case.  As Deputies know, Captain Ryan was an officer of 36 years of age when he was killed on flying duty over a year ago.  He was the third member of his family to give his life in the military service of the State.  He left a widow and six young children and, under the Army Pensions Act, his widow is entitled to £90 a year and each of his children is entitled to £16 a year.  The total pension that that family receives is £186 a year.</P>
    <P>Obviously, that pension is entirely and grossly inadequate.  No person in this country could seek to justify such a miserable pension for a family of seven persons.  It is a wonderful tribute to that officer's widow that she is managing as she is to maintain herself and those six children on that miserable allowance.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that if, instead of being an Army officer, Captain Ryan had been a civil servant who was killed while flying in the course of his duty, his widow and children would receive something less than £600&mdash;£581 a year.  But, because Captain Ryan was an Army officer, killed in the course of his duty, his widow and six children are entitled only to £186 a year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that it is intended to change that position at an <Col N="1564" /> early date.  I want to put it to the Minister that it is no use making some small increases in a case such as this. Adequate provision must be made so that the widow and the children will be enabled to live in ordinary, reasonable conditions of comfort.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear to the Department of Finance that the amendment that is proposed to regulations must be a substantial amendment and must cover in retrospect the particular case of Captain Ryan's widow and the widows of other officers and soldiers who lost their lives in somewhat similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera dealt last night with the case that is made on behalf of the Department of Defence that, because an officer receives flying pay of 5/- a day, he ought to make provision by way of insurance for his wife and children.  That, of course, is not correct, as Deputy Major de Valera very clearly established, because the premiums that would be charged to cover the death of an Army officer belonging to the Air Corps, on duty, would be too high.  Deputy Major de Valera dealt exhaustively with that particular point and there is no necessity for me to repeat it.</P>
    <P>I would make the appeal which he made and which I am sure other Deputies will make, to the Minister, to be generous and fair in dealing with this particular case.  We hope and trust that the provision made in this case will be a headline in fair, generous and just treatment for the dependents and relatives of Army personnel who lose their lives in the service of the State.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by making the broad general appeal to the Minister to announce as early as he possibly can the decision of the Government to remove the grievances of which members of the Old I.R.A. complain and to bring all those pensions that were authorised in 1923 up to date so that they will reasonably help the recipients to meet the increase in the cost of living that has taken place since 1923.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way the discussion on this pensions Estimate should not take any time.  I hope and trust that, as a result of the removal of the <Col N="1565" /> anomalies and grievances that have been referred to in this debate, it will be possible to dispose of future Estimates in a very short time.  It depends now entirely on the Minister and the Government.  In making the improvements sought they will be acting in accordance with the wishes of this House and in accordance with the wishes of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the appeal that has been made to the Minister in connection with a variety of matters under Army pensions legislation.  First of all, the members of the Defence Forces who have retired or who are about to retire have a grievance in regard to the delay in announcing their rate of retirement pensions. Officers, N.C.O.s and men have retired and they are not yet aware of the rate of retirement pension.  That imposes a disability on them from two angles.  A number of Army personnel who are about to retire inquire into the possibility of securing civilian employment and the type of position which they seek is to a considerable extent governed by the amount of the retirement pension.</P>
      <P>If a man is due for retirement, and knows his pension will be at a particular rate, he may seek a position at a certain wage or salary but if he is due for retirement at a low rate of pension and has dependents it will be necessary for him to seek a position which will enable him to earn a higher remuneration.  Consequently I think that there is no justification whatever for the excessive delay in dealing with this matter.  I need not reiterate the case that has been put before the Minister or the arguments that have been used.  It is sufficient to say that in the case of civil servants and other public servants, they are in a position to know for some time prior to retirement what the rate of pension will be on the basis of a known period of service. In the case of Army personnel, there has been this delay which has existed now for quite a considerable period and Deputies from all sides have been approached to urge that a decision would be arrived at without any further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies have over the <Col N="1566" /> years made representations concerning the ending of the abatement of military service pensions in respect to Old I.R.A. personnel.  Whatever justification there may have been for such an abatement in the initial stages, I think that, having regard to the increase in the cost of living since the pensions were first granted, a strong case can now be made for the discontinuance of this abatement.  It is doubtful indeed if there was ever any justification for it.  The pensions were awarded in respect of service given at a particular time.  Comparisons are sometimes made between two individuals serving in a particular position, one of whom is in receipt of a military service pension from the home Government, and another who has a pension from the British Government for service in the British forces or in some department of the British services.</P>
    <P>The British pensioner is allowed to retain the full amount of his salary and emoluments without abatement while the person in receipt of an Irish military service pension is subject to abatement.  Seeing that the pensions were awarded for services rendered in a particular capacity, I think the pension should be paid in full without any abatement.  The amount involved is comparatively small.  Although it is not possible to estimate accurately what the figure is, it is obvious that it must be in the region of £30,000 or £40,000.  The loss entailed to the Exchequer, if pensions were paid without abatement, would be trivial in comparison to the relative loss which abatement involves for the individuals concerned and the satisfaction which full payment would afford them.  The fact that these payments are abated is in itself an irritation to the recipient.</P>
    <P>The case that is being made on behalf of officers and men who receive injuries or who are killed in the course of duty, particularly the case of the late Captain Ryan referred to by Deputy Cowan, is one which must appeal to the sympathy of the Minister and his advisers.  The rates of pension fixed for Air Corps personnel bear no relation whatever to present living conditions.  Nobody can contend for a moment that the present rate of <Col N="1567" /> pension in any way meets the cost of living or the responsibilities of the widows and families of personnel killed on service.  The suggestion has been made that because an increase of pay, known as flying pay, is paid to personnel of the Air Corps, that should in some way enable an officer or a member of the rank and file to insure while on service.  Deputies are aware that the insurance premiums for civilian flying personnel are extremely high&mdash;so high that it has been a problem for flying companies as well as the personnel concerned.  The premiums demanded for members of the Air Corps or members of any active service unit in any army are still higher, because the risks involved are much greater.  To suggest that these persons could insure by utilising the amount of flying pay, which is paid as part compensation for the risks involved, is to refuse to face up to the realities of the situation.  Not merely should personnel of the Air Corps or widows and families of deceased personnel of the Air Corps receive these pensions but dependents of officers and men in the Army who are killed in the course of duty should receive proper and fair treatment from the State.</P>
    <P>Our Army may be different from other armies with which comparisons are likely to be made at the moment. Units of the British Army from time to time are on active service.  At present, and for quite a considerable time now, no section of our Army has been on active service, but members of the flying corps and officers and men engaged in operations such as those which were proceeding when the explosion took place in Glen Imaal, are involved in very risky operations, operations comparable to active service, operations which sometimes result in the same degree of suffering and hardship to dependents of these personnel as active service operations. The Minister and the Government should seriously consider this matter. While I appreciate that the Minister has promised amending legislation, the delay involved, particularly as the amount involved is not considerable, cannot be justified.  The matter has <Col N="1568" /> been under consideration for a considerable time and a decision should be reached.</P>
    <P>The fact that a circular has been issued to Deputies, certainly Deputies who served in the Defence Forces, calling attention to the plight of the widow and children of the late Captain Ryan has focussed public attention on the matter.  It is particularly tragic that the family concerned suffered an earlier bereavement arising out of service to the State.  There is general agreement not only in this House but outside the House, that immediate action should be taken to remedy the serious disabilities under which dependents of army personnel killed or seriously injured while on duty are at present labouring.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the fact that there is dissatisfaction as to the manner in which the Referee in the Military Service Board is hearing appeals.  I urge the Minister to consider the position which has arisen. I have no doubt that the Referee, in common with other Referees, is anxious to carry out his duties impartially and in a fair manner, but a number of individuals who made applications for pensions under the earlier Acts and who were turned down, feel that when they make a fresh application and it is heard by the same Referee in some way or other they are not getting a fair hearing.  It is true that the legislation has been altered and that the Referee is bound to take into account matters which he was not entitled to consider under the earlier legislation.  But it is impossible to convince an applicant who presented his case under the earlier legislation and had it considered and rejected and who represents his case and has it considered and rejected that he is getting a fair hearing.  He feels a sense of grievance no matter how fairly or fully his case is considered.</P>
    <P>I know of cases where applicants have had additional evidence, and certainly in one case the additional evidence was not called for.  In these circumstances the applicant had a definite grievance and the Minister should favourably consider having a different Referee for appeals from the Referee who heard the original case. <Col N="1569" /> I have no doubt that everyone will agree that a person considering an appeal from an earlier decision made by himself is bound to be influenced by the factors which operated in his mind in arriving at the earlier decision, no matter how legislation may be framed. These matters are bound to affect the operation of the individual's mind in arriving at a decision, and whether they do or not, most applicants feel they are not getting a proper hearing when they see the same Referee hearing the case.  I, therefore, urge that the Minister should consider the suggestions made to provide a different Referee for appeal cases from the Referee hearing the original applications.</P>
    <P>The Minister has heard from all sides of the House appeals to give an early indication of the Government's decision on military service pensions. Deputies on all sides agree that there should be an early decision in this matter.  The amount involved in relation to the total expenditure for military service pensions or the total expenditure on the Army is comparatively small, but the suffering imposed by the delay in arriving at a decision is great for the individuals concerned. The House would welcome and readily assent to any proposals introduced to remedy these grievances.  The grievances are confined to a small section of the community who rendered distinguished and valuable service in particularly difficult times, and who are entitled to recognition in the only way in which the State can afford adequate recognition for the service rendered. The Minister should, therefore, consider this as a matter of urgency and should request the Government as a matter of urgency to introduce whatever legislation is necessary to remedy the various grievances in respect of Old I.R.A. pensioners and officers and men of the Army who have retired, with particular attention to the cases of personnel killed or injured while on duty and to the other matters in connection with the administration of the Military Service Pensions Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admitted that every class of pensioner and, in fact, almost every class of person in the <Col N="1570" /> country have got increases in pensions or pay during the last four years except the Old I.R.A. pensioners.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for Finance admitted that a few days ago. I am anxious to deal with the people who are drawing what is known as special allowances, people incapable of self-support and who have no means of subsistence.  When in 1946 the Government had an Act passed giving pensions to those people a considerable amount of happiness was brought to many people because it gave them some hope for the future.  Certain classes of men who had rendered good service to the country and who had not qualified for either a service pension or a disability pension, found when they were no longer able to support themselves that the Government were prepared to help them to do so.  At that time individuals were awarded a special allowance at the rate of £77 10s. per annum, with £20 for a wife and £10 or £12 for each child.  That was a pretty reasonable amount in 1946, but I am sure that nobody will agree that it is sufficient with the present cost of living.  Appeals were made during the previous Government's régime to increase this. Appeals are being made to the present Government.  Nothing has happened but in view of the statement made by the Minister for Finance the other day I believe we have good grounds for hope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply, if one can call it a reply, given by the Minister on this amendment is very unsatisfactory. The Minister stated that this was originally introduced by a Minister here who was a member of the Labour Party.  There is no use in the Minister trying to throw that across my path in relation to this amendment, because when a Labour Minister did introduce <Col N="1571" /> this originally there was some protection for the local authority.  I am not dealing now with the case of the aggrieved person <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present occupant of the post of Minister for Local Government.  I am looking to the future.  We none of us know who will be the Minister for Local Government called upon to decide this issue at some time in the future.  In dealing with legislation we must always bear in mind the fact that we do not know what attitude a particular Minister may take at a particular time.  I think that is a fundamental point to be considered in relation to this amendment.  It is certainly a point worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>When this was first introduced some years ago the local authority had some say at least in the matter.  Now the overriding decision is in the hands of the Minister for Local Government in the case of an aggrieved person appealing against the decision of the local authority.  It is quite contradictory for us to stipulate for more progressive local government on the one hand and, at the same time, insert a clause in a Bill whereunder the unanimous decision of a local authority can be completely nullified by a decision of the Minister.  If we reach that stage in local government, then all local government will be on the broad highway leading to destruction because it will no longer be possible to have the views expressed collectively by a local authority and its executive officers properly considered by the central authority.  That is the difficulty under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given no indication of what he considers to be a fair rent. If a local authority is not satisfied in the case of a first application for this rent, which, after all, over ten years represents £400 to a local authority and if the Minister is not prepared to consider that difficulty in assessing what we regard as a fair rent, what is there to prevent these new-found landlords from charging a rent of £4 per week? At the present time they are charging rents ranging from £3 2s. 6d. to £3 10s. 0d. per week and who will decide ultimately in the case of new <Col N="1572" /> houses where the demand outstrips the supply if these landlords find it convenient to charge up to £4 per week? Is there any protection afforded under this measure to the prospective tenants of such houses?  Is there any means by which rents can be limited?</P>
    <P>I was amazed by the way in which the Minister acted in relation to this amendment.  We have tried to meet this measure by offering criticism of a constructive nature.  Yet the Minister gets up and ignores every point raised and refuses to touch on the possibility of the disability which will be imposed on incoming tenants as regards the rate that must be paid because the landlord can escape the responsibility of paying rates.  That burden will be placed then on the shoulders of the incoming tenant.  Yet the Minister does not consider it worth his while to suggest any possible remedy in that respect.  It seems a waste of time to discuss this at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken unto himself the right to ride roughshod over decisions.  He has the machine behind him.  He has the voting strength behind him.  Nevertheless we shall continue to expose what we believe to be blatant difficulties and disabilities imposed on tenants in rural areas or those living in proximity to cities or towns.  If the Minister wishes to continue on that road, let him do so.  He can take that onus on himself.  He is so important in his own estimation that he can refuse to listen to any form of constructive criticism.  He demonstrated that attitude last night and again to-day.  Eventually he will find, irrespective of which side of the House he happens to be on, that time will prove all that has been said here and the justification for some of the amendments that have been refused by him will be abundantly demonstrated. We will be justified in asking for this protection for incoming tenants, a protection that the Minister has blatantly refused to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was fairly fully gone into by me on the Second Reading debate on this measure.  I intervened briefly before the adjournment to set out the facts as I saw them and with which I was trying to deal. <Col N="1573" /> The 1948 Act, which contains Section 19, was passed through this House and, after becoming law, was administered by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy T. J. Murphy.  The section itself did not give the Minister the right to adjudicate in the event of an appeal.  It was thought then that the Minister had power to make regulations which would give him that right.  The then Minister, I stated briefly, appealed to all the different semi-State and commercial concerns in this country&mdash;banking institutions, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo.&mdash;to take advantage of this section.</P>
      <P>At that time the Minister who was charged with the responsibility of administering that section thought that he had the power to do what I am making clear I have the power to do. It was only when these regulations were made and when they were being applied that certain legal advice was secured by the Cork County Council to the effect that the Minister had no such power.  We do not know whether or not that was correct from a legal point of view, but anyhow it raised a doubt sufficiently strong to warrant the course of action I am taking here.  All my predecessors thought they had the power I am seeking.  It is not, therefore, a question, as Deputy Desmond says, of seeking power to ride roughshod over local bodies in this matter.  It is a question of clarifying the position and of making certain of that which they, in their time, thought was certain.  In addition, when the amount of the grant in each case is finally determined the State recoups the local body concerned by two-thirds.  Surely in these circumstances, and with the assurances and guarantees which are held out to the concerns affected, it is the duty of this Parliament to see to it that no successful attempt will be made by a local body to avoid meeting its fair and just responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision and there was provision for making appeals to the Minister.  A number of appeals have come before me and a number of appeals came before my predecessor. The rents that were being charged <Col N="1574" /> were being examined from the point of view of whether or not they were fair and just.  In all cases, both in my predecessor's time and in my time, it was found that the rents being charged would not, even after making allowance for the grant, recoup the individuals and the concerns who erected the houses.  Deputy Desmond suggests that there was no objection to giving those people a fair return.  Deputy Desmond, and people on local bodies who adopt the attitude which Deputy Desmond has taken in this House to-day, make sure not to say what they regard as a fair return.</P>

      <P>If you regard the amounts which you fixed as a fair appreciation of the responsibilities that had to be met on foot of legislation passed in this House then that is enough for me and it is enough for any fair-minded person who wants to approach this question in the manner in which I feel it should be approached. I am not trying to convince Deputy Desmond of anything because I realise that he wants to play his hand when he goes down to his local body.  He is free to play whatever hand he likes and to take whatever kudos he can get from it.  He is free to say that the Minister saw to it that a section was inserted in this Bill that enabled him &mdash;as Deputy Desmond will describe it beautifully&mdash;to ride roughshod over local authorities.  We shall not hear Deputy Desmond say one word to the effect that after I have done what my predecessor thought he had the right to do and attempted to do and was prevented from doing&mdash;after I have ensured that the persons who have erected these houses will get what the State guaranteed they would get&mdash;the State will refund two-thirds of the entire amount to the local body concerned.</P>

I saw through houses that were let to bank officials and towards which the State had made, <Col N="1575" /> through the Transition Development Fund and otherwise, a fund contribution. I have not, in any detailed fashion, gone into how that contribution would compare with what was aimed at in Section 19 of the 1948 Act. I should have no hesitation in saying, however, that if we were able to secure that houses would be built for these classes of persons by these concerns it would result in a very substantial saving both to the ratepayers and to the taxpayers.  My only regret is that unfortunately this section was not taken advantage of by the persons and by the business concerns for whom it was intended.  Perhaps one of the main reasons why advantage has not been taken of it&mdash;to the advantage of everybody&mdash;is the attitude that local bodies have taken up, for example, the attitude taken up by the Cork County Council in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deny Deputy Desmond all the freedom he desires to go down the country and distort my action in respect of the insertion of this section in the Bill.  When all comes to all, and when this whole effort is stripped to its bare nakedness, this section merely sets out to make quite sure that I have the power to do what my predecessors thought they had the legal right to do and would have done in exactly the same way as I will, so long as that responsibility is mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some clarification both as to the effect of Section 19 and as to this amendment. Section 19 of the 1948 Act sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A housing authority shall, subject to regulations made under this section, make to any person erecting one or more than one house in the functional area of the authority, a grant not exceeding the appropriate sum....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the position, the Minister's case which he has just made is that the housing authority should make a grant of the amount specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Act of 1948.  I would like to be quite clear as to whether that is the view put forward by the Minister.  The Fourth <Col N="1576" /> Schedule to the 1948 Act specified that for a three-roomed house the grant would be £25 per year; in the case of a four-roomed house £35 per year, and in the case of a house with five rooms or more £40 per year.  The amendment deals purely with the rent to be charged for the house but I would like to know whether I am misinterpreting the Minister when I say that I understand that he believed that the grant should be the amount specified in the Fourth Schedule.</P>
    <P>If I am misinterpreting him in that respect could he explain the circumstances in which the grant should not be provided in the Fourth Schedule, because quite frankly it is on that that my opinion regarding the amendment would largely be based?  I took the view on Sections 9 and 10 that every house put up by anybody would help to solve the housing problem.  Although the Minister attacked me fiercely on that attitude on Sections 9 and 10 I think that it was the same case as the Minister is making now in different words.  In other words, the case which I was making and which the Minister was dead against is now made by him, and I suggest that Deputy Desmond is taking the line that the Minister took on previous occasions.  It is not altogether logical unless there is something in Section 19 of the 1948 Act which I find difficult to understand from the Minister's remarks a few moments ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the full amounts set out in the Schedule must of necessity be paid, but where a case comes before the Minister on appeal regard would be had to the size and cost of the house and the rent it is proposed to charge for it.  He would also consider the amount of grant proposed by the local body.  Even if it were less than the maximum so long as it appeared to the Minister to be reasonable having regard to the other factors he would allow the grant to go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 of the 1948 Act and Section 16 of this Bill were incorporated for the purpose of helping co-operative societies or private firms to build houses for their employees.  They are admirable sections, <Col N="1577" /> because they remove the onus from the local authority to provide houses for people for whom they would otherwise have to provide them.  As a member of a housing authority and the only member who supported an application from a co-operative society for the maximum grant under the section, I believe that the Minister should allow local authorities more discretion than it appears he is going to allow them.  In my judgment, the Minister is taking dictatorial powers and the local authority will have no discretion whatsoever.  The opinion of local members&mdash;and the majority opinion at that&mdash;is that where the local authority must find the money to pay those grants they are entitled to have some say as to the type of person who will be eligible for them.  Their big difficulty and obstacle is that, so far as the fixing of rents is concerned, they have no power whatsoever.  The opinion of many local authority members is that co-operative societies and private firms would build houses only for their senior staffs and higher-paid employees.  In other words, their employees who would be able to pay a good rent.  In the case of one or two companies which have availed of these grants in County Cork, that is quite true.  The employees for whom they provided houses are those in the higher income groups who could reasonably provide houses for themselves, and then a rent was charged, which, to say the least of it, was more than an economic rent.  Local authorities cannot see why they should be obliged to hand over the ratepayers' money, which, as we all know, is very limited at the present time, to those companies to build houses for employees in the higher income groups who could reasonably be expected to build houses for themselves.  While I do not agree with all Deputy Desmond said with regard to the section, I think the amendment is reasonable.  The position that a firm can build houses for its employees and get an economic rent or more, if possible, and can get into the bargain a present of £40 a year from the ratepayers is a position which should not be allowed to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little use in my suggesting <Col N="1578" /> to the Minister that he should leave local authorities any say on such matters because I know that he and the Government of which he is a member are entirely against local authorities having any discretion in any matter whatsoever.  In fact, they are going so far that the day will shortly come when they will abolish local authorities completely and, as they have taken almost all their power from them, it would be a great saving of public funds if they did abolish them altogether.  In all those matters the responsibility is the county manager's, but the day must soon come when the Minister learns the lesson that there are members of local authorities just as capable of administering local affairs and with just as much interest in the welfare of the people whom they represent as the Minister himself or any county manager in the country.  Conditions in Cork may be different from conditions in Donegal, Mayo or other counties and discretion should be allowed to the local authority to decide whether an applicant is entitled to a grant or not.  There is no doubt in the world that the amendment proposed by Deputy Desmond should be acceptable to the Minister.  It will not interfere with his powers to any great extent but it will be a safeguard against employers or business concerns building houses for their well-paid employees, letting them at a more than economic rent and, into the bargain, getting from the pockets of the ratepayers £40 per year, less the two-thirds subsidy if they did not avail of the grant from the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to consider the suggestions just made by Deputy Murphy. He is very much in error when he says that £40 a year would be taken from the ratepayers and given to such industries or undertakings as would avail of the section.  I think that the Minister should go out of his way to encourage industrial concerns and such to avail of the opportunity given under this section.  I suggest to Deputy Murphy that he calmly consider the position and that he digest in particular the reference to the £400.  That £400 will be payable over ten years <Col N="1579" /> at £40 per year.  According to my mathematics, we are getting a return of two-thirds from the Department, which is £26 13s. 4d. a year, and rates will provide £13 6s. 8d.  These houses&mdash; what are called the better-class houses &mdash;will very seldom come under a valuation of £10 or £12 a year, and we must take into consideration the fact that such houses will come into immediate valuation, and must contribute from the day they are finished.  I know of no town, and in particular a town where there are any industries, in which the rates are under £1 in the £. Consequently, we stand to gain, and at the expiration of seven years such property will come into full valuation, so that it would be false economy to discourage such people from availing of the opportunity of providing houses. If industries do not avail of the opportunity, the responsibility falls upon the local authority at much heavier cost, and, if not upon the local authority, these people will be obliged to avail of the Small Dwellings Act, and there again it will be heavier in the long run on the national Exchequer.  For these reasons, I appeal to the Minister not to delete this section, but to go out of his way to encourage and induce industries and institutions to provide houses for their employees under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Walsh has said, I did not mention the position of industrialists as industrialists at all.  I did not mention any State body or board.  I believe that if an industrialist or State corporation, such as Bord na Móna or any other such body, builds houses, it is prepared to rent them to prospective tenants at an economic rent.  I am quite prepared to admit that, but the dangers which faced us were not in respect of concerns of that nature but individual people who built to suit themselves.  These people built houses at a cost, roughly, of £1,700, and there were cases in which we asked to be furnished with the rent charged.  For houses built for £1,700, some of these private individuals were charging rents of £160 a year.  In ten years, that amounts to £1,600, and in 11 years these landlords had the full cost of the <Col N="1580" /> house back in rent.  After 11 years, they were free, because we are surely entitled to assume that such a house would not be in urgent need of repair for a period of 25 years, which is a fairly normal period.  If, after 11 years, these people had been recouped in full through the rent charged, surely no Minister can say that £160 a year afterwards, coupled with a grant of £400, is not an exorbitant profit?  In fairness to some of the concerns the Minister mentioned, I believe they would not set out to reap such profits, but I am objecting to giving such a profit to a private individual.  No one can say that if a man has been repaid the cost of building in 11 years and if afterwards he gets £160 a year, plus £40 a year grant for ten years, it is not an exorbitant profit.</P>
      <P>The Minister apparently held the view that I would go down the country seeking political kudos.  Let me remind the Minister that in South Cork, the area which I try to the best of my ability to represent, there is not one such case.  I will gain no political kudos from this.  We have not had one application from such people as these in South Cork.  They are in the Cork County Council area, but it is the Deputies of the Minister's Party who are involved in these areas.  I am not, and I will not gain one iota by all this. Still, even though these districts are not in my area for Dáil purposes, I believe that my responsibilities must take me further afield than merely my own small part of the county.  Let the Minister understand that when the late Minister, Mr. T.J. Murphy, brought his Housing Bill in, he, as Minister, did not try to steamroll me.  I adopted the same attitude at meetings of the Cork County Council after the 1950 Bill was passed as I am adopting now.  I had a free hand as I am using that free hand now, not for my own individual sake but for the sake of the people who, in the ultimate, will have to pay the piper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made a case which cannot be argued against when he says that the central body is providing two-thirds of the funds and is, therefore, entitled to have an overriding discretion, provided <Col N="1581" /> that discretion is used in a reasonable way.  If it is not so used, there are half-hours provided at night here when we will have an opportunity of bringing the Minister in to deal with it.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this is an unusual way of framing a section giving a right of appeal.  In the 1948 Act, Section 7 (2) provides that any person may appeal and so on, but this is rather an unusual phraseology here, quite apart from the retrospective provision in it. I should like the Minister to consider between now and Report Stage whether there was any reason for abandoning the usual formula for an appeal and providing the rather unusual wording which is contained in Section 7.</P>
      <P>I want to say further that the Minister was quite right when he said it was a great pity that Section 19 of the 1948 Act was not more widely availed of.  There must be a case, I think, for saying that one of the ways in which that section would be availed of more widely would be by making the grant a fixed sum in the Fourth Schedule instead of leaving it a maximum sum.  If the grant were a fixed sum and if a person knew that he would receive such fixed sum if he complied with the regulations in a a proper and reasonable way, such knowledge might prove to be an inducement to him to apply for the grant.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the section.  In my opinion, the Minister has taken too much power.  The Minister mentions that Deputy Desmond feels he may ride roughshod over the local authorities.  I will omit the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and I will put it that the Minister has ridden roughshod over the local authorities.  I understand that, in a case where a dispute arose between the person who was seeking the grant and the local authorities, the local authority had power to appeal to the Minister.  I know of certain <Col N="1582" /> cases where people who built houses applied for a grant to the local authority.  They got a notification about the grant and, instead of raising the matter with the local authority again, they went right over their heads and approached the Minister.  Likewise, instead of the Minister writing to the local authority and saying: &ldquo;I feel that the local authority, in view of certain circumstances, should have allowed a greater grant to this person who is building his house, or to this company&rdquo;, the Minister sent down word to the local authority to give the full grant every time.</P>
      <P>I am acquainted with a case in which a bank applied to the local authority for a grant to build houses for letting purposes.  I proposed at the time that they should get a grant of £20 per year, £200 in all.  However, the members of the Minister's own Party in the county council proposed that instead of giving this company a grant of £20 per year, or £200 altogether, they should be given a grant of £4 a year.  I was opposed to that idea, but all the same I eventually agreed to it due to the fact that the majority of the members were in favour of it.  The Minister did not even acquaint us of the reason for his decision.  This showed very little regard for the members of that particular local authority who had assembled to do their work to the best of their ability.  The local authority felt it was hard lines if they had to raise a loan at 4 per cent. or at 5 per cent. and give it to a bank which was only paying interest at the rate of 1 per cent. on their depositors' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You would be getting a recoupment of two-thirds of the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that point.  The position was that most of the members of the county council did not understand they would be recouped to the extent of two-thirds. If the Minister had the courtesy to treat the members of the local authority properly, he would have written and said: &ldquo;Go ahead.  You will be getting two-thirds of the money back.  I feel it would be a good idea to encourage the bank to build houses for their employees.  If they do so, <Col N="1583" /> there will be other houses vacant for somebody else.&rdquo;  I feel that such a suggestion would have been very good, but it was not forthcoming from the Minister.  Instead, apparently, some of the officials said: &ldquo;Here is a case in Kilkenny.  Give them the full grant.&rdquo; In my opinion, if the Minister had used a little discretion and courtesy it would have been much better.  The members of this particular local authority and the members of the Minister's own Party in particular, felt that they should not be expected to raise money in one bank and pay 4½ per cent. and 5 per cent. interest on it, for the purpose of lending it to another bank which was only paying 1 per cent. on the depositors' money.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to withdraw my opposition to this section if the Minister assures me and the House that, in future, where he thinks there is a case for a greater grant he will write to the local authority pointing out his reason for so thinking.  In any case where the Minister believes the local authority are not reasonable in the grants they allow, he should be prepared to give his reason for thinking the grant should be increased.</P>

    <P>Deputies will realise that it is not an easy matter to get an amendment <Col N="1587" /> that will be all-embracing without going far enough or going too far.  I tried to give the House an idea of the type of case I wanted to cover.  My attention was drawn to the fact that the Bill, as drafted, contained this weakness.  I happened to be in the country and met a county manager who saw at once that this section, as proposed, would inflict hardship.  I thereupon, without any consultation at all, and not knowing what difficulties the draftsman might have in putting into legal phraseology what was in my mind, said: &ldquo;Here is what is in my mind.&rdquo;  I set out for him the type of case I thought should be covered.  He said that would meet the situation entirely, but when I came to the House I found that all sorts of problems arose.  We then got a draft of what was thought to be sufficient to meet all the cases that were mentioned here and mentioned by any other sources.  Even then, I was doubtful as to whether that would suffice.  I would prefer to avoid the provision in relation to the appeal to the Minister if I could, but no matter how wide an amendment of this nature is you will find very often that some cases of hardship will arise here and there. These cases are reported and the Minister has to say in this House or outside: &ldquo;I am just precluded from doing so, although I admit there is a case to be covered.&rdquo;  That is why I am providing here for an appeal in the event of any case arising that would not be covered already.  I think there are several other amendments, but I think this amendment of mine fairly meets all the cases that could possibly arise and which would demand a sympathetic approach and consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not meet every case.  There are a few amendments of mine.  The Minister, however, has made a very substantial effort to meet the cases that were put up to him on the earlier stage of the Bill.  Schemes adopted by local authorities contained, in our case, a provision that the house had to be completed before the 31st March, 1952.  We put that in because the 1950 Act expired <Col N="1588" /> on the 31st March, 1952.  We were bound to put it in.  While we put that in, it was quite clear that it was the view of every section of the county council that they would extend the period when they were empowered by law to do so.  I take it that the Minister's amendment will provide that, so long as the house has been commenced and was put up in accordance with the scheme, the fact that it was not finished by the 31st March, 1952, will not count even though that date was in the county council's scheme?</P>

    <P>To warrant registration as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school three conditions are necessary:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) that the school be situated in a district where Irish is generally spoken as the language of the home; (2) that a considerable proportion of the children coming to school for the first time know Irish only or know Irish better than English; (3) that the teachers are competent to give instruction entirely through the medium of Irish, and that instruction in the various subjects of the school programme (other than English) is so given.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether this school fulfilled the necessary conditions has been under review from time to time, and it was found as a result of these reviews that the circumstances did not warrant the registration of Derryloughan National School as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school.</P>

I would <Col N="1597" /> ask him&mdash;and I would ask the House&mdash; to support me in this, to recommend that the children of tenants who have been in the houses since the 1914-18 war should not be evicted now and that they should get the benefit of the legislation that is going through West-minister. I hope they will be allowed to remain as a result of the Minister's recommendation.</P>

      <P>This Bill in question proposes to implement an agreement made in 1951.  Anything not provided in that agreement will not be covered by the Bill.  The Deputy will agree that there is no point in having an agreement as between two Governments unless its provisions are given effect to.  Any recommendation that I would make in regard to this matter could have no bearing at all upon the proposals that are necessary to implement the agreement to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>In so far as the exserviceman or his widow buys one of these cottages, I take it that for the future the family will be protected inasmuch as the father or the mother will have the right to convey the property to a son or daughter, as the case may be.  The only people, therefore, who stand in danger of being evicted are those against whom court orders have recently been got or may be got before the houses are actually purchased, and that will, I take it, be a small number. I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in this matter, but there cannot be many people involved.  Would the Minister consider sympathetically the question of asking the Trust to deal sympathetically with the sons or daughters of ex-servicemen who occupy these houses with a view to leaving them in possession of the houses, even as tenants, if it is not possible under the new legislation to permit them to purchase the houses in which their father or mother, now deceased, resided?</P>

      <P>The Trust will immediately reply to all these requests that they are bound to take whatever action the law prescribes.  I am not in a position to say what the agreement that was reached in 1951 between the <Col N="1598" /> two Governments provided for.  I read the agreement, but naturally I could not say right off just what is provided for in that agreement.  All I am saying in reply to the question addressed to me by Deputy Byrne is that the proposals for legislation before the British House of Commons are proposals that are designed to implement the agreement that was reached between the two Governments.  These proposals will do that, and will do no more.  No intervention, no request, of mine would have the least effect.  It could not be expected that it would have the least effect in altering these proposals in any shape or form.</P>

      <P>Arising from the supplementary questions and the Minister's answer thereto, are we to take it that there is an agreement now between the two Governments which will put these houses over and above the ordinary Landlord and Tenant Act in the country?  Is the Minister aware that, in all local authorities, the practice has been well established that, where tenants die, their children are regarded as the tenants in succession. If this is to be taken as a headline, that, where the original tenant dies, we are to evict the children because they have no rights, it is a matter that would have to be seriously considered again in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the Deputy has in mind, but what I have in mind is that discussions took place between the representatives of the two Governments with a view to arriving at an arrangement by which these Trust houses could be sold to the tenants.  I take it that the very best possible case was made for the very best arrangement, that is, as far as our people were concerned.  Finally, an agreement was made.  The agreement provided for certain things and to the extent that it did not cover the children of tenants, to which this question refers, I suppose it was disappointing from our point of view. However, the agreement is there.  The agreement was announced in May, 1951, and it was necessary to introduce proposals for legislation in the British Parliament.  The proposals that are <Col N="1599" /> before the British Parliament, I understand, cover the full and complete terms of that agreement, and that is all I can say or do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) where the grant is in respect of the erection of a house, a contract for the purchase of a site for such erection was completed before that date.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 22 the Minister has covered a great many cases, and I must pay a tribute to the fact that he did make an effort to meet them.  Amendment No. 22a, however, is in respect of a further type of case of which I have some personal knowledge.  I know of three cases in County Kildare where people bought sites in the belief that they would be able to get grants from the Kildare County Council under the 1950 Act.  So far as I am aware, they are people who will be round about the limits in the section.  I am not sufficiently acquainted with their exact means to know whether the three people would or would not come within Section 9 or Section 10.  What I am trying to get at in this amendment and the next one is where a person had taken an irrecoverable step in the genuine and <i>bona fide</i> belief that the Kildare County Council would carry out what it was known they wished to carry out, namely, to give grants under that scheme, and had bought and paid for a site that he would not be put in an unfair and unfortunate position as a result of what we may do in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, on Second Reading, made it clear that he would not throw the door open wide to everybody who <Col N="1605" /> of view.  But here is a case where there was a specific step taken.  The Minister is probably aware or, if he is not aware, he can ask his colleague, the Minister for Justice, that there is put in an application.  If you accept the earlier sections, I can see his point a delay of about four months in the registration of title in the Land Registry for a new folio such as would be required for a site of this kind.  In one of the cases I have in mind the purchase was completed last February and application had been duly made to the county council.  The registration, although it was lodged last February, was only completed by the Land Registry in the beginning of the month of May.  Until the registration is completed, the purchaser of the site who is going to erect a house would not be able to get a loan under the Small Dwellings Act.  That person did not think it would be wise to start building until the Small Dwellings Act title had been proved, because, otherwise, he would be in the position of having his house put up and the builder looking for the first instalment and, because of the Land Registry's delay, would not be able to get the instalment from the county council under the Small Dwellings Act.  Accordingly, he deemed it prudent not to start the house until the Land Registry had completed registration of the title. That seems very bad luck for him.</P>
    <P>In the second case, a man paid £75 for a site.  He took all the steps that were proper and reasonable for a prudent man to take.  Now, because of the provisions of this Bill he will not be able to deal with this matter as he genuinely and <i>bona fide</i> believed he could.  He cannot hand back the site to the persons from whom he bought it.  It has been taken out of the title of the vendor and it has gone into the name of the purchaser.  Unless he is protected in some way the position will be that he will have paid his £75 for a couple of roods of land that will be of no use to him.  I do not think the Minister intended that to operate in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see them, the <Col N="1606" /> Deputy's amendments were designed to throw this matter wide open.  In other words, they were designed to permit of a free-for-all scheme under Section 7 of the 1950 Act to run almost parallel with the schemes outlined in the measure which is now under discussion.  I do not think there is any use in our arguing about this matter.  I can quite see that some type of border-line case must exist, even if we were to reduce it to the point that a man had an idea in his mind to do something under a scheme that might operate in Kildare and which was drafted under Section 7 of the 1950 Act.  If that man did nothing more than say to himself that it was his intention to build a house, if he did not acquire a site or dig a sod of earth on that site&mdash;the fact that he had a thought of doing it, while thousands of others had not&mdash;he could be said, to that extent, to be disappointed that something was changed which prevented him from continuing with his intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not suggested in any of these three amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that it goes as far as that but the three amendments go almost that far.  If a man has it in his mind to erect a house, to acquire a site and to go through the legal difficulties that have to be contended with before actually becoming the owner of the site, and if he happens to be outside the class for whom we are providing, I suggest that that is a slim kind of case.  With regard to amendment No. 22, which I propose here, I can genuinely say to all concerned that I have gone further than I would have gone if I were not afraid of doing something that might create a real hardship.  I know that even in my amendment people will be able to secure the advantages of a free-for-all scheme which, if I could stop it, I would not permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is next door to it.  I asked the people who drafted amendment No. 22 to do the very best they <Col N="1607" /> could.  When they had done their best I inserted the further provision that an appeal would lie to the Minister on the part of an aggrieved person.  Having gone that distance, which was far in excess of what I had in my mind, I am afraid I will not be induced to take any further step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going back on Sections 9 and 10, I think the Minister will agree that this is the first time that grants which were given in respect of housing were ever cut down. Therefore, a person is fairly entitled to think that when a grant scheme operated, though it was limited in point of time it would be limited on the same line.  The Minister circulated amendment No. 22 before the last day's sitting.  When I handed in amendments Nos. 22a, 22b and 22c I thought the amendments would be discussed on that Friday morning and therefore I did not have as much time to consider them as I should have liked.  I can see the Minister's point that he does not want to have the 1950 scheme running parallel with the 1952 scheme.  The rest of the Minister's case consisted of the old trick of putting up a case that is not there for the purpose of knocking it down.  It is good debating tactics but it is not too hot for the people being hit by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very definite cases of people who will suffer hardship under this amendment, if it is passed, but at the same time they are a very limited number of people.  The number of people who bought a site before the 29th April last must be very small.  The number of people&mdash;if I may discuss amendments Nos. 22a and 22b together, as they are on the same line&mdash; who actually redeemed their annuity for the purpose of taking the land out into a separate folio and in that way qualifying to borrow under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and who actually did that before the 29th April last, must be very small.  The Minister's case would be very much stronger if we were discussing this on the basis that the relevant date was to be the date on which the Bill would be signed and an Act.  Then he would genuinely be entitled to say that people had got notice of this and were <Col N="1608" /> going to beat the Bill.  We are going back to the date upon which the Bill itself was circulated.  If people believed that they would get certain facilities if they expended their own money on the purchase of a site and on the redemption of an annuity, it is a genuine hardship if the Minister now wishes to have a different scheme in other areas.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to see the Minister's point of view.  If the Minister had come a little bit towards me in my amendments Nos. 22a and 22b, I should be prepared to come to him on his amendment No. 22.  I can see that where a person had just merely written in an application, and nothing more, the Minister's point of view might have some force and some validity.  If such a person had not taken any irrevocable step or suffered any financial loss, but had some hope shattered, I can see the Minister's point of view.  At some time or other, all of us experience some hope or other being shattered.  In that case it is hope that is gone, but in the other two cases hard cash is gone&mdash;hard cash which cannot be brought back.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister, under the provision for an appeal, would have any power to allow a housing authority to give a grant on appeal where the erection did not commence Certainly, there would not be any difficulty with our authority.  We would wish to try and cover the case where we were absolutely satisfied that a man had committed himself financially and spent money which he would not otherwise be able to recover.  After all, no matter what the £ may be worth these days, to acquire a £75 site one must pay £75.  I would suggest to the Minister, in all seriousness, that that man should not be put in the position in which he will be put if this amendment is not accepted.  The amount that is paid in respect of the redemption of an annuity may not be an enormous sum, but it is a very substantial sum to the person in question.  I know of one case where a sum has been paid on the redemption of an annuity by a man whose valuation is £36 and who, accordingly, under this Bill, will not get a grant.  This man is a farmer. The fact is that the money he has paid <Col N="1609" /> in the redemption of the annuity is gone so far as he is concerned.  Of course, he will pay slightly less on his annuity in future, but that is a different matter.  He will be at the loss of the money he has paid.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary for the county councils to await the passage of this Bill so that they can deal with the matter.  In that respect, I would urge the Minister to go half-way towards me by accepting amendments Nos. 22a and 22b.  Then, I will accept his view on amendment No. 22c.  We had a very friendly discussion all the morning. Let us finish it in the same way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with the other claim that was made, that this is the first occasion on which grants were reduced.  I am not admitting that, taking it all in all, the scheme that is outlined here effects any reduction inasmuch as provision is being made for the payment of grants in certain cases where no grants were previously paid. Under Section 7 of this Bill increased grants will be paid for reconstruction. Supplementary grants can be paid to <Col N="1610" /> people who wish to provide themselves with amenities such as water and sewerage or to reconstruct their premises.  Even if there is a limit both in regard to payment and earning capacity, there is compensation on the other side.  Even if a reduction were effected in the grant, the Deputy is not correct in saying that it would be the first time it was ever effected. Grants provided under the Housing Act of 1925 effected a reduction upon the grants that were payable under the Housing Act of the previous year.  If I were to admit, which I do not, that the Deputy's charge was correct and that this scheme effected a reduction, I would have introduced a precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position with regard to the acquisition of land is very unsatisfactory.  In Cork, a number of sites have been acquired. Some of them were acquired over 30 years ago, and the local authority has not paid for them yet.  Some five or six years ago, thousands of sites were taken over, and the local authority has only paid for 77 in one area where there are over 500.  Would the Minister consider introducing an amendment, on the Report Stage, that would enable the local authority to discharge its full legal responsibility by paying the registered land tenant and ensuring that that payment to the registered land tenant be deemed to be a complete discharge as far as the local authority is concerned?  The position at the moment is that, when the local authority makes a compulsory purchase order, it gets an absolute title to the plots it acquires.  There are hundreds, even thousands, of holdings that will never be paid for until some simple method of accepting title is arrived at. If the Minister could, on the Report Stage of the Bill, introduce an amendment to simplify the procedure, it would help very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure these questions deal with cases at Friar's Walk, in Cork, which is outside the Cork County Borough.  There are other districts where the Cork Corporation acquired land for sites.  According to the county solicitor, they have not the functional authority to do this.  The authority has now been given to them in connection with these sites.  The corporation leased those sites to people under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  In some cases, the houses <Col N="1614" /> are nearly completed and still the people cannot get loans from the Cork County Council because equities have not been discharged.  In a couple of cases they are not likely to be discharged for a very long time as some of the former owners are in a mental hospital.  There does not seem to be any inclination on the part of the solicitor engaged to push the case.  I know of a few young men waiting to be married.  They have houses practically completed but they cannot get a penny of the loan, not because the corporation has not the functional authority&mdash;that has been settled between the different councils&mdash;but because the corporation leased out those sites to those occupants without having a proper lease of the ground at all and without having a proper title.  The county solicitor says he cannot give the loans as there is no proper title. I think something should be done to ensure that applicants building under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act should be protected against anything like that happening again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the case made by Deputy Lehane.  As one of the sites committee in Cork, I find it is rather embarrassing to go out selecting sites for cottages where payment has not been made for sites taken over three or four years ago and entering a man's land in order to get further facilities.  Perhaps the Minister would ensure that the rated occupier should be entitled to payment, or perhaps he might make provision enabling the people who are occupying and working the land and from whom these sites have been taken to get payment for them.  That might solve the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any means available to me of finding a suitable solution to that problem.  I know it is a problem which confronts us from place to place and from time to time.  It is easy to see and recognise the hardships that are imposed, but I do not see how we could, in this Bill, provide, by way of an amendment, for what Deputy Lehane has drawn attention to.  I received a note mentioning this matter from him yesterday evening.  The note was not <Col N="1615" /> from himself and did not convey to me what he has stated in the House now.</P>
      <P>I do not profess to have any knowledge of the legal difficulties that are involved.  Speaking as a layman, I can see a great many obstacles to providing in this or, indeed, in any such measure for the sort of situation to which the Deputies have referred and which arises, unfortunately, in quite a number of places all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not the practice heretofore to accept the registered landowner?  The position now seems to be much more complicated in certain cases to discharge equities.  Letters of administration have been taken out in some cases, but the families have gone to America. The cost of discharging equities will prove in many cases to be more than the plot of land is worth. There are a large number of plots taken over and money lodged in court, and there are thousands of plots for which people will never be paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a determination has been made by a housing authority under Article 3 of the Emergency Powers <Col N="1617" /> (No. 277) Order, 1943 (S.R. &amp; O., No. 184 of 1943), in relation to a dwelling-house, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  notwithstanding the revocation of the said Order, any such determination shall continue in force until revoked by the housing authority;</P>
    <P>(b)  so long as such determination remains in force&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the dwelling-house shall be deemed to have been acquired by the housing authority for the purposes of Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the requirements imposed on the housing authority by Part II of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931 (No. 50 of 1931), in regard to securing the vacation and demolition of the dwelling-house shall be suspended;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(c)  sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (b) of this section shall not confer any power to sell the relevant dwelling-house.</P>
    <P>A local authority acquiring property in a clearance area under Part II of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, is required by that Act to cause every building in the property to be vacated and demolished.  During the early years of the war the Dublin Corporation had several properties in hands for demolition under these provisions. As they were unable to rehouse all the families that would have been displaced by the demolitions, an Emergency Powers Order was made enabling them to determine that it was necessary to maintain a dwelling-house which had been acquired under Part II of the 1931 Act for the accommodation of the working classes.  The Order provided that a determination might be revoked by the local authority by whom it was made.  The Order is about to be revoked, but we are continuing that power in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 33, but in Part V, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where labourers' cottages have been erected on lands in the possession of the State, the Minister for Finance may, on behalf of the State, sell the lands to the local authority concerned to enable that authority to sell such lands and cottages to the occupiers by means of a tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, as far as this amendment is concerned, it really affects the State Lands Act, 1924, more than this Bill. It is our old friend of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Beegan.  There have been questions from time to time in <Col N="1619" /> the House about it.  As I understand the position it is that the Minister may not sell State lands to a housing authority for the purpose of house building.  I think he can give a lease of them for 99 years or for some specified term.  If that is so, it would be fairly satisfactory if we could get that august body in St. Stephen's Green to consider the matter in a more friendly light.  At Ballyfair, in the County Kildare, the county council has a site for labourers' cottages, but so far as I can understand the Commissioners of Publice Works have taken refuge behind the 1924 Act.  If this amendment would mean that the commissioners could not take similar refuge in the future under the State Lands Act, I would like to see it accepted.  I know that this matter of the State Lands Act was put on the long finger by the last Government and by this Government, and I fear it will be put on the long finger by any future Government. Until something is done we will continue to be told &ldquo;we have no power&rdquo;. If the effect of this amendment would be to give the housing authority power to deal with State lands, even to get a lease for 99 years, let us hope that before the 99 years are up some Government will have dealt with the problem and that the reversion expected at the end of the 99 years will have been sold or bought.  Perhaps 99 years is too short a time for the Board of Works to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I was wondering what cases Deputies had in mind in putting down this amendment.  I took it that perhaps this amendment referred to cottages in Kilworth Camp.  I do not know eactly the places the Deputies had in mind nor do I know the number of houses.  If I had been supplied with these particulars I would have followed them up to see what the position was in regard to them.  We could not do anything in this Bill, even if we were free to.  We could not do more than make inquiries as a matter of interest, just to see what the position was.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Belton I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a), line 24, to delete &ldquo;one thousand eight hundred&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two thousand two hundred&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had some discussion on Second Stage about the actual increase in the limit that the provision in Section 33 would make.  So far as rural areas are concerned, the limit provided in the Bill is adequate.  I am using the word &ldquo;rural&rdquo; as including the smaller urban towns.  So far as the City of Dublin is concerned, I think the Minister has flown a shade too low.  I think the Minister could fairly say that Deputy Belton, perhaps, has flown a little too high.  Perhaps if the Minister could agree to a half-way point between his original suggestion and the suggestion of Deputy Belton, everybody could go away happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position used to be that the market value of the house in respect of which any small dwelling loan was <Col N="1621" /> being given was not to exceed £2,000. The provision in the 1950 Act meant that the person who was erecting his own house had to put up at least 5 per cent. of that market value.  If one took the figure that 5 per cent. of the market value was £100 and the grant was £375 that would be the position as it arose under the existing legislation. This will increase it somewhat.  It will increase it, however, in one way that I doubt is intended.  Under this section, any person can buy a house for £4,000 and can go to the corporation and say that he wants £1,800 out of the small dwellings pool.  The Minister will agree that that is not exactly what was intended and it would mean that the Small Dwellings Act was being utilised for a purpose for which it was never intended.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, the housing authority concerned must make up its mind as to whether the applicant is a person who is in need of a house. That is the overriding matter rather than the size or type of house being built.  Is there any danger that the effect of this will be to draw off the amount available for small dwellings loans to larger types of houses instead of making sure that the whole amount is available for the medium type of house, up to £2,500, that we are all considering?  That is the effect of the changed method.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is this to be said, that the change in method will do away with some of the friction that there always was everywhere as to the manner in which market value was being computed.  In the City of Dublin, having regard to the increase in the price of building that there is at present and with the increase in wages and salaries that there will be in view of the demands that are being made now, I think the increase the Minister has made will have the effect of merely putting things back part of the way to where they were and, £1,800 as the maximum advance when this increase will become operative, will not in fact be as good a proportion of the cost of the house that is being erected as the old proportion was with the limit of £2,000 market value.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear <Col N="1622" /> that, so far as I am concerned, I entirely agree with and endorse the viewpoint the Minister put forward on Second Stage, that it is the applicants that we must consider in this section and not the builders but, if there are no builders, then there will be no applicants.  We have to ensure that the two will work together in a reasonable fashion and that in that way the scheme will be successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some figures in his Second Reading speech as regards applications for housing grants. I must confess that the figures rather surprised me, but we will have an opportunity of considering them in greater detail on the Estimate for his Department.  I am, however, inclined to the view from talking to people in Dublin that there will be a substantial diminution in private building in this city within the next six or nine months. If that is so, then we need to do something to offset that diminution, to offset the conditions which have created it, and something which will have the psychological effect of increasing demand and of increasing availability.</P>
    <P>When discussing the grants, the Minister very frankly said he would love to increase them but, notwithstanding his love, he was not able to do so.  When he was not able to do that in regard to the grants, he should be able to do it to a larger extent in this section for the city, with the provision that it is being done in such a way that the Small Dwellings Act will be available for the type of case for which it was intended originally to provide loan finance.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, generally speaking, has failed to help a large section of the population which it really should have helped.  It seems to me that a lot of people in income groups who really do not need it have been availing of it. I do not think that the way in which it is altered at present by the suggestion of £1,800 will improve that position very much.  I feel that the figure is too low.  Apart from that, I am sorry that something cannot be done to help a man in the smaller income group to build his own house <Col N="1623" /> under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  So far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, I believe that 50 per cent. of the people who are waiting to be rehoused by the Dublin Corporation would be in a position to build their own houses if the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act had been scaled down to meet lower incomes instead of being availed of by people who can afford to go to a building society.  The figure which Deputy Belton suggested is a bit high, but the Minister's figure of £1,800 is too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We not only think it, but we are sure of it.  One of the reasons for deciding on this method, and it is a very excellent reason, is that, for many years, with building costs increasing, there was, from time to time, a demand that the limit should be raised.  We know that every time you raise the limit it is the builder who, as Deputy Sweetman said, is a very useful citizen in regard to this business, who usually comes forward, putting on the pressure to raise the limit.  But, in raising the limit, if you are satisfied that building costs warrant it, you naturally raise it very carefully, because you are afraid that, in a situation where there is a demand for houses, advantage could, in certain circumstances, be taken of your raising it to increase the cost of the house to the purchaser.  That might mean that no sooner have you raised it than, if the upper tendency in prices were to continue, they should be back again asking for a further increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how I found things when I arrived in the Department of Local Government.  It was only after a considerable discussion with my officials that we finally said: &ldquo;Would it not be better, since the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts were intended to serve certain classes that <Col N="1624" /> could not be described as poor or as well-off, that we should decide upon a figure&mdash;the figure we decided upon is the figure here&mdash;and say to the local authorities: &ldquo;You can advance that sum of money and that will cover the type of person which it was intended by the Acts to cover.&rdquo;  If there are people outside that class who want to build more expensive houses there is no reason why we should push up the limits to cater for them, but if the local authorities are satisfied&mdash;and the local authorities are free to refuse or accept an application for an advance&mdash; that it is a case where an advance should be made they may say to the individual: &ldquo;You can build a house costing £2,500 or £3,000, but so far as advances are concerned, we will only give £1,800.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brought you the very awkward situation which I have described, where building costs were continuing to rise, where there was a continual urge on the part of those building houses to raise the valuation limit, and where there was an anxiety on our part not to raise it in any way which might tempt any person unnecessarily to force up the price of houses.  We did not want to curtail their activities or to tempt them or anybody else still further to increase the price of houses. It was hard to arrive at and to maintain a valuation that will result in achieving these two aims.  In fact, I imagine it is impossible to achieve these two aims.  It is because of that I am satisfied, after discussion and examination with the people who have been administering these Acts for a very long time, that this is the best solution, and that it meets in a fairly reasonable way the people for whom the Acts were originally designed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the special allowance when the debate was adjourned, and what a benefit it was at the time it was introduced.  Of course, everything has increased since 1946, and every other class of pensioner, except the I.R.A. pensioner, got an increase during the past four years.  As I pointed out in this debate before it was adjourned, the Minister <Col N="1626" /> for Finance said the other day that we would not forget the Old I.R.A.  I hope that the Minister will not delay in dealing especially with this particular class who are so much in need of help.</P>
      <P>There are several points which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention in connection with the matter of the special allowance.  I have no doubt that the Minister is already aware of most of them.  As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, when the means test is applied on assessing the special allowance the whole earnings of a son or daughter under 18 years of age are taken into account.  In assessing means for an old age pensioner only the profit from the earnings of the son or daughter is taken into account.  In the case of this particular special allowance, when the son goes over 18 years of age the same principle is adopted and it is only the profit from the earnings.  Just imagine a young boy who gets a job at £1 or 30/- a week.  His total earnings are assessed against his father's special allowance or against his mother's Cumann na mBan pension.  I think there is no justice in that.  The very least should be to take only the profit from their earnings after clothing and feeding them.</P>
      <P>Another drawback is that when an award is made it must hold for 12 months.  Even if decisions and awards are proved to be entirely wrong, they cannot be altered for 12 months.  That is very unfair, especially in the case of a person who at the time of the making of the award might have had the earnings of some member of his family assessed against his claim, while, on the other hand, the person who was earning in that family at the time of the making of the award, and whose means were assessed in that connection, might have become idle the following week.  There can be no alteration in the decision until a period of 12 months has elapsed.  When the means of an old age pensioner or a non-contributory widow alter, they can make a fresh application.  If there must be a time limit, surely three months is long enough without having to wait 12 months to have a decision altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> Another peculiar thing about this special allowance is that under the Social Welfare Act a person can have a special allowance and can draw a full old age pension, but if he got the old age pension first he cannot get the special allowance because the old age pension is assessed as means against him.  That is a ridiculous position.  I think that my statement is correct and if it is wrong I hope the Minister will point out that it is wrong.  I have been informed that a person cannot get a special allowance because he has an old age pension.  If, on the other hand, he had the special allowance first, he could draw his full old age pension. Surely, there is something wrong with that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>When the National Health Insurance Society was being handed over to the Department of Social Welfare the then Minister for Social Welfare agreed that, as their I.R.A. pensions were not abated while they were working for the National Health Insurance Society, he would see to it that national health insurance agents would be at no loss when the transfer would take place.  We now have the ridiculous position that the I.R.A. pension of a national health insurance agent is abated and that he gets a refund from the Department of Social Welfare. Surely there should be some other way of getting over the position that the pension should be stopped and then refunded by another Department. Surely if it is decided to exempt them, they should be exempted in the first instance and no more about it.</P>
    <P>I appeal strongly to the Minister to give a substantial increase to the people who are drawing the special allowance.  They are the most hard-up section of the Old I.R.A.  They must be incapable of self-support and must have no means of subsistence before they will get this allowance.  Surely the Minister will agree that what was a good thing in 1946 is not a good thing in 1952.  The matter of abatement has been condemned universally on both sides of this House under the last Government and under the present Government. I do not think any case can <Col N="1628" /> be made for stopping money out of a man's pension because he is working for a Government Department or a local authority.</P>
    <P>We have the cases of corporation sweepers, cleaners and messengers in Government buildings, postmen and labourers working for local authorities whose pensions are being abated because they work in those particular jobs.  I know of a few cases where people are drawing their full pensions&mdash; substantial pensions&mdash;because they are working for bodies whose funds are not provided out of the public rates.  One of the men I have in mind can draw his full pension in addition to a salary of about £800 per year.  However, if he were working in the Cork Corporation instead of in the body in which he is working, he could not draw his pension at all. I have a case in mind of a man who was secretary to a public board in Cork, and who never bothered to apply for his pension.  He knew that it would be no use for him to do so.  He got a new appointment as secretary to another institution in Cork and he applied for and got his full pension. Is not that a ridiculous state of affairs?  Is it not ridiculous also that there are cases of dispensary doctors whose pensions are abated, and there are other cases in which doctors hold four appointments and get their full pension?  It seems to me that the whole matter is a complete injustice. When a man gets a job as a cleaner or as messenger in a Government Department because of national service, is he not doing the same work in that Department as the person who has no national service record?  Because he gets this job owing to I.R.A. service, is he to be deprived of his pension?  In other words, is he to be deprived of his pension, and is he to work in a particular Government Department at a lower rate than that at which a person who has no national service would be expected to work?</P>
    <P>If the man in question did not take that particular job he would get his full pension in some other job.  Is it because he has served with the I.R.A. that he is to suffer a reduction in his pension and work at a lower rate than another man who has not rendered any <Col N="1629" /> such service?  There was a general foreman in the Cork Corporation, and immediately he got the offer of a job from a private firm giving him the same pay as he was getting from the corporation, he jumped at it.  The result was that his pension went up by about £2 per week.  The person in question had been granted a substantial pension.  Surely, there can be no justice attached to the practice whereby a person, retiring from Government service on a pension which is much lower than his salary heretofore, has his I.R.A. pension abated also.  Is it because there were such happenings in this country 50 years ago which we all criticised that we should continue such practices?  In my view, the whole thing is absurd and should be finished with as quickly as possible.  I do not think it would cost the Government much to do so.  I imagine there would be unanimous agreement on the matter on both sides of the House.  While the inter-Party Government held office I was speaking casually one day to Dr. O'Higgins, and this particular matter cropped up.  He said that there should be a motion from both sides of the House to abolish the practice, but that the Governments in power from time to time did not like to bring it in because it affected themselves personally.  Why should they allow other people to be imposed upon because of their personal feelings? However, it is not the Government or the Opposition I am worried about but the type of people such as corporation sweepers, postmen, Government messengers and cleaners.  I would appeal to the Minister to give this matter very early consideration.  I am not worried about the men with big I.R.A. pensions who are in receipt of large salaries in other businesses.  However, there are some persons in receipt of small Civil Service pensions and, if possible, something should be done about them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to-day to the dependents of Air Corps personnel. The case of Captain Ryan's widow was quoted.  We should have in mind the dependents of all deceased Air Corps personnel as well as the dependents of the late Captain Ryan.  I feel sure that we all think something should be done <Col N="1630" /> for the dependents of those people who lose their lives in the service of the country.  The case of Captain Ryan was a particularly sad one.  Five brothers of that family served in the Army during the emergency.  Three of them lost their lives.  Two of them had no dependents, so there were no claims lodged in their case.  However, the third brother left a widow and a large family, and I feel sure that we can safely leave their case in the hands of the Minister.  I am certain that he will make provision also for the dependents of all persons who lose their lives in the service of the country or in the Army.</P>
    <P>I would appeal strongly to the Minister to bear in mind two particular cases that I put to him.  I appealed to him to increase the special allowances of the people who are badly in need of such increases and to do away, once and for all, with the abatement in I.R.A. pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising two points.  I touched very briefly on one of these points on the Army Vote, but it was explained to me that I was not in order, which explanation I accepted. One of the matters I wish to discuss is in relation to pensions, which was also discussed by Deputy McGrath.  I wish to draw attention particularly to the position of privates in the Army&mdash; those men who will retire with small pensions&mdash;whose pensions will be affected if they get a job.  In my view, that is not correct or fair.  I have in mind cases of men living around the south coast of Cork who served in the army or in the navy of another country and who, at the present time, enjoy large pensions as well as having the advantage of being employed.</P>
      <P>We should not interfere with the pension of a man who has given good service to the country and who, when he retires, has been offered employment in the Government service or in the service of a local authority.  In many cases, the wage received by that man is very small.  I would ask the Minister to give these people the consideration to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy McGrath, I have little or no sympathy with some of those who have retired on large pensions <Col N="1631" /> and who have secured very good positions in outside employment.  They enjoy high salaries, and at the same time they enjoy good pensions.  It is unjust that some who retire on very large pensions should move immediately into very good sheltered employment, where the salaries far exceed those for which other people could hope.  If they have the ability to fill these posts that is another matter. From a Christian point of view it is very unjust to allow a full pension to a man who may be in receipt of £1,000 or £1,500 a year, while, at the same time, reducing the pension of a man earning £4 a week in the employment of the Government or of a local authority.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider that matter.  Any man who has given service to this country should not be deprived of his pension altogether, nor should his pension be reduced.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to mention relates to the question of special allowance.  The Minister may say the position now is what it was in the past.  I do not want to attack one particular Minister or administration any more than another.  I believe there is undue hardship placed upon the recipients of this particular allowance.  I know of one particular man who got the full benefit for one year, but the following year, just because his little girl of 15 years went into employment and received 15/- per week, his special allowance was reduced.  That 15/- which his little daughter received was almost all spent on clothing her.  It is only natural to expect also that when a boy and girl are employed they expect a few shillings pocket money for themselves. They are entitled to that but, as I say, just because this little girl was earning, the father's special allowance was reduced.  That is very unjust.  It is an incentive to the young member not to work.  This little girl I mentioned had to travel quite a journey to her place of employment, with the result that the reduction in the father's pension far exceeded the amount she received in wages.  I urge the Minister to do his utmost possible for those people.</P>

      <Col N="1632" /> Most of the people in receipt of this special allowance are advanced in years and they cannot expect to enjoy the allowance for very many years more.  It is unjust that, in the later stages of their lives, when they receive this little financial benefit, it should be reduced or taken altogether from them because a member of the family gets employment.  I know, of course, that the Minister or any other Minister is faced with the problem of finance, but we would not be here in an Irish Parliament talking about finance were it not for the important part played by those people in establishing the State of which we are proud to be citizens.  Were it not for those people, the British flag might be flying over the capital of this country as it did for a long time.</P>

      <P>The casualty list amongst the Old I.R.A. is very high. Other speakers have pointed out that a pensioner who is employed either in the Civil Service or in a local authority has his pension reduced, but if he went into the commercial world and was successful enough to draw £2,000 a year he would be all right.  There are road workers in County Dublin, employed by local authorities, whose pensions have been reduced.  I do not think that is fair at all.  As I said at the outset, the casualty list amongst these Old I.R.A. men is very high.  A number of them are old men now.  Even at the eleventh hour, I would appeal to the Minister to do his best to remedy this injustice.  Judging by the contributions to this debate from all sides of the House, there seems to be a unanimous opinion in regard to remedying this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to disability pensions and Old I.R.A. pensions, here again you have to deal with old men, many of whom are unable to work.  I think that, in the evening of their lives, they should be favourably considered for an increase.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. Thursday, 26th June, 1952.</P>
