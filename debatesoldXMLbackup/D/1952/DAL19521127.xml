    <Title>Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House, I think, is aware that the Government exercises certain powers under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, which is an annual Act.  It is necessary to ask the House to extend it for a further year because there are powers which it is necessary to retain for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the aim of policy to try to dispense with the necessity for this Act either by repealing the Emergency Powers Orders when the need for <Col N="166" /> them has passed, or by proposing permanent legislation to confer powers to deal with matters for which it is still necessary that the Government should take responsibility.  We have not been able to get this year to the stage at which the retention of the Supplies and Services Act would no longer be required.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, for example, still exercises exchange control under an Emergency Powers Order, but separate legislation dealing with that matter is in course of preparation.  He also gives, under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order, guarantees against borrowings by certain semi-State bodies.  A Bill to deal with that matter is at present before the Dáil, but it is not likely to be enacted during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government requires powers under the Supplies and Services Act to maintain various regulations dealing with traffic matters for which he has not yet been able to prepare permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare requires powers under the Act for the maintenance of a number of minor relief measures which originated during the emergency and which it has not yet been found desirable to discontinue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, under the authority of this Act, maintains various regulations in connection with the dairying industry, the meat industry, cereals and feeding-stuffs and other matters.  In respect of these powers, it is not yet practicable to relinquish them, and the circumstances are not such as to permit a decision as to whether they should be continued under permanent legislation or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce requires the Supplies and Services Act mainly for the purpose of operating price control and the regulation of exports and to continue the suspension of various quotas and tariffs.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the Dáil that permanent legislation relating to price control will be promoted when a position of relevant stability of <Col N="167" /> prices has been reached.  The Control of Prices Act, 1937, was found not to be sufficiently flexible to deal with price problems in the abnormal circumstances which have prevailed since the beginning of the war.  That Act has, in fact, been allowed to lie dormant since 1939.  I would regard it as undesirable to revive it or to submit to the Dáil proposals for its amendment until it was clear that the rather slower procedure of permanent legislation would be suitable to the conditions as against the more flexible machinery of the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    <P>The regulations relating to the control of exports are not very many in number at the present time, but I think it is still necessary to retain some emergency powers relating to exports. I have in mind alternative proposals for the purpose of continuing such powers permanently to the extent that they may be necessary, but these are unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future.  As regards quotas and tariffs, the existing permanent legislation also lacks flexibility in some degree and the question of suitably amending it is being considered.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year a number of Orders under the Supplies and Services Act were discontinued. The most notable of these were the Orders relating to the rationing of foodstuffs, the rationing of petrol and the control of building.  All the Orders relating to these matters have been revoked, together with a number of other Orders of perhaps less importance.</P>
    <P>From time to time Government Departments are exhorted to examine all the Emergency Powers Orders in operation and dispense with those which are no longer required or serving little purpose at the present time.</P>
    <P>When asking the House to renew this Supplies and Services Act for another year I would not like to be taken as suggesting that it would be possible to avoid asking the Dáil to renew it again this time 12 months. While I hope that in the course of the present year considerable progress will be made along the lines I have indicated of revoking Orders no longer <Col N="168" /> required and introducing permanent legislation where the retention of powers is considered necessary, I think it is clear that the completion of that legislative programme during the next 12 months is unlikely and, therefore, it is probable that the continuation of the Supplies and Services Act for another year after 1953 will, at least, be necessary.</P>
    <P>I propose to make some particular reference to Orders authorising an increased price for bread and flour.  I understand it has been agreed that motions standing on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy MacBride for the annulment of these Orders will be moved during the course of the debate so that the Dáil can take a decision on them, if it desires, within the statutory period.</P>

      <P>I think it is Wednesday next.  We are coming to the end of it, but there are some days still left.  This is the 17th day and there are 21 days allowed.  These Orders of the Government sanctioning an increased price for bread and flour naturally have earned a great deal of comment.  Whenever a Government takes the unpleasant or unpopular step of sanctioning increased prices for essential foodstuffs like bread and flour it is not unnatural that Opposition Parties should try to take the fullest advantage of it. I cannot resent that being done because twice during the Coalition Government's term of office increased bread prices were authorised by Orders made by that Government in almost precisely similar circumstances, and Fianna Fáil Deputies did not hesitate to comment upon them.  Perhaps some time there may be a different approach to these matters, but not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the House the circumstances in which these Orders were made.  On the 29th August last the Association of Master Bakers and the Guild of Irish Bakers, that is to say, the two organisations representing the master bakers of <Col N="169" /> the country, informed my Department that the Labour Court had made a recommendation on August 21st for increased wages to bakery workers. Both these organisations stated that their agreement to pay the increased wages recommended by the Labour Court was conditional on either the price of bread being increased or the price of flour being decreased.  As regards the possibility of decreasing the price of flour, it was known that the matter of flour milling wages was also coming before the Labour Court.  I do not wish to refer further to that matter because, as the House is aware, no final settlement in regard to flour milling wages has yet been reached, and discussions are, I understand, proceeding between the parties concerned. That, however, was the position with which I had to deal.  On the one hand, a recommendation of the Labour Court that wages in the bakery trade should be increased and, on the other hand, an intimation by the master bakers that their agreement to pay the increase so recommended was conditional on their being allowed to increase the price of bread or, alternatively, to be given the advantage of a decreased price for flour.</P>
    <P>The evidence produced by the Master Bakers' Association and checked by my Department showed that the increase in wages recommended by the Labour Court was equivalent to an increase of 2/6 in the cost of converting a sack of flour of 280 lb. into batch bread.  When coming to a decision as to the recommendation that I would make to the Government on the matter, I assumed &mdash; and I think rightly &mdash; that a refusal of relief to the bakery firms would have led to a refusal by them to pay the increased wages recommended and in all probability to a strike in the bakery industry.  I could not contend that the bakery workers were not entitled to an increase in wages the same as workers in other trades, and I decided to recommend to the Government that to enable increased wages to be paid increased bread prices should be sanctioned.</P>
    <P>That situation which I had to face in September last the Dáil has to face <Col N="170" /> now.  I think it is certain that if the annulment Orders are carried and the maximum prices permitted for bread reduced in consequence, some or all of the bakery firms will withdraw the increase in wages they have been paying, and of a certainty there will be a period of acute industrial unrest in the trade and a period of considerable difficulty for those who depend upon bakers' bread for their daily meals.  There was, however, one aspect of this matter that involved a complication. I have said that the calculations made showed that the increase in bakery wages recommended by the Labour Court was equivalent to an increase of 2/6 in the cost of converting a sack of flour into batch bread.</P>
    <P>The lowest increase in bread prices possible with our currency was, however, a farthing.  With no smaller coin in use than a farthing, obviously no lesser increase could be made effective, but the effect of an increase in the price of batch bread of a farthing per loaf was to give the bakers an extra 3/9 per sack instead of the 2/6 by which their costs had been raised.  In order to avoid that unnecessary addition to bakers' profits, the price charged to them for flour was increased by an adjustment of the subsidy arrangements by 1/3 per sack.  The position, therefore, as far as the bakers were concerned, was that their costs for changing a sack of flour into bread were increased by 3/9 per sack against which they were receiving through an increase in price the same amount.  I want to make it quite clear that bakery firms received no advantage whatever from the increase in prices.  Nobody benefited by a penny by the increase other than the workers employed by bakery firms.</P>
    <P>The price of flour had necessarily to be adjusted in relation to the price of bread.  It has always been the practice since these price control arrangements were inaugurated to keep the price of household flour in line with the price of bakers' flour.  If that practice were departed from, there would be the likelihood of a shift in demand from bakers' bread to flour for home baking leading to a loss of business in the <Col N="171" /> bakeries and unemployment among bakery workers.  I may say that it has been contended that the present price structure does favour the person buying flour for home baking as against the person buying bakers' bread and the figures available to me suggest that there is some possibility of a shift in demand from bakers' bread to household flour.  My own view, however, is that that shift in demand which is more to be expected in rural than urban areas, would be due to a greater extent to the extension of the rural electrification scheme than to the present price arrangement.</P>
    <P>It has been contended in the Dáil and elsewhere that following upon the increased costs of baking batch bread consequent upon the higher wages the necessity for an increase in batch bread prices should have been investigated by the Prices Advisory Body before a decision was made.  I did not think that to be necessary and I should like the House to understand my reasons for coming to that conclusion. The cost of bread production was under review no later than June last when following the Budget changes alterations in bread prices were made. It has been the practice of the Prices Advisory Body and of the prices branch of my Department to base their conclusions regarding the cost of bread production upon the very exhaustive report made by the special committee set up by the previous Government under Mr. Justice Lavery the report of which was published. That committee went very fully into the whole business of bread making and gave their analysis of the cost of production in great detail.  Since that report became available our decisions relating to bread prices have been based on the assumption that there has been no shift in relative costs in the meantime and I do not think that anybody can seriously suggest that there has been.  Therefore, any known variation in particular costs can be related to the price of bread without difficulty.  It is open to the Prices Advisory Body to investigate the price of bread or of any other commodity on their own initiative any time they think it necessary and I have no <Col N="172" /> reason to think that they will not undertake that investigation if they are satisfied that the need for it exists. I think it is fair to say also that the procedure which the Government followed on this occasion was precisely the same as their predecessors followed on two occasions during their term of office.  In April, 1948, the bakery workers in Dublin demanded an increase in wages and, the bakery owners having said that they could not give that increase without an increase in the price of bread, the bakery workers went on strike.</P>
    <P>Following the strike, sanction was given to the payment of an increase in wages and to offset the effect upon bakery production costs the price of bread was raised by the authority of the then Government by a farthing per loaf in Dublin.  The actual increase in wages on that occasion was less than that recommended by the Labour Court in August last and, of course, the Government then in office had to make the same adjustment in the subsidy arrangements as we have made now so as to keep the overall cost of bread production in line with the increased price sanctioned.  Again, in February, 1951, there was a claim for increased wages in the bakery trade and that claim was taken to the Labour Court, which recommended an increase in wages almost identical with that which they recommended in last August, and to permit that increase in wages to be paid the Government then in Office made an Order, a rather complicated Order, designed to sanction an increased price for bread, not merely in Dublin on this occasion but all over the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that bakery firms are making substantial profits and could carry the increase in wages recently recommended by the Labour Court without increasing prices.  First of all, let me say, that the position is precisely the same as it was in 1948 and in 1951, when our predecessors sanctioned increased bread prices to offset higher wages.  If the bakery firms are making undue profits now they were making undue profits then, because the whole basis of control is exactly the same now as then.  The information <Col N="173" /> available to me, however, does not suggest that bakery firms are making excessive profits.  I admit that it is not possible to give precise information regarding the profits earned on the production of batch bread.  Almost every bakery firm produces a number of other commodities as well.  Most of the larger Dublin bakeries have substantial trades in confectionery and fancy bread; some of them have export trades.  Throughout the country most bakery firms produce confectionery or other forms of bread than batch bread, and it is only the price of batch bread that is involved in these Orders.</P>
    <P>The examination made of the accounts of seven of the larger bakery firms in Dublin in respect of the year 1951 shows that the profit on sales earned by them on the whole of their business, including confectionery, was 1.9 per cent., and in respect of 15 representative provincial bakery firms was 2.9 per cent.  I do not think it could be contended that that margin of profit on sales is excessive.  May I say that the profits which these firms are capable of earning have not been altered to the extent of one penny by the alterations in prices following on the increased wages which have been sanctioned?</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion &mdash; and there may be something in it &mdash; that the costs of production in some bakeries are lower than in others and that in Dublin particularly one or two firms might have been able to carry the higher wages without increasing the price of bread.  I do not know if that suggestion is intended to lead up to the idea that a lower price should be fixed by Order for the batch bread produced by any firm in that position, while a higher price would be sanctioned for firms not in that position. I think that would be an impossible situation.  The whole practice of price control appears to require the fixing of a uniform maximum price for all firms.  I have been giving consideration to the possibility of restoring competition, or should I say more acute competition, in the bakery and flour-milling trades.  I feel that the restoration of competition leading to the <Col N="174" /> efforts of individual firms to increase sales by price reductions will have quite substantial consequences if it can be developed.</P>
    <P>It will, I think, put a number of firms out of business and tend to concentrate trade in the larger and more efficient concerns.  That is a possibility we can face and the time is coming, in my view, when we will have to face it. There is ample evidence that over many parts of the country, retail flour is being sold at less than the fixed maximum price.  With the abolition of rationing, competition has developed between traders and they are endeavouring to attract trade by selling flour at less than the fixed maximum price.  In Dublin there are a number of smaller bakeries selling bread at less than the fixed maximum price and I think that is true of a number of provincial bakeries also.</P>
    <P>It is frequently contended here in the Dáil that once the Government fixes a maximum price for any commodity it becomes automatically the minimum price.  That was probably true in times of scarcity but those who put forward that contention also argue that if any single firm charges less for its products than the fixed maximum price, then the maximum price has been fixed too high.  It seems to me they cannot have it both ways and while it is probably not desirable yet to contemplate the abolition of price control by means of a fixed maximum price in respect of bread and flour, nevertheless we must encourage any development which may result in firms offering their products for sale at less than the prices so fixed.  The fact, however, that some firms, particularly in respect of retail flour, are selling at less than the price which has been fixed for flour suggests that the time has come when we could consider decontrolling its price and thereby stimulating further competition for trade.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of price control in relation to flour-milling is bad.  The time has come when it must be completely overhauled.  It is operated virtually to eliminate competition amongst the millers and to discourage them from keeping their plants efficient and up-to-date.  I am hopeful <Col N="175" /> that in the very early future we will be able to devise a system which will operate to promote the reappearance of competition between flour millers. In the case of bakery firms there are more complicated matters to be considered. We have had discussions here in the House also as to the effects upon the business of rural bakeries of the extension of activities by the city bakeries.  There may be a view that it is not desirable that the whole of the bakery business should tend to become concentrated in the larger firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If, however, we are to make our main target the getting of flour and bread prices down to the lowest possible level, we must be prepared to take other consequences of that kind which may follow from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that fully and, of course, there are, naturally, in that connection anxieties amongst the workers who engage in the bakery trade.</P>
      <P>So far, therefore, as these Bread and Flour Orders are concerned, it is perfectly true that the Government could have refused to make them.  The effect would have been, I think, a period of protracted dislocation in the bakery business or, even if it meant that one or two firms would have paid the higher wages and would have remained in business, it would have completely disorganised it on its present basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no desire &mdash; and I think the House should join with us in this &mdash; to conceal economic realities from our people.  It has not infrequently been suggested that it is possible for workers generally to get increased wages without any effect upon prices, the increased wages being carried upon the alleged excessive profits of manufacturers and traders.  That is a fantastic idea.  It is far better that we should appreciate that any increase in costs, including labour costs, must eventually <Col N="176" /> reappear in higher prices.  That does not mean that increased wages should not be paid when the justification for them has been established.  What it means is that we make our decision in these matters with full and realistic appreciation of all the consequences. Any successful effort to conceal these economic realities from our people can only do damage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Dáil will not agree to annul these Orders.  I cannot contemplate what the consequences of their annulment would be, apart from the political effects, and I think it is far better for us to recognise that, increased wages having become payable in the bakery business, increased wages which were recommended by the Labour Court, the prices of bread had to be adjusted to enable them to be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised that we had a rather lame and apologetic speech from the Minister in moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  It was a rather remarkable speech, remarkable not for what the Minister said, but for what he left unsaid.  Over a number of years it has been the custom to make the debate on the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services Bill a full-dress debate on the cost of living.  Having regard to the present unprecedented level of the cost of living, it is remarkable that the Minister never once mentioned it in the course of his speech.  Let me remind the Minister and the House of some of the things which the Minister said when he last spoke on the Supplies and Services Bill from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, on 23rd November, 1950 &mdash; Volume 123, column 1308, of the Official Report &mdash; the Minister said: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As a protest against the Government's failure to use properly the powers given them by the Supplies and Services Act during the course of the past year, as a protest against their coming to the Dáil now to request a continuation of these powers and as a protest against their failure to secure the enactment by the Oireachtas during that period of permanent legislation for the <Col N="177" /> regulation of prices, for rationing, for exchange control and building control, we propose to vote against this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, at column 1311, the Minister said, regarding exchange control: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I disapprove of this control being still exercised under the very wide powers of the Supplies and Services Bill.  I think these powers are far too wide to give to any Minister to exercise without being accountable to the Dáil, and, if there is to be some permanent form of control, then it should be more precisely defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>That is another reason why I am going to object to the Government seeking to continue this Emergency Act instead of facing up to its responsibilities and transforming into permanent legislation the powers which it thinks it needs and the requests for it which it can justify here.  But our main objection is because of the Government's failure to control prices, their refusal to face up honestly to the problem of prices and, particularly, of this new device of theirs of pretending that they are doing something by setting up advisory committees to conceal their incompetence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reference was to the setting up of the Prices Advisory Body which, of course, is still in operation and I think the Minister is rather glad to have it at his disposal.  At column 1306 of the same volume the Minister said: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The failure to control prices, to prevent a rise in prices up to now, the accelerating rise that is now in progress is perhaps the Government's greatest failure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want respectfully to suggest to members of the House and particularly to members of the Fianna Fáil Party that they ought to refresh their memories of the debate which took place on the Supplies and Services Bill two years ago in this House.  Many of them ought to read their own speeches. I am rather sorry that Deputy Vivion de Valera is not here this morning.  In Volume 123 of the Official Report there are no fewer than 47 columns taken up <Col N="178" /> by Deputy Vivion de Valera on the cost of living, in the most detailed way I am rather sorry that Deputy Peadar Cowan is not here this morning.  Or that occasion Deputy Cowan spoke or the cost of living.  At column 1611, he said: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody knows that the cost of living has so increased that the poorer sections and the middle classes are hardly able to make ends meet, and that every person, except the pretty well-to-do, has to go with out items of food and clothing, which are essential to a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is the Department which is primarily concerned with this matter, and I charge the Department with failure, criminal failure, to do its duty in regard to the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear Deputy Cowan on the Second Stage of the Bill now.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is, perhaps, the most important and certainly the most urgent matter for discussion and consideration by this House.  It is remarkable, and it is only right that it should be underscored, that the Minister did not make a single reference to it, did not think it desirable or necessary to make a single reference to it on an occasion on which, as he knows better than anybody else, it is always the main topic.  If the cost of living justified the statements which were made about it in this House this time two years, if the Minister was justified on that occasion in making the statements I have just quoted, if Deputy Vivion de Valera was justified in taking up no fewer than 47 columns of the Official Report in dealing with the cost of living; if Deputy Childers, Deputy Briscoe, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Cowan and all the others were justified in looking for the heads of the then Ministers, the House would like to hear their justification for the present level of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, it was on that famous occasion that Fianna Fáil started the ramp &mdash; and it was a ramp &mdash; about the cost of living, which put them where <Col N="179" /> they are now.  That dishonest campaign which was started on the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services Bill two years ago, which was dragged out here for weeks, which was featured in the Party organs and which was continued down to the crossroads and the street corners, that more than any other ramp, that completely dishonest misrepresentation of the actual position at the time in relation to the cost of living, that more than anything else is responsible for the fact that the Minister is moving the Second Reading of this Bill to-day.  There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>The people have discovered to their cost &mdash; discovered too late &mdash; that it was a dishonest ramp.  They have discovered that, so far as the cost of commodities was concerned, they were on easy street two years ago compared to where they are now.  I do not want to go into the price of bread, the cost of production of bread, milling costs and so on, this morning &mdash; there will be others to deal with that &mdash; except to say this, and it is the most significant fact that has emerged, a fact indicating perhaps more clearly than any other single fact the condition to which our people have been reduced as a result of the enormous increase in the cost of living &mdash; there has been a fall in the consumption of bread.  There has been a fall, and a very substantial fall, in the consumption of bread.  I ask Deputies on the far side of the House who when they were on this side were clamouring day in and day out that we were not giving enough bread to the people, that the ration was not big enough, that the price was too high, that it was not fair to make an additional amount over and above the ration available at an economic price, to ask themselves now what is the reason why the consumption of bread has fallen and fallen substantially.  The answer is quite simple: the people to-day cannot afford to purchase it. That is something which ought to give this House, apart from the Government, something to consider and to think about.</P>
    <P>I want to assert &mdash; and I do not think it will be challenged &mdash; that the cost of <Col N="180" /> living is to-day at a figure that it never attained before in the history of this country.  I want to assert without fear of contradiction that the cost of living has risen at least three times as much in the last year and a half as it did in the three years and a half that we were in office.  Indeed, I think I am rather understating it than overstating it when I say three times as much.  There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>The people's capacity to meet that increased cost is not at all equal to what it was a year and a half ago. There is considerably more unemployment. The live register itself has fluctuated between 11,000 and 8,000 over the number who were on the live register during our time; but those of us who know anything about these matters know that that is not the whole story.  There may be 11,000 more unemployed than there were a year and a half ago or a year ago; but how many thousands are there underemployed, how many thousands are on short time?  And by how much has the earnings, as distinct from the wages, of those in employment been reduced in the last year and a half?  I do not think the Minister will venture to question the statement that earnings &mdash; earnings as distinct from wages &mdash; are considerably less than they were up to the advent of the present Government. How many factories and industries are to-day on short time?  Is it not true to say that many of our people who were not merely in full employment but were working a full regular number of hours and had considerable overtime to add to their earnings are to-day lucky if they bring home in the pay packet half of what they were earning a year and a half ago?</P>
    <P>Deputies may be inclined to query that.  I could give many evidences of it.  Let me mention just one which I know about and of which I have personal knowledge.  Up to a year and a half ago, up to 12 months ago, it was almost impossible to get in this city a factory premises to purchase, a factory premises for sale.</P>
    <P>To-day you can get your choice of a dozen of them or 20 or 30 of them. What does that indicate?  Not merely was the progress of industrial production <Col N="181" /> not maintained, but it has been substantially reduced, with consequent unemployment or under-employment, with its consequent effect on the capacity of the people to meet the enormously increased cost of the everyday commodities.  Deputy Cowan was blathering here a night or two ago, telling us that we were engaged in a war against unemployment.  We are engaged in a war against employment and a war that, unfortunately, is being fairly successful.</P>

      <P>I say that we put additional tens of thousands of people into employment in this country and this Government has succeeded in putting thousands out of employment.  I do not like to make prophecies.  I made one of which the Minister reminded me and I particularly dislike having to say what I am now going to say.

      <P>Let us keep where we are.  I am saying that all the signs are that there will be considerably more unemployment and considerably more under-employment with a consequent still greater difficulty for the people to meet this enormous high cost of living.  I am quite sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce is fully conversant with it.  He knows at least as much and, perhaps, far more than anybody else of the state of business in this country.  Would any Deputy on any side of this House, who is in touch to any extent at all with what is happening in this country and particularly in this city, deny that for the last six months we have been hit with the greatest slump and depression in business that ever struck this country since the State was established?  There is no doubt about that.  There are employers and firms in this country laying off men and women out of employment for the first time in 40 years.  I can give names in that connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give them to the Minister.  I will give him a list of them.  That is true.  I do not believe for one second that the Minister is not aware of that himself.  I do not believe that the Minister is not fully aware that we are in the middle of the greatest business slump that ever struck this country.  I do not believe for a minute that the Minister is not fully aware of the fact that there are people in business to-day with their backs against the wall.  I do not believe that the Minister is not aware that there are certain people in business in this country and in this city who are being forced to dispose of their business premises and are unable to get any price offered for them.  That is true and there is nobody, no matter on what side of the House he sits, but knows that that is true if he is in <Col N="184" /> touch at all, good, bad or indifferent, with what is happening.  If they do not know, I invite Deputies in the House to go out and consult any businessman in this city, no matter what type of business he is engaged in, and ask him whether what I am saying now is true or untrue.  Let them go to a personal friend of their own or a political supporter of their own and ask that question.  Whatever he may say publicly or whatever the Deputy may say publicly, I have not the shadow of a doubt what his answer will be when you ask him the question.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is not confined to this city.  It is all over the country. I say &mdash; if my colleagues from North Tipperary are not in the House they can be brought in &mdash; that there is more unemployment in my constituency at the moment than there has been for a great many years and we have been told that there is going to be still more.  The cost of living situation is so serious that, in my opinion, this House is bound &mdash; it has a responsibility &mdash; fully to discuss the matter and see if it is possible to find some method of meeting it.</P>
      <P>I think I am entitled even to challenge members who sit behind the Government to get up here to-day and express their views on the cost of living, express them as freely, if not as fully, as they did two years ago. There is no doubt whatever that in every single phase of its activity this country is considerably worse than it was two years ago.  It could not be otherwise.  The tragic thing about it is that it is largely due to irresponsible, untrue and dishonest statements which were made by men who occupy ministerial positions in this country to-day. There is no doubt whatever that there are very considerable numbers of people to-day lining up at the labour exchanges who are there because statements made by certain Ministers shook badly the people's faith in the credit of this country.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody believe for one moment that men who are supposed to be responsible and who occupy ministerial positions can go up and down through this country telling us that the country <Col N="185" /> is in a desperate plight, that it is on the brink of bankruptcy, that its assets have been squandered in the most shameful manner by their predecessors and continue that and repeat it without bringing about the unfortunate results which we have in this country to-day?</P>
    <P>I must say that to those who are in touch with what is happening outside it is difficult&mdash;very difficult, indeed&mdash; to listen to the man who was mainly responsible for that and who made the most irresponsible of all the irresponsible speeches that were made postulating here for three hours like a peacock on a lawn on a sunny day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;teetering around making jokes and trying to be witty, but it was the type of joke and the sort of wit that does not appeal to a man who lines up outside a labour exchange or the man who does not know that tomorrow evening he may not be getting something in his wages packet as well as his wages&mdash;an intimation that his services will no longer be required or that as from this day forward instead of working every week he will be working every second week.</P>
      <P>Those are the sort of things I suggest we should have heard from the Minister this morning.  I am not going to weary the House by making quotations from Deputy Childers, as he then was, or Deputies MacEntee, Briscoe, and Vivion de Valera.  I would suggest, though, to Deputy Vivion de Valera that he ought to reread some of the quotations from his own speech.  He ought to mark in that speech, in the columns in his volume, the prices he was quoting then for commodities and compare those prices which he was denouncing with the prices that are there to-day for the commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am entitled to ask some Independent Deputies here to justify their action in keeping this Government in office, in the face of that cost of living, in the face of unemployment and the appalling business slump.  It is so bad that &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; is not too strong a word to attach to it.  Those <Col N="186" /> Deputies, if they cannot justify it to themselves, will have to justify it to the country.  Some of the Deputies now supporting and keeping this Government in office are the very Deputies who were denouncing us for our failure, as they alleged, to grapple with the cost of living and keep it from increasing. These are some of the matters I should like to hear discussed in this debate, and they are some of the matters which I hope will be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no case at all for the Bill and he gave no excuse for not doing this year, not to talk about last year, what he denounced his predecessors for not doing two years ago&mdash; scrapping this measure and bringing in permanent legislation.  Not only was the Minister unable to do it last year&mdash;perhaps it would have been unfair to expect him to do it last year&mdash; and not only is he unable to do it this year, but he has warned us that he will be coming back to us again, if he is in a position to do so, this time 12 months with a Bill similar to this.  How does the Minister reconcile that with his statements which I have quoted from this volume, statements which he made two years ago?  I do not see how he can reconcile it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had fears, and apparently he had, two years ago with regard to having in the hands of the then Minister for Finance these great powers in relation to exchange control, what fears ought we to have with regard to having these powers in the hands of the present Minister for Finance?  I do not think it is safe to give any power to the Minister for Finance in relation to anything.  I want to finish with the Minister for Finance by saying that if the Government are not going to get out&mdash;and they have got clear warning enough to get out&mdash; if we cannot get rid of the Government, the Government ought to be able to get rid of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not want to widen the discussion of this Bill.  It could be a very wide discussion.  We have had no explanation at all from either the Minister or any of his colleagues who want these powers continued.  We have had no case made by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance for <Col N="187" /> their continuance.  We have had references to the necessity for the Minister for Agriculture to have these powers in relation to the meat industry, cereals, feeding-stuffs and so on.  One would like a discussion on cereals this year, but probably there will be another occasion for it.</P>
    <P>Price control&mdash;the Minister is always talking about when we get stabilisation in prices.  He has been at that for a number of years and that stability has always been around the corner.  We are always near it and just about to have it&mdash;it is going to happen.  The Minister told us that many years ago, and he has been repeating it since the war ended, except during the period when he was in opposition.  He repeated it again to-day in speaking about price control measures, and we are not going to get anything new from the Minister until we get stability of prices&mdash;I think he used the term &ldquo;relative stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with building was revoked.  So it could be.  There is plenty of material available for building now and plenty of building operatives&mdash;too many&mdash;available now. There is nothing to stop building now but outside local authority building the building industry has been practically killed.  It is practically at a standstill. I heard the Minister for Finance and Deputy Briscoe a few days ago asserting that more houses were built this year than were built last year, the year before or any other year.  I questioned that and Deputy Briscoe said: &ldquo;I have the statistics.&rdquo;  I suggest to Deputy Briscoe that he might consult the building workers or some of the trade unions which cater for building operatives, whether skilled or unskilled.  He will find what the position is.</P>
    <P>There is no licence necessary now to build any size of house or building for any purpose.  Not only have we enough material&mdash;enough in the sense that we have more than there is a demand for&mdash;but, as was mentioned here and I do not intend to labour it, we have been exporting it.  We were told that the reason we were sending out in one consignment 5,000 tons of building timber was that we could buy it at a cheaper price, and hard-headed <Col N="188" /> businessmen in the Six Counties came down here to give us a higher price than either we or they could get it at on the world markets.  The fact of the matter is that the demand is not there for the timber.  The fact of the matter is that the building programme of local authorities is coming up this year to its peak before, I am afraid, it starts on the downward curve from next year onwards, but there is no doubt that, so far as private building is concerned&mdash;and Deputies ought to remember that it always exceeded building by public authorities&mdash;it is practically at a standstill.</P>
    <P>The financial situation and the credit situation have been so bedevilled here by the present Minister for Finance and his colleagues that there are to-day in this city and county alone hundreds of houses of all types and sizes, completed, ready for occupation, and the builders cannot sell them. They cannot get them off their hands. I invite Deputies to go out any road from the centre of the city into any of the suburbs and out into County Dublin and look for themselves at the hundreds of houses that are there idle, and then think of the thousands of our people who are looking for homes and cannot get them.</P>
    <P>Remember, these houses to-day are on the market at considerably less cost to the purchaser than they were available at 12 months, two, three or four years ago.  Still they cannot be sold. They cannot be sold for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, credit is restricted not merely by the banks but by the other lending bodies.  Secondly, the rate of interest has gone considerably higher on the repayments and the man who out of his salary or his wages, or his family income, could two and three years ago undertake the responsibility of repaying £2, £2 5s., £2 10s. or £3 per week to the lending body is no longer in a position to do so because of the increase in the price of all the other commodities he has to buy to enable him to live and keep his home going.  That increase is so great that the margin left, if there is any margin left, in his income or his salary or his wages is not sufficient to enable him <Col N="189" /> to undertake the responsibility of repaying an instalment for the purchase of a house.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is a single phase of our economic or our commercial activity here that is not in a considerably worse and more precarious position to-day than it ever was at any time in the past.  There is no question about that.  There are a great number of other matters that call to be dealt with under this Bill, a great many other matters that I believe it is our duty to discuss here, a great many other matters that I believe it is our duty to bring to the notice of the Government and on which to challenge the Government as to what, if anything, they propose to do in order to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking here two years ago, gave us the reasons why he was then protesting against and proposed to vote against the Supplies and Services Bill in that year.  He was very trenchant, as he can be on occasion; he was very forthright and he was very positive.  He had no doubts as to what would be done.  He had apparently no doubts as to what could be done.  Why has he changed his mind?  He has not told us why he found it impossible to do what he thought should be done in the last year and a half.  He has not said a word about the Prices Advisory Body, a body he said we established in order to cover up our own incompetence.  He has not told us whether that body is working well or whether they are working at all.  He has not told us whether he is satisfied with them, whether he proposes to give them any additional powers or functions, whether he proposes to restrict them or whether he proposes to abolish them altogether.</P>
    <P>Judging merely by what one occasionally hears in the House and what one reads in the newspapers, I think that body has fully justified itself.  I think that body has worked well.  I am perfectly satisfied that if it had not been for the establishment of that particular body the cost of living would be even higher than it is to-day.  I am satisfied that those in <Col N="190" /> whose power it is to increase prices unduly have been deterred from doing so because of the existence of that body.</P>
    <P>This Government has made this country a pretty tough place for a great many people.  It has made it much more difficult for nearly all sections of our people to live as well as they are entitled to live.  During the three and a half years we were in office we had succeeded&mdash;and I do not in the least mind anybody saying, nor will I even reject it, that we had fairly favourable conditions&mdash;in raising the standard of life here to a level to which it had never been raised before. The standard of life for every section of the community, whether engaged in agriculture, in industry, in trade, in commerce, in production or in distribution had been raised, and raised substantially, and the people were living in peace and quietness, and they were working; there were more people working, and working gainfully, than perhaps at any other period in our history.</P>
    <P>That progressive improvement in the standard of living in this country has not merely stopped since the change of Government, but has actually gone into reverse.  There can be no question about that.  The standard of living and the struggle to live is to-day a fairly acute one.  I do not care whether one is talking about unskilled or skilled workers.  I do not care whether one is talking about the ordinary labouring man, the tradesman, the shop assistant, the civil servant or the middle-class worker, for each and every one of them the struggle to live is to-day more acute and tougher, unfortunately, than it was when this Government took over from us a year and a half ago.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any hope in the minds of the people that there will be any improvement, for all the indications are that conditions will be worse. There is no question about that. People see only one hope, and that is that they will get an early opportunity of registering their views on the work of this Government since it came into office.  I think the people ought not to be denied that opportunity.  I think the Government is in duty bound&mdash;I <Col N="191" /> see Deputy Cogan is having a smile at that&mdash;to go to the country.  I ask Ministers and Deputies who challenged us for the whole three and a half years to go to the country, who challenged our right and even our authority to constitute a Government, to reflect for a moment on what authority they have now.  They had not very much authority a year and a half ago except that given to them by Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and a few others.</P>

That is the only reason.  I suggest to the Minister for Defence, who appears to be in particularly good form this morning, that he cannot, and that his colleagues cannot overlook the latest indication which they got of public feeling in regard to their policy. They cannot continue to overlook that. I am suggesting to the Government that&mdash;now that it is quite obvious that they can only continue to make the situation in the country infinitely worse than it is&mdash;they ought to get out.  They ought at least give the people a chance of saying whether they want them or not.  I do not know whether the Ministers and the Deputies on the Government side of the House have any doubt as to what the result of that would be. I have not any doubt about it.</P>

      <P>I think that rural Ireland will confirm its opinions of the <Col N="192" /> past 20 years when we go to it again. If Deputy Morrissey finds that the Opposition do better in urban areas, he is entitled to his fancy.  It is far from any desire on my part to divide the country into town and country but we know that urban populations react much more quickly to changes in the standard of living.  If they react when they get an opportunity&mdash;particularly when they know that the fate of the Government does not depend on the result&mdash;then I, for one, do not take the result very much amiss.  If the people of North-West Dublin had thought that the fate of the Government depended on their votes a week ago, I have not any doubt what the result would be.  When that issue was in the balance earlier in the year we got a result accordingly.</P>
      <P>I think it would be far better for us in this House if we were to try to assess the questions of unemployment and the cost of living in relation to world causes and influences rather than to the positive actions of either side in this House.  Deputy Morrissey said that we are now in Government because of a dishonest and untruthful ramp which we carried on when the Coalition was in office.  I think that Deputy Morrissey himself knows that he might still be in office if he and his Party, of their own volition, had not decided to leave. It is my recollection that nobody drove them out by the votes of the Dáil. They decided, for reasons of their own, to go to the country.  As far as my memory serves me, I think that at any time when there was a general election it was caused either by a defeat in the Dáil or by the fact that a term of office had expired.</P>

      <P>There was one case in 1933 when it was not exactly like that. There were four by-elections pending which, in their combined result, would be tantamount to a general election. But the Coalition decided of its own volition to go out.  I want to demonstrate that the causes which Deputy Morrissey places as being due to the positive actions of this Party are, in fact, the causes which decided them, of their own volition, to go out of office <Col N="193" /> and to seek a mandate from the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they had got a mandate from the country they would have had to do the things which we found it necessary to do in order to rehabilitate the country &mdash;things which they knew it would be necessary to do.  Let us take one example to show that the trend and the positive causes of the Korean war and similar world influences produced the situation.  We have the example of a decision, before the last Government went out of office, to increase the salaries and remuneration of public servants by several million pounds. Will it be contended here that the Government quite wantonly gave an increase of £4,000,000 without a case having been made for it in relation to the cost of living?  Let us take another particular trend.  Deputy Morrissey said that, by the positive actions of the Coalition Government, far greater employment had been found during their term of office than previously.  If one looks up the records of industrial employment since the end of the war he will find that from 1945 onwards there was a steady, progressive increase in industrial employment of 6,000 persons per year.  If anybody examines the figures in respect of the first six months of Coalition office he will find that that progress was completely wiped out.  But the momentum which had previously been created was so great and so effective that it gathered way again after the first shock of the uncertainty of Coalition policies in relation to protection and to industries.  The figures are there. The latter ones to which I have referred&mdash;the first period of the Coalition office&mdash;were, in fact, prepared by themselves.  The trend created under the long-term policies of Fianna Fáil had produced that result as soon as the worst aspects of the war were over and there was a freer flow of the things necessary to make industry hum.  The industrial drive in this country got under way again.  It was because of the adverse effect of another war that the Coalition found themselves unable to continue to subsidise an artificial standard of living. We know that they got Marshall Aid. We know that they got a certain <Col N="194" /> amount of money at home.  We know that these two sources dried up.</P>
    <P>From a politician's point of view, it is perhaps somewhat unfortunate that Fianna Fáil got the mandate in 1951. I have no doubt in my own mind that what happened was best for the country.  Let us assume, however, that the Coalition had got the mandate. after going out of office quite voluntarily and without having been defeated in the Dáil.  Causes, which they knew were inescapable, produced that decision on their part.  Let us, however, assume that they had got the mandate in 1951 and that they came back here again.  Can they demonstrate to us now how they were going to finance a standard of living such as that which Deputy Morrissey has been boasting about?  We know that they could not borrow.  How, then, was the money to be found?  They had evidence that the cost of living was rising, because of the increases which they sanctioned.  That is the situation that has been handed over to Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil, being quite realistic in the matter, is applying the only solution which would have been open to the Coalition itself if it had been returned to office.</P>

      <P>The question of the drop in the consumption of bread was a point made by Deputy Morrissey.  I read in one of the newspapers a few days ago that one firm is producing less, to the extent of 500 sacks of flour per week, than they formerly produced.  I do not know what the exact figures are but in any event I have been told that there is now no waste of bread&mdash;that the increase in the price of bread has had the good result that it has given the people a keen appreciation of the value of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like the Parliamentary Secretary to be misled <Col N="196" /> by what Deputy Morrissey stated.  The consumption of flour has gone up in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to something I had seen in the papers recently.  I should like to add, in any event, that a great many observers have told me that the wastage of bread which was formerly observable in a great many parts of the country, has been very greatly checked as a result of the increase in price and that it is not now a common sight to see half-eaten loaves of bread being cast away.  If that is so, and that the people are consuming all the bread which they buy, I take it that they have saved much more than the increased cost represents.</P>
      <P>The positive actions of either side in relation to employment and the cost of living are things which can be very controversial.  In my constituency we had a very sorry experience of positive decisions causing immediate unemployment. We had a very large exodus of bog workers from my constituency following a decision of the last Government as soon as they came into office.  That was in regard to turf production. They have denied here several times that any decision on their part brought about that result. We know ourselves quite differently in West Galway, that knowledge of the planned operations had been already communicated to administrators and supervisors, that the men had been allocated to several stations and that the recruitment of the necessary labour was under way.  As soon as the change of Government took place in 1948 that was all scrapped.  I think in view of things of that kind it would be much better for the education of the public and for the calm and proper discussion of a world-wide problem, if the cost of living and the standard of living were discussed in relation to the true cause.  If world causes produce positive decisions here by the Government in power, while I do not object to the Opposition taking whatever advantage they can of it, I think the public who will have to make up their minds when they are called upon to express an opinion will have to be told by somebody in authority what the real causes are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> I should like Deputy Mulcahy to tell us how they would have avoided, if they had come back after the 1951 General Election, either an increase in taxation or a reduction in the food subsidies or if they were going to carry on the price structure as it existed two or three years ago, how they were going to finance it?  I think it is past time that we stopped putting the dalla mullóg on the people outside or putting it on ourselves here.  If the North-West Dublin election result is now taken as an expression of the opinion of the country as a whole, I should like to point out that the expression of opinion of rural Ireland, which we got some months ago, shows a much keener and a much more realistic appreciation of the causes of the present condition in the world than any ill-informed urban opinion can be.  I do not want to emulate Deputy Mulcahy in his comment on the result of the by-elections earlier in the year but I shall say this for the rural areas: When it comes to politics and weighty problems I do say that the rural man and the rural voter gives these matters, and has an opportunity to give these questions, much more serious and much deeper thought than any urban dweller whose life sweeps along at a much faster tempo. We know that the urban dweller has a great deal more of his time taken up with amusements and entertainments which form a very large part of his life and which have not reached the rural dweller to the same extent, possibly to his good.</P>
    <P>In any event, while I did not intend to speak on this Bill, I felt that Deputy Morrissey's very artificial and unrealistic approach to it did deserve some reply from me.  If the present Government's courage can continue to be applied to the ills which afflict not only Ireland but mankind for the next three or four years, I have no doubt that the causes for the complaint and the propaganda which the Opposition now take so much advantage of, will have entirely disappeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Bartley is indebted to his imagination for the rather comforting picture which he drew to-day about the political fortunes which await the Government <Col N="198" /> if only it goes to the country.  If the Deputy had taken the trouble to add up the Government votes in the three by-elections earlier this year, and the votes in the recent by-election in Dublin, he would find that the Government is in a very comfortable minority as a result of the four by-elections, the anti-Government vote being substantially higher than the Government vote.  That, apparently, has not dawned on Deputy Bartley.  He has got some notion that there is some weapon hidden in the mind of the rural voter, and that if only he gets the chance he will show the low-down urban voter, whom the Tánaiste represents, that the rural voter is by far the superior being, and that he, somehow or other, will ensure the continuance in office of the present Government.</P>
      <P>The plain truth of the matter is that, within the last few weeks when the people were tested in North-West Dublin on what they thought of Government policy, the Government polled 30 per cent. of the votes cast, while there was a 70 per cent. non-Govern-ment vote recorded in that constituency. Deputy Bartley, by reading a horoscope, apparently imagines that represents a comforting picture.  His assurance, that on the result of that election this Government will continue in office, passes my comprehension. The person who thinks that is far too simple to be a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of any governmental responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste moved the Second Reading of this Bill to-day by making practically no recommendation for it. It seemed to me that the Tánaiste, when speaking on the Bill and recommending it to the House, was rather impeded and confused by the memory of his own speech on this Bill two years ago, because he then said that there was no need for a Bill of this kind and that what was wanted was permanent legislation.  One would imagine that, having made that declaration two years ago to the Government which was then in office, the Tánaiste would at least have given us a permanent measure, or the bones of a permanent measure, this year.  Instead, we are told to hold on, and that two <Col N="199" /> years hence we may see it.  I am not one of those people who are fussy for a permanent measure to deal with matters of this kind, especially in a fluid situation.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste ought now take the opportunity of apologising to the House for the intemperate speech which he made two years ago.  It might well be highly undesirable to have a permanent measure on matters of this kind in present circumstances.  It would be much better, in my view, to have flexible legislation capable, from time to time, of being adjusted to meet a change in circumstances rather than that we should be tied down in present circumstances with fixed legislation which would have to be amended by positive amending legislation in the House.  The situation, in my view, is such that we should still have legislation of this kind.  We need it from the Government point of view and from the point of view of the protection of the community.  It is far better, therefore, that whatever legislation we have should be of a flexible kind, capable of meeting the lights and shades of the situation, and capable of being bent in the direction required to meet particular needs.</P>
    <P>What I could not understand about the Tánaiste's speech was the low key in which it was delivered.  For a very important Bill such as this, which up to now has been made the occasion for a wide review of the nation's economy, it was offered to us to-day as if it were a Bill of no importance whatever, and as if it were dealing with routine and trivial matters.  That attitude, on the part of the Tánaiste this year, is all the more incomprehensible when we know the profound changes which have taken place in the whole economic structure over the past 18 months.  The year 1952 will not be remembered as a pleasant year by the Irish people because, during that year, they have seen on the one hand, prices rise, and on the other a very substantial rise in unemployment. Emigration has increased.  The year 1952 will be noted for that.  That is the way in which 1952 will be card dexed&mdash;rising unemployment, rising <Col N="200" /> prices and rising emigration.  Yet we are offered a Bill of this kind with not a single reference made to unemployment or to emigration, and with practically no reference to the rise in prices, except some embroidery references to the mechanics of the bakery industry.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the Tánaiste would have availed of this opportunity to survey the whole economic situation and to give us some picture of the situation we are now in, as seen by him, and into what situation we are likely to move.  The position to-day of the ordinary man in the street is that it is harder for him to buy the food which he and his family need, that it is harder for him to get a job and that it is harder for him to keep a job.  These are plain facts.  Everybody who is not just cabined on a main road knows perfectly well that is the situation in the country to-day: that it is harder to buy food and harder to get a job or keep a job than ever it has been.</P>
    <P>That situation has been brought about by the fact that, for the last 17 months, this Government has been purveying gloom, despair and misery all over this country.  The recent loan, which was got at 5 per cent., could have been got last year at not more than 4 per cent. if this Government had gone to the country last year and looked for a loan from the people. Instead of doing that, a few specialist members of the Government, specialists in misrepresentation, were let loose on the country to tell the people that the end of the motherland was close at hand and was going to come down, notwithstanding her long struggle, in an abyss of poverty and bankruptcy.  It could not keep doing a thing like that without it having its repercussions on the economy of the country.  The specialists who were selected for that miserable and despicable task have been able to get for the nation dividends in despair, in unemployment and in high prices.  Every time the Minister for Finance delivered an address at one of these functions there was a fog of gloom and despair the next day.  He succeeded in running the country into bankruptcy every night he went out to a dinner, while <Col N="201" /> every time the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spoke you got the impression that we were now just over the abyss, and that it was only a matter of minutes until we tumbled in.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste knows well, and this must be said to his credit, that he endeavoured to put a face on the mischievous and unjustifiable speeches of some of his embarrassing colleagues. The gloomy prognostications made by certain Ministers as to where we were heading brought about a situation in which people were cagey about investing money, cagey about developing their industries, cagey about buying houses and cagey about undertaking these or other worthwhile works, because they foolishly believed that these Ministers were in any way competent to analyse the economic and social situation or capable of surveying the nation's problems as they existed at that time.</P>
    <P>We sowed the wind of despair among the people and we are now reaping the whirlwind to the discomfiture of the people.  Let us look at the cost of living, for example.  Deputy Bartley stated to-day that we ought to look at this against the background of the economic causes and when he searched for the causes he found the Korean War, which he said went against the Americans.  When that happened is not yet clear to anybody else.  But we had Deputy Bartley knowing that the Korean War went against the Americans and the Minister for Finance recently announcing the secret intentions of the President-elect of America, General Eisenhower, when he indicated, as the Tanáiste will remember in Manor Street&mdash;a suitable place for the Minister for Finance&mdash;that he had good reason to believe that General Eisenhower was going to get tough with the Russians and we would all be precipitated into the cauldron of war. These were the profound announcements of these two specialists of the Government, Deputy Bartley and the Minister for Finance, who announced behind the backs of the American people that General Eisenhower was going to get tough with the Russians, but at least there was one consoling thought for the Irish people&mdash;that Deputy MacEntee was the Minister for <Col N="202" /> Finance and everybody could go to bed feeling that his imperturbable granite spirit would save the people from any catastrophe they might be faced with as a consequence of General Eisenhower deciding to get tough with the Russians.  That kind of play-acting is all right in a third-class circus or in a small concert-hall in which there has not been a concert for a long time, but it does not make sense for members of the Government to be speaking in these terms.</P>
    <P>I remember during the last election in 1951 seeing a leaflet in my constituency purporting to say that the inter-Party Government said that the Korean War had caused a rise in prices but that, in fact, the Korean War had nothing to do with prices at all, that it was really the incompetence of the inter-Party Government that brought about the rise in prices.  That leaflet was issued by the Fianna Fáil headquarters and I would be glad to make a copy of it available to the Tánaiste if he wants to see it.  That was the Fianna Fáil view in 1951.  In 1952, Deputy Bartley comes along and states that the Korean War was the cause of these price increases.  But, somehow or other, the Koreans managed to persuade us to slash the subsidies on tea, sugar, butter, bread and flour.  It is as a consequence of the evil eye which they threw upon us that our people now have to pay higher prices for these commodities.  Is not all that clap-trap and make-believe which nobody believes?</P>
    <P>What happened to prices in this country for the past 18 months and particularly the past six months?  In February, 1951, the cost-of-living index figure as recorded by an index devised by this Government was 102.  That was the last known index figure before the last Government went to the country. The Tánaiste should not take a bet now in challenging that statement of mine as otherwise he will pay heavily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. The cost-of-living index figure in February, 1951, was 102.  It is now 122, notwithstanding the fact that the present index figure does not make any allowance for the substantial increase in the price of cigarettes, tobacco and beer which took place under the recent Budget.  In other words, the cost of living has increased by approximately 20 per cent. over the past 18 months.  If the Minister had dealt with it in his speech instead of trying to interrupt me, we would have the Minister's view as to the way the index figure was moving; but the Minister, knowing that the cost-of-living index figure is as comfortable to him as a hot griddle is to a hot hen, kept off it and made no reference to it when discussing the matter to-day.  The plain fact is that the index figure, which was 102 in February, 1951, has now moved to 122, notwithstanding the fact that no allowance was made for the increased cost of beer, tobacco and cigarettes.  Everybody knows the extent to which these enter into the ordinary day-to-day expenditure of the people.</P>
      <P>That is the situation that the people have to face; that is the situation the people are up against.  Notwithstanding that substantial increase of 20 per cent. in the last 18 months, we had not a single word from the Tánaiste about the cost of living or the cost-of-living index figure during the course of his speech to-day.  The fact is that the increase in prices, particularly the increase in prices which took place as from July last in consequence of the slashing of the food subsidies, has inflicted a crushing burden on the workers in particular, and on all those who have to live on fixed incomes.  It may be said that certain classes of workers have secured a wages increase since then.  But the notorious fact is that the wages increase does not meet the substantial rise which has taken place in the cost of living and only partially and very inadequately compensates them for the rise which has taken place even by the slashing of the food subsidies alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> It is obvious to everybody who cares to admit it that there has been a recession in trade in the past six months in particular.  Anybody who goes into a draper's shop and asks the proprietor or an assistant how things are will be told very promptly that business is in the doldrums; anybody who goes into a food shop will get the same answer.  All that is due to the fact that the people, having now less money owing to the increased cost of living, are not able to buy now what they were able to buy two years ago, due to one reason, the insecurity created by Government speeches, allied with the fact that the rise in prices left the people with less money with which to purchase commodities.</P>
    <P>We had no reference from the Minister to unemployment.  Deputy Bartley has some kind of notion that employment is much better than it was 18 months or two years ago.  There is no need to draw on our imagination in regard to this.  We can quote the figures issued by the Government.  The latest return issued by the Central Statistics Office shows that there are 10,500 persons more registered as unemployed to-day as compared with this day 12 months; in other words, unemployment is up by 10,500 compared with 12 months ago.  But do not let us stop there.  Let us look at the figure for last November and compare it with the figure for the previous November and we find that even during that period, due largely to the advent of this Government to office, there was a substantial rise in the unemployment figures for the second half of 1951.  These are the figures issued by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>You do not have to speculate on the situation.  Here are facts, here are figures available for everyone to read. Of course, an old politician or rather a veteran politician like the Minister knew perfectly well that this was inconvenient material for him and, consequently, he deliberately eschewed it in the speech he made here to-day. The naked fact remains, however, that if you compare this November with last November you find that there are 10,500 more unemployed people. The situation is worse, because the <Col N="205" /> Government figures issued each week, to prove the accuracy of their statements, show that that figure is not going down, but is going up and up, and once you get over the seasonal spurt in employment for Christmas you will find that the figures will rise again in February and March.  Yet we had from the Minister in his speech to-day not one single word of what he thought of that situation or of what plans the Government have to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Even these unemployment figures, depressing as they are, indicative of widespread poverty and misery as they are, do not reveal the full picture in the field of unemployment.  A large number of workers are at present working part time, are under-employed or are being laid off because of slackness of work in their places of employment. They do not register at the employment exchange unless they are likely to get benefit, and where they do not benefit they do not register at all, and, therefore, do not come into the picture in the figures I have quoted.  They represent, however, a very substantial number of our people who are getting less employment than they got two years ago.</P>
    <P>If emigration had even stopped or had remained at the previous figure you might try to draw some comfort from these figures bad and all as they are.  But whereas we took 5,000 more people into the Army during the last 18 months, notwithstanding that the emigration figures are up by 50 per cent. compared with 1950.  Notwithstanding the siphoning off of the employment market of unemployed persons by recruitment to the Army and by emigration we still have 10,500 more people unemployed than in November, 1951.  These figures cannot be gainsaid by the Minister.  I would like to know from him&mdash;and I think that he should take advantage of the opportunity to tell us&mdash;what the Government's plans are to deal with the situation.  Are we just to sit quietly by and wait for more prophecies from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture or more prophecies from the Minister for Finance?  Are we just to wait and see <Col N="206" /> what happens or are we to be told by the Minister what the Government's plans are to deal with a situation in which unemployment is rapidly mounting and mounting in spite of the fact that we are exporting more and more human beings every week and every month, and in spite of the fact that we have siphoned off artificially 5,000 men from the employment market by recruitment to the Army?</P>
    <P>It was rather ironic to think while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture was talking that this morning Deputies received by post from the Central Statistics Office a document described as the Industrial Analysis of the Live Register at mid-October, 1952.  Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary does not read this document but someone should compel him to do a little homework on it to keep him away from fancy and lofty flights of fancy.  This document does not make comparisons over long periods in some fields but it takes yearly periods in other fields.  The document is dated 18th October and it shows that between 13th September, 1952, and 18th October, 1952, a matter of less than five weeks, the number of unemployed increased by 3,330.  There is an examination of all the occupations in which the numbers employed increased or decreased but the over-all picture shows that in five weeks the number of unemployed increased by 3,330.</P>
    <P>If you look at the picture on 18th October, 1952, and compare it with the figures operative for 13th October, 1951, a matter of 12 months, you find that the number of unemployed increased by 8,147.  These are official figures which cannot be controverted. They represent an impersonal examination of the whole problem by the Central Statistics Office.  On the front page of this document a rather general observation is made as to what caused the increases in unemployment.  We are told that over 1,000 workers employed on the construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, etc., lost their employment during the month due to the termination of certain schemes, registrations for sugar beet campaign, and decreased activity in turf work.  We are told that 596 people lost their jobs in general building construction and <Col N="207" /> repair work due to a slump in the building and allied trades.  Five hundred people lost their employment in hotels and restaurants due to a seasonal slump.  Two hundred people lost their jobs at docks and harbours due to a slump in dockside employment. Is this all not conclusive evidence that the employment situation is rapidly deteriorating?  We should, therefore, have from the Government some indication of what it proposes to do.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Morrissey to the building trade.  Now for the first time in five years the building trade worker is packing his bag and emigrating again.  He has not been emigrating for the past five years.  We engaged in efforts to bring him back into this country to do the housebuilding that remained.  The housebuilding worker is not getting the employment he got five years ago.  Employment has sagged and is continuing to sag.</P>
    <P>The worker is packing his bag and leaving on the emigrant ship for places where he will get regular employment.  Nobody will attempt to question the fact that there has been a slump in private building.  The Federated Union of Building Employers have not only acknowledged that fact but have said that many of those engaged in that business were forced to seek the protection of the courts because their indebtedness in respect of their activities was beyond their capacity to meet.  We have yet another example of the slump in the building trade due to the Government action in paying 5 per cent. on the recent loan while loans under the Small Dwellings Act are now carrying substantially increased interest charges and a larger number of people who could and would have bought their houses under the previous rate of interest have been compelled to abandon their earlier intentions with the result that there is less demand for houses, less employment for building trade workers and consequent unemployment in all the areas where employment is generated by the building of a new house in this country.</P>
    <P>I think we have taken the quickest <Col N="208" /> possible step to kill building by private enterprise in the country because the present interest charges are beyond the capacity of the lower and middle-income groups to pay.  They will not be able to pay the present charges under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act for the purchase of houses.  That will inevitably result in a falling off in the demand for houses and, consequently, in the building of houses.  By our action in increasing the rates of interest under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, we have done a great deal in a short time by that one move to kill private housebuilding for the lower and middle-income groups for whom, let it be known clearly, the local authorities will not provide houses at all.</P>
    <P>Not only have we succeeded in taking a substantial step towards killing private housebuilding but, by increasing the interest charges, we have also said to the local authorities: &ldquo;You will pay more money for whatever sums of money you borrow for housebuilding in the future, and as a result of that you will be compelled to charge higher rents for the houses which you build for the accommodation of those who are not able to provide houses for themselves.&rdquo;  We have not, therefore, merely kicked the private housebuilder out of the market and kicked out of the market the potential house purchaser, but even in respect of the local authorities we have said to them: &ldquo;If you borrow money in the future to build houses for people who need them in your area you will have to pay higher interest charges and, therefore, you will have to charge higher rents as well.&rdquo;  That is the situation which confronts every local authority in the country to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the prices of bread and flour and made what I thought was one slick reference to the fact that what he did recently was in conformity with what was done by the previous Government in 1948 and 1951.  I am quite sure it was an accident on the Minister's part&mdash;not done by design&mdash;that he omitted to mention, of course, that there was no Prices Tribunal in 1948 and there was no Prices Tribunal functioning in 1951. Therefore the previous Government <Col N="209" /> could not have referred the matter to a prices tribunal.  But the Minister had a prices tribunal available to him; nevertheless, he did not avail of the opportunity of asking the tribunal to examine the matter, and I did not know that there was such urgency about the situation that it would not have stood an examination by the Prices Tribunal.  It may well be that in some of these cases an increase in wages may necessitate an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>To the extent that that is true and even to the extent that it is incontestable it is all the more reason why the case should be publicly examined, because not merely have we to endeavour to control prices and keep prices at the steadiest level possible, but we must also allow the public to understand all the factors which go into price movements and which have a bearing on whatever the price level is at a particular time.  The more necessary it is for an increase in price to be authorised, the more necessary it is that the case should be heard publicly so that the public will know the facts and not need to have them extracted by means of parliamentary questions which get cagey answers and which, in any case, never convey adequately to the public the same picture as a public hearing can convey, where you get a case made for an increase and a case against it, and intelligent people have got to make up their minds where the merits lie.</P>
    <P>I know of no reason why the Minister should not have referred that matter to the Prices Tribunal.  He did not attempt to give any reason himself. He sought solace in the fact that something similar had been done by his predecessor on a previous occasion.  As I say, he omitted to tell the House and the public that his predecessor had no prices tribunal available to him at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that, and if he has got some advice on it, I will accept his word, but I definitely recollect, at the time when this matter was raised, there was, in the first instance at all events&mdash;whatever the final stage was&mdash;when these particular negotiations took place and when the bakers' union raised the question of increased charges or wanting to know would the master bakers get an increased subsidy, there was certainly no prices tribunal in the city then.  I doubt if there had been any tribunal in existence at the time the bakers went to the Labour Court or when they had the first negotiations out of which the increased prices of bread arose in 1951.  However, I will take the trouble of checking that afterwards.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Minister said he has a good case for what he did.  If that is so, he ought to send the case to the tribunal for examination, and say: &ldquo;Examine that; see what you think of the merits; give me a report and, based on your impartial examination, I will judge what the situation is.&rdquo;  But the Minister did not do that, although it was a very obvious step for him to have taken.  He never gave us any explanation to-day as to why he did not take what was so obvious a step for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this feeling&mdash;and I think the Minister cannot be unaware of it &mdash;that a number of big miller bakers who have installed the latest type of baking equipment are getting away with very substantial profits.  Some of these machines which have been installed do not involve human labour at all.  The whole of the dough-mixing is done by machinery.  The ingredients are passed right through the machine and come out the other end without being touched by human hands at all. That firm is getting for its bread the same price as a firm which has got to make that bread by what you might describe as old-fashioned methods. There is a general feeling that the miller baker in this city, in particular, <Col N="211" /> is doing well.  He is doing very well, and there was no need to give him an increase in prices to compensate for the rise in his wage costs, because in these firms&mdash;bear this in mind, it will be confirmed by the bakers' union &mdash;the tendency is to pay off more and more bakers, because the new machine is doing what the hand operative formerly did.  In 1951 one of these miller baker firms&mdash;I remember, because I used the argument at the time during some discussion&mdash;was selling its bread 50 miles from Dublin for a farthing a loaf cheaper than it was selling the same bread in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are selling it now over 100 miles from town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, this firm, which was charging a certain price, let us say 6d. or 6¼d. in Dublin, was loading that bread in motor vehicles and taking it down as far as Athy and as far as Portlaoise and selling it there, after that long journey, at a farthing less than it was charging for the same loaf in Dublin. To give a firm like that an extra farthing in those circumstances, when it is able to compete on such advantageous terms with local bakeries, seems to me to be trowelling it on as far as these miller bakers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that the rate of profit on their sale is so much.  The plain fact of the matter is that everybody knows the miller bakers are doing well.  The developments which they have made in their own businesses show perfectly well that they do not believe the Minister for Finance's prognostications of gloom and of bankruptcy.  What they have done is there for everybody to see.  Two bakeries in particular can be seen and notice taken of their architectural developments over the past couple of years.  We must be satisfied, dealing with a commodity such as bread, that these firms are not getting more than their fair profit from these transactions, but how can we when the whole question of bread prices is examined privately in the Department <Col N="212" /> of Industry and Commerce, in the prices section, for which I have no great admiration as to its methods?  Instead of having this private examination we ought to have referred the whole matter to the Prices Tribunal.  I suppose the Minister is not unaware of the fact that it is alleged&mdash;I do not subscribe to the view; I think it was a bad blunder on the part of the Minister not to refer the whole question to the Prices Tribunal&mdash;that it would be embarrassing to the Government if the profits of the miller bakers were brought out at the Prices Tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was far more embarrassing to the Government that the price of bread went up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it was.  I thought your normal sagacity deserted you on this occasion when you made the decision yourself instead of being fortified, particularly if you had a good case, by a report from the Prices Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that need have worried you very much because in Limerick the bakers are waiting six months and are getting no increase in pay but the public are paying an extra price for the bread. Patience is not a virtue unknown to bakers, judging by the Limerick experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does. I think it supports your argument for keeping small bakeries, perhaps, whose methods are not generally adopted in the modern bakery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the bakers said: &ldquo;We will increase the wages provided we get authority to increase the price of bread.&rdquo;  Therefore, postponement of the increase in the price of bread would involve postponement of the payment of increased wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would. <Col N="213" /> The last increase which we permitted the master bakers to make in the price of bread was given to them in circumstances that did not make us darlings of the master bakers because we insisted that they should pay the increased wages retrospectively to the 1st January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most unreasonable proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To make an employer pay increased wages retrospectively when he cannot increase prices retrospectively is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view was that the increase he was being permitted was capable of meeting both the current and the retrospective charge, something like the device you resorted to recently in connection with the insurance premiums on motor-cars.</P>
      <P>There is a general view that this matter ought to be examined by the Prices Tribunal, that the miller bakers' profits ought to be examined by the Prices Tribunal and that the public ought to be assured by the tribunal that so far as miller bakers are concerned they are not getting an undue profit from the community.</P>
      <P>A close examination of the Lavery Report will show that it is not too easy to ascertain what profits millers and miller bakers make but I think there is a confession somewhere in the report about the difficulties in ascertaining precisely what the profits were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to move on to the question of the Prices Tribunal generally.  That was a good body if it had been used in the way that it was first intended, namely, that it should be a watchdog for the community, that it should supervise carefully every application for an increase in prices and that anybody who wanted an increase in price should be compelled to get into the queue and go to the Prices Tribunal and make his case there, in the same way as the ordinary worker has to make application in public before the Labour Court for an increase in wages. There could be situations where somebody has to buy forward when other <Col N="214" /> methods would have to be adopted. There was nothing to prevent a competent tribunal from devising ways and means of dealing with situations of that kind.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the Minister wants to strangle the Prices Tribunal, although he is afraid of the political howl which would follow any such course.  If the Minister's intentions were known, I am sure there is political murder in his heart so far as the Prices Tribunal is concerned.  He would love to strangle it but he does not want the howl which would inevitably arise if he were to do so.  It has nearly been strangled. It is not consulted as it ought to be on questions of price increases.  It is quite clear that its stature and prestige to-day are shadows of what they were 16 months ago.  That is because the Minister does not like the tribunal.  He gave utterance to unkind words about it when it was first set up and anything that he has said since has not indicated that his first views have changed.  His dearest ambition would be to strangle the tribunal and get rid of it because he does not like it but he does not want to meet the political odium and risks involved in destroying the Prices Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am an unrepentant believer in the Prices Tribunal.  The public are entitled to a watchdog such as this. One of the best things that could be done from the public point of view is the restoration of the Prices Tribunal to the position and importance which it previously enjoyed.  It should be given a vital function to discharge in the matter of supervising price levels and examining claims for increased prices.  That ought to be done in public in every case except where trade secrets are being discussed, if they are ever discussed in that context. The Prices Tribunal could be a very useful body if it were permitted to function and encouraged to be vigilant in every possible way.  Its function should be to lean towards the public and to give the public the benefit of doubt in any case where it feels that the case for an increase has not been fully established.</P>
    <P>There ought to be public examination <Col N="215" /> of all these cases to let the public know what is happening, to educate them in the factors that enter into price control and price regulation and generally to enable the community to understand that the State is functioning as vigilantly as possible on their behalf in the matter of endeavouring to control prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley made one statement about turf production.  He alleged that the previous Government killed hand-won turf production.  That is a falsehood, Sir.  That statement has been made repeatedly and denied every time it has been made.  I put this challenge on record now to Deputy Bartley: Will he examine the files in the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with the hand-won turf production and look at an Order which was made at a conference between the Minister and the officials on, I think, one day in February, 1948, in which it was declared quite clearly in the minute that was made that the Government proposed to abandon hand-won turf production?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision related clearly and specifically to the hand-won turf production through hostels in County Kildare, not to the county council schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried to get the document, in any case, and put it on record.  I do not know whether it has ever been put on record.  We tried to get that document and put it on record and let everyone judge, but the Minister knows that Deputy Bartley was taking leave of normal senses, that he pretended he knew what the situation was.  The Minister could have told him, if he wished, that he was on dangerous ground by getting back on to hand-won turf production, that in fact the present Government had decided to jettison hand-won turf production in 1948 on the scale then contemplated and previously in existence.  I hope that, when he is replying, we will hear some case from the Minister for the legislation which he has asked the House to pass.  He has given us a completely fragmentary picture, if I <Col N="216" /> may use such a paradoxical expression, of the economic situation.  We are as wise now as when he started.  I would prefer to hear the explanation from the Minister rather than from his embarrassing collegue, the Minister for Finance, as I think it would be more realistic from the Minister.  I hope that he will tell us what he thinks of the situation existing in respect of matters which have been raised already and others which will be raised during the remainder of the discussion on this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>I usually listen with rapt attention to any utterances from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but straight away I must confess I was very gravely disappointed this morning, and the high opinion I had formed fell completely to the ground.  In introducing the Bill, he confined himself solely to one particular aspect, the flour question.  I was surprised to hear him say that the Minister for Finance still exercises control under emergency powers on many of the matters appertaining to this Bill.  One would think that the emergency having passed over us seven years ago there would be no necessity to have the Minister for Finance exercising those powers now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many points to which one would like to refer on a matter like this.  I understand that under the Supplies and Services Bill one can touch on practically the whole sphere of governmental control.  I think it can be made perfectly clear&mdash;as I have no doubt the members on the Government side now realise&mdash;that this little land of ours has never passed through a more distressing period than that through which it has passed during the past year and a half.  I well remember that when the inter-Party Government were in power, this particular debate continued for three whole weeks&mdash;starting, I think, on the 23rd November, 1950, and finishing on the 13th December.  It was indelibly impressed on my mind that what we had from the Opposition in those days was one long howl on one specific subject, the cost of living.  I remember here one day Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke for about three hours and there was not an article essential <Col N="217" /> in any Irish household but he had the price of it.  He emphasised the whole way through the increase in price in those commodities from the time Fianna Fáil left office.  It would be interesting to compare those prices of November, 1950, with those of November, 1952.</P>
    <P>One does not want to rub it in, but I think it is essential to impress on those who are now in authority and responsible for the control of Government, and to the country, the terrific increase in the cost of living over the last year and a half.  Nobody but a rabid political supporter would deny that during the three and a half years of office of the Government so ably led by Deputy Costello, we never had more peace and tranquillity amongst the people.  What do we find around us to-day?  There is a general restlessness, there is an uneasiness amongst every section of the community, large and small, and all are weighed down under a load that most people find it wellnigh impossible to bear.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of supplies and services I suppose that trade would be really the main item concerned.  In Ireland at the present time we have the supplies and we have the services, but we have not the trade.  Ask any businessman in the country how his trade compares with that of one and a half or two or three years ago and he will tell you there is no comparison.  I do not mind what trade it is&mdash;whether it is the licensed, drapery, grocery, any branch of trade or any shop on the side of the street in any part of the country. If you ask how business is, you get the reply: &ldquo;Rotten.&rdquo;  You ask yourself then what the cause is.</P>

      <P>You know there is something definitely responsible for it. There is a cancer eating into the business community and people living on the side of the street find it practically impossible to make ends meet.  I am closely in touch with many of such people throughout my constituency in East Cork and in my wanderings round the constituency I call in to see these people and I make inquiries.  Inevitably, I am informed that business is <Col N="218" /> very slack and that if it continues people will have to let some employees go.</P>

      <P>In the case of trade you naturally must go first to the source of supply.  The mills of Ireland are able to give us all the people want but as the demand is not there, there are repercussions in the productivity of various mills throughout the country. I am aware that all over Cork, of which our distinguished Lord Mayor is in the House at the moment, there is growing unemployment.  I have never seen in the last five or ten years, when passing along George's Quay, more people queued up at the unemployment office than I see to-day. That is a very serious matter and should concern us all and should be above politics.  This country belongs to every one of us and it should be our bounden duty to ensure as far as we can that unemployment does not exist for a day longer than anyone would wish it to last.  I feel that the recession in trade over the last year or two has been due to a considerable extent to the gloomy speeches made here when the present Government took office. People throughout the country naturally take a very keen interest in the utterances of responsible Ministers. I feel that the utterances of some, not all, of the Ministers at present in the Government have been responsible for the first slide into that abyss of depression which has taken place over the last couple of years.  The people were frightened and they stopped buying.  When the ordinary man in the street ceases to buy, naturally that has its reactions on the mills.  The people were absolutely frightened when it was stated by Ministers that we were on the brink of a financial crisis. As an ordinary Deputy I think we are considerably removed from that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself do not like to preach gloom but, peering into the future, I would say that people will find it very hard to make ends meet if things continue as they are.  Almost all our factories <Col N="219" /> are on short time.  That is a very serious matter.  Another thing which has been responsible for the present state of affairs is that credit has been completely tightened up.  Most people in business or in the professions have to lean on the banks occasionally.  In view of the fact that the banks were squeezing the people became frightened.  People who are quite competent and solvent find it hard at times to meet the &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; that the banks put on them.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Norton commenting very severely on the great slump in the building trade.  I think that is true. No one will deny that private building at the moment is at a standstill and will be in my opinion for a considerable time to come.  Nobody is undertaking any building schemes at the present time except local authorities.</P>
    <P>I live quite convenient to the labour exchange in my own town where men get forms when they are laid off work. Being the nearest public man, they come to me to have those forms signed and for the last three or four months I have signed forms for more men in respect of whom I have never had to sign a form before.  These men have told me that they were left off work owing to slackness.  That is serious. When passing down to Cork, one hears nothing but the cry: &ldquo;Strike on here&rdquo; outside certain establishments.  That is to be regretted in a country where so many bodies have been formed to discuss disputes between employers and labour.  We must ask ourselves what is the cause of that.  &ldquo;Strike on here&rdquo; means that the employers and employees cannot have come to any agreement and are just fighting it out.  That is a rather sad thing.</P>
    <P>Coming into contact, as I do, with these working men, I know that they do not want to go on strike.  Nobody wants to go on strike unless he has a really definite grievance.  What is the cause of that grievance?  Employers say they cannot pay more workers owing to the economic pressure on them as a result of the increase in the cost of living.  Nobody will deny that the primary factors in the ordinary household <Col N="220" /> of an Irish working man are bread, butter, tea and sugar.  They may at times have other things but the staple food of the working men and women of this country is bread, butter, tea and sugar.</P>
    <P>Men do not go on strike unless economic pressure forces them to do so. A man when he receives his weekly pay packet of £6 or £7 a week comes home and passes it on to the housewife in order to buy the necessaries of life for himself, his wife and family.  If she finds that the pay packet is unable to meet the demands on her, due to the very steep increase in the cost of living over the past six or eight months, she becomes dissatisfied.  The husband becomes restless and grumpy when he sees that as a result of the work he is giving in his job he is not getting an adequate return to meet his demands. His employers cannot afford to give him more for the simple reason that trade is slack and business is bad.  It is too horrible to contemplate what such conditions might breed.  I leave that to the imagination of the Minister who controls the Department at the moment.</P>
    <P>My own opinion is that the cause of all the trouble started in a major way with the severe impositions of the last Budget.  The subsidies were slashed and the Government stated it was necessary.  We on this side of the House maintain that it was unnecessary. Let the blame rest on the Government who were responsible for the slashing of the subsidies, increasing in price every commodity that is necessary for the Irish household to-day.</P>
    <P>The 2 lb. loaf means a lot to a man, his wife and family of five children with an income of £6 per week.  The price of the 2lb. loaf was increased from 6½d. to 9d.  Flour went up to 4/8 per stone.  Butter increased from 3/- to 3/10 and tea at the subsidised price of 2/8 is going to any price.  It is costing the ordinary man in the street 5/- to 6/- a lb.  Those demands on a man's income are bound to cost him anything from 25/- to 35/- per week and that is a very severe strain on the head of a house.  It makes a man restless, as I said, and it makes the woman who has <Col N="221" /> to look after the house discontented and breeds in a home that has been otherwise happy a form of discontent which passes on to the children.</P>
    <P>Flour is about the only subject the Minister touched upon.  In Ireland we have some of the finest bakeries in the world.  I noticed that the Minister and other speakers referred to the fact that at the present time the future of the ordinary operative baker is a very ominous one.  We have in many towns in the South of Ireland at the moment bread being delivered 48, 50 and 60 miles away.  If I may say so, the day of the operative bakers in these particular towns is over.  Bread is baked by machinery.  No hand touches it and it is delivered to towns such as Waterford, Dungarvan, Youghal and right up to Kilkenny. This is causing considerable unemployment in the bakery trade.</P>
    <P>As we all know, bakers must serve their time and spend a long time, six or seven years, to qualify as a firsthand baker.  It seems to me a terrible thing that in this age these men who spent their lives in their profession are to be thrown again on the unemployment list due to machine-made bread. Nobody wants to see that but it is happening.  I understand that at the moment there is a big combine in Waterford with money to burn supplying bread right up to Dungarvan and Youghal.  Deputy Crotty, who is a baker himself, tells me that they supply towns right up to Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I detest combines for the simple reason that no small man living on the side of the street has a snowball's chance in Hades of making a living if he finds himself up against a combine.  Deputies on all sides of this House have spoken on many occasions about doing everything possible for the poorer sections of our community but I feel that we should not allow a combine in the bakery business with unlimited wealth behind it to instal machinery which, in every town throughout the South of Ireland, is throwing out of employment bakers who have given 25, 30 and 40 years to their trade.</P>

      <P>It is your baby and not mine at the moment, but if we were in charge we would do something to stop it.  I should be sorry to be under the Deputy as Lord Mayor of Cork in the corporation.  Nobody will deny that there is not the same atmosphere of contentment in this country as was there during the three and a half years the inter-Party Government were in power.  Those of us who have fought elections and fought them hard for the right to speak for the people can well remember the slogan plastered on the walls of various constituencies: &ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil&mdash;the poor man's Government.&rdquo;  During the past year and a half they have shown their solicitude for the poor because it is on the poor that this burden falls more heavily than on any other section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary man, the man living in <Col N="223" /> the lane or on the byroad, is feeling the pinch to-day as he never felt it before, and finds it harder than ever to make ends meet.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture spoke about North-West Dublin and said it was a city area.  If my memory serves me, it was the city areas which put most of the present Government in at the last election and it certainly looks ominous for the Government if they go to the cities or towns in future because there was never more unemployment than there is at present and people were never as dissatisfied as they are at present.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed by the Minister's statement.  He is a man to whom I always listen with rapt attention and I pay serious heed to what he, as second in command of the Government, says, but, for once in my life, I was disappointed.  His usual cogency was sadly lacking and there was not the usual clarity about his points.  He confined himself to the one subject of flour and never touched on the cost of living, the slump in various trades and the very serious recession in the building trade, which has resulted in people being asked to sign forms in connection with unemployment for men who were never unemployed before.  I suggest that the Minister, who is a competent man, if not the most competent in the Government, should pay very serious attention to what has been said by speakers on this side.</P>
    <P>We do not get up here merely to pour out depression and gloom.  We speak our minds out frankly and fairly. We have nothing to gain by being depressed, but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that this country at the moment is suffering from a wave of depression which I have never seen before, in a fairly lengthy experience. If things continue as they are going, there will be many more on the unemployed list.  None of us desires that and it is up to the Government to take steps to come to grips with the position. I hope they will do so.  They need to do so, or they will be out of office very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose <Col N="224" /> of the introduction of this Bill is to continue the controls which were found necessary in regard to supplies, prices, imports and exports during the war period.  Opposition Deputies have suggested that the Minister should at this stage have brought in permanent legislation to deal with these matters, but I think it is clear that, in view of the multiplicity of Orders dealing with prices, imports, exports and other restrictions which were found necessary during the emergency, it would be an impossibly difficult task to deal with them at present with fluctuations in prices and supplies as they are.  The Minister's desire, and I am sure everybody will agree with it, is that permanent legislation should not be introduced until such time as there is at least foreseeable stability in relation to these matters.  He has said on a number of occasions recently that such stability is approaching, and I think it has been fairly well established that, in respect of some commodities, stability has been reached and the diminution in the number of Orders under the provisions of this Act is an indication that some stability has been reached.</P>
      <P>This Bill naturally gives an opportunity for the discussion of the cost of living.  The Government when in opposition took advantage of it for that purpose and I do not think we have anything to apologise for in making our contributions at that time such as to bring the performance of the Government of the day in relation to their promises under survey.  The point made in these debates two and three years ago was that, in relation to the promises made, the Government had failed miserably with regard to the cost of living and that is an assertion I am still prepared to make.</P>
      <P>The members of the Government and the members of the Party have stated frequently that the cost of living is a matter over which no Government of its own volition has full control. International circumstances have more than a major part to play in the cost-of-living index figure in any country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Morrissey give expression to these sentiments on a public occasion shortly before he left <Col N="225" /> office.  Apparently he then realised, due to his experience in the Department of Industry and Commerce during the two and a half or three years in which he occupied the office of Minister there that, apart altogether from the controls and restrictions that he, as Minister, was able to effect there were international circumstances over which he had no control whatsoever.  That is the position to-day.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to deny that the reduction in&mdash;not the withdrawal of&mdash; the food subsidies under the last Budget has had an effect on the cost of essential foodstuffs in the ordinary household and therefore on the cost of living not only to the housewife but to the community as a whole.  It is worth while recording, however, that statistics show, and statistics are the only things which give us a reasonable guide to trends in commerce, trade, the cost of living and so forth, that in the last three or four months of the inter-Party Government's term of office the increase in the cost-of-living index figure was almost exactly the same as the increase in the cost-of-living index figure as a result of the reduction in food subsidies.  That fact is recorded in our up-to-date statistics.</P>
    <P>It must be assumed, therefore, that these essential commodities taken as a basis for computing the cost-of-living index figure increased in price as much during the last few months of the inter-Party Government's term of office as they did as a result of the reduction in food subsidies.  That fact cannot be gainsaid.</P>
    <P>The Opposition is quite entitled to take full advantage of every opportunity that Government policy or changes in Government policy offer in debate here and elsewhere.  The trouble about that, however, is that they take too much advantage.  When they get a platform as a result of Government policy they pound that platform until there is scarcely a single plank left beneath their own feet. The Opposition did that in relation to the Budget.  To put it crudely, they flogged their advantage to death until not only they but the people outside got thoroughly fed up with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> Everybody admits that the cost of living is now at a level at which nobody would desire to see it maintained. I would, however, like to demonstrate that we are in a relatively good position in comparison with the position in other countries.  I think nobody in this enlightened age will even attempt to suggest that we can so isolate ourselves from or so insulate ourselves against world conditions as to keep our cost of living at a more attractive level than obtains elsewhere. Anybody who has travelled in recent years, and particularly within the last few months, must appreciate that the cost of living here is lower and the standard of living higher than that which obtains in most countries, if not in all European countries.  Certainly our cost of living is lower than that in the United States of America or in Canada, though I agree that the level of wages is much higher in those countries in order to meet the phenomenally high cost of living.</P>
    <P>It has been said by almost every speaker on the Opposition Benches that unemployment has increased considerably. Certainly the figures show that there has been some increase in the unemployment register.  I do not think it is fair&mdash;and Deputy Morrissey must realise that it is not fair&mdash;to compare the figures in 1950 with the figures in the present year.  Deputy McGilligan said last evening&mdash;Deputy Costello has said it frequently&mdash;that some time in 1950 the inter-Party Government called in the editorial representatives of the Press to explain to them certain aspects of Government policy, particularly in relation to some stockpiling the Government intended to do and to have done throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As a result of that decision, which was conveyed only to the editorial representatives and to the manufacturers, it was obvious that there must be increased activity in manufactured goods here.  The Government encouraged manufacturers and stockists of goods to get in as much material as they possibly could, in some cases a one year or two years supply.  Most companies went abroad on receiving that advice and sought all the raw <Col N="227" /> materials they could buy for their own particular industries.  There was a stepping-up in the volume of activity in many of our factories and particularly in our manufacturing industries, such as textiles, boots and shoes and even motor-cars.  As a result of increasing output to provide against harder times our industrial and commercial concerns were able to take on more workers but they knew, and the workers knew, that the period was an exceptional one, that they were providing against a possible increase in prices and against times when the goods in which they were interested might be in short supply on the world markets.  More people were taken into industrial employment for a period during 1950 than would normally have been taken in.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, obvious that having supplied the demands that would be made should a world shortage occur, our manufacturers and industrialists could not go any further than keep these supplies on hands.  It was not suggested, nor was it expected, that they could or should at any stage maintain productivity at the same level in subsequent years.  That is one of the important factors which has caused a certain reduction in the employment figures here in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Deputies have painted a depressing picture of unemployment.  We are at the moment passing through a slump in trade and industry but it is incorrect to relate that slump back to the reduction in food subsidies.  I suggest to them that their memory is very short if they think that the slump has occurred only since the reduction in food subsidies.  If there is a slump at the present time, I suggest the slump was much worse and inflicted far greater hardship in the months immediately after the change of Government rather than in the months immediately following the last Budget.</P>
    <P>It all related back to the same point that, as a result of the stockpiling, shopkeepers had goods on hands&mdash; goods which were manufactured or made up when prices were at their peak.  That is true, particularly, in relation to goods made of wool in its <Col N="228" /> various stages of processing.  Shopkeepers purchased wherever they could find goods for sale.  They piled up their shelves with those goods. Factories manufactured far beyond current demands.  They piled up whatever space they had to spare with those woollen goods which were made at a very high cost&mdash;possibly at the highest cost of woollen goods ever experienced in this country.  Since then, there has been a reduction in the price of goods.  It is only natural that shopkeepers and manufacturers found it difficult, in the months following that stockpiling, to distribute the goods they had piled up.  That was one of the reasons for the slump&mdash;one of the worst slumps that has hit Irish trade and industry in recent years.  I think that Deputy Morrissey&mdash;who, more than anybody else, was responsible for that advice which was given to traders and manufacturers&mdash;knows that quite well.</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Morrissey tries to be fair to all sides.  Like any other member of this House, however, when he is painting a picture Deputy Morrissey will, if it suits his book, try to leave out certain things which he considers are not necessary for the purpose of the picture which he is painting.  I suggest that he ignored that fact this morning when he painted a very depressing picture of trade and industry in this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>He did not say it directly but he implied that in every aspect of industry there is less employment now than there was 18 months ago.  I will agree with him that in the first few months of this Government's office there was less employment than there was during the latter few months of the Coalition Government's régime.  I cannot agree with him that that applies at the present time in every branch of industry.  Following the trade recession in the woollen industry, the remedial measures taken by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce have begun to show effect.  In many of our textile factories throughout the country, if not in all of them, work has been restored to full capacity output. I know of factories in my constituency <Col N="229" /> where unemployment was rife in the early months of the present Government's terms of office but where they are now working three shifts a day.  That is something which they thought, when the change of Government took place, would have been impossible in such a short time.</P>
    <P>There is a slump in the motor industry.  That is something which I and my colleagues who represent Cork City deprecate more than anybody else. I am not going to make any attempt to minimise the effect of that slump on employment, not only in Cork but throughout the country.  Again, we cannot ignore international trends.  It must be realised that in Britain the motor-car industry, despite all their insistence on exports, is having a very lean time at present.  That in its turn, affects this country.  There may be other factors&mdash;I am sure there are.  The alteration in the road tax cannot be held responsible for the slump, because, in the case of many categories of cars, the alteration in the road tax will mean a decrease in the amount of money that will have to be paid by their owners.  As well as that, there is the reduction, that will come into operation shortly, in the amount of insurance to be paid.  There is a decrease in the output of many of the makes of cars for which there is to be a decrease in the amount payable. Therefore, it is not fair or right to suggest that any slump which is being experienced at present in the motor manufacturing or motor assembling industry in this country is due to the alteration in the road tax.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar fact that while work is decreasing and while the employment content of Ford's factory in Cork is decreasing, the neighbouring factory&mdash; Dunlops&mdash;is producing tyres and rubber goods almost to maximum capacity: I use the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because I am not certain that they are producing at the maximum capacity.  I know that many of the workers whom Dunlops were obliged to leave off some months ago have been taken on again.  Therefore, that represents to me a somewhat contradictory picture.  At all events, I think it indicates that if people are not buying the motor-cars at the present <Col N="230" /> time they are doing as much motoring as they did formerly.  Taking one year with another, I think it is well established that the months immediately prior to Christmas are the months when the motoring manufacturing industry, and kindred industries, are at their lowest ebb.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the fact that there is reduced employment in very many branches of industry throughout the country.  He admitted that some of these reductions are seasonal.  He instanced the 500, or so, who are disemployed in the hotel and catering industries.  That is usual at this time of the year.  He also made a lot of the fact that there is less employment at the docks now than there was formerly.  As leader of a trade union and as a person in close touch with trade union affairs, I think Deputy Norton must know that there are other factors which are causing this disemployment. I take it that if in a trade union it is found that some members are rendered unemployed, the union will investigate all the factors that go to bring about that reduction in employment.  I am sure that if Deputy Norton has not found the reason, it must have been conveyed to some of his colleagues that shipping all over the world has reduced considerably.  There are shipping companies who are operating at the present time on about one-third of their normal tonnage. They are now able to manage what trade they do with this country and with other international ports with one ship whereas formerly they used three ships.  That is another factor for which no government can be held to be entirely responsible.  Why, may we ask, is shipping at such a stage at the present time?  I think that one of the reasons is that, due to imminence of war or to the fear of imminence of war, every country is trying its best to make itself as self-sufficient as possible.</P>
    <P>In order to redress its balance of payments, every country throughout the world, including our own and Great Britain, is doing its utmost to reduce imports.  A reduction of imports necessarily means a reduction of exports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because when we reduce our trade with countries with which we have trade agreements, these countries in turn will reduce the demand for goods which they have been importing from us unless we can produce goods of a better quality and at a lower price than that at which they can procure them elsewhere.  That is the object of our policy at the present time&mdash;first of all, to develop our natural resources in such a manner as will preclude the necessity of importing goods and commodities that we should be able to provide for ourselves, and, in so far as we have a marketable surplus, to export that surplus to countries which are prepared to buy it from us.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Gorman in particular mentioned what he termed &ldquo;the depressing 18 months&rdquo; we have just experienced.  I think Deputy O'Gorman should be the last person in this House to refer to a depressing 18 months. He knows well that in his own town of Youghal a factory was planned, built and put into production within 12 months and that during the period of the depressing 18 months about which he talks.  The factory was opened, I forget whether it was in the early summer or late summer but some time recently in any case, and, on the very day of its opening, one of the directors informed me that already they had to contemplate expanding the size of the factory in order to meet the increased demand for the goods they produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is far from a depressing picture and Deputy O'Gorman knows that were it not for the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, and in particular for the policy of the Minister who holds the portfolio of Industry and Commerce, it would not be possible to place not only that factory in his native town of Youghal but to place there the factory that preceded it.  I am not trying to detract from the energy or ability of the man who conceived this factory in the first instance, the late Mr. William O'Dwyer, but Mr. O'Dwyer himself has testified to the fact that were it not for the assistance he got from the Minister for Industry and Commerce the <Col N="232" /> expansion would not have been possible.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned most of the points I intended to make but I just want to refer to one remark in Deputy O'Gorman's speech with regard to the mechanisation of the bakery industry. I think Deputy O'Gorman is sufficiently progressive to realise that if certain improved methods are introduced to industry, there is very little a government can do or that they should do, to stop that type of progress.  If such mechanisation has the effect of putting people out of employment, I certainly believe that the government should view it with concern.  In so far as it does put people out of employment if the government cannot provide alternative means of employing these people, the government should take some steps to control the use and operation of that type of machinery but I think it is generally accepted that in any progressive form of industrial activity, whether it be the production of bread, engineering or otherwise, mechanisation is something that cannot be avoided in the modern world, particularly if we are to produce goods, as we all hope, of equal quality with those that at present we have to import and if we have to find a method of manufacture which is as cheap at least, as the method employed in countries from which these goods were formerly imported.</P>
    <P>It is very easy when in opposition to say that, if machines are being introduced to do this job or that job, the government should stop it but it is quite a different matter for anybody to take a decision to stop progress in any country.  There are methods at the disposal of a government which can be employed in an effort to reduce the cost of living but, since Deputy Morrissey is here now, I should like to repeat that there are factors outside the control of the government which seriously affect the cost of living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to have to go back over the speech I have made but I am sure Deputy Morrissey would not bother looking it up.  I have asserted that this Government's record in the last 12 months is by no means as bad as Deputy Morrissey attempted to make it this morning.  I have tried in the few remarks I have made not to exaggerate the position, but to compare our conditions here in Ireland with conditions abroad and to indicate that we are relatively better off than most people in the world at the present time.  Our cost of living is by no means as high and our standard of living in many cases is far higher than that of other countries.  If the cost of living is higher in other countries it is true that it is often met by a higher level of wages but before I sit down I should like to give one instance of a higher cost of living which is presumed to be offset by a higher salary.  I met a man some time ago who was earning £1,000 <Col N="234" /> a year in this country and who went abroad.  For the same type of service, he was able to command £3,000 in a country west of the Atlantic.  I asked him what was his relative position in the country of his adoption as compared with his position in Ireland.  He said that even though his wages were three times as high, he felt his standard of living was only about 10 or 15 per cent. higher than in Ireland.  That is a fairly good indication of the fact that even though wages are so much higher in Canada or the United States as compared with Irish wage standards, the standard of living in these countries is not so much higher than our own.</P>
      <P>Again, I assert, from what I have seen myself, that our standard of living is far higher than that of most European countries at the present time. I believe that industry, despite the miserably depressing picture painted this morning, is picking up in this country, and that many factories are not only increasing their production but increasing the employment which they are giving.  It is not true to say that the position is getting worse in every instance.  That, certainly, is by no means true.  I think that if the position is examined home, it will be found that employers are more hopeful now of the future than they were 18 months ago when the change of Government took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be failing in my duty if I did not join in the appeals which have been made by other speakers to the Government to deal immediately with the unemployment problem.  The depression to-day is as serious as anything that we have known over the past 25 years, and unemployment is responsible for it. Everywhere you go you find that men are being disemployed, whether it be in a draper's shop, a tailor's shop or by a wholesale clothing manufacturer. The same is true of the shipyards down at the North Wall.  I want, without any exaggeration, to arouse the Dáil to deal seriously with this matter before further depression sets in causing greater discontent amongst our <Col N="235" /> people.  The position in the shipyards is that our men are being dismissed and are going to England and Scotland. Why are they going?  It is not because of any desire to emigrate but rather to earn something to send home to keep their families.  Unfortunately, that means keeping two homes.  The last speaker said that a higher cost of living has brought about a higher standard of living.  Everyone in the House knows that is not so.  I say that the higher cost of living has made the people go in for substitutes.  They are not able to buy the better quality of food.</P>

      <P>We get those figures every week and can see from them what is going on.  I wonder did Deputy Cunningham hear the reply that was given to a question yesterday in connection with the building trade.  In that reply, we were told that there are over 500 carpenters and 500 painters unemployed as well as a couple of hundred bricklayers.  That was never known before in this country.  Three years ago, we had to bring our men back from England to engage on the building of houses here. But now, instead of bringing them back, they are going away.  Why?  If we do bring them back are we going to give them employment, because if not they will pack up again and go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> During the last three or four weeks I had occasion&mdash;it was more than an ordinary occasion&mdash;to meet a very big number of Dublin housewives.  One out of every three told me that her husband was unemployed, or if not her husband, that her eldest son or daughter had recently been dismissed. What are we going to do for the youth of the country?  Take the motor trade. A number of young people in it, some of them serving their time and others getting decent employment, have been disemployed.</P>
    <P>The same is true in regard to dockers at the North Wall.  Most people know what the North Wall is like on a Sunday morning.  The position on week-days now is that the North Wall is as dull on week-days as it usually is on a Sunday morning. We do not know what has happened, and I can suggest no remedy.  I am just giving the Minister and the House the benefit of the experience I have had of a number of industries in Dublin City.  A depression has set in and something will have to be done to stop it.  For the first time in the last five years, we now have groups of men waiting on the corporation steps asking the members to have work on relief schemes started.  We had not anything like that in operation over the last five years.  There was no necessity for it.  Who is going to wake up quickly and pay attention to this, and not let the position become worse?</P>
    <P>When we, the members of the corporation, attend meetings of the housing committee every second Friday we see before us a list relating to ejectments, due to the fact that people are unable to pay their rents. When we make inquiries we are told that the father of the family has gone to England to look for work, or that the eldest son or daughter is unemployed. I have at least 50 letters in the room for Independent Deputies dealing with these genuine complaints, and I am prepared to show them to anyone who cares to see them.  Some of the writers mention that their husbands are unemployed while others make an appeal to get a son or a daughter into a job instead of having these young people wasting their time and thus <Col N="237" /> causing uneasiness to their parents.  I want to know what is the Government or the public authorities going to do concerning these cases?</P>
    <P>Recently one of our shipyards lost a very big contract.  The proposed expenditure was something like £250,000. The contract went to a foreign firm, the difference between it and the Irish firm being £18,000.  The giving of that contract to a foreign firm means that steel, iron, coal and other equipment will have to be brought in from the other side.  The bringing in of that raw material to fulfil the contract will, I suggest, amount to the difference in the tenders between the Irish firm and the foreign firm.  I suggest it would have been better if the contract had been given to our own shipyard.  Heavy import charges on the raw materials would have been avoided, while it would mean that we would be providing work for our own people.  I have already said that I have no remedy to offer, but I think it is the duty of the Government to keep our men at home in good employment.</P>
    <P>I know from meeting housewives that heretofore they used to buy reasonably good quality tea and good quality butter.  Due to unemployment and the loss of wages, as well as the increase in the price of bread, butter, tea and sugar, they now have to do with substitutes. They are buying margarine and a cheaper quality of tea.  Heretofore, bread, butter and tea were almost essentials in Dublin working-class life. They might see meat on one or two days a week, but now these people are buying substitutes for good quality tea and butter.  All that is due to their failure to be able to get work for their sons and daughters and, in many cases, their husbands.</P>
    <P>I have told you what I think should be done in connection with shipbuilding, that the freight on the raw materials of these firms should be taken into consideration when tenders are being considered.  We have a good shipbuilding yard in Dublin at the North Wall.  I am sure the Lord Mayor of Cork will tell you that there is a splendid dockyard in Cork which also gives good employment.  But they have to import raw materials and to compete <Col N="238" /> with others.  The freight on the steel and iron required to build ships is very high on the firm that has to tender.  The Government ought to do something about that.</P>
    <P>Then there are the young fellows of 16 or 17 who, having left school, have gone to a vocational school for two or three years and who have got a good training from their teachers which should lead to an apprenticeship if things were all right.  But, at the end of the two years in the vocational school, there is no work for these young fellows.  The unemployment problem is a matter for the Government and not for any special Minister to deal with. It is more serious in Dublin to-day to my knowledge than it has been for the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>For the first time we have men waiting at the corporation labour bureau imploring us to start relief work and asking that grants should be made immediately so that the work can be started.  I will support any demand made on the Government which will lead to the reduction of unemployment in the City of Dublin.  I get a large number of letters, as I know every Dublin Deputy does, from people asking what can be done for their sons and daughters who are being trained in vocational schools because they do not know what to do with them.  I ask the Government to do something quickly about that.</P>
    <P>I always had a feeling that there was silence when emigration reached a certain height.  There are from 50 to 100 boys and girls, as well as fathers, who should be doing skilled work here, leaving Dublin every night.  Do the Government think that it is right or proper to shut their eyes to the problem of emigration, that emigration is a remedy for unemployment? Deputies know that from their own towns and villages there are two or three people leaving every week and that these places are becoming deserted.  As a rule, these people are not going to America now but to England, Scotland and Wales for some kind of war work.  The wages now are not as tempting as they were a few years ago.  These people only get moderate wages now out of which they <Col N="239" /> have to send something home.  The ration they are allowed is fairly good, but they are not able to buy the things because they have to send money home. That is not good for their health.</P>
    <P>It is discouraging for one to feel that people are not bothering about the unemployment problem.  We know that it is increasing rapidly.  The Minister knows better than I do that in Dublin men are being dismissed every day in the week in the clothing trade.  I will not say that the drapers are dismissing anyone, but they are not taking on extra hands for Christmas as they used to do.</P>
    <P>What is to happen to the young men and women, and even the adults, who used to get employment in that trade? In the building trade there are three unemployed men for every vacancy. That even applies to carpenters, although we had not sufficient carpenters some time ago when we wanted them.  There were 7,000 or 8,000 newly-wed couples in this city five years ago who have now two or three children and they are no nearer to getting a house to-day than they were five years ago.  The men who should be building houses for that type of people are leaving the country. I know of cases in Dublin where there are two families living in one room.  I know of cases in which mothers have taken in their married sons or daughters to live with them in one room while our building workers are going away and the timber for the houses has also gone.  When are we going to bring them back?</P>
    <P>It is a matter for Cabinet decision and for serious thought to see what can be done for the unemployed.  I appeal earnestly to the Government to do something for the unemployed men with large families who have to go away and then have to send half their wages back to keep their families here and for the boys and girls who are leaving Dún Laoghaire and the North Wall every night to seek employment on the other side.  They are going away day after day in very large numbers.  I know the Minister is aware that there have been protests from our own people on the other side against closing <Col N="240" /> our eyes to the fact that such large numbers are going away and that nothing is being done for them when they get to the other side.  There is no living accommodation for them when they get to the other side and some of our own people over there have to try to do something for them.  Then they write back asking us not to allow our young people to leave Ireland to live in the conditions with which they have to put up.  I do not say that Irish people are getting any different treatment from the people over there. There is a shortage of accommodation. They are not able to build houses quickly enough for their own people. It is only right and proper that we should pay attention to that matter.</P>

Emigration appears to be the only remedy which the Government have for the unemployment problem.  It is not fair to shut our eyes to the emigration of these young people and especially the fathers of families who are going away.  It is a matter for some big minds to devise a scheme which will give them decent employment and a decent way of living and of bringing up their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister here this morning.  I thought that he would have gone over the various economic problems which we are facing.  Unemployment, trade recession and emigration are three very big things which are looming up at the present time.  Instead, however, I heard a very detailed lecture on the bakery trade.  I did not object to that lecture, being connected with that trade I enjoyed it, but I felt that the Minister was avoiding the main problems which we are facing this morning and just delving into a small side issue. If you like, he did so at great length and spent three-quarters of an hour trying to justify the last increase in the price of bread.  I think that that increase was most unjustifiable.  He <Col N="241" /> said that the costings produced by the Master Bakers' Association and by the Guild of Master Bakers to the Labour Court justified an increase of 2/6 per sack.  I am sure that the Labour Court must have gone into these costings very closely.  I am sure that they were quite all right and I have no doubt that they were.  Then the Minister said to them: &ldquo;The least increase we can give will more than compensate you so we will put up the price of flour by 1/3 a sack, the cost of the wage increase being 2/6 and a halfpenny on the 4 lb. loaf representing an increase of 3/9.&rdquo;  In trade circles we speak of a 4 lb. loaf as a &ldquo;loaf&rdquo; may be any size.  He need not have gone down to the farthing but could have said a halfpenny on the 4 lb. loaf.</P>
      <P>Was the Minister justified in increasing the price of bread?  Does he not know, does everyone not know that, as Deputy Morrissey and the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned, the consumption of bread over past months has gone down very considerably?  In fact, one paper which the Parliamentary Secretary read and which I also read, the <i>Irish Times</i>, said that in one bakery alone in Dublin consumption had gone down by 500 sacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And in another it had gone up by 500 sacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  They took it that in every bakery consumption had gone down and in that particular one it had gone down by 500 sacks.  The Parliamentary Secretary was not making the case the Minister wanted him to make and the Minister immediately pulled him up, but I can support the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Morrissey by saying that it has gone down.  I have been speaking with several bakers in different parts of the country.  I was not confined to one area at all.  In the most modern bakeries and in the oldest type of bakery trade has gone down.  The Minister may say that the consumption of flour has risen but I doubt it.  The only way I could account for it is that there must be a tremendous amount of exports of cake to England to absorb the extra flour.  I know for myself that as far as bakeries are concerned <Col N="242" /> the consumption of flour has definitely gone down.  As the amount of flour on which the Minister must pay subsidy has gone down, this increase of 2/6 would have been easily offset by the reduction in consumption.  He said that it was most embarrassing for him and for the Government but I do not think the Minister felt the slightest embarrassment.  The first embarrassment he got was when he went to North-West Dublin.  Before that there was no trouble in putting everything on the taxes but now a halt has been called and we are all very pleased that it has.  The Minister could have paid for the increase out of the subsidy and at the end of the year the subsidy would not have increased.  The Minister mentioned that the Minister for Finance had a hand in all the Bills going through to-day.  Is the Minister for Finance trying to bring back on bread what he lost on whiskey?  He knows that people can give up drinking whiskey as they have done.  Is he trying to cash in on a reduction in the bread subsidy to pay for the whiskey? He has lost on that but people must eat some bread.  They cannot cut it out altogether as they have done with whiskey.  Therefore he felt that he could recoup on bread what he lost on whiskey.  People can go teetotal but they cannot go starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say&mdash; he made a very detailed examination of the problem undoubtedly&mdash;that to maintain employment in the bakery industry he must keep an even keel between the price of retail flour and the price of baker's bread.  If the price of bread went up there must be a rise in the price of retail flour because if not people would switch from baker's bread to home-made bread. Does anybody think that a penny on a stone of flour, an increase of 2 per cent., would influence anybody to eat home-made bread rather than baker's bread?  I doubt if it could and he knows that.  He then said that even with the Government's fixed price at the present time retailers were selling flour under that price.  If they have done that already does he not think that that should have encouraged people to change from baker's bread to home-made bread?  I do not see any <Col N="243" /> reason whatever why the Minister should put an extra 1/3 per sack on the price of retail flour.  Again, it is to recoup the Treasury as the Government is short on beer and whiskey. I do not think that this penny per sack would influence anyone one whit and I see no justification for the increase in price.  In this case the Minister cannot say that an increase in wages necessitated an increase in the retail price of flour.  He just thought: &ldquo;We are putting up the prices of flour generally so why not have a crack at this too?  We are losing this year on certain taxes which we estimated we would have and we will gain on this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he was afraid that with open competition the big bakeries would have an advantage over the others and that all the trade would be brought to them.  In fact Deputy Norton went a shade of the way with him and pointed out that in some bakeries as a result of the wonderful machinery they have installed practically no labour is required in the manufacture of bread and that they have an unfair advantage over their competitors who are in business in a small way.  The Minister must realise, however, that he is subsidising the largest of these bakeries, the largest of these monopolies, to the extent of 3/6 per sack, £100 per week, £5,000 per year.  As a matter of fact I put down a question myself asking the Minister about these allowances.</P>
    <P>Why should one firm, if it be large itself, get an advantage over a smaller firm of 3/6 per sack?  The Minister said these were allowances under old regulations which these miller bakers were getting and he could not change the position.  The Minister said here to-day that he is afraid of these people coming in and reducing the price of flour or reducing the price of bread, but so far they have not done so.  These bakeries which the Minister is subsidising at the present time have not reduced prices and he is handing them 3/6 per sack. The particular firm I have in mind is getting an allowance at that rate.  In fact the Minister admitted across the floor of this House that this firm was getting a special concession not given to any ordinary man in the trade.  We <Col N="244" /> have all, from time to time, listened to pious expressions as to the decentralisation of industry and as to taking steps in favour of the people in the country having a small industry of their own. However, it seems to be a case of subsidising the big man.  It may have been all right pre-war that where a person was able to place an order for 10,000 sacks of flour as against another person placing an order for ten sacks that the man placing the larger order should get the advantage of a reduction of two, three or four shillings.  There may have been something in that because it gave the miller continuity of production that the man buying the ten sacks of flour did not give because that man might go some where else for his next ten sacks However, there is no reason for giving him a reduction when it is coming out of the taxpayer's pocket and when the Government is subsidising it.  Is there any reason why any one firm should be subsidised to the extent of £50,000 per year?  It smells and tastes queer.  The Minister was telling us about monopolies and said he was afraid that certain firms would monopolise the country's trade but he did not disclose to us to-day that he is helping all these monopolies.</P>
    <P>I have heard rumours recently in the trade about complete decontrol and the taking away of the subsidies altogether I did not believe these rumours but when I heard the Minister dropping a hint this morning that he was going to take away subsidies, it was a revelation to me.  It was a nice little stroke for the beginning while waiting to get the wedge driven in deeper.  It was the first hint as regards the removal of the subsidies altogether.  The Minister suggested this morning that if he removed subsidies altogether a free market would exist and that a person could go into the market and supply bread at any price they wished.  The Minister's statement this morning is a warning to us that we should be very watchful, that he will take away next January all the subsidies on bread. That is what I gathered from the Minister's hint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very easily gathered.  Anybody in the know would have gathered that hint.  As I said, although I did not believe the rumours I heard about the subsidies being taken away, the hint from the Minister was very enlightening to me.  The normal person in the House might not have made the same deduction from the Minister's statement but, as I said, I have good reason to believe that by next January we will not have any more subsidies; we will have a free market.  At present there is a free market as regards bakery and he said this morning he is going to make a free market as regards milling.  I am very glad that I at least was able to take that hint.  There was a hint circulated some time ago about a tax on cattle going out of the country which was nailed very quickly, and we were very glad that was denied.  I would be very glad if the Minister would deny, in his reply, that he intends removing completely the subsidies on flour and bread because, as I said I heard rumours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening very carefully this morning.  I was intensely interested in what he said and the rumours I heard were confirmed.  So far I think I have shown that there was no necessity whatever for this increase in taxation.  The big reduction in consumption in the present year would easily have offset any increase in the subsidy which he would have had to give due to increases in wages and, consequently, in prices.  I do not think there is any justification for the Minister increasing the price of bread and much less for increasing the price of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with that, the next question I would like to refer to is the unemployment position.  In the small city from which I come, namely, Kilkenny, the cold blast, as Deputy Bartley put it, has been felt.  I have spoken here before on the sugar industry. I am glad to say it is in full production; likewise the woollen industry is struggling through.  But what have we now?  The brewery industry is getting into difficulties.  I am very glad <Col N="246" /> to say that the brewery industry is famous throughout the 32 counties for its good beer.  It was always a question of how many men would be taken on in the brewery industry at a certain time and how many would they expect to take on next year.  Of course, in the harvesting season there is always a big increase in the number of workers, and those who are taken on at that time are let off again.  But what do we find this year?  It is not the temporary workers who have been taken on for the period of three or four months of the summer and harvesting season, who are being let off, but the permanent employees.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the firm which employs these men is a decent firm and if they saw a way of holding these men in the industry they would hold them.  It is only as an extreme measure that this particular firm would let any man out of their employment, but every day they see their sales going down and they can see no prospect whatever of increased sales. Therefore, men who were in secure employment for the last two, three and four years are now going to be put on the unemployment list.  This is a regrettable thing.  People say that the price of beer is too high.  It is high but it is not that alone.  The cost of living is getting too high and there is no money whatever for beer.  On a Friday night I go into a place where I used to see barmen behind the counters trying to stretch out amongst a crowd to serve people at the back but now it is only an odd person who is to be seen at the counters after pay night.  Even the men in employment have not the money.  What about the poor people who are now going on the unemployed list?  I think the Minister should have dealt with some points like that in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>In regard to trade recession I heard the Minister saying 12 months ago: &ldquo;We are just around the corner.&rdquo;&ldquo;Hey round the corner!&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no &ldquo;Hey round the corner&rdquo; for these people <Col N="247" /> who are unemployed.  The Minister said 12 months ago: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is recession in the woollen trade; we must stop imports.  The inter-Party Government had allowed imports; we have closed down on them and everything will be all right in a couple of months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>County council workers cannot be expected to save out of their wages in order to meet hard times.  In Kilkenny the number of county council workers has been reduced by 50 per cent.  The worst position of all is in the building trade.  At one time the surveyor would tell us that it was not possible to get carpenters or plasterers, when we were pressing him to get building work carried out.  The position now is that carpenters, plasterers and labouring men are coming to me every day in the week asking me to use my influence with the borough surveyor to have them taken on.  That is an over-night change and a remarkable change in the building trade.  The cold blast to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred is being felt in the trade.</P>
      <P>As a result of the increase in the rate of interest, many people who were hoping to build homes for themselves have abandoned that hope.  In the normal way, they would be independent people who would not have to lift their hat to any T.D.  Now they are looking to me to see if I could get them a corporation house.  The increased rate of interest has to a certain extent made beggars of these people who have to come to members of local bodies to know what we can do for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bartley revealed many thoughts of the Government.  He said that it was most politically unfortunate that they were returned to power in 1951.  If it was politically unfortunate for the Fianna Fáil Party, it was economically unfortunate for the people that they were returned to power in 1951.  If any one had told the people then that the change that has taken place would be wrought in the country in one and a half years, the people would not have believed it.  Deputy Bartley also said that the people in North-West Dublin reacted much quicker than people in rural areas to <Col N="248" /> the cold blast, that these people have a lot of amusements and have not time to consider matters in the way that the rural population would consider them. The Minister should go to the country now.  Deputy Bartley thinks the rural population are fools, that they would not understand the cold blast. I tell the Minister that the people in the country, particularly after the North-West Dublin by-election, have lost confidence in the Government.  I call on the Minister and the Government to go to the country and to test the feelings of the people.</P>

      <P>I was not a member of the House when the present Government were in opposition. Therefore, I have studied the speeches which they made when the Supplies and Services Bill was under discussion in 1950.  To-day the Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Lynch, referred to the matters which are discussed on this Bill.  There were some extraordinary points made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He said that reduced imports meant reduced exports.  I wonder when the Government came to that way of thinking.  He was referring to unemployment among dock workers that had been referred to by Deputy Norton.</P>
      <P>It is worthy of consideration that the opposition at that time had one long wail in referring to the Supplies and Services Bill.  That was in connection with the increase in the cost of living.  The statistical bulletin gives us the following figures for cost of living: in 1948, all items, 99; 1949, 100; 1950, 100; 1951, 111; 1952, 122.  Before this discussion closes perhaps we may be informed as to how that 20 points increase occurred since the change of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did a single candidate seeking election as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or a single canvasser for a Fianna Fáil candidate or a single Independent now supporting the Government indicate to one voter that it was the intention, if returned to power, to abolish food subsidies?  Even before these subsidies were abolished <Col N="249" /> there was an increase in the cost of living.  Yet, to-day we hear from many members on the Government side that circumstances outside this country are responsible for any increase in the cost of living.  That is a big change from the attitude of Fianna Fáil when they were in opposition.  At that time a single point increase in the cost of living was attributed purely and simply to the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>During the three and a half years that the inter-Party Government were in office there was an increase in the cost of living of less than two points but since the accession of the Fianna Fáil Government to office there has been an increase of 20 points in the cost of living figure.  That indicates that the Deputies who were then in opposition were not sincere in the arguments which they put forward. Far from having a deliberate policy which would ensure a reduction in the cost of living, by neglect and by deliberate action in reducing food subsidies, they have allowed the cost of living to increase to the extent that was so clearly and certainly resented when a working class constituency was given an opportunity of voicing its opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley claims that it will take some time yet for the cold blast which has struck North-West Dublin to reach some of the rural constituencies. I represent a rural constituency and I can say that the temperature has risen slightly following the result in North-West Dublin, that there is a feeling of hope and confidence that the people in the rural areas will be given an opportunity shortly of remedying the wrong which a few Independent members did when they elected this Government.  They will give an answer to a Government which has allowed the cost of living to get out of bounds, which has allowed unemployment to reach unprecedented levels and which has brought about conditions inimical to business and every phase of our national life.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Lynch, speaking on the Supplies and Services Bill on 29th November, 1950 &mdash; column 1341 &mdash; said, in reference to the Government's claim that in October, <Col N="250" /> 1948, real earnings had at last come hip to hip with the cost of living: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If that is the case, the cost of living has since then easily outstripped real earnings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gave some concern to the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement this year.  He brought in measures to see that it would not obtain much longer.  Now we have a very different approach from the Government side in relation to problems such as the cost of living and emigration.  It is to be noted, and it has already been stressed, that unemployment figures stand to-day 10,500 higher than when the inter-Party Government was in office.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>For the reasons explained in reply to questions on the subject of tea prices in <Col N="257" /> Dáil Éireann on the 22nd October last, the trade are at present required to purchase their requirements of tea from Tea Importers Ltd. and cannot obtain teas direct from London.  Tea Importers Ltd. were authorised recently to make limited purchases in London as an exceptional arrangement made necessary by the need to supplement the stocks held by them by supplies of original teas of lower grades.  The average price paid for these lower grade teas by the company was 1/4½ a lb.</P>
    <P>Tea Importers Ltd. deal only in original unblended teas of many different grades which are sold by that company to the trade for blending.  The teas which are sold by wholesale and retail traders are blends made up by those traders from original teas.  I have no means of knowing the composition of the teas stated by the Deputy to be retailing at 3/3 a lb. and I cannot answer his question about that tea.

Dublin, surely be to God if the cost of living is at the level at which it is at present some steps ought to be taken to liquidate the existing stocks of tea in the hands of Tea Importers and give the people access to tea at one-half the cost they are required to pay for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the tea which is available at 1/4½ a lb. to Tea Importers Limited, and which would be bought at that price is unblended tea which must be seeded out.  Before that is capable of being sold, it has to be blended with other teas to produce a variety of tea that people will buy.  It is open to wholesale and retail merchants to buy any grade and any blend of tea from Tea <Col N="258" /> Importers provided it is a blend the people are prepared to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will permit the trade in Ireland generally &mdash; the retailer, wholesaler and everybody else &mdash; to buy as best they may, I can assure him that, on the basis of the price quoted for the lowest grade original Indian tea in Mincing Lane, tea can be put on the market for retail of an excellent and potable quality at 2/- per lb. retail within seven days.  I guarantee that tea can be made available at 2/- per lb. retail in every shop in Ireland if the Minister will take control off imported tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a problem of a temporary character arising out of the fact that there is a quantity of tea purchased in 1950 or 1951 as a reserve&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which cost a lot more than the price at which tea can be purchased at the present time. That stock is moving slowly.  Apart from that problem, there is no reason why Tea Importers cannot buy tea as cheaply as anybody else.  These cheaper teas of this year's crop are now coming into the country.  So far as I am personally concerned the sooner Tea Importers Limited, can be got out of this business the better.  I have asked the Tea Wholesalers' Association what are their proposals for the future importation of tea. There is one thing I will not agree to and that is putting this country back into Mincing Lane.  I would sooner leave the Government than agree to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

Not one of them raised a voice to get <Col N="259" /> us a reasonable supply of tea.  We were on a half ounce and they were on two ounces.  They did not raise a hand to give us a reasonable share of these stocks.  I told them that never again would this country go back into the London wholesale market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the people of this country have the reputation of liking dear tea.  Long before the war, the average price of tea was higher here.  It was on the basis that that taste would continue that Tea Importers built up these reserve stocks to include various high-grade teas as well as low grade.  At the present time they are being left with a residue of high-grade teas which is going slowly.  We may find a way of liquidating that tea stock, perhaps, at Belfast.  When that is liquidated, tea can be made available as cheap as in Great Britain and there is no reason why it should not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative site mentioned by the Deputy is not held by the Land Commission but by the forestry division which provided the original site on representations from the development company.  The original site was chosen by a director of the company and appears reasonably suitable for a sports field.</P>
      <P>No good grounds have been advanced in support of the more recent plea for an exchange of sites and the forestry division which has no functions in regard to the provision of sports fields is not disposed to entertain the proposal.</P>
      <P>The alternative site is part of an existing cow park.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the forestry division that we may require this ground, for housing, for example, at some time in the future.  Portumna should be an important forestry centre, as the Deputy knows, and it is possible that the question of providing housing <Col N="269" /> accommodation for employees may arise.  Apart from that, however, may I point out that, when this place was taken over in June, 1948, at the request of the local people themselves, the present arrangement was made?  For reasons which seem to me to be inadequate, they now want to take an existing cow park, which would involve amongst other things depriving people of the use of the cow park, on the ground that the new site would be more convenient to the village.  I have not been convinced so far that the case that has been made is sufficiently strong to warrant making the exchange.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the Corporation of Dublin has advanced moneys from their small dwellings loans account on houses which were (1) not erected at the time of advance of the loan and (2) not completed to the stage necessary to qualify for a loan; and, if so, if he will state (a) the amounts so advanced; (b) what steps have been taken to obtain the return of these moneys and (c) whether it is intended to institute criminal proceedings against the person or persons who obtained these moneys as the result of false declarations and, further, if he is aware that the corporation has advanced moneys from their small dwellings loans account for the purchase of houses outside their borough area; and, if so, if he will state (1) the amount so advanced and (2) what steps have been taken to recover the moneys from the other <Col N="272" /> local authority involved; and, finally, if he will direct the corporation to make provision for the lending of these moneys when recovered to purchasers at the old rate of interest and if he will direct the holding of a public sworn inquiry into the administration of the small dwellings loans by the corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ascertained from the Dublin Corporation that in one case the corporation advanced an instalment of a loan where the erection of the house had not started.  In this case the amount was refunded.  In nine other cases instalments were paid before the stage at which they were properly due.  The houses were subsequently completed to the satisfaction of the corporation and the loans were issued in full.  The total amount involved was £5,990.  The question of the return of the money does not arise. Disciplinary action was taken by the corporation in respect of the officials who were responsible for issuing the certificates on the basis of which the payments were made but the corporation was advised that it would be practically impossible to sustain proceedings against any other parties involved.</P>
      <P>As regards the remaining portions of the question, I have ascertained that the Dublin Corporation advanced loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts outside the city area, in respect of sites which they themselves had made available on lands which they had acquired partly inside and partly outside the city boundary.  The portion outside the boundary will, however, be included in the city by the 1st April next.  Forty-eight loans amounting to £61,815 were advanced in these cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Control over imports of seed wheat is necessary to ensure that only suitable varieties are imported and to encourage the assembly of homegrown seed.</P>
      <P>Pending the development of a scheme for the propagation of pedigree seed wheat, which is at present under consideration, facilities are being granted to merchants for the importation of a substantial quantity of seed to meet current requirements and to provide foundation stocks for further propagation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why this country should depend on outside sources for the supply of seed, and I hope that in due course it will be possible to provide from our own resources our full requirements of first quality seed wheat in the same way as we are already <Col N="285" /> providing seed barley of malting varieties.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the necessity for taking all possible steps to provide long-term outlets for our dressed meat, and this will continue to be the policy of the Government.  The countries with which we have trade agreements providing for the import of dressed meat from this country are Britain, Germany and Spain.  In the annex to the 1948 Trade Agreement, the revision <Col N="288" /> of which is at present under consideration, Britain undertook to import dressed beef from this country at a rate of 200 tons per week, subject to an annual figure of 4,000 tons.  In practice, however, much greater quantities were purchased by the British Ministry of Food.  Actual exports of beef to Britain last season &mdash; that is from the 1st July, 1951, to the 30th June, 1952 &mdash; amounted to approximately 10,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Dressed lamb and mutton are purchased by the Ministry of Food under an arrangement made in 1949 pursuant to the 1948 Trade Agreement.  No limit of quantity is specified.  Exports in 1951-52 amounted to 1,127 tons.  Under a long-term agreement of 1951 with the Ministry of Food, an unrestricted outlet has been provided for pork, and since the commencement of exports to the Ministry last July up to 4,000 tons of pork carcases have been shipped.</P>
    <P>Germany has undertaken to provide import and currency facilities for 1,000 tons of Irish dressed beef in the period December, 1952, to April, 1953. The quantity exported to Germany last season was 1,430 tons, the bulk of which was consigned to the United States forces there.  The Spanish Government has undertaken that if, in any year, the necessities of the Spanish economy require the importation of meat, import and currency facilities will be granted for imports of meat from Ireland.  The quantity exported to Spain last season was 2,904 tons of dressed beef.</P>

At present, it is only when the catches by the inshore fishermen are inadequate to meet the demands of the Dublin market that the Sea Fisheries Association buy fish to meet the demand, but now that these trawlers are to come in, what is to happen to the catches of the inshore fishermen, if the former glut the Dublin market with their landings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the amendment is concerned, I thank the Minister for meeting the point I have made, but I had a twofold purpose in putting down the amendment.  I wanted, as I <Col N="296" /> conveyed privately to the Minister yesterday, first of all to deal with the question of tabling and, secondly, I wanted to get at the material that goes into the regulations.  The Minister gave us an explanation last Thursday. Let me say at once that I accept his statement, as he is perhaps in the same position as I am.  I am not an engineer and neither is he, and this is an entirely technical matter.  I have been asked, however, by technical people concerned to get clear what is the technical difference between the basis in cubic capacity on which an engine is now being computed as compared with the basis in 1926?  It is quite clear, of course, that the basis is now that the capacity is to be divided by 125. I am told that in the original calculation, in 1926, which carried forward I think a previous calculation, the capacity, on the basis then operating, was divided by 160.  That is the information given to me, but, like the Minister, I am not a technician.  The Minister, however, has technical advice available to him.  May I ask, therefore, is it correct that the 1926 computation was divided by 160 and, if that is correct, why we are changing that 160 to 125?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read still further and perhaps what I read will throw light on the point which Deputy Sweetman has just raised:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am asked why we did not revert to the method used in the period 1922-1926, when the volume of a cylinder was also taken as the basis of horse-power.  In that period the divisor used was 160, and not 125. Naturally engines had a much lower horse-power rating under it than they would have under the new formula. If we adopted it, the horse-power rating of every engine would be very considerably reduced, and we would lose substantially.  Furthermore, the more expensive cars would gain most under it, while the smaller models would gain little, if anything.  The formula was adopted at a time when the efficiency of engines was a good deal lower than at present, and was designed in particular to benefit a particular make of engine, which was <Col N="297" /> being manufactured here at the time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is 1926?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1922 to 1926.  I think the Deputy will find that that is a satisfactory explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister understand it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very crude idea of how it works, but I would not like to be cross-examined too closely on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the explanation, it is, first of all, agreed that, in 1926, the divisor was 160.  I think the Minister confirmed that.  As I understand it, it is because the mechanisation has improved since that, that 160 should now be changed to 125 on account of the improved engine design.  Is that the case which was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We wanted a figure that would have the least disturbing effect, and I take it that if it has any effect at all, it should tend to remove any injustices against the smaller vehicle rather than confer an advantage on the larger one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They say here that if we were to use the figure of 160 now it would have certain effects which would not be justifiable.  The figure of 125 gives a result which does not disturb to any great extent the <i>status quo</i>, except that it relieves for the future certain types of smaller cars and gives certain concessions to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us three or four standard makes of cars which would give us a balancing of the two figures?  That would be probably easier for a layman than trying to go into mechanics.</P>

      <P>This section replaces Section 8 of the Finance (Customs and Excise Duties) Act, 1933 and Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1934, copies of which are attached.  The idea is to make a vehicle chargeable at the higher rate of duty where a vehicle is used during the year in a number of ways each of which attracts a different rate of duty or where because of a change in structure of the vehicle during the year it comes within a class liable to a higher rate of duty.  Similar provisions appear in Section 8 (3) of the Roads Act, 1920 and Section 14 (2) of the Finance Act, 1922.  Because of legal doubts these sections were replaced by the existing provisions but not specifically repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in explanation mentioned &ldquo;copies of which are attached.&rdquo;  I cannot find them in my Bill.  I have a letter here from a constituent of mine, a farmer, who writes that the present road tax on his vehicle is £25 and under the proposed scale it will go to £142, even though it is a vehicle that is only used about once or thereabouts per week on an average over the year.  Does this section apply to a case like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the section on which I should make the inquiry.  It is under the Roads Act that the tax as such is collected by the different local authorities.  Will the Minister help me in this?  There used at one time to be a provision that local authorities gained something by having a large number of vehicles registered on their books.  I would like the Minister to confirm what I understand is the position or to give us the existing position.  The local authorities concerned staff the office and collect the tax.  In the first place, is the entire cost of that staff met out of the Road Fund tax so collected, or does the local authority concerned have to meet, directly or indirectly, any portion of the cost of staffing the motor taxation section of such local authority?  I <Col N="303" /> think the Road Fund bears the whole cost, but I am not quite clear.  In the second place, does the amount of the grant that the local authority gets vary in any way according to the number of vehicles registered in the area of such local authority?  I believe at one time it did.  I think that stipulation has gone, but I would like confirmation from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first question is that the Road Fund bears the cost.  The reply to the second question is that it was the practice to have regard to the number of vehicles when distributing the amount in the Road Fund but that is no longer the practice.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule, as amended, be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule deals with all the different rates.  I want to mention the rates that are mentioned in paragraph 6 so as to keep the field open for myself on Report Stage.  We may consider putting in an amendment to that paragraph on Report when we have had an opportunity of considering the explanation which the Minister gave earlier to-day about horse-power.  I would like an opportunity further to consider that.  We wanted to get that explanation about horse-power before we considered amending the Schedule in other respects. It is necessary to mention it now.  We may require also to put in an amendment now that we know the horse-power provisions for hackney vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, as I see it, is that, under this Schedule, the rates will be operative at the figures which we have already discussed on the Financial Resolutions.  It would be impossible for anybody who was not aware of all the technicalities involved to follow the intricacies of this section, but, as I understood the Minister's speech on Second Reading, he assured the House that this Schedule merely put into legislative form the exact proportionate figures which were in the original White Paper which was circulated. The Schedule must put into legislative form the material that was included in the Financial Resolutions, but, on the assumption that it does put into legislative form the increases visualised in the White Paper, we know where we stand and, with the new explanation we have now got from the <Col N="305" /> Minister in regard to horse-power, we can see where we stand with regard to Report Stage amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking earlier to-day I referred to the considerable increase in the number of unemployed since the advent of this Government.  In the industrial analysis supplied to all Deputies, 596 of these unemployed men are classified as general building, construction and repair workers, and the reason given for their being unemployed is &ldquo;slackness in building and allied trades&rdquo;.  Every Deputy must be well aware of this retrogression and of the reasons for it.  It is a definite result of the restriction in credit, following the speeches made by leading members of the Government shortly after their taking office.  The House will recall that, in connection with the inter-Party Government's extensive housebuilding operations, at no time was finance the limiting <Col N="306" /> factor.  The only hold-up was caused by the fact that there was not sufficient skilled labour available to do the work.</P>
      <P>We can also recall that when we were encouraging our young men, who had previously emigrated to Britain, to come home again and engage on this work, they were told by our opponents that it would hardly be advisable for them to do so.  However, they came home in great numbers and found employment here.  The building trade also absorbed many lads who otherwise would be unemployed.  I have in mind a family from my own town who were known for many miles away as excellent wheelwrights and where the trade had been handed down for generations.  The father died leaving a young family.  The eldest boy came to Dublin and got immediate employment as a carpenter.  I met him again on the day of the North-West Dublin by-election.  He was poorly clad and showing obvious signs of distress.  When I asked what had happened, he said he had been tramping to the labour exchange for the last six months but had given up hope.  He went out that night on the boat to England.  He told me there were many others like him who were throwing in the sponge as they could not see any possibility of re-employment in the building industry in the near future. He had also noted that we had exported timber very shortly before that, that we had sent out supplies which some years ago we were so anxious to obtain for housebuilding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was certainly a sad experience for me &mdash; I am not speaking in the political sense &mdash; as it would be for any rural Deputy, when brought for the first time into close knowledge of the present conditions, where people are dwelling in very close confinement in houses completely unfit to give even normal accommodation to a reasonable-sized family.  In our travelling around in East Cabra, we came across some pitiful cases.  There was one of 14 adults and three children sleeping in three rooms.  I did not think such conditions existed in this country.  How can the Government be complacent in such circumstances?  We know that very good work has been done, but we should not spare any effort in ensuring <Col N="307" /> that by making the money available the skilled men will be retained to provide reasonable accommodation in the shortest possible time.  It is, therefore, with considerable disquiet that people now look to the future.</P>
    <P>We have had the conditions clearly put before the people in one constituency and they have answered in no uncertain fashion.  I think one member of the Government commented on the fact that they looked now to the rural areas to try to make up for the very grave losses in a Dublin constituency. I would remind that Deputy that it was only in the cities that Fianna Fáil made any showing at the last general election, and the reason was obvious &mdash; they went out on a policy of criticism of the few points increase in the cost of living which had taken place, as we are told now by this Government, as a result of the breaking out of hostilities in Korea.  Not a single member of the present Government, not a single Deputy opposite, would admit at that time that that was so.  Those hostilities resulted in very much increased shipping charges, and we were affected to a considerable extent while, on the other hand, the increases we might have expected for commodities we had to sell had not time to take effect.</P>
    <P>In my constituency industry is not a very important factor as it is principally agricultural, yet I see in the statistical report that there were 595 unemployed there on the 30th August last.  That is very far from reassuring. We should also note that some 5,000 men have been absorbed into the Defence Forces since the advent of this Government.  Many of those would now be on the unemployed list if they had not been recruited into the Army.  Is it something to be proud of that in the unemployment analysis it is to be seen that there are 217 more unemployed discharged members of the Defence Forces to-day than there were when the present Government attained office?  We cannot give any encouragement to their colleagues, now driving hackney cars or acting as lorry drivers &mdash; quite a number have been absorbed into the motor industry &mdash; that in the <Col N="308" /> foreseeable future they will not lose their employment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government spoke quite candidly to-day of the concern it was occasioning him that in the City of Cork where a considerable number are employed in that very important industry, many have been laid off work.  He contended that the increase now being effected in motor taxation could not be responsible for that.  At Question Time to-day we were informed that the cost of tyres, petrol, oil, servicing of motor vehicles has risen by 28 per cent. since the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government this time.  Surely that was enough of an impost, without saddling hackney owners and others, in cities and small towns, with this new threat to the employment which they have enjoyed heretofore.  When Fianna Fáil got back into office they made some very strong appeals to the people of the country to increase production but they made no effort whatever to ensure that the cost of production would even be kept stable not to speak of being reduced.  We can point to considerable increases in production costs in practically all spheres of activity in this country.  In this connection, I refer in particular to the increased costs which the agricultural community now have to bear.</P>
    <P>When the agricultural community answer the call and produce more they are then informed by the Minister that although costs are increasing the price obtaining for the commodities they produce is reduced.  He points out that production has increased and that that is responsible for the reduction in the price they obtain for the finished product.</P>
    <P>I regard that as being discouraging for production.  Having answered the call, they are then mulcted for having done the duty which they were told was an obligation on them to do.  Consequently, there is a growing feeling among producers that they must get some long-term guarantee and some assurance so far as it is in the power of the authorities to do so that increased production will not mean to them a lesser return on investment and on the work which they put into their efforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> No matter how the Government may seek to gild the lily in an endeavour to prove that the picture is not really a black one, unemployment figures and emigration figures prove the contrary.  When we are on our way to the Dáil and halt at Limerick Junction, we find dozens of young men and girls in the prime of life on their way to Great Britain seeking work denied to them at home. We cannot be complacent in view of these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The people who are in employment have no guarantee that that employment will continue.  Every section of the community is mulcted by the increased cost of living which shows no sign whatever of being stabilised even at its present level.  Clothing has again increased in price during recent weeks in spite of statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; and accepted by us&mdash; that he did not foresee an increase in the price of clothing in the near future.  That, however, is occurring and, as other speakers have pointed out, there is a recession in trade.  If firms are not actually leaving off staff at this time of the year, they are not recruiting the additional staff for the Christmas rush which they did in recent years.  All that would indicate that the raid made upon the people's pockets and the housewives' purses in the last Budget has been so effective that the people now have not the wherewithal to meet the normal requirements of life.</P>
    <P>We indicated earlier the 20 point increase that occurred in the cost of living but when the present Government were in opposition they took great pains to indicate that there were many items excluded in arriving at that index figure which should have been borne in mind, items such as the simple luxuries which the normal working man enjoys, the cigarette, the pint of stout.  It was in regard to these that the present Government made the most severe attack on the working classes.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that when they introduced their Supplementary Budget in October, 1947, the Government stated at that time that it was <Col N="310" /> necessary so that they could meet their commitments in relation to the food subsidies.  This year, by one fell blow, food subsidies were reduced and practically abolished and an increased tax far in excess of what was imposed in 1947 was put on the people.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may claim that the people could well do without these luxuries, the tax upon which was designed, we were told by the Minister for Finance, not to effect a reduction in our consumption, but to bring more money into the Exchequer.  We now have a clear statement on the authority of that Minister that there were defects in the Budget.  That statement was made when certain sections asked for increased pay to meet the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>That brings me back again to the point that some items which were taxed extremely heavily in that Budget were not in effect luxuries. Deputy Vivion de Valera, speaking at a rally in County Clare, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 5th January, 1948, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know in the case of the pint that it is a very welcome addition to those who have to depend on a cold lunch and that the pint of stout is almost as much a necessity as the other.  I can assure you that nobody regretted more than we did that there was no way in which we could get the amount required except by the particular device adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was surely an implication there that there was regret at having imposed these taxes at that time and also an admission that the money which it was expected to get from these taxes was not forthcoming. Surely his listeners at that rally in County Clare must have believed that the Government had mended its ways? At least, the Fianna Fáil Party was the Government when these taxes were imposed.</P>
    <P>The people in the constituency of the Minister for Finance were assured at the last election that the charges made by the people on this side of the House that if Fianna Fáil got back into office the food subsidies would go were not correct.  The people who <Col N="311" /> have now slashed the food subsidies are those who have been in office for the past one and a half years.  During the present Government's term of office we have had an increase in the number of unemployed.  This increase is more than disturbing.  There is the increased cost of living, an increase, may I remark, which started long before the subsidies were abolished. These increases, we are now told, are attributable to factors outside our control.</P>
    <P>Who outside this country asked the Minister for Finance to abolish the food subsidies?  Was not the retention of the food subsidies the subject matter of item 15 in the proclamation which was made in this Dáil when it met the first night, and which was submitted to the Independent Deputies who voted Fianna Fáil into office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much experience in this House and I am guided principally by having read up previous debates on Supplies and Services.  In 1950 I could not find in Opposition statements a single strong reference beyond a continual wail about the cost of living and unemployment. That is why I refer to the matter now. It has always been the case that estimating the numbers of unemployed, the numbers emigrating and the cost of living gave the clearest indication as to whether a Government was pursuing a policy which was in the best interests of the country.</P>
      <P>In explaining these views on this matter we are not merely expressing our own views, but the views of our executives, the views of our branches, and those of the people we meet when we journey home at the week-end. To-day there is a concerted clamour throughout the country by the people for an immediate chance to record their complete disapproval of the present policy of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is their desire that a general election be held at the earliest possible date to give the people who had not the opportunity which the <Col N="312" /> people in North-West Dublin had of uniting to give this country a Government which will provide for the people employment and a standard of living which will not attract the attentions of a Minister for Finance such as has occurred this year, in the form of a raid on their pockets so that they would not live too well. They cannot see any progress being made while the present Government remains in office.  They see them at sixes and sevens and doing things for which they secured no mandate and which they gave no indication of their intention of doing, if they were returned to power.</P>
    <P>We feel that it is desirable now that the people who elected the Deputies who voted this Government into office&mdash;not members of the Government Party, but Deputies who were elected on inter-Party tickets and who did that in opposition to the wishes of their electors&mdash;and the people who elected Fianna Fáil to reduce the cost of living, to reduce unemployment and to make the country so prosperous, should now get the opportunity which the people of North-West Dublin got and used so effectively.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that since they came into power again, Fianna Fáil are a sadder and a wiser Party.  For three long years, they carried on an unrelenting attack on the inter-Party Government.  Everything they did was wrong, according to Fianna Fáil, and they stooped to the lowest tricks to bring about the downfall of that Government.  They are now the Government again and we see changed times.  We see more unrest than we saw perhaps in the past ten years, chiefly caused by the removal of the subsidies at such short notice. Bank restrictions were ordered by the Government, which brought about building restrictions.  On top of that, motor taxation was increased and work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which was giving so much employment, has slowed up and almost closed down.</P>
      <P>The land reclamation scheme which ought to be in full blast and publicised in every paper, national and local, has almost dried up also and we find a recession of trade, with unemployment piling up.  We see men leaving the country and the building trade which was booming for a number of years has now practically stopped.  We see the men who were indispensable, so far as the building trade is concerned, leaving the country, perhaps never to come back.  In addition, we have had a year of strikes and unrest, a year in which the cost of living has soared and emigration and unemployment have been rife.  Our middle-class people are denied under this Government the right to build their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as my own county is concerned, I see a trend within agriculture which I do not like at all &mdash; the farmers, in view of the cost of the commodities they have to buy to carry on their farming, are now engaged in sowing grass seed almost to their hall doors, because they feel there is no other hope for them.  That is a sorry spectacle after a year or two of Fianna Fáil's return to power and they must <Col N="314" /> feel ashamed of themselves.  They told us that if the inter-Party Government were thrown out, there would be peace and plenty and work for all, if they were given the chance.  Fianna Fáil have had their chance over a long number of years.  I read in to-day's papers that the Taoiseach expects to be coming home next week &mdash; I hope, restored to full health and vigour. What is the picture which the Minister must present to him?  It will not be one to make him happy but one which will make him realise that things have gone to the dogs since he went away.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are allowing trouble and unrest to develop throughout the country. In my town of Navan, over many months, I saw a long and bitter strike in the furniture trade.  There were 600 or 800 men out on strike, fighting for a higher wage, and some of the big magnates who are strongest in the furniture trade in that area were quite happy about that strike, gloating that it would go on and that the final result might be that the smaller interests in the furniture trade would be squeezed out and one or two of them would control the furniture industry in the town.  That was the picture: on one side, men crying for increased wages and, on the other, men carrying on big business delighted that the strike was continuing because it would squeeze out the small man.  I am happy to say that the strike has been settled, but I am not so happy in the thought that these people who, for eight or ten long weeks, went through a hard and cruel time were left to fend for themselves and that the Government were not in the least worried.</P>
    <P>These men in the furniture business who are earning £5 and £6 a week found that the cost of living was bearing so heavily on them that they had to demand increased wages, while in the country our agricultural workers are trying to live on half that wage. What must be the position of these people in the rural areas?  Certainly there is distress and misery in almost all the homes of the agricultural workers and they never found things so tight.  Many of them are now seeking home assistance and others are seeking increased benefits at the labour exchange.  There is a complete <Col N="315" /> wave of unrest throughout the country and I ask the Government to make some effort to right matters or to declare a general election and make way for some Government that will try to clean up the mess.  The present position is certainly one of the most deplorable we have had over a long period.  There is not the slightest excuse for it, because there should be full and plenty here and there should be work for all our people at a reasonable wage provided the Government adopts proper business methods.  Instead of that they are devising all kinds of plans and practices to show that the inter-Party Government was a failure and that is why Fianna Fáil find themselves in the position in which they are to-day.</P>
    <P>They should have taken over where the inter-Party Government left off. They should have ensured the continuation of the excellent schemes initiated by that Government, such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act. They should have continued the operation of that Act until such time as all the poor land and the bogs were drained in order to give the farmer more land and better land.  They have made every effort to put down the &ldquo;Dillon&rdquo; scheme.  If the land reclamation project was put into full operation the farmers would have thousands of acres of land, but the Government is making no effort to put the necessary drive into that scheme. A sum of £40,000,000 was earmarked for that scheme, to be spent at the rate of £2,000,000 per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary man is absolutely fleeced.  The lives of those at the bottom are too hard, while the lives of those at the top are too easy, and no effort is made to achieve a happy medium or to alleviate the lot <Col N="316" /> of those people who are quite unable to bear the impositions cast upon them. The position of the ordinary farm labourer living on a small pittance, with seven or eight children to rear, is absolutely cruel.  The Minister should go down the country and see things for himself.  He will find things there that will rend his heart with sorrow.  It should not be necessary for us to come here and paint the picture for him. Only this morning I received a letter from a widow in County Meath whose husband died suddenly last June at a football match in Mullingar.  She says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am living here with my three children, aged 12 years, ten years and two years, and receiving 38/- widow's pension, plus 5/- home assistance. When my husband was alive the rent and rates of our cottage were only 1/9 per week, and when it was transferred to me the council increased the rent to 3/8 per week.  I wonder, Mr. Giles, if you would kindly see if I could buy out the cottage at the old rent, as it would not be worth doing so under the new rent?  I am unable to carry on any longer as I have to buy a bag of coal every week at 11/- per bag, and pay 4/8 per week for milk and keep 3/8 for rent. You can see that I have absolutely nothing left for food.  I could not buy any coal last week trying to make up 14/8 for the rent collector on Tuesday, with the result that myself and the children are perished all this week for the want of a fire.  I have no fire as I am writing this letter to you, and there is no place around that I could turn for any.  It is almost a village here where we live. I will have to let the cottage go altogether, and then the children will have no home.  I cannot go anywhere to work myself.  My youngest child is only two years old and has a bad chest.  He was in hospital on two occasions with it.  Trusting in your kindness, that you will do something for me.  Yours &mdash; Mrs. Mary Mooney.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just one letter from a decent woman who finds herself in a desperate financial position.  She cannot cope with the rise in the cost of living.  Her <Col N="317" /> home assistance is useless.  Her pension is merely a pittance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to come to the aid of these people.  There should be full and plenty for everybody in the country.  Our resources are great. There is no reason why there should not be full employment at a reasonable wage for all our people.  Doles and pittances will never make us a nation. Yet, that is all we have &mdash; unemployment, home assistance and doles.  Our position is one that no Christian Government should tolerate.  We have had 30 years of native Government, and yet we find ourselves in this extraordinary situation to-day.  That widow I have mentioned is only one of the scores who find themselves in a position analogous to hers.  Deputy Hilliard gets letters in the same way as I do.  So does Deputy Matt O'Reilly.  These people's situation is pitiable.</P>
    <P>Our able-bodied men should be employed on the land and our farmers should be in a position to give that employment.  Despite our independence over the last 30 years there is to-day no hope of solving our unemployment problem. The removal of the subsidies this year was, I think, the meanest act that Fianna Fáil has ever performed.  The removal of the subsidies does not affect the well-to-do.  They can buy full and plenty.  The diet of the ordinary man is the loaf of bread, the cup of tea, and the egg if he can get it. Now the loaf of bread is a luxury.  We will find our people back again to potatoes and salt under their own Government, something to which they never had to revert for long years under an alien Government.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do something to alleviate the position.  All over my own county there are scores of young men begging for work.  They are asking the county councils and the Deputies to find work for them.  Those who are lucky enough to get work are on for three days and off for three days.  I hope some plans will be made at an early date to provide work for our people over the Christmas period. If that is not done, we will find ourselves back to the hunger marches, the unrest and the strife.  There should <Col N="318" /> be no need for that.  There is a remedy, and it should be applied.</P>
    <P>Credit is restricted, and the farmer cannot now get a loan of £100 or £200 to improve his land and give employment in the improving of it.  At the behest of the Government the banks will not give him credit.  This Government is acting on the orders of the Government in London.  This Government is allowing itself to be dictated to by a bully just as our people were dictated to for 700 years.  If the banks were ordered to give credit to the farmers, our position would be a very happy one, for we would double production in a few years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have tried to reverse all that was done by the inter-Party Government.  During the three years in which that Government was in office we had peace, unity and progress. We had full employment.  We had a full building programme.  We had land reclamation.  Emigration had almost ceased.  The jail gates had been thrown open.  There was no discontent. The moment Fianna Fáil returned to office there was unemployment, trouble and turmoil.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to make some effort to remedy the present situation and to hold out some hope to those who cannot fend for themselves. The Government should alleviate the position of the underdog.  It should not allow aliens to come in here to live riotously.  Every day I see tracts of land in my own county, in Dublin and Kildare, being bought up by foreigners.  These lands are bought by syndicates, combines and companies in order to evade the 25 per cent.  The Government has made no effort to put an end to that practice.  I ask that a full inquiry be made into the position and a remedy found.  When they buy they say the lands will be used for tillage.  We see the results in 12 months: grass to the hall doors, whiteheaded bullocks in the fields and nothing else.</P>
    <P>We who have to stand in the neighbourhood and see these things happen feel that it is a sad day.  We put the British out of the North Wall but they are now coming in by other avenues and they are buying up property.  If we do not take some <Col N="319" /> action in the matter then Fianna Fáil and the nation will curse the day they allowed it to happen.  Let the Government go back and work for the Irish people, for the little man who works in the bogs and in remote areas, for the people who are in misery &mdash; people whose husbands and sons could not obtain work at home and who had to go to a foreign country in order to make a living for themselves.  No effort is being made by this Government to cure these ills.  The policy of the inter-Party Government was full employment, a good building programme and peace and prosperity.  Let Fianna Fáil go back and take over where we left off.  Then there will be peace and plenty in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, by agreement, I may move a number of motions which stand in my name on the Order Paper concerning the price of bread and flour.</P>
      <P>The first motion is Motion No. 23:</P>
      <P>That the Bread (Prices) Order, 1952 (Amendment), Order, 1952 (S.I. No. 268 of 1952), be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>The second motion, Motion No. 24, is:</P>
      <P>That the Flour and Wheatenmeal (Maximum Retail Prices) (No. 2) Order, 1952 (S.I. No. 269 of 1952), be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>The third motion is Motion No. 25:</P>
      <P>That the Flour and Wheatenmeal Order, 1952 (Amendment), Order, 1952 (S.I. No. 270 of 1952), be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>The fourth motion is Motion No. 26 and it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that a public investigation should be undertaken by the Prices Advisory Body, or some other tribunal, to determine whether or not the increases in the price of bread, flour and wheatenmeal provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the three recent Orders in this matter are essential and, in particular, to report to Dáil Éireann on each of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The total additional cost <Col N="320" /> which the consuming public will have to pay as a result of the said Orders&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) to firms engaged in the manufacture of bread,</P>
    <P>(ii) to firms engaged in the combined business of milling wheaten flour and the manufacture of bread,</P>
    <P>(iii)  to firms engaged in the business of flour milling.</P>
    <P>(b)  The percentage of the increased receipts (which would result from the operation of the said Orders) by each of the three categories of firms referred to above which would be devoted to the payment of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) increased wages,</P>
    <P>(ii) profit and interest on capital,</P>
    <P>(iii) increased directors' fees and salaries of higher executives.</P>
    <P>(c) The extent to which any portion of the increased receipts accruing from the increased price of bread and flour is likely to be used by some of the larger firms involved for the purpose of extending their trade throughout the State to the detriment of the smaller provincial bakeries.</P>
    <P>I tabled these motions immediately following upon the making of a number of Orders by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At that time, the Dáil was not sitting.  I felt it was essential that, as soon as possible, the Dáil should have an opportunity of considering the Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>My reasons for tabling these motions were, in the first place, that any increase in the price of bread and flour was bound further to add to the spiral which had been set in motion by the Budget.  In the second place, I felt that, in the situation which exists in the country at the moment where there is a constant race between prices and wages, it was highly detrimental that any increase in the price of one of the most essential commodities that the public consumes should be permitted by the Government without the fullest public investigation.  I also felt that <Col N="321" /> the announcement which was made in the Press a few days after the Orders had actually been made by the Minister was intended to convey that the increases were rendered wholly necessary as a result of increases in wages granted to operatives in the bakery and milling trades.  On a very rough calculation of the amounts involved, I very soon came to the conclusion that the full amount involved was not likely to be passed on to the operatives in these trades.  I felt that while portion of the amount might reach the workers by way of increased wages, a large portion of the money which was being extracted from the public would, in fact, never reach the workers and that it would go either to the Exchequer, by way of an additional tax on one of the most essential commodities that the public consume, or to swell the already not insubstantial profits of the master bakers and millers.  The amount involved, as far as the consuming public is concerned, is not far below £500,000.  As a result of these Orders the public will, in the future, have to pay between £450,000 and £500,000 more for bread and flour.  That is quite a substantial sum of money.  I have not yet been able to ascertain from the Minister the exact proportion of this amount which will reach the workers employed in the industry by way of increased wages.</P>
    <P>As regards the increases in the price of bread, the Minister indicated that the amount involved in wage increases comes to £200,000.  The amount involved, as far as the consuming public is concerned, in respect of bread is between £330,000 and £350,000.  I must say that I am not satisfied that even the £200,000 mentioned by the Minister as being the figure necessary to cover the increase in wages is accurate.  I should like to see a breakdown of that figure.  If it is possible to say that the total amount involved in wages is £200,000 then it should be possible to show how that calculation is arrived at.  Assuming, however, that £200,000 is the amount involved, we have still to learn where the balance is going &mdash; that is, a sum of £130,000 or £150,000.  The Minister has said that this sum will go to the Exchequer.  If it is going to the Exchequer it means <Col N="322" /> that the consuming public are being taxed without a Vote from the Dáil to provide revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I think it is a dangerous precedent that revenue should be provided for the Exchequer in this manner.  It would be a temptation to any Government to increase the price of bread by one farthing if, as a result of that increase, the Minister for Finance were to reap an additional £150,000.  That is not the full figure because in addition the Orders in question provided for an increase in the price of flour of 1/3 per sack ex-mill.  The total consumption of flour amounts to something in the neighbourhood of 3,000,000 cwt. annually and accordingly the increase permitted by the Minister's Orders provides for a sum of £165,000 or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>Again we were told that this increase in the price of flour was intended to cover an increase in the wages of the operatives employed in the milling trade.  Yet, after this announcement had been made, we saw that the operatives in the milling trade were negotiating for an increase in their wages.  We saw that their case came before the Labour Court and that the award made by the Labour Court was not accepted. I think, if I am not mistaken, we even saw that strike notices had been issued by the operatives because they had not received an increase, so that at the time these Orders were made, as far as I know &mdash; I may be wrong in this; I am subject to correction on the point&mdash; the operatives in the mills had not received that increase at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed at that stage that any increase made would be retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, in effect, a sum of somewhere around £165,000 is being provided by these Orders to cover possible increases which the Labour Court might grant to the operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far more definite than that.  The Labour Court has made a recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is entitled to have full particulars of the number of persons employed, the total wage bill and the increases which are being granted or which are likely to be granted.  We are dealing here with very large sums of public moneys which amount to close on £500,000.</P>
      <P>Surely the House is entitled to a fairly full account as to how this additional money is to be spent.  The net effect of these Orders is in effect to tax the consuming public to the extent of £500,000.  This House is entitled to have full particulars as to how this £500,000 is going to be spent.  I think it would be probably far more satisfactory if, instead of discussing these matters here, the Minister agreed to have the matter investigated by the Prices Advisory Body.  A body of that kind is much better equipped than this House to investigate the matter fully. I should like to see full particulars furnished by some responsible body of the amount of wages paid by the mills, by the master bakers and, particularly, by the big firms that are engaged in milling and baking.  I should like to see, side by side with that information, full particulars of the increases in wages that have been granted and of the amount necessary to cover these increases, instead of merely telling us in general terms that because the workers in the industry received, or were likely to receive in the future an unspecified amount, the public was called upon to pay an extra £500,000.</P>
      <P>I must say that I could not help feeling that to a certain extent an attempt was being made to throw the blame for the full increase in the price of bread and flour on the workers in that particular industry.  In point of fact, we know that a large portion of the increase is not going to the workers in the industry but is going into the Exchequer.  The Minister, I think, admitted that in this House in reply to questions.  The Minister does not agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will bear with me if I refer to questions that were asked in the Dáil by myself <Col N="324" /> on the 23rd October last.  As reported in column 211 of the Dáil Debates of the 23rd October, the Minister stated that the total amount of increased wages, so far as bakery operatives were concerned, was £225,000, and that the increase in the price of bread was going to produce £330,000.  I then put the question to the Minister: &ldquo;So there is £100,000 going into somebody's pocket?&rdquo; and the Minister replied that it was going into nobody's pocket.  He then said that it would go to the benefit of the subsidy, that the subsidy was being adjusted to get that money.  I then asked: &ldquo;It goes to the Treasury?&rdquo; and the Minister for Finance, in his usual helpful fashion, came in to help the Minister, and said: &ldquo;To the taxpayers' pocket.&rdquo;  The Minister then said: &ldquo;If anyone benefits, it is the taxpayer.&rdquo; I have not seen any indication that there is to be any remission of taxes or that the taxpayers will benefit in any way.  We know that the taxpayer is being asked to pay more for his flour and bread and, so far as I know, he is not getting any relief. The whole of this matter is particularly disturbing having regard to the general feeling of uneasiness that exists in regard to the organisation of the millers and the milling trade, and also to the large bakery milling firms.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has already agreed in the House earlier to-day, and on another occasion, that the whole price structure relating to the production of flour and bread, and the whole organisation of the industry need to be overhauled.  We know from investigations that were carried out recently that the cost of production of a sack of flour varies from 5/- to 19/- according to the way in which it is produced. We know that substantial sums are allowed to the millers under the heading of depreciation in the value of machinery, sums which I think are regarded, even in the Minister's own Department, as being grossly in excess of the sums that should be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>We know also &mdash; and I think if the Minister looks through his files he will find a number of reports dealing with this question&mdash; that the basis upon which interest and <Col N="325" /> profit are allowed to the milling firms depends upon an exaggerated assessment of the capital value of the firms involved.</P>
      <P>I think that, if the Minister takes the trouble to read through the report that was made recently by the committee, presided over by Mr. Justice Lavery, in regard to the production of bread and flour, he will find that the statements which I am making are substantially correct.  We know, too, that some of these firms have been making substantial profits in recent years.  We know that some of the bakery firms have been paying high dividends, up to close on 20 per cent. In these circumstances, at a time when every section of the community, particularly the wage earners in the community, are being asked to reduce their standard of living, it would seem not unreasonable to suggest that the accounts of these firms should be carefully scrutinised before any increase is granted in the price of bread and flour.</P>
      <P>We also know that the discounts allowed by millers to wholesalers, and to some of the bakeries, is a variable amount.  It varies in some cases from 1/- per sack to well over 2/- per sack. Is it not possible that some saving could have been made in these discounts, or in the rate of interest payable or in the production costs of some of the millers, which would enable them to meet any increase in wages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, quite apart from these particular considerations, it does seem, at a time when the wage earners and workers in the country are being exhorted not to make fresh demands for an increase in wages, and when everybody is being told that they must economise, that, before any increase is granted in the price of an essential commodity, there should be a full public investigation.  It seems to me that, in this direction, the Government should be the first to give an example of restraint and caution.  These Orders were made and an announcement was published a few days subsequently in the papers regarding them, but in so far as it gave any information at all, it was misleading information generally, <Col N="326" /> because it sought to convey the impression on the public that the full increase in the price of bread was due to the workers, and that the workers in this industrial group could be blamed for the increase.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that, in this situation, if it was found necessary to provide for any increase in the cost of the production of flour and bread, that that increase, in the course of production, so far as it is related to an increase in wages, should have been met by subsidy.  These fresh increases, unless they are halted, will inevitably mean fresh demands for an increase in wages.</P>
    <P>In one of the motions which is before the House, I have asked that the Minister should refer this question to the Prices Advisory Body or to some other tribunal.  I do not wish to limit the Minister's discretion to the Prices Advisory Body.  The Minister has from time to time, possibly for, I think, political reasons criticised the Prices Advisory Body.  I, therefore, did not want to give the Minister the excuse that he did not like the Prices Advisory Body.  If he does not like the Prices Advisory Body, I would be quite satisfied if he were to set up a special <i>ad hoc</i> inquiry to investigate this question publicly.  My only insistence is that there should be an investigation, and that that investigation should take place under the searchlight of public opinion.</P>
    <P>Personally, I would say that the Prices Advisory Body would be the best body before whom such an investigation could be carried out.  I frankly cannot see any reason why the Minister does not accept that proposal.  If the facts I am stating, and if the allegations I am making are incorrect, why not have a full public investigation? Why not allow the question of the costings of the millers and of the milling-baker firms be investigated publicly?  If the facts are as stated by the Minister, why does he fear an investigation?  Is there any reason, and if there is, the public is entitled to know it.  I think I am not being unfair to the Minister in saying that there is general public uneasiness at the making of Orders of this kind behind closed doors without a public <Col N="327" /> investigation.  The Minister may retort that Orders of the kind were made before.  They may have been, but they were not made in the circumstancs in which we say the Government should give an example itself.  If any set of wage earners in any industry seek an increase in their wages, they have to submit their claim for the increase to a public investigation by the Labour Court.  I see no reason why the same principle should not be applied in the case of producers of essential commodities such as bread and flour.</P>
    <P>In the motion, I have asked that a number of specific matters should be referred for investigation, particularly by the Prices Advisory Body or by any other tribunal set up to investigate these increases.  I have asked, first of all, that the investigation should ascertain the total amount which firms engaged in the manufacture of bread purely will receive as a result of the increased price; secondly, the amount which firms who are engaged in the combined operation of milling and baking will receive as a result of these Orders; thirdly, the total amount which the millers will receive as a result of these Orders.</P>
    <P>In other words, I have asked that there should be a special report showing the breakdown of the incidence of the additional prices that are being charged.  I have then asked that there should be a further breakdown showing the exact amount of the increase which is to be utilised for increased wages, for increased profits and interest on capital, for increased directors' fees and salaries of higher executives.  As the Minister has told us that portion of this is to go into the Exchequer, then I think we should also know the exact amount of this money which will find its way into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested that there should be an investigation to determine what proportion, if any, of the increase in the price of bread is likely to be used by some of the bakery firms to extend their competition throughout the country against some of the smaller bakery establishments.  We know that some of the big firms have apparently a sufficiently high margin to enable <Col N="328" /> them to advertise very extensively in the daily newspapers.  We can see the advertisements that are published regularly by some of the bigger firms, presumably in order to extend their competition.  We also know that a great many of the bigger firms, particularly ones situated in Dublin, are extending their sphere of competition right through the country.  It pays them to send vans for long distances away from Dublin in order to sell more bread in competition with the local and smaller bakers.  These firms, of course, in many ways have an advantage over some of the provincial firms because the cost of transport and of raw materials to them is smaller.  The public would be interested to know what proportion, if any, of these increases is likely to be utilised to enable these bakery firms to extend their range of competition.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister agrees that the whole of the milling and baking industry needs to be overhauled, that there should be an examination of the whole position.  I am glad that he takes that viewpoint.  Anyone who knows anything about the conditions in the industry will realise that it is highly unsatisfactory to find that, although the intentions that created the present situation were, I am sure, quite good, the results are such that one might not expect to find them anywhere but in a mental home.</P>
    <P>There is a position in which some millers are subsidised not to produce flour, a position where some of them by a quota arrangement are restricted to producing only a certain quantity of flour; if they produce more than their quota they have to pay a fine. There is a situation wherein the costs of production vary from 5/- per sack to upwards of 19/- per sack.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain the Minister realises that the conditions could not be more unsatisfactory than they are in that industry and I welcome the indication which he has given that he considers the time has come to have the whole position overhauled.  But that is probably a long time objective, and I suggest that in the meanwhile, in order to relieve the public uneasiness which exists in relation to the recent increases which were granted, and in <Col N="329" /> order particularly that the Government should itself set a good headline, he should agree to refer the question of these increases to the Prices Advisory Body or to any other tribunal he may care to set up.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way insistent that it should be referred to a tribunal for investigation in the exact terms in which this motion is framed.  The motion does cover some of the most essential questions which the public would like to see investigated.  If the Minister has additional matters which he would like to see investigated in connection with the industry, he can easily include them in the motion and I would willingly accept any suggestion of his on the matter.  In conclusion, I want to say that I can conceive no reason why the Minister should be afraid of a public investigation into this matter.  If the facts are as he has stated, there is sufficient public uneasiness concerning this whole question to justify the fullest possible public investigation.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate to protest against the action of Deputy Giles in introducing and parading before this House the intimate details of the family circumstances of a widow in his constituency. That would, of course, be quite permissible if the widow's name was not mentioned, but I think it is a detestable thing when a citizen of this State writes to a Deputy setting forth her particular troubles that her letter and her name should be read out in this House.  I do not mind very much whether or not this lady gave Deputy Giles her consent to the reading of that letter.  It is wrong that the troubles and the intimate circumstances of that family should be publicly paraded in this House. Deputy Giles referred to a series of misfortunes which have befallen this particular family, that the husband died suddenly when attending a football match and that one of the children had contracted some disease. All those details were paraded before this House without, I believe, any justification, cause or reason.  We all know how the Balbriggan widow was ridiculed from the Government side of <Col N="330" /> the House two or three years ago.  Now the County Meath widow is introduced, but I hope that there is nobody on the Government side of the House who will ridicule her circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have no objection.  I want to deal with the point raised by Deputy Giles.  He said that this woman was receiving only a modest widow's pension, but he did not mention that that pension was very substantially increased over the past year.  He did not mention the fact that, previous to the passing of legislation in this House last year, that pension would have been very considerably less than it is.  He also failed to mention that this woman has received an increase in her children's allowances as a result of legislation during the past year.  In fact, the main complaint which she made was against the county council of which Deputy Giles is a member, because, in the first place, they did not supplement her home assistance, she was allowed only 3/- per week, and, in addition, when her husband died, on the transfer of the tenancy of her cottage to herself, the rent was very considerably increased.  I think that that is a very grave indictment of the county council of which Deputy Giles is a member.  Instead of bringing this <Col N="331" /> pathetic case into this House and parading the details of this woman's family circumstances here, he should have gone immediately to his own local authority and sought redress for her.</P>
      <P>I feel that Deputy Morrissey, in widening the scope of this debate to deal with the higher cost of living and with unemployment, overlooked quite a considerable number of factors.  He overlooked the fact that, during the tenure of office of the Government of which he was a member, this country was in receipt of very substantial home assistance from the United States.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey brought all those issues into this debate which the Minister had opened mainly on the points raised in Deputy MacBride's motion, that is, the price of bread.  I think it is no harm to remind Deputy Morrissey that in widening the scope of the debate and bringing in all those matters he overlooked quite a number of important factors.  Deputy Morrissey said that whatever unemployment and trade recession exist are due entirely to what he called gloomy speeches delivered by Ministers.  Now, if gloomy speeches can affect the trade, commerce and industry of this country to the extent Deputy Morrissey suggests then we are in for a very bad period as a result of the speech which he delivered to-day. I have never heard in this House a more pessimistic, gloomy or depressing speech.  He told us that factories were closing down, that factory premises were available in large numbers <Col N="333" /> and could not be sold, that newly-built houses were for sale all over the place and could not find a buyer.  If Deputy Morrissey continues in this strain and is allowed to do so, all the auctioneers in this city and in the surrounding districts will be completely out of business.  I do not think, however, that it is necessary for Deputy Morrissey to be so extremely pessimistic. I believe that we will overcome the difficulties which this nation must undoubtedly experience as a result, in the main, of world conditions. We must do so by our own efforts and by a spirit of enterprise and initiative, not by the gloomy and depressing forecasts and prophecies with which Deputy Morrissey has regaled the House and so depressed it.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every phase of the economic life of this country,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is worse than last year.&rdquo;  I do not think that is true.  There are many phases of the economic life of this country which are substantially better than they were last year.  The position of agriculture does not show any decline as compared with last year, and I think the prospects for agriculture for the coming year are reasonably good.  If we were to follow the advice of Deputy Giles our prospects would not be so good. He said the farmers in County Meath are sowing grass.  I did not think it was necessary to sow grass, but apparently they have sown it in Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity more of our farmers do not sow grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about County Meath.  I always thought there was plenty of grass there.  I do think it would be very foolish to extend the acreage of grass at the present day having regard to the reduction in the number of live stock and in the number of cows which are the fundamental source of live stock. Surely it does not make for an improvement in the situation to have Deputy Giles advising his supporters to lay down an increased acreage of grass.  He should be advising them to increase the area under cultivation and provide the crops for which there is a ready and secure market in this <Col N="334" /> country.  As far as I know, there is no physical limit at the moment to the market for all the feeding barley and wheat that we can produce in this country in the coming year.  If the acreage in these two crops is substantially increased there is no danger whatever of the market being glutted. If we face the future with courage and with confidence there is a great opportunity for expansion in the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>There has been over the past few years a substantial expansion in industry, and I hope that will continue. There are some industries which are finding the going hard, but there are others, as Deputy Crotty very fairly pointed out, which are holding their own and even improving their position. If we look around us and seek out ways and means of expanding agricultural and industrial production, we will be doing far more to provide employment for our people here in Ireland, and to overcome the economic difficulties that face us than we are going to do by wailing, as some Deputies have been wailing, about the existing conditions.</P>
      <P>I want to say just a few words about the matter to which the Minister referred, and that is the bread and flour milling industry and the baking industry.  There is considerable uneasiness, particularly all over the Leinster counties, in regard to the manner in which the city bakeries are extending their operations to the rural towns and villages.  It may be said that that fierce competition of the city bakeries is a good thing, and that it will make for cheaper bread, but it does carry with it also very substantial dangers. If the bakers in the provincial towns are put out of business there is always the danger that competition, instead of being increased, will be eliminated.  I think that would be bad for the provincial towns, and ultimately it would be bad for the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know &mdash; and I think everybody in this House who is fair-minded will admit &mdash; that the whole question of milling and baking is a very complex and a very difficult one.  We are all anxious, on the one hand, to ensure that the wheat is converted into flour and from flour into bread as efficiently and as cheaply as possible in the <Col N="335" /> interests of the consumer; at the same time we are anxious to ensure that the milling industry is decentralised, and that the flour mills throughout the country which are operating are permitted to continue.  It is not easy to combine those two ideas.  In trying to protect the smaller mills throughout the provincial areas we may perhaps, be giving too large a margin to the larger and more efficient city mills.  As I say, it is a problem that will require very careful attention, and it is one that should be attended to immediately. I am glad that the Minister did indicate in his opening speech that he intends having the whole matter reviewed.</P>
    <P>I would rather welcome the statement that the Minister made that there is a certain change-over to the purchase of household flour as against bakers' bread.  To a certain extent it may hit the baking industry but I am quite satisfied that the reasons the Minister gave in connection with that have a substantial measure of truth.  The fact that we have rural electrification and the fact that we have better cooking appliances provided in greater numbers in the rural areas, encouraged people to go in for cooking their own bread in their own homes.  I think that is all to the good and even though the bakers may not like it this is a free country and people are entitled to eat whatever they chose and to cook it for themselves if they think fit.</P>
    <P>I was engaged recently in a controversy in the Press in regard to the matter of wheat and flour, and I found that the person who was opposing my views on the growing of wheat carried his opposition to its logical conclusion and demanded that our people should not be permitted to eat wheaten bread.  That man is much more honest than some of the people in this House who have opposed wheat growing, inasmuch as he declared himself to be not only against the growing of wheat but also against the eating of wheaten bread.  However, I feel that common sense ought to guide us in these matters and I am sure common sense will guide us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> In the years that lie ahead I hope we will have a much better-balanced economy than we have had in the past and that our land will be producing what is essential to this nation. I hope also that agriculture and industry will go forward not in opposition to each other but in close co-operation and by their development make this nation more self-reliant and more prosperous.  If those on the Opposition side of the House who have been trying to depress us by their wails and their moans would just think of this nation as their own country, if they would think of the people of Ireland as their own people and seek to find ways and means of improving their position, they would be doing a useful service.  The only effective means by which we can improve the standard of living of our people is to increase the output of agriculture and the output of industry. Those who claimed and sought to prove that you could for an indefinite period stave off poverty, those who claimed you could raise the standard of living of our people by relying upon external aid have, I think, been proved to be completely wrong.  That is why I referred to external aid in the earlier part of my speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the woebegone statements made here to-day by Deputy O'Gorman.  Deputy O'Gorman considers that everything is bad when Fianna Fáil are in and everything is good when Fianna Fáil are out.  That may be a special policy of his.  I would like to take Deputy O'Gorman on a little tour of our constituency and show him the changes that have occurred there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evil that men do lives after them.  Deputies opposite cannot get that into their heads.  I have here <Col N="337" /> figures given by Deputy Norton in connection with unemployment.  How much of that unemployment was caused by the import of foreign shoddy?  The effect of that did not make itself felt for six months afterwards.  We did not feel the effect of it in Midleton town until the people who did the damage were gone.  They had departed quietly leaving behind them 7,500,000 yards of foreign shoddy.  Every draper's shop was packed with it.  Then the workers in Midleton Worsted Mills were wondering how it was that there was no employment for them.  But for the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce stepped in again and prohibited the import of those goods, unemployment would have continued, the stuff would have been shoved in. Thank God, all those people are now back in full employment in the town of Midleton despite the efforts here last week of Deputy Dillon, ably assisted by Deputy O'Gorman, when we had held up to us a piece of the 3/9 a leg stuff for flannel pants and were asked: &ldquo;Why not allow this in?&rdquo; by a Deputy representing a constituency in which the import of that kind of stuff had caused misery and unemployment.</P>
    <P>When he could find no other grounds to go on, he attacked me because I had not money in worsted mills.  Every penny I have in this world is invested in the biggest industry in this country, the land, and is giving employment on the land.  It is far safer there than it would be in any industry with a danger of three of four years of a mixum gatherum government.  In Midleton to-day there is full employment in these mills again.  There are flour mills working there that had been kept going from 1932 although they were being closed down and were working only two days a week when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office.  There is a further extension of these mills now to give more employment because the owners of the mills realise that they are now secure and can continue.  That will mean increased employment in the town.</P>
    <P>We then come to Deputy O'Gorman's own town.  Youghal.  There is far more employment in Youghal to-day than there was one and a half years ago when the mixum gatherum went out of office, and far more secure employment. <Col N="338" /> I met Deputy O'Gorman down there recently when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was providing more employment there, opening a new cotton mill to give employment to the people in their own town.</P>
    <P>We then come to the third town in Deputy O'Gorman's constituency, Cobh.  For three and a half years I was endeavouring to get different Ministers for Industry and Commerce to implement the guarantee given by Mr. Seán Lemass, in November 1948, that he would give sufficient money from the State to enable the sheet mills there to be built up and put into operation.  I spent three and a half years on the opposite benches hammering Ministers here, asking them by 18 questions, to have that money given to put that sheet mill into operation, a sheet mill where three-quarters of the machinery was lying there with grass and rust on it.  We have got it going.  Thank God, one of the first jobs the Minister did since he returned to office was to guarantee that money.</P>
    <P>As a result, that sheet mill is now being built up to give employment. This is one of the things I would like the Minister to get ahead with.  There is room in that industry, and portions of other mills that were brought in at the same period are still lying there, and it is time we got ahead with that work.  I am assured by the general manager there that employment can be given in the steelworks not just for the 680 at present employed, but for well over 1,000, if the other mills are got going.</P>
    <P>Take, then, what I always consider the Cinderella of our constituency&mdash; the town of Fermoy.  Thank God, the military barracks there has now been taken over for a further industry, and the people of Fermoy, who have had to sit for 30 years looking at their children growing up without any hope of local employment, will now find that employment in the town.</P>
    <P>Those are the four principal towns in my constituency.  I am glad to announce that, at present, negotiations are in hand for taking over the military barracks at Little Island, the Rockgrove military camp, to give further employment, producing goods we now buy from the foreigner.  Where is the need for the moans and groans <Col N="339" /> over that position of affairs?  I admit the people are hard hit.  You cannot find the money needed to pay the debts of three years' squandermania, the interest and the sinking fund, unless you find it out of the pockets of the producers and workers.  That money is being found, for the cheap pint and the cheap fag those opposite gave in 1948 and 1949 when they came in.  You cannot do those things without repercussions.  No old lad can turn around and go into the pub for six days of the week and get boozed every night and go continually to the bank manager when he wants to pay his rates or annuities.  He cannot do it always; the time comes when the bank manager says he will get no more. You cannot borrow for the ordinary working of a country, for a country, after all, is in the same position as a family.  You cannot borrow year after year &mdash; £9,000,000 this year, £15,000,000 the following year, £20,000,000 the next, and then wind up with £30,000,000 odd &mdash; and throw that burden on the State without the knowledge that the interest must be paid and the principal must be found.</P>
    <P>When I saw Deputy Flanagan joining up with the inter-Party Government I thought he was going to be the means of finding the money&mdash;that the Monetary Reform man was going to print the notes.  Apparently, they had not come quite to that stage at the time they left office, but I dare say they were not far from it.</P>
    <P>We now have a Minister who will see that these various proposals are pushed ahead.  I will no longer be met in the manner in which I was met by the previous Minister &mdash;&ldquo;It is a very serious matter, it will need further consideration.&rdquo; Three months later, in reply to another question&mdash;&ldquo; The matter is still being considered.&rdquo;  Then, in the wind up, we had &mdash;&ldquo;It has been referred to the Industrial Development Authority.&rdquo; That came at the end of three years of answers &mdash; that it was gone to Limbo.</P>

      <P>The evil that men do lives after them, and the evil those people have done for three and a half years has had unfortunate repercussions.  I am sick of hearing industrial people shouting and bawling at the farmers, saying they are not doing their bit, and should produce more.  What is the incentive to more production on the land? The previous Minister used to stand up here amidst the cheers and plaudits of the Labour Party and others and solemnly announce: &ldquo;I am going to give the farmers, not the 1/2 a gallon they were getting at the creameries for the milk up to the present, but a guarantee that for the next five years they will get 1/- per gallon.&rdquo;  While Deputy James Dillon is a Deputy here he will never live that down.  What was the result?  There was a reduction of 50,000 milch cows the following year, followed by a reduction in 1951 of 24,600 more&mdash; 76,600 milch cows disappeared out of the herds in two years.  At even 400 gallons a cow, they would give 30,000,000 gallons of milk, which would make 92,000 cwt. of butter.  Last year we imported, to fill the gap left by the cows that were gone, 100,000 cwt. of foreign butter, and paid £1,886,000 for it For the first nine months of this year we have already imported 105,000 cwt., at a cost of over £2,000,000&mdash;into this country of milk and honey.</P>

      <P>It was only when the Minister for Agriculture guaranteed a costings board to the farmers and guaranteed they would be paid the cost of production, plus a fair profit in their milk and butter that some hope was held out to them to prevent the disappearance of the cows of this country. There was that change.  I hear a lot of talk both inside and outside this House.  In fact, everywhere you go you hear the question being asked: &ldquo; Why do not the farmers produce more?&rdquo;  How can you expect the workers in the principal industry in this country to work harder and produce more at roughly 50 per cent. of the wage that is given in any industry in this country?  That is the position to the shame of all Governments.</P>

    <P>Travelling around this year during the beet harvest I saw a gentleman driving up with a Córas Iompair Eireann lorry.  It pulled up on the <Col N="342" /> side of the road and the driver said: &ldquo;Better hurry on, lads.  My time is nearly up.&rdquo;  The gentleman in the lorry, by the way, had somewhere in the region of £8 to £10 a week.</P>

They climbed into the lorry and went to the railway station where they forked the beet out of the lorry.  When they had it forked out, the fellow with £8 per week gave another look at his watch and said: &ldquo;I am sorry I cannot take you home.  My time is up.&rdquo;  He left them to march three miles back in the rain.  These men, in addition to keeping their families on £3 10s. or £3 12s. per week, had also to pay in the price of their beer and cigarettes and even in their bread to make up for the other gentleman in the shape of £1,800,000 Córas Iompair Éireann losses at the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The beet workers engaged harvesting this year's beet crop have, roughly, about £3 19s. 6d. per week, including wet time and holidays with or without pay.  The man in receipt of the £7 to £8 per week takes the beet out of the field and the worse paid worker in the beet factory, who works inside sheltered from the rain, the cold and the frost, has a wage of £6 1s. 9d.  That condition of affairs must end if we are to have more production. There is no good any Government, no matter what Government it is, trying to look for more production from the land whilst that rotten condition <Col N="344" /> of affairs exists.  There is no use in pretending anything else.</P>
      <P>The foundations of our agriculture have broken down and the foundation of our agriculture is the milch cow.  If you have 76,000 odd less milch cows, then you will have, roughly, about 70,000 less calves.  You can work that out and you will find that you will have less three-year-old bullocks owing to the fact that the foundations of agriculture were undermined and wrecked by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>You have the same condition of affairs in regard to beet.  There are 28,000 less acres of beet in the country this year than in 1947.  At that rate we will be importing in three years hence all the raw materials for the sugar industry.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from somebody what steps are being taken to arrest that decline and what steps are being taken to prevent that industry going to the wall.  You are not going to arrest it on the basis of £3 10s. to £4 a week for the worker at the beet, and there is no use in anybody in the House or outside it thinking that it can be arrested on that basis.  The time has arrived when the ordinary worker, the farmer, the farmer's son and the farm labourer will have to get at least as decent a position as the worker in any industry in this State. These are workers in the principal industry of the State, and they have not got it, and they are not getting it.  Their position is the position of the serf, and, so far as I can judge, the organisation of the professionals in this country is determined to keep them serfs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the result.  If production goes down on the land, and the land is our greatest asset, the food required for the people will have to be got somewhere else.  It will have to be paid for and purchased on the same basis as that on which it was purchased recently.  We had foreign sugar to the extent of 74,000 tons at £12 per ton more than was paid to the Irish worker in the field and in the factory for producing that sugar at home.  Count that up&mdash;£12 per ton on 74,000 tons.  That is what was paid to the foreigner for producing for the <Col N="345" /> people what should have been produced at home and what would have been produced at home if the worker here in our greatest industry had been treated at least as decently as evidently the then Government was prepared to treat the heathen Chinese or the nigger.</P>
    <P>I consider that the position in this industry is most dangerous.  We have four factories set up, the complete raw material for which is produced on the land here.  We have the raw material at home.  What steps are going to be taken to arrest the rot that has developed there?  Within the next few weeks, the representatives of the Beet Growers' Association will be meeting the sugar company and we want a line from the Government.  We want a line to know whether we can now change the condition of affairs in which we had a reduction of 28,000 acres in a few years.  We have practically the same condition of affairs in other respects. Last week, I had to raise on the Adjournment the dangerous position which had risen by reason of the breakdown of the Milk Costings Committee. Thank God, we had a Minister here who did not spend his quarter-hour on the Adjournment in the abuse and vilification to which we had been accustomed for three years.  We had a Minister who was prepared to set out and see what he could do to get that committee back at work and he succeeded in getting it back to work.</P>
    <P>I referred to the attitude of the professionals. We have in this country to-day a section of people who deny to the producers of food the same rights as are given to every other industrialist.  We hear gentlemen coming in and saying: &ldquo;You are not going to get anything on the money you have invested; you are not going to get anything for the money you paid for your stock and machinery; you are not going to get anything for the management of your farm or your stock of cows.&rdquo;  But when the farmer goes into Messrs. Gouldings for his artificial manure these costings are included in the price of that manure. Is there to be one law for what we will call the industrialist and another for those who are running the biggest industry of all, agriculture?  I am glad <Col N="346" /> as I say that we had a Minister who was prepared to tackle that problem and to insist that the farmer should get his rights, a Minister, who, as the representative of the farmers, was determined to see that he got them. It is a change and a very big change.</P>
    <P>To my mind those are the main problems confronting us.  To-day I heard a good deal of discussion about flour.  Last year on the advice of the Government farmers started to put an end to the importation of maize.  They increased the acreage of feeding barley for that purpose.  The market for barley opened at 48/- per barrel, £24 per ton.  For the first fortnight the moisture content per barrel was roughly 22 per cent.  We all know that in the early part of the season the barley is not fully ripe.  The threshing of it may have been rushed and the moisture content will be as high as 22 per cent.  That barley, with a moisture content of 22 per cent., was evidently worth £24 per ton.  After the first rush during the first fortnight, the barley that subsequently went into the mills had as low a moisture content as 15 per cent.  The price was still £24 per ton, 48/- per barrel.  Who controls that?  Who controls the undue and unjust profits made out of the difference between a moisture content of 22 per cent. and an average moisture content of 16 per cent.?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference shown of roughly 6 or 7 per cent. in the moisture content.  That has been used by various Governments here as an excuse for not giving us the same price for our wheat as was paid for imported wheat.  When we asked for the same price the Governments began to mutter about moisture content.  If that is the kind of price arrangement that is permitted, we will very soon find ourselves in the position that the farmer will water his barley before he sends it in.  It will pay him better to <Col N="348" /> cut in the rain rather than cut in fine weather.  These are matters that will have to be rectified if we are to attain the objective that I hope is ours, namely, a good increase in our wheat acreage, an increase in our barley acreage, some improvement in our position as regards our beet acreage and a change from the position in which the farmers, in despair, are clearing out their herds of milch cows. The story is a sad one.  Can the position be rectified?  I think the story is sufficiently gloomy to merit the attention of Deputies of all Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that state of affairs should be allowed to continue. We hear a good deal about the &ldquo;back to the land&rdquo; movement.  Mark you, it is not alone the agricultural labourer who is leaving the land to-day.  The farmer's son to-day is no longer the same as his prototype of 20 years ago. The farmer's son is no longer content to be an unpaid labourer on his father's farm.  If we intend to take the road back and put ourselves in the position of being able to look our workers in the face, and if we are not to be dependent on the men who will not be taken in any other employment, we must take steps immediately to rectify the position, for no man who has only his labour to sell will sell that labour for half the price he should get.  He would be a foolish man if he did, and the agricultural community would be very foolish if they accepted the position wherein they would be expected to work harder, produce more and get less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I am sorry for delaying the House so long.  As far as the industrial position of my constituency is concerned, I have no cause for worry. Employment has increased in the town of Youghal, in Midleton, in Cobh.  A new industry is going into the town of Fermoy, and a new industry is going into Little Island.  Those are five principal points that I have got to look after.  As far as industry is concerned, and as far as employment in industry is concerned, I have no occasion to worry.  My concern is that my constituency is a tillage constituency.  My <Col N="349" /> constituency is, you might say, the grain granary of Cork County.  There was never any occasion to talk of compulsory tillage to the farmers of East Cork.  They never had under the plough less than 40 per cent. of their holdings.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the condition of affairs there &mdash; owing to this policy of &ldquo;increase this, increase that, increase the other thing but do not pay the farmer any more for what he produces&rdquo;&mdash; which I have outlined.  I remember when things were very cheap, butter being exported from this country at 70/- a cwt.  You have now to go to the foreigner for butter.  Despite the fact that special pains were taken and that special steps were taken to erect factories here to produce sugar for this nation, you have to go to the foreigner for your sugar.  A definite decay has been setting in for a pretty considerable number of years now in our agriculture. That is the position that will have to be remedied if we are to exist as a nation.  I suggest that it is not a matter that can be passed over lightly.  It is a matter that will have to be remedied immediately.</P>
    <P>In my own parish a gentleman by the name of Walls came down from town and started to build a sanatorium. The week he opened up operations I saw 18 agricultural labourers leave the farmers of my parish and go across to work for Mr. Walls at one and three-quarter times the wage they were getting as agricultural labourers.  No man could blame them for doing so.  However, I also saw something else.  The man who leaves the land will never go back. The moment he finds the £6 or £7 a week, the moment he finds the one o'clock stop on Saturday, and knows that he need not bother his head again about his work until the following Monday morning, he will not go back to work on the land as an agricultural labourer.  Consider his position for a moment.  He earns £6 or £7 a week and from the one o'clock stop on Saturday until the following Monday morning he is free.  There is nothing to compel him to go back to work on Sunday.  There are no cows to be fed. There are no calves to be fed.  There <Col N="350" /> are no cows to be milked.  There is no city drone looking for his milk at 8 o'clock in the morning.  As far as his position is concerned, he is off work. The agricultural labourer and the farmer's sons and daughters have to face all that work.  The moment the agricultural labourers get out of that situation they are not going to go back to it.</P>
    <P>It is three years now since Mr. Walls started that operation.  None of those farm labourers has gone back.  I do not blame them.  I wish them joy, happiness and prosperity.  Since they cannot get it on the land of this country, I am glad to see them getting it somewhere else.  It is things such as that which make any Deputy who looks at rural conditions feel bitter.  Year after year, I have found Deputies who represent rural constituencies &mdash; Deputies who should have some consideration for the worker on the land and for the man who is producing on the land &mdash; trot into the Lobby and vote, for instance, against an increase in the price of milk to the farmers.  I saw them trotting around the Lobby and voting against the farmer.  Their attitude was that anything was good enough for the farmer.  Now we see the result.  Any Deputy who takes the trouble to go into the Library and examines the statistics in that connection will see those things for himself.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to press ahead in respect of the steel industry in this country.  There is room there for enormous expansion.  There is room there for the employment of at least 300 or 400 more men.  All that is needed is the push from the Minister.  He should give that push.  I admit that he has done a lot.  I have to give credit to a Minister who comes along and, after three years of deadness, pushes ahead to give more employment to our people and to produce more here.</P>

No matter what Government may be in office, it is my duty as a public representative to call attention to shortcomings.  I do not care who they may be, I will nail whoever is responsible, no matter on what side of the House they may sit; I have no hesitation in doing that.</P>
      <P>I hope that when we come to discuss the Supplies and Services Bill next year, I shall be in a position to say that industry has gone still further ahead, so far as my constituency is concerned.  When Christmas comes round again, I hope I shall be able to give an account of the new industry in Fermoy and the new industry in Little Island and to wonder what the boys were doing while they held the reins of office.  I hope also to see a change, a radical change, in the position of our principal industry.  As I stated already, I am sick hearing lectures from every industrialist who has 6 per cent. guaranteed to him and who comes along to lecture those who have no dividends guaranteed to them, who very often have only losses to look forward to.  These people ask why the farmers do not produce more.  I have given the reasons why the farmers will not produce more.  I have given what I consider the reason for the cancer that has existed for some time in agriculture. I hope that it will be remedied. If it is not, well then we can farm in Cuba and in New Zealand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can go to Formosa and import the stuff we require from there.  We have got to face the fact that we are now approaching a position in this country when the situation will have to be faced and dealt with by whatever Government is in power.  I should <Col N="352" /> like to see the Government coming along and saying: &ldquo;Very well, the minimum wage in industry is £6.  We are going to fix a wage of £6 per week for agricultural labourers in this country and we are going to see that the farmer, by means of guaranteed prices, will get the wherewithal to pay that wage.&rdquo;  That is the cure and the only cure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would have been interesting to have heard a speech from Deputy Corry if he were in opposition and if the following situation faced the country.  If the complaint of the farmers were that although they have worked harder and produced more they got less, if there were less acreage under wheat and beet, fewer milch cows, less milk and butter being produced&mdash;if that were the agricultural situation produced by a Government to which Deputy Corry was opposed, one could imagine the kind of speech that he would make here.  Yet those are the conditions that he declared obtain in the country to-day&mdash;less tillage, the beet industry finished, men running from the land because the land cannot provide a decent standard of living for them, the milk industry and the dairy industry destroyed.  That is the agricultural picture which he has painted for us. We can at least say that Deputy Corry in his speech put a very clear indictment against the Government's agricultural policy.  Of course, we know at the same time that, despite what he may have said, he will vote to maintain in power the Government that has permitted this unfortunate and deplorable situation to exist.</P>
      <P>I should like to return, if I may, to the more acute problems that now face the country.  It is proper, and I think it has been the custom for some years back, that this debate should be availed of by Deputies to review the economic condition of the country during a particular 12 months' period, or a longer period perhaps.  I think, applying that test to the conditions that we now see obtaining in the country, there is one clear fact which emerges.  It is that this Government is the high price Government.  The Fianna Fáil Government and Fianna Fáil are now synonymous with high prices, rising costs, high taxation and the general economic ills which are always associated with a period of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is deplorable that that should be so when we recollect that it was on this debate two years ago, in 1950, that the present Minister led an onslaught on the inter-Party Government <Col N="355" /> because of a complaint with regard to rising prices.  I am sure that the attention of the House has been directed to the words which the Minister spoke in this House on the 23rd November, 1950, as reported at column 1,306, Volume 123, of the Dáil Debates on this Bill just over two years ago.  The Minister then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The failure&rdquo;&mdash;he is referring to the failure of the then Government&mdash;&ldquo;to control prices, to prevent a rise in prices up to now, the accelerating rise that is now in progress, is perhaps the Government's greatest failure.  It is, I think, no answer to the criticisms that have been expressed among sections of the public of the apparent indifference of the Government to that increase that, generally, economic conditions in the country are better now than they were in the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I adopt every single word used by the Minister two years ago as being a fair description of the present economic condition of this country and of the present deplorable failure of the Government to take effective, or any, measures.</P>
    <P>In his speech two years ago the Minister referred to ministerial indifference. He referred to it in a most unfair way, because he knew that, at that time, the backwash of devaluation and the outbreak of the Korean War were causing conditions outside the control of our Government here; but he was prepared, and his Party were prepared, and it will be to their cost now whenever an election may come, to use any particular circumstances for the purpose of causing public discontent and uneasiness two years ago. They started a ramp about prices. The Minister himself castigated the former Government two years ago because of an increase in prices, and he referred in a determined manner to apparent ministerial indifference.</P>
    <P>In other passages in his speech, he went along to make jibes which I regarded then, and regard now, as cheap jibes about various commodities which had gone up in price.  He asked where was the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and <Col N="356" /> Commerce, and what were they doing, and where was the great system of price control which he had established in the Department, and why was it not working.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry referred in his speech to the evil that men do living after them.  The words which the Minister used two years ago can now be fairly used to test his conduct in office and his record over the last 12 months.  Is it fair for the Opposition to ask, as he asked two years ago, where now is the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and where now are the controls necessary to maintain commodities at a fair price for the people?  Meat has been decontrolled. It has been decontrolled by the Minister with a pious expression of opinion by the Department that it would result in a fall in the price of meat.  Does the Minister now think that the pious hope expressed when meat was decontrolled has been satisfied?</P>
    <P>Bacon was decontrolled.  Again, we were supposed to experience an amazing drop in the price of rashers and hams.  Again, has that been the result? Over the last 12 or 18 months, in relation to a variety of commodities, has the Minister taken effective steps to decontrol prices and to ensure that the prices obtaining will be the ordinary economic prices resulting from supply and demand?  He is the Minister who, as a Deputy, charged his predecessor with shirking his responsibility in relation to rising prices and with not doing the job that he was told to do by the Dáil when he was appointed a Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no Deputy, no matter on what side of the House he may be, who can be satisfied with the record of this Government over the last 12 miserable months.  In relation to prices, they have done nothing.  They sat back, fiddling while the people were surrounded by a forest of rising prices. It is for that reason that, I think, the people can regard this Government as a Government of high prices.  I think it is about time that the Government, through his representative here in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce should be made aware that we in the Opposition, representing <Col N="357" /> the majority of the people in this country, are not going to stand for this kind of ministerial complacency, laziness and indifference any longer in relation to this problem of prices.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know what, if any, policy the Government have in relation to the cost of living.  Two years ago, the then Government, facing as it was the effect of factors outside their control, took action which was sneered at by the present Minister. They established a Prices Advisory Council.  They passed a standstill Order in relation to prices which, again, was jeered at and jibed at by the present Minister.  But whatever defects that policy may have had, nevertheless it was a policy.  When the Supplies and Services Bill was introduced two years ago, it was introduced by the member of the Government in charge of it as a measure designed to deal with the problem of rising prices, and contained concrete proposals in relation to the problem of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>What a change we see now two years later!  In introducing this Bill this morning, the Minister made no reference whatever to the problem of the cost of living, offered no proposals, concrete or otherwise, as to what policy the Government might have in relation to rising prices, offered no prognosis with regard to what was going to happen, made no suggestion, good, bad or indifferent, to the representatives of the people here with regard to this serious and acute problem.  Did the Minister think that by saying nothing about it this debate might have been conducted without any reference to the problem of the cost of living?  Was he so naive as to think he could set the tone which this debate should follow?  If that were in his mind, he was very much mistaken because we in the Opposition know our responsibilities.  As I say, we appreciate that we represent the majority of the people in this country, and we will not tolerate this kind of lack of policy and ministerial indifference in relation to what is the big economic problem of the moment.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to see the apparent indifference of Fianna Fáil Deputies, representing city constituencies, in relation <Col N="358" /> to this matter.  Where are all the brave boys of two years ago? Where are Deputy Vivion de Valera, Deputy McCann and Deputy Briscoe? Where are all the other Deputies who two years ago followed the Minister as leader of the pack howling about rising prices?  Why are their voices silent now?  When any Government Deputies attempted to intervene in this debate why did they endeavour to talk about something else rather than this problem of the cost of living?  It is noticeable that ministerial defence and protection in this debate were afforded, not by Fianna Fáil Deputies, but by their outriders, Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan and these other gentlemen. That is not satisfactory so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I glanced through the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill two years ago, and it is well worth reading.  I recommend it to every Fianna Fáil Deputy, because it will be remembered by every former Fianna Fáil supporter. They should read that debate, see what they said, and regard their conduct for the last two years.  Deputy Briscoe was very vocal two years ago. Now he only sits and beams magnanimously at Deputy Cogan defending the Government.  But two years ago Deputy Briscoe reminded the House that Fianna Fáil as a Party was formed to look after three things.  He said that Fianna Fáil's traditional concern was in relation to the food, clothing and shelter of the people.  As reported in column 1462, of Volume 123 of the Official Reports, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are three items of importance to the vast majority of our people &mdash; food, clothing and shelter. We on these benches subscribed to that particular principle on the formation of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We agreed, and we laid it down as part of our policy, that there were three items to which the Government must give the utmost and the first consideration because of their effect on the vast majority of our people: food, clothing and shelter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Deputy went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us take food first.  One would imagine that food subsidies <Col N="359" /> existed when Fianna Fáil took office. Do the members of the Coalition groups not realise that the subsidisation of the essential foodstuffs for the vast majority of our people was a principle introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1463 he referred to what was happening under the bad inter-Party Government in regard to food subsidies.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the change of Government came, taxation was not to go up; taxation was to come down. However, the price of food for the vast majority of the people was affected by the system of limiting the ration allowance, not with regard to the availability of any particular foodstuff, but with regard to the extent to which the Exchequer would suffer by a particular subsidy.  That, in our opinion, we say quite frankly, was a bad change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have a Fianna Fáil Deputy two years ago lecturing us on the principle of rationing food at a subsidised price to the vast majority of the people.  Led by the Tánaiste and followed by the Fianna Fáil city Deputies, he was saying that the inter-Party Government were in some way reducing subsidies.  &ldquo;That, in our opinion,&rdquo; said Deputy Briscoe, &ldquo;we say quite frankly, was a bad change.&rdquo;  Where is Deputy Briscoe to-day?  On the Supplies and Services Bill two years later not a word is said by him with regard to the type of Government that not only reduces or interferes with subsidies but wipes them out completely.</P>
    <P>These are serious considerations, because I suggest to the House that in relation to prices and other matters this Government have no policy, good, bad or indifferent.  If they do anything, they decide what they will do from day to day and from week to week as a result of political pressure exercised on them by groups represented by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Cowan on the one side and Deputy Dr. Browne on the other.  That is the type of policy which is dictated by the exigencies of the different circumstances <Col N="360" /> of each week.  So far as the country can see, there is no clear programme being followed, no aim being sought and nothing concrete to be put before the people.  That is, I think, illustrated very clearly by the type of speech which the House heard from the Minister to-day.  It was clear from his speech that there is no policy in relation to prices and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I know that when I refer to prices as one of the big economic problems of the moment I must also add to it the big problem of unemployment which exists to-day.  Deputy Corry or any other Deputy of that kind should not try to cod this House.  There is more unemployment in this country to-day than we have experienced for many years back.  It is unemployment that did not accidently happen, but unemployment, unfortunately, that has been caused by the direct action of the present Government and, incidentally, by the present Minister.  That is a serious situation.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to that, what policy do the Government put before the country?  When they assumed office some 15 or 16 months ago this country was doing fairly well.  Of course, we had not solved all the outstanding problems that faced the country but we had had only three years to do what we could.  Things were going fairly well nevertheless.  There was no unemployment.  There were no spiralling prices.  There was no heavy burden of taxation.  There was plenty of money in circulation and, despite the suggestions of the Minister for Finance, there was no restriction in credit from the banks.  Generally speaking, conditions in agriculture were booming and the country was passing through a very good period. That was the situation at the very moment when the present Government were charged, not by the people but by this Dáil, unfortunately, with responsibility for governing the country. Now we can look back on the immediate and startling change which took place.  Again it was not a coincidence. It was not accidental.  It was the result of the very unfortunate and irresponsible campaign initiated by the <Col N="361" /> Minister and by other members of the Government by which the solvency and credit worthiness of this country were endangered, causing a business and trade recession, unemployment and the general economic ills about which we now complain.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any member of the Government intended in June, 1951, when they came into office, to follow the deflationary financial policy which has been the cause of so much harm in this country in the last 12 months.  In fact, I know that when they went into office, they just did not know what they were going to do; but they started a particular trend which has led to their actions of the past 12 months and to the present deplorable situation.  The present Government, 13 or 14 men, and the present Government Deputies, some 60 odd, are the most unhappy people in Ireland to-day, and they are in that deplorable situation because of their actions in the last 12 months.  I do not think that the results were foreseen.  I am quite satisfied, no matter how many hard things I may have had to say on the political line about the present Government, that no group of men could possibly promise the people of Ireland, as Fianna Fáil did in June, 1951, that they would maintain the system of food subsidies if they intended to do the very reverse.  That is not what happened.  When they became a Government, particularly with the Minister for Finance playing politics and acting the giddy goat, they wanted to attack the condition of the country because they knew that if they did not get the people to believe when they were well off that they were badly off then the people would regard the financial policy which made that possible as being the correct policy.  Since the country was prosperous when Fianna Fáil came into office the people had to be told that it was a false and phony prosperity, and they were told that very well by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other members of the Government. All of us were told that we were codding ourselves for three years before when there was full employment, expanding markets, good <Col N="362" /> business conditions and all the rest, that that was all phony, that it was make-believe, and that now we had to face up to realities.</P>
    <P>That campaign started off as a political expedient aimed against the previous Minister for Finance and the financial policy which the previous Government had been following, but unfortunately for the Government, disastrously for the country, that campaign got out of hand.  It was like letting a car roll down a slope, it got faster and faster and eventually the people who started it could not control it.  When the banks were told by the Minister for Finance that there was too much money in the country and that people were spending too much they began to restrict credit.  Step by step conditions began to appear where there was uncertainty and doubt in the minds of business people and the people generally regarding the solvency of the country and the trade recession which presumably would have existed to a certain extent was magnified out of all proportion by the campaign indulged in by the Government.  As a result we must complain here of the deplorable unemployment situation and the consequential problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>While that campaign was going on it was suggested by members of the Government and by Fianna Fáil Deputies that the inter-Party Government had been doing something wrong when they borrowed from the investor in this country and sought investments here at home.  I have references here but I do not want to go over all the speeches made by Deputies on the other side of the House in relation to the investment programme of the inter-Party Government.  It will suffice to say that every supporter of Fianna Fáil down the country was firmly convinced that the inter-Party Government had been doing something terribly wrong when they asked the Irish investor, instead of putting his money in England, to invest it here at home.  All of them, like a well-trained squad of soldiers, were in step in suggesting that that borrowing programme was something terribly wrong and that we were jeopardising our future by the financial policy we had supported.  When all <Col N="363" /> that campaign was over, when all the noise had died down, when the people had begun to think over what the issues had been, when all that was finished and unfortunately harm had been caused in business with regard to the solvency of the country, along came the Minister for Finance himself seeking a loan of £20,000,000 from the people of the country, a loan at a rate of interest higher than had ever been given.  I think that that type of action by the Government has certainly not been consistent, certainly not been part of a definite policy or a definite programme.</P>
    <P>It certainly gives evidence to the people of this country that there is a policy of drift and nothing else in Government circles.  There is no clear, cogent line such as the people are entitled to expect from the Government, but rather is there a collection of hasty decisions made up in varying circumstances by, so far as we can see, different groups of Ministers.  It is very hard for anyone to justify condemnation of an investment programme 12 months ago, and to justify that same investment programme as being a proper financial expedient 12 months later.  That unfortunately is what is happening in this country.  It is regrettable that the sufferers are not merely the Fianna Fáil outriders like Deputy Cogan and Deputy Cowan, but also the unfortunate people of this country, those who are out of work, those who are paying Fianna Fáil prices for the things they have to buy, paying Fianna Fáil taxes on all the commodities they use.  Those are the people who suffer and who have to pay. In addition, as a result of what the Minister for Finance described in a letter to the newspapers as &ldquo;a ha'porth of tar&rdquo;, everyone who now seeks to build a house will have to pay increased interest charges.  That is the result of the action of the present Government.  It is that situation which we are entitled to complain about here in this debate.</P>
    <P>I know there are many other grounds upon which the present Government can be indicted.  I do not intend to deal with them.  It is certainly fair that the present Minister should be <Col N="364" /> indicted here two years later on the same grounds, on the same Bill, on which he sought to indict the previous Government in the month of November, 1950, on prices and on employment. While the previous Government could at least say they were doing something&mdash;perhaps not the right thing, perhaps not the best thing, but they were doing something&mdash;that is not a defence available in mitigation to the present Minister here to-night, because he is doing nothing, good, bad or indifferent, to control the spiralling of prices.  He is doing nothing to retain some reality in the value of the workers' pay packets.  On the contrary, his actions and the actions of his Government in the last 12 months have been positive steps further to increase prices, further to reduce the real value of money.  The abolition of food subsidies, the decontrol of meat, bacon and other commodities of that kind have contributed in their own way further to increase the cost of living.  While we complain of these unfortunate results we also complain that the Government has no right, good, bad or indifferent, to be there at all or to be doing the things they have been doing in the last 12 months. They have not the support of the people.  They were not put there by the people, and, so far as popular expression of views can be obtained, the people of the country are merely waiting for the moment to get rid of them.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this political situation should exist in the country to-day.  It is regrettable that any Government should find itself in the position that it knows it has not the support, the goodwill and the confidence of the people it seeks to govern. It is bad for the country and it is bad for the Government.  It is bad for business and it is bad for the people generally that these unsettled political conditions should obtain, causing insecurity, causing lack of confidence, and causing apprehension, not merely in the minds of Deputies like Deputy Cogan and others but in the minds of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>We say to the Government, in the interests of the people and in the interests of the country generally, that the time has come to seek a proper <Col N="365" /> mandate from the people of Ireland. If the Government can get it, well and good.  We will accept it; we will abide by it.  At least the country will be stronger in this fact that, whatever Government is elected, whether it is the present Government or any other Government, it will be put there with a policy and charged by the people with executing and carrying out that policy.  In that way the air will be clearer, the country will be stronger and the future made more definite. If the Government just carries on, holds on to power, holds on to office, knowing that the people are going one way and the Government going the other way, then these unfortunate conditions I have described will continue to exist until, eventually, some circumstances or accident unfortunate to the Government will cause the dissolution of this unrepresentative Assembly.</P>
    <P>I do suggest that the time has come for a new general election, and it is proper that that should be pointed out in this debate, which has been used actively by the Opposition in the past to draw attention to acute problems facing the people.  It is clear that the Government's policy is not acceptable to the people of this country.  At least that is our charge.  That is what we suggest.  We may be wrong; I do not think we are.  Most Fianna Fáil Deputies recognise the fact that their policy has not the support of the people of this country.  At least we are making that suggestion, we are making that charge, and we are doing it as a responsible Opposition asking the Government, in the interests of the country, in the interests of the Government itself, to seek a fresh mandate from the people.  If they do that, and get back, they will be a lot happier, I am sure, and the country will be a lot stronger.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his address, referred to an occasion such as this as one on which this House should have a stocktaking as to the state of affairs which has existed over the past 12 months. In the course of his address he has pointed out to this House one or two of the very serious national ills which our people and our country are suffering <Col N="366" /> from at the moment.  It is very remarkable indeed that, on an occasion such as this, when emigration and unemployment, rising prices and soaring cost of living, should be discussed here, we hear so little contribution to this important debate from the members of the Government Party.  The reason that the members of the Government Party are so silent on this occasion is that they have no contribution to make.</P>
      <P>I should like to open my remarks to-night by asking the Tánaiste, in common decency, to pack up and get out.  That appeal is in accordance with the expressed wishes of the majority of the people to-day.  Everybody knows that the Opposition represents the majority of the people.  Everybody knows that the Minister for Finance or the present Government got no mandate whatever from the people.  The fact that Fianna Fáil's policy was rejected at the last general election is ample proof of that.  The fact that Fianna Fáil's policy was rejected in Limerick recently is ample proof of that.  The fact that the majority of the electors in Waterford &mdash; although the Government were lucky enough to pull through &mdash;viewed with disfavour and disgust the policy of the present Government, is proof of that.  The large majority secured by the inter-Party candidate, belittling and disgracing in no small manner the policy of the present Government, would make any backbencher, even the dumbest of the dumb, of the Fianna Fáil Party blush. They are inclined to brazen it out and to hope that something will happen that will get them out of the knee-deep mud they are in at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the present Government enjoys the fruits of office, the unfortunate taxpayer is being bled to the last drop and the unfortunate worker is being driven forcibly into the ranks of the unemployed.  Thousands of our manhood are being forced to take the emigrant ship, to eke out an existance in the land of our traditional enemy. Thousands of our workers in recent months have obtained employment in Bradford, London, Liverpool and Hull. Many Irish workers have gone to help Britain to increase her coal production. Many Irish workers who were working full time in constant employment <Col N="367" /> for the three years during which the inter-Party Government administered the affairs of this country now find themselves working in Sheffield, in the Welsh mines and on drainage schemes sponsored by the British Government.</P>
    <P>As a result of the policy enforced by the present Government, the housewife finds it impossible properly to conduct the affairs of the home.  As a result of the present Government's policy there are between 500 and 700 members of the Grocers' Assistants' Union unemployed and reporting at the hall in Parnell Square daily in the hope of getting a day's work.  Shops are not doing sufficient business to keep the assistants employed.  As a result of the recent disastrous Budget, publichouses that formerly employed five six and ten hands can cope with the present trade by employing two hands.  Staffs have been halved.  The licensed trade has been killed completely. The value of licensed premises has reduced considerably.  A similar appalling state of affairs exists in the drapery trade.</P>
    <P>At the same time as industries are reducing staffs and working short time and half-time, drainage schemes are coming to a standstill.  Every local authority that gave employment to hundreds of men finds there is a very bleak period facing the workers between now and the 1st April next.</P>
    <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are members of county councils know quite well that the numbers of men employed by county councils to-day compared with the figures for the three years while the inter-Party Government were in office reveal a drastic change as a result of the cutting down of the amounts granted for the relief of unemployment.  Every Deputy from rural Ireland must view with alarm the prospect of a dreary, hard, cold winter.  Approaching Christmas, thousands of the best of our manhood are receiving only the miserable allowances payable to the unemployed. Thousands of workers in rural Ireland are facing Christmas as unemployed men.  Heads of families are unemployed; members of families are unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> The Minister must be aware that, in addition to the appalling circumstances resulting from unemployment, the Department of Social Welfare is undertaking a review of the allowances payable to widows and orphans and quite a large number of widows' pensions will be discontinued or reduced. Then we are told that the times are bright and good.  Two years ago, the Minister, when he was on this side, said that the inter-Party Government was plunging the people into debt, that it was responsible for unemployment and he hurled serious allegations against the Front Bench of that Government; but it is interesting to note that for every week that the inter-Party Government was in office there was 1,000 people put into employment. Yet you have Deputies brazen enough, courageous enough or bold enough to stand up here and tell us that their present policy is more beneficial to the people than that of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>Probably the result of the recent by-election in North-West Dublin has been brought about by the increase in the cost of living.  Deputy Morrissey referred this morning to the reduction in the consumption of bread and the Minister, in reply, said that, in his opinion, it was due to the rural electrification scheme, that there was more bread being baked at home in rural Ireland, that that was responsible for the reduction in the purchases of bakers' bread.  Surely no one takes that seriously.  No one could possibly believe it.  Does the Minister think that times are so good in rural Ireland that people can pay £40 or £60 for an electric cooker?  Does he think the old age pensioners in rural Ireland have electric cookers; does he think the agricultural labourer or the cottage tenants have electric cookers; does he think that all Deputy Corry's farmers have them?  Where are the electric cookers?  Those who know rural Ireland, the districts that have been lucky enough to secure electricity under the rural electrification schemes, know that it was hard enough to get the people to take in the light, without asking them to take electric cookers. That sort of reply to Deputy Morrissey might sound lovely in the Mutt and <Col N="369" /> Jeff strip, or in <i>Comic Cuts</i> or <i>Our Boys</i>, or in something to provide laughter.  When the Tánaiste, the Leader of this House at the present time, tells us that as a result of rural electrification there is more bread being baked in the country in expensive apparatus, it is like something you might expect from someone about 24 hours released from a lunatic asylum.  That sort of silly reply does not cut any ice with the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>We had the Tánaiste to-day making a case as to why the people should not have cheap tea.  He said the Irish people were very particular about the blends of tea they use.  Does he seriously suggest that while there are thousands unemployed their wives would go in asking for a pound of tea at 5/8 if they could get it for 1/6? The Minister is of opinion they would take the 5/8 tea and leave the 1/6. The time has come when every housewife and every father of a family are watching every penny piece to see how they can make a shilling purchase two shillings' worth, whilst the present Government is permitting them to buy only 4d. worth for the shilling.</P>
    <P>The present Government have no regard whatever for rising prices. Since they took office the prices of household commodities have gone up sky-high.  Not only have the prices of tea, sugar, bread, butter, flour and oatenmeal gone up, but every item that goes on the housewife's table has gone up in price as well since the present Government came into office. The housewife cannot even have a headache in comfort when she now finds that the box of Aspros that was 3d. when we were in office is 4d. to-day.  She cannot even have her headache cured at a reasonable price. They are 4d. to-day.  Soaps, Lux, Rinso, washing-soda, everything in that line has gone up.  We know quite well that, after Deputy Morrissey was Minister&mdash;and Dr. O'Higgins was Minister later&mdash;the present Minister made a speech, just as they left office, and said they neglected their duty and funked their responsibility. He said: &ldquo;When I walked into the Department I found reeks of files piled high, of prices about to be increased, <Col N="370" /> waiting for the Minister's signature, and the Minister did not sign them or would not sign them.&rdquo; That was the greatest charge he made against Deputy O'Higgins, that he would not sign recommendations of the Prices Advisory Body for price increases. The greatest charge the present Tánaiste had against Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Higgins was that they would not sign the necessary Orders to increase the prices of commodities, which would mean an increase in the cost of living.  They were criticised for not sanctioning those increases.  I say that Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Higgins acted wisely in not sanctioning the increases recommended on those occasions. Things would be more favourable if the present Minister had taken the same line as his predecessors in that respect.</P>
    <P>Since this time 12 months, Electricity Supply Board charges have been increased. That means that every shop and business premises has to pay more for light, every house has to pay more for light and the ordinary ratepayers have to pay more for public lighting. It would have been wise if the Order made by the present Minister increasing electricity charges had been left unsigned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke of the plight of the farmers.  He said there were no worries whatever in his constituency, no unemployment, no one complaining, no one grumbling, everyone satisfied with the cost of living, everyone well pleased, well dressed and well fed.  I visited Deputy Corry's constituency quite recently and found that in a town four miles from his home, the town of Midleton, there were between 40 and 60 unemployed men.  I found that there were people working in the distillery in Midleton on short time and half-time. I was speaking to some unemployed people in Midleton, who were-employed in the distillery in Midleton when the inter-Party Government were in office.  The same conditions prevailed in other towns in Deputy Corry's constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry spoke of the farmers and said that they were not getting a fair crack of the whip.  He was right in that because the farmers are not <Col N="371" /> getting a fair crack of the whip. Deputy Corry made sure that he did not refer to the imported butter.  He referred to the oats, barley, wheat and beet, but he did not say anything about butter.  Is it not amazing when one recalls the serious opposition to Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture because he imported Danish butter?  At the last general election and even after that voices were raised in the Fianna Fáil Party, which reechoed through every town and village and every hill and valley in the country: &ldquo;What about the Danish butter?'</P>
    <P>Labour representatives, Clann na Talmhan representatives, the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Fine Gael Party were charged with importing butter.  We heard the present Minister for Agriculture, when he was Deputy Walsh, describing the despicable production that was being brought in here from Denmark.  Every Fianna Fáil Cumann in the Twenty-six Counties was given instructions to arouse public ill-feeling against the imported butter. We were told that the Danish butter formed fours on the butter plate, stood to attention and that it grew a beard overnight in the cupboards.  We were told all that about the Danish butter.</P>
    <P>We were told that the moment Fianna Fáil got back into office the last ounce of butter would be imported and our people would no longer have to stand in the same house in which the Danish butter was forming fours and standing to attention.  We were told that in shops, where the Danish butter was being sold, glass had to be broken, new windows installed, fresh ventilation provided and that the shop assistants found it impossible to mark time with the Danish butter on the counter.</P>
    <P>We were also told that the very moment Fianna Fáil were back in office would be the end of imported butter. What happened?  They were not very long in office when they obtained £2,000,000 worth of New Zealand butter.  Brave and brazen the Minister for Agriculture told us in the Dáil a few weeks ago that it was the Government's intention to import more butter. <Col N="372" /> The sad part of all this is that the unfortunate people who were given the description of the imported butter fell for it at the last general election but no one could stand in the same street with the butter that Deputy Dillon was responsible for importing.  But once Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, imports the butter it is lovely butter, very nice and tasty.  That is what we are told.  When Deputy Dillon brought in the butter, it stank but when Deputy Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, brings it in it is very nice and tasty.  Now there is not a word about the imported butter.  Let us take for example the bacon and the hams.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember during the days of the inter-Party Government the feelings of the Tánaiste and Deputy Walsh and occasionally the Minister for Justice were aroused when they recalled the days when hams and bacon were readily available.  One of the first acts of the present Tánaiste was to take off the control on hams and bacon.  We find that at the present time ham and bacon is a mere memory in the worker's home.</P>
      <P>The young children of many workers never saw a rasher and do not know what a ham is like except to see it in a shop window.  Their parents cannot purchase it because the price control was taken off and those responsible could charge what they liked for rashers and hams.  When the inter-Party Government was in office that was not so.  That Government realised that the poor man, the worker, the farm labourer, the widow and orphan and the old age pensioner were equally entitled to their ham and bacon as the industrialist and those who were living on a salary out of which bacon and ham could be purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any Deputy in rural Ireland visits the homes of the working class people to-day and if he asks the head of the family for details of the family diet, he will be told that there are hundreds in this country to-day who can only purchase one pound of butter per week since the present Government put 10d. <Col N="373" /> per pound on it.  When they imposed 10d. per pound on butter they might as well have put 5/- a pound on it because the butter was gone out of the reach of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>There are school-children in rural Ireland to-day bringing two cuts of rough dry bread to their schools because their parents cannot afford to pay 3/10 per pound for butter.  The unemployed man has butter in his home for Saturday and Sunday and there might be some left for him the following day, but Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are the days on which butter is a memory.  On Fridays the longing for butter consumes the hungry little children sitting by the fireside who say: &ldquo;To-morrow, please God, we will have butter on our bread.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the state of affairs that has been brought about.  The tears are falling from the soft and tender eyes of many Irish mothers to see their children crying for butter on their crusts when they cannot provide it.  Butter is a thing of the past and the Fianna Fáil Party smile with delight and push out their chests because they were brave and courageous to deprive the poor people of butter.</P>
    <P>I remember when Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Health, opened some institution in the parish of Rathgar about two months ago.  In the course of his address, he referred to the diet of our people.  I recall that he made reference to the nourishment of our people.  On more than one occasion the present Minister for Health advised our people to eat plenty of butter, drink plenty of milk and eat plenty of eggs.  I am speaking as one who represents a rural constituency and I must refer to the towns of: Birr, Tullamore, Edenderry, Clara, Banagher, Mountmellick, Portarlington, Rathdowney, Mountrath and Stradbally.  In these areas, there are families who see butter three days a week.  They are families who cannot afford to pay 6d. each for an egg&mdash; the price of eggs is between 5d. and 6d. each &mdash; or 6d. for a pint of milk. Take the case of the unemployed man, with a wife and five or six children. According to the recommendation of <Col N="374" /> the Minister for Health, in order that they may be physically strong and healthy, they are to eat plenty of eggs, drink plenty of milk and use plenty of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Corish says, they were told that they should have saved money which they should invest in the Post Office Savings Bank. Everybody knows that the conditions that prevail in the homes in rural Ireland to-day have never been experienced in the history of this country. There are people in the large provincial towns drinking black tea because they cannot afford to buy milk.  The Minister can make inquiries in the many homes in O'Mulloy Street, Tullamore, and O'Moore Place, Portlaoighise, and if the correct investigations is made, my statement will be borne out.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners, widows, orphans, invalids and others cannot afford to pay 3/10 per lb. for sufficient supplies of butter to do them the whole week, and sufficient supplies of milk to colour the tea three times a day every day of the week.  They cannot purchase meat. Meat is only for the rich.  It cannot be purchased by the poor, and everybody knows that.  Fathers of families in this city and through the country know that meat has now become an article of diet for Sunday, and that it is only used for one meal on Sunday in most of the workers' homes in Ireland.  Beef, mutton, cutlets, lamb, bacon, pork &mdash; everyone knows that the unemployed people cannot purchase these commodities.  We all know that at his present rate of pay, with the cost of living as it is, the farm labourer cannot purchase them, and we know also that it is the policy of the present Government to make our people eat less, wear less and drink less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are our people forced into the position of eating less.  They have been forced into that position because bread has gone up in price, with the result that less can be eaten; flour has gone up in price, meaning that less bread can be made; eggs and milk have reached a price only for the rich; meat <Col N="375" /> is prohibitive; and vegetables in the city, in an agricultural country, have reached a price which the poor of Dublin cannot pay.  That applies to parsnips, cabbages, beetroot, potatoes and other essential vegetables.  Because of the prohibitive price of vegetables in the cities and large towns, people are forced to have tea three times a day, and, if tea can be made available at 1/6 or 1/8 per lb. they will use that tea in preference to tea at 5/4 or 5/8 per lb.  The Minister differs from me in that.</P>
    <P>While these conditions prevail in the homes, we find that, due to the present Government's policy, the rents charged for the new houses which were provided for these people are prohibitive, with the result that many people living in rural Ireland to-day under the conditions I have outlined must remain in the hovels instead of going into the newly provided houses.  I have outlined the conditions with regard to the purchase of food, and we find that the lowest rent even to the unemployed man in my constituency is 12/6 per week.  The rents of houses range from 12/6 to 35/- per week, with rates.  In that regard, we find that the serious plight in which working-class people find themselves is definitely due to the policy pursued by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a statement by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he was on one of his rabbit-hunting tours in Westmeath, that the people were living beyond their means. I should like the Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to tell us exactly whom they are referring to when they tell us that the people are living beyond their means.  We were told that the people were spending too much.  On what? We were told we were all living beyond our means.  Was it the old age pensioner on 21/6 per week who was living beyond his means?  Was the farm labourer with a little over £3 a week living beyond his means?  Was the farmer with the oats and the barley he cannot sell living beyond his means? Is it these farmers, with the demands for increased rates and taxes, the increased cost of seeds and manures, <Col N="376" /> and with shop bills coming in, who were living beyond their means?</P>
    <P>Is the home assistance recipient living beyond his means, the person getting 7/6 per week from the local authority on which he is expected to purchase £3 worth to keep body and soul together for the week?  How that is done is a mystery, but they are expected to do it.  Are they living beyond their means?  Are they the people the Minister is advising to save, the people who should have saved money which they should put into the Post Office Savings Bank?  Is the tradesman living beyond his means? Deputy Alfred and Deputy Tom Byrne referred during the week to carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, painters, plumbers and others engaged in the building trade, and said that there was no end to the number of these tradesmen who are unemployed in Dublin at the moment, and that goes for the whole Twenty-six Counties. Are these tradesmen living beyond their means?  When the Taoiseach and the Minister told us that we were living beyond our means, whom were they referring to?</P>
    <P>It was certainly not to the type of people to whom I am referring.  Was he referring to the teachers?  Are they living beyond their means?  Time and again they have asked the present Government to set up the same machinery for investigating the necessity for an increase in their pay as was set up by the inter-Party Government. The present Minister for Education has refused point-blank to do that and has notified the I.N.T.O. to that effect. Are the teachers living beyond their means?  Are the members of the Defence Forces, the privates in our Army who are looking for increased marriage allowances and rent allowances to meet the increased rate demand on their homes living beyond their means?</P>
    <P>Were the publicans living beyond their means?  The publicans were doing a flourishing trade, and a good trade until the recent taxation was imposed. Many of them in rural Ireland have decided now to keep the shutters up on one window because it is no longer worth their while taking them down <Col N="377" /> and putting them up.  The doors of public-houses are creaking and squeaking for want of oil on the hinges because they are not being opened and closed as frequently as they used to be, thanks to the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>There are fewer employed in the breweries.  There are fewer employed in the distilleries.  Fewer will be employed on lorries in the future because of increased taxation.  In my constituency some of the big firms have stated publicly that they will not tax all their lorries after 1st January next.  That will mean a driver unemployed, a helper unemployed, a lorry less taxed, a lorry less on the roads, less petrol being consumed, fewer tyres being worn, less plugs being needed, less batteries being required and, therefore, less work in the garages.  That is what will happen after 1st January next.  The unfortunate hackney driver may put away his car and sign on at the local labour exchange after the 1st January next.</P>
    <P>Every step taken by the present coalition&mdash;I deliberately use that word &mdash;of &ldquo;Lemass-Cowan-Cogan&rdquo; has been a step bringing more disgrace and more dishonour to the country and arousing more disgust amongst our people.  I am sorry that the Taoiseach was not here in the House and in good health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps he will do it when he comes home and, if so, the sooner he comes and does it the better it will be for all of us.</P>

      <P>With reference to the loan floated by the Minister for Finance, the loan was generously subscribed and the Minister patted himself on the back because of its success. Observe the attractive rate of interest. Who will benefit by this loan?  Who will pay for it?  I would like to hear those questions answered.  Is it not a fact that, as a result of this loan, local authorities will have to meet increased charges for loans advanced under the Small Dwellings <Col N="379" /> Act?  That means private building is finished.  Decent people may have subscribed to this loan&mdash;I am not saying they did not &mdash; but a golden opportunity was given to adventurers and to racketeers to invest their spare cash, draw big interest and make a good profit at the expense of the poor and at the expense of those who will be driven out of employment and at the expense of the cottage tenant, who will have to pay more in rent and rates in order to help the speculators and the gamblers to get rich quick.  Some decent people may have availed of the loan but there were all sorts of opportunists waiting for the right moment.  We know that opportunists have always been connected with Fianna Fáil and we know that Fianna Fáil policy has always given a clear road to these opportunists to get rich quick at the expense of the worker and at the expense of the poor.</P>
      <P>A golden opportunity was given to the speculators and the gamblers in this recent loan so that the rich might get richer and the poor might get poorer and thinner.  The pinch has not been felt yet, but it will be felt. It will be felt next year, the year after that and for many a year to come.  It will be felt in particular in the City of Dublin by the newly married and those about to be married who were engaged in the erection of their own homes.  One of the first steps the present Government took was to deprive ordinary people of the opportunity of providing themselves with a home.  They stretched forth their hungry hand over the young man anxious to set up a home for himself.  They took the roof from over his head and deprived him of that home by means of which he could marry and bring up a family in Christian decency in his own country.  He has been denied that right.  We find Fianna Fáil speakers defending that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many sad events have happened from time to time in the history of our country but I think that the saddest event that has ever happened was the return of the present Government to office some 18 months <Col N="380" /> ago.  If an opportunity presented itself this moment, the present Government would not be 24 hours in office if an angry and raging people had an opportunity of deciding the matter&mdash;as they decided so well and wisely in North-West Dublin.  The Fianna Fáil policy has been a policy of beggary, despair, discontent, dishonour and disgrace.  I should be very anxious to know what one good thing they did since they took office. Can the Minister for Industry and Commerce stand up here now and tell us that he provided more employment, built more houses or provided more for the relief of our distressed people? If there were some favourable report to be obtained from the present Government, all the criticism that has been hurled from this side of the House would not be hurled.  Turf camps in my area have been closed down&mdash;Boora Camp.  Less have been employed on our bogs.  Between 400 and 500 fewer people are employed by the Laois County Council.</P>
    <P>Drainage work is at a standstill.  The land project is slowing up.  Farmers are consulting their auctioneers and asking: &ldquo;Is now a good time to sell so that we can get out, because the present Government may be in office for another few years and it would be better to sell now than to have to sell later on.&rdquo;  I find that the farmer is the most discontented person in the community to-day.  Not alone is that true of the labouring man and the farmer but it is true also of the businessman.  The Government can give him no guarantee as to the future. The only guarantee that has been given to him is: &ldquo;Stay in existence while you can for when you go you are gone and there is nothing we can do for you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick spoke here last week about timber.  The timber that the inter-Party Government bought and was keeping in this country for the erection of houses for our people has been exported to Belfast and to Britain for use in the construction of houses there.  That is an example of the policy of the present Government.  Then we are told that we are all living beyond our means.</P>
    <P>Look at the present plight of the Old <Col N="381" /> I.R.A.  They are a section of our people which, year after year, is becoming smaller and smaller.  Every day we take up the paper we read that one of them has passed to his eternal reward. Many of those Old I.R.A. men who fought for the establishment of this Parliament are living in rural Ireland. They are suffering the pinch brought about by the increase in the cost of living.  Their pensions or allowances have not been increased.  For those of them who got neither allowance nor pension there is the county home. The Government&mdash;this Government in particular&mdash;have a responsibility to those unfortunate ex-soldiers&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash;of the Republic of Ireland.  We find many of them in county homes.  They may die in a public institution but the moment they die there is a Guard of Honour.  There is a shooting party.  Shots are fired over the grave and a bugler sounds the Last Post.  The ceremony is there when they are dead but they may die in the workhouse or of hunger.  Then the hat goes around for the widow and the orphans to help them to keep body and soul together.  There is no bugle sounding to keep them alive.  Every Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party knows that many of the men who fought nobly and bravely for the freedom of this country are ending their days in workhouses and poorhouses.</P>
    <P>Emigration is the greatest misfortune and disaster that can befall any country.  What were we told by members of the Government?  We were told that we are a roving nation.  We were told that we like to move around, that it is bred in us to be travellers and to wish to see what is going on in other countries.  Never, all during the long 16 years when Fianna Fáil were in office, and for the past 18 months since they returned to office, has there been such a drain from this country as we have at present.  There are no figures or records of emigration&mdash; Fianna Fáil made sure of that.  When they took office they made it quite clear that they would keep no records or statistics in regard to emigration. No Deputy can stand up here and say that so many thousand persons have emigrated or that so many hundreds of thousands have emigrated.  Nobody can state definitely that less than <Col N="382" /> 250,000 persons have emigrated.  We do not know how many have gone, because there are no records.  We know, however, that there is not a town or village in rural Ireland which has not homes to which the fathers, brothers or sisters are sending money from a foreign land to keep the home fires burning.  We know that, day after day, our people are being forcibly driven out of their own country.</P>
    <P>I ask any Fianna Fáil Deputy to compare the Fianna Fáil record in regard to emigration with the work which was done by the inter-Party Government and the efforts they made to stem it.  For the first time in the history of Ireland, as a nation, we heard: &ldquo;Ireland is building.  Come home.&rdquo;  An appeal was made over Radio Éireann, in the Press and in the British newspapers to our carpenters, our plasterers, our painters, our plumbers and our builders to come home from Britain, that there was work and plenty of work for them at home.  Is the radio saying: &ldquo;Come home&rdquo; now?  Are appeals being made from the Irish Embassy in London to Irishmen abroad to respond to the call and to fill in the form, one question of which was: &ldquo;In what part of Ireland do you want to work?&rdquo;  I am referring to the form that was available when the inter-Party Government was in office.  Are any such forms available now?  Are any calls being made to the lonely and distressed ear of the Irish emigrant who is living to-day under the types of conditions to which the Taoiseach referred&mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce was with him&mdash;in Galway?  That was when they expressed their desire and their longing to bring home our emigrants.  They said in Galway that the Irish emigrants are living under disastrous conditions.  Reference was made to English lodging-houses.</P>

      <P>There is only one way of improving the conditions of Irishmen abroad and that is the way in which we were doing it while we were in office &mdash; calling them home to work in their own land, providing their own people with houses, our sick with hospitals, our farmers with drainage <Col N="383" /> and storage, which are not available to them at present, and with the various services necessary for agriculture. There is work for millions in Ireland if we had a proper and sane Government that had the interests of the people at heart.  We see young children leaving school who are immediately faced with the emigrant ship.  It is a sad state of affairs when the father of a family, who has reared a boy or girl until he or she has reached the age of 16 or 17, and who has spent anything from £1,600 to £2,000 in his or her education, is compelled to permit that boy or girl to emigrate to help in the production of food or the production of materials for another country.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture is here because he represents a Gaeltacht district, and from the Gaeltacht come Irish traditions and a special love for the language.

Is it not sadder still to see the blind eye and the deaf ear given to those who need work, and to see that the one section of the people in whom Fianna Fáil are interested, are the people who own dance halls, the ballroom proprietors?  They are the only people for whom Fianna Fáil have done anything since they took office. They gave them a handsome present of £145,000.</P>

      <P>The policy of the present Government is one which has brought great discontent to every section of our people.  I do not wonder at Deputy Cowan rising in this House to criticise the financial policy of the Government.  I do not wonder at the Deputy, having been troubled in his conscience by Deputy Byrne's victory in North-West Dublin, rising in his seat to have a kick at the Tánaiste and his Government.  The quicker Deputy Cowan puts this bag of rags out and goes out along with them, the better it will be for rural Ireland and for the unfortunate people who voted for Deputy Cowan at the last election, believing that he was going to support the inter-Party Government which he has reneged and, as a result of his reneging, has brought ruin, disaster, <Col N="385" /> despair and discontent upon his own constituency, upon his own profession and upon the people of Ireland as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the Supplies and Services Bill gives Deputies an opportunity of dealing with the policy of the present Administration as it relates to the situation that we find in the country.  I think we are justified in looking back on the methods by which the present Government came into power.  In the last election, from platforms throughout the country, Fianna Fáil speakers rubbed home how the inter-Party Government had failed in its duty to the Irish people by permitting the cost of living to rise.  When the Tánaiste stood up to make his opening speech in this debate to-day, I am sure a number of people in the country, the Deputies in his own Party, and those Deputies who support and maintain his Party in office, hoped, and quite reasonably so, that he would give some outline in his statement which might in some way alleviate the unhappy situation that exists in the country to-day.  If we look at the country to-day and as it was 12 months ago, what is the sorry position that presents itself?  Let us, first of all, take the position as it existed when the inter-Party Government went out of office.</P>
      <P>I was not a Deputy then, but I was sufficiently in touch with the political life of the country and conditions generally, as they apply to rural Ireland, to know that there was happiness and contentment born of the fact that almost for the first time in the history of this State there was full employment. For successful government, the most necessary requisite is that our people should be working, more particularly those people who are entirely dependent on their weekly hire, because they have probably the best purchasing power amongst the community. It is fair to say that if good employment exists, there will be a good circulation of money, goods and services will be sought, and the country will be happy, contented and prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that that was the state of affairs <Col N="386" /> which then existed and that it was the position when this Government came back into office.  What is the position to-day?  We have the official figures produced by the Statistics Office, by the Government itself, and no one can controvert them.  These figures show that the number of unemployed, as compared with what the position was when the inter-Party Government was in power, has gone up by from 8,000 to 11,000.  These figures in themselves indicate that there is something seriously wrong.  One would have thought that, when the Minister was speaking this morning, he would have indicated what the policy of the Government was for dealing with this unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I was not present for most of his speech, but I have read a report of it in the evening papers, and I find that it was confined almost entirely to the price of bread.  Is it-not a sorry state of affairs to find that on the Supplies and Services Bill, the only statement the Minister had to make to this Irish Parliament was as to why the price of bread had gone up? I accept his explanation as giving the facts, but is it a satisfactory explanation?</P>
    <P>The situation, as I can read it, is that he had to permit an increase in the price of bread because the employees were looking for an increase in their wages.  It is not very hard to find the reason why they were looking for an increase in their wages. I think we can find a sufficient explanation for it in this year's Budget which enshrines the policy of the Government in power for the time being.  I think that answers the question for everybody.  You have at the moment a vicious circle which is going to continue to the detriment of the country so long as you have the present Government maintained in power by people who were not elected to put them there.</P>
    <P>Ever since Fianna Fáil was returned to power, there has been a continuous rise in the cost of living.  What gives stability to a country?  The people who, by their work which produces goods and services, and thus ensure that money will be kept in circulation. That money provides employment for <Col N="387" /> the people who, in turn, keep the factories going by purchasing the goods they produce.  What do we find to-day?  We find that unemployment has increased by between 8,000 and 11,000.  Someone has to maintain them.  If you have a number of people in a country doing nothing, somebody has to support them.  I am not decrying the fact that they must be supported. Everyone has the right to live in his own country, and if a Government does not provide work for the people then the people have the right to make a claim on the social services which are offered to them.  If you have a large number of people who are a deadweight on the State, through no fault of their own, is it not crystal clear that someone has to pay for that? Social services have to be provided for them, and the increased payments in respect to these social services fall back on the Irish people.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons for increased taxation.  When the inter-Party Government were in power they gave the people employment and a decent standard of life.  With one or two exceptions, they did not look for extra taxes.  Deputies in my constituency, when on the hustings at the last election, screamed with indignation &mdash; they frothed at the mouth almost &mdash; over the extravagance of their predecessors and the national debt which they had put on the country. They put that national debt to good purpose by employing the people.  That was done at a normal rate of interest.</P>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil Party came into power they let the situation hang. For 12 months or more they had been repeatedly advised from these benches by people of financial acumen who had studied the situation, to go for a loan at a suitable rate of interest.  They got that advice at a time when it was possible to obtain cheap money. Instead of doing that, they blackened their predecessors.  I suppose it is fair politics, to a certain extent, for any Government or Party to blacken the Opposition or to paint as bad a picture as they can to put before the public. Possibly that is allowable and possibly it is justified, always provided that you <Col N="388" /> do not ruin the country.  As a result of that foolish and misguided policy, the Minister for Finance found that, in the interests of employment and of maintaining the services of the State, he had to do what his immediate predecessors did.  He had to do what that Party denounced us for doing when we were in office.  He had to go for a loan, but, as we know to our cost, the unfortunate part about the Fianna Fáil Party is that it is always too late. They went for the loan but did so too late.  As they have told us they got the money.  The head of the Minister for Finance is unbowed, but the country is not unbowed.  The result is that ordinary working people throughout the length and breadth of the country, with no education on financial matters, think that this has been the greatest mistake in the history of this State since its inception, because now they know that the rate of interest on houses is to go up.</P>
    <P>They know that dear money affects them just as much as it affects the financiers.  They know that it will cause a slump in the building trade. Then we are back to unemployment and to the emigrant ship.  Were we not waiting long enough to have our own native Government without having to face such a situation as has been created, causing disturbance in industry and in building, through the misguided policy of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    <P>What is the position in the country towns to-day?  Deputies who come from rural constituencies know just as well as I do the state of affairs existing to-day.  They know that in the country towns the spectre of unemployment is haunting housewives of the working class and of the middle class.  These housewives do not want very much down the country anyway.  They want to be able to live, to maintain and feed their families and rear them in a decent state of comfort, and, above all, they want security.  I maintain that that has been denied to the people of Ireland since this Government came into power.</P>
    <P>In Gorey, near where I live, we had a thriving prosperous leather factory <Col N="389" /> employing about 180 men.  These men were given full employment all the time the inter-Party Government were in power.  There was no trade recession and we were not forced to let men go during the three and a half years of the last Government.  When Fianna Fáil came into power that state of affairs was soon changed.  When they were exactly six months in power the 180 employees in that factory were reduced to 40; some 140 of them were thrown on the roads.  They stayed in their own country.  They were a dead weight around the neck of the people who were working.  They had to draw unemployment benefit.  As Deputies know, unemployment benefit does not go on indefinitely.  But the unemployment in this particular factory went on and eventually we lost from the town of Gorey 50 or 60 wage earners, most of whom were married men rearing families in comfort until Fianna Fáil came into office.  These men were added to the list of unemployed throughout the towns in the country. That gives us an idea of the unhappy position in this country at the present moment.</P>
    <P>At the recent by-election the people of Dublin with no uncertain voice told the Fianna Fáil Government to quit. I think that is a fair statement.  After all, if there is a two to one majority against a Government, the intimation to that Government is that the people no longer want them there.  Perhaps Dublin has received more from this Government &mdash; or shall I put it in a better way? &mdash; that it has suffered less hardship under this Government than the rural constituencies.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking this morning many of us were hoping that he would outline some policy which would alter the state of affairs we are facing to-day, some policy which would be for the benefit of the country.  What will happen in Dublin if the present rate of expansion goes on?  The size of Dublin is far in excess of what it should be; it is top heavy.  There are far too many industries in Dublin. Some of these industries should have been established in the country.  What are we to look forward to if the present unhappy state of affairs continues?  We can look forward to mass unemployment. <Col N="390" /> What does that mean in Dublin? It means that an overburdened agricultural industry, which is the whole basis of our economic life, will be further taxed to maintain the people brought into Dublin by the extensive development here, and so produce a worsening of the unhappy industrial situation which is developing.  We have too many industries centred in Dublin; we have too few industries centred in the country.</P>
    <P>In view of the heavy rate of interest which Fianna Fáil have seen fit to bring about people may leave Dublin and go to live in the country because it is cheaper.  But, if they do, the Minister, who is responsible for developing industry in this country, will want to give to these people some opportunity of living.  But the difficulty about that is the curtailing of building which is bound to occur, and which will affect many of our factories scattered throughout the country.  We have a furniture factory in Wexford and an electrical equipment factory in New Ross.  Such factories as these are largely dependent on the building of houses, because new houses require electrical equipment and furniture.  We have already large industrial unemployment in the country, and there will be a worsening of that situation.  I do not know how long this Government will remain in office.</P>
    <P>Anyway the people of the country are hoping that it will not be long.  The question I am asked nearly every day of the week since the by-election in Dublin is: &ldquo;Have you any chance of getting them out?&rdquo;  Presumably however they will hold on.  Those who are supporting them will cling like leeches to them and they will all go down together.  If they are going to hold on I hope that the Government will try to give us some sort of constructive policy.  As they have floated a loan of £20,000,000 I hope that they will use that money to endeavour to develop the country and to rectify the unhappy state of affairs which they have created. If they are not prepared to do that I think that there is only one honourable thing for them to do.  I understand that the Taoiseach is returning next week and I am sure I hope that he <Col N="391" /> returns in good health.  He has been away for some time now and when he realises the condition which things have got to in this country, a condition which, I submit, is not due to outside influences but solely and purely to mismanagement, misgovernment and a total lack of foresight in policy, I hope that the Taoiseach will do what the Irish people want him to do: dissolve Dáil Éireann and accept the will of the people.</P>

      <P>My contribution to this debate will be brief.  Possibly there is no person here who knows better than I do and than the Chair does the effect this Bill will have on rural constituencies such as we represent. When the present Government came into power they appointed a Parliamentary Secretary to the Government whose sole duty was to look after the Gaeltacht.  I am trying to tell this House that the Gaeltacht is fast dwindling and if we continue at the rate we are going in a few years' time we will have no Gaeltacht left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to talk of politics as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, but I say that day after day the Gaeltacht is being denuded of its Irish speakers. Even worse, those Irish speakers are now practically cursing the day on which they became Irish speakers because they are suffering a handicap in not knowing the English language.  I had hoped that my very good friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government would be able to stem the flow of emigration from the Gaeltacht but unfortunately that flow is gathering day after day.  I thought that one of the first actions of the present Government would be to endeavour to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and give us rural electrification in all the Gaeltacht areas.  We in Donegal have the largest Gaeltacht in Ireland and yet, with the exception of a very small area in the Glencolumbcille district, we have no such thing as rural electrification and without it we cannot expect industries.  If we are to continue merely paying lip service to the Gaeltacht as we have been doing for the last 25 years, however, then <Col N="392" /> very shortly it will no longer be required.</P>
    <P>I had placed great faith in the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to look after fisheries and a Parliamentary Secretary to look after the Gaeltacht, but we will very shortly have no Gaeltacht to look after and I am afraid that we will have no inshore fisheries to look after.  I know that it may be outside the scope of the present Bill, but I wish to say that were it not for the fact that Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture endeavoured to set up fish-meal factories on our coasts, when these German trawlers about which we have heard so much got active and became the paying proposition we are led to believe they may have become, our inshore fisheries would have been completely wiped out. I want to see more fish-meal factories and more quick-freezing plants erected along our seaboard.  I want to see canneries if possible and I think the Minister should do something about providing canneries wherein we could utilise our surplus fish, our surplus poultry and our surplus fruit and vegetables. These are things that could be done for our congested districts but unfortunately no effort whatsoever is being made to stem the flow of emigration from them.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has gone up and that is no encouragement to any person to remain at home.  We complain about the poor rate which rural Ireland must pay, but do not forget that when the cost of living goes up the cost of the inmates in our institutions goes up, and so sure as to-day follows yesterday the rates all over the country will go up next year.  We must provide for the inmates in the various institutions &mdash; we have no option, and while Government policy is tending towards an increased cost of living we in the various local councils must surely follow that trend and increase our rates.  That again hits the ratepayer and tends to drive him out of the country.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal about hand-won turf.  I remember that in the days of the inter-Party Government we heard it said in this House that the inter-Party Government had killed the <Col N="393" /> hand-won turf scheme in the congested districts and day after day that lie has had to be nailed.  We have had to quote the Minister when he told us that hand-won turf was no longer economic and when instructions were sent down to the various county councils informing them that the production of hand-won turf would have to cease.  We looked for a revival of this prosperous industry on the change of Government but we no longer heard of hand-won turf.  That is a thing of the past and no one is interested any longer, but unfortunately the people who were engaged in the winning of the turf have no substitute employment and are thrown on the labour market, on employment assistance or on the dole.  It is either the dole or emigration for them and with the increased cost of living who can blame them for emigrating? Nobody.</P>
    <P>Again, the Tánaiste mooted the recommendation of Córas Iompair Éireann that it might be necessary to curtail the radius in which private lorry owners might operate.  Do not forget that, first of all, we closed the railways; we threw ourselves on road transport and if we curtail the radius in which these private lorries may operate we are going to hit at anything that is left of the hand-won turf industry.  We are going to nail and finish it.</P>
    <P>I thought that under the Undeveloped Areas Act something would be done for what was originally known as the congested areas.  I put down a question in this House as to the number of applications which were received from people in West Donegal. I am satisfied now, despite the fact that that Act has become law, that over the past 12 months not a solitary industry has been established in the biggest Gaeltacht in Ireland, West Donegal.  Were it not for what my colleague, Deputy Blowick, did in the line of afforestation we would have no employment in that congested area. Were it not for the fact that Deputy Dillon had the foresight to establish in Killybegs fishmeal and quick-freezing plants we would have no industry whatever in South-West Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> However, we have a rival to the industry there in three German trawlers.  I have a question down on this matter; I do not wish to anticipate the answer but I would like to know how these crews were recruited for these three German trawlers.  I would like to know were the unemployed fishermen of West Donegal consulted when these vacancies existed for fishermen on these German trawlers.  It would be most interesting to hear the reply to the question I put down.  We have an unemployed surplus of fishermen.</P>
    <P>We have an unemployed surplus of navigators and deep-sea fishermen, and still we must employ foreign skippers for these foreign trawlers which we have purchased.  I wonder how many of these fishermen employed on these three trawlers are Irish speakers?  I would be most interested to know and I shall ply the House with questions until I find out.  These are the small matters, if you wish, which could be seen to and which could be of assistance in retaining Irish speakers in Irish-speaking parts of Ireland.  Recently I suggested that possibly some of our unemployed Irish musicians could be employed, say, by Radio Éireann in various ways.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I submit it must arise.  We are really discussing at the moment employment and unemployment and the methods by which we can banish this curse and evil of unemployment.  Nothing, no matter how small, should be overlooked, in endeavouring to retain in this country the Irish people who are flowing out.  Day after day we take up our newspapers and find that technicians and experts are being brought in here to advise us on various matters.  We are not ashamed of our Irish experts, our Irish skilled and unskilled labourers but, for goodness' sake, I appeal to the Government: keep them at home; employ them at home.  By doing that we will be building up the Ireland which we all hope to see.</P>

      <P>I hoped that this debate would be finished by now and I was surprised when I came in to find the lines on which it was running.  I was more surprised when I heard the speech we had from Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  A very patethic case he put forward about the unhappy state which this country is in.  He did tell us a number of things in regard to the inter-Party Government and particularly in regard to events just prior to the defeat of that Government.  I think each and every one of us in this House knows that at that time there was another Esmonde in this House and he did not have the same views as those of Deputy Dr. Esmonde. We can have political cainism just as we can have the other kind.  For some reason or another, Deputy Dr. Esmonde went out of his way to make some references to those Deputies who, like myself, generally support the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear to Deputy Dr. Esmonde and to everybody else that I make no apology for so doing.  I am supporting the Government because I believe it is a better Government than the kind of Government we would have if we had Deputy Blowick and a few other members back as Ministers of a Government that, in fact, did nothing during the period they were in office. Deputy Dr. Esmonde talks about the Social Welfare Acts.  Deputy Esmonde, if he was acquainting himself with that period, will remember that in three years we could not get that Social Welfare Act on the Statute Book. Why was it not put on the Statute Book?  Why was it being held up?&mdash; because the Minister who was trying to bring it in was prevented by the group of Deputies in the Party to which Deputy Dr. Esmonde now belongs.  They prevented it seeing the light of day and they prevented it being an Act.  That was the sort of Government we had at that time.</P>

      <P>It is perfectly so. We were anxious at that time also to put a little Bill through dealing with adoption and Deputies on all sides of <Col N="396" /> the House were anxious to have it enacted.  The Minister for Justice of the Fine Gael Party, now Deputy General MacEoin, refused to introduce that Bill and it was only when we got rid of the inter-Party Government that we were able to get that Bill introduced and passed into law.</P>

There was the same story to relate in regard to restrictive practices.  We have now a Bill before the House, and even Deputy Davin will not suggest that it is not relevant to this discussion.</P>

      <P>As far as this Government is concerned, a Bill has been brought in for the purpose of establishing industry in the Gaeltacht and undeveloped areas.  Every facility is available to help in the development of such industry.  A Bill such as this can be discussed in a common-sense way but, apparently, we are just going to have the usual hash on this Bill that we have had on everything else. Deputy Dr. Esmonde talks about &ldquo;the native Irish.&rdquo;  I am quite certain that that is his approach to the people&mdash;&ldquo;the native Irish.&rdquo;  We have our &ldquo;native Irish Government.&rdquo;  During the last debate in which he participated he was talking about the &ldquo;native negroes&rdquo; that he knew so well out in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear to Deputy Dr. Esmonde and to anybody else who wants to know that I believe this Government is doing good work; I <Col N="397" /> believe it will continue to do good work; I believe it is necessary that it should be maintained in office and, as far as I am concerned, my vote will keep it in office.  I want that to be perfectly clear.</P>

I do not want to sound my own trumpet, but I will sound the trumpet of the inter-Party Government for what they did.  I am quite prepared to take the bricks for whatever we failed to do or omitted to do.  More realism should be brought into the debates, particularly into a debate on such a serious matter as Supplies and Services. Talking about the Dublin North-West election and so on is of little use and it is time we got down to brass tacks. For Captain Cowan's information, whatever the inter-Party Government did, whether wrong or right, there are a few major problems still facing the country.  If we of this generation and we members of this House are serious in tackling them even now, we should cut out the nonsense and get down to the work.</P>

I would not like to be guilty of jumping in too soon &mdash; like the boy who sowed the seeds one day and expected results the next &mdash; but I am anxious that something should be done for the Gaeltacht. Perhaps the Minister is not to blame; perhaps the Bill did not go far enough or perhaps it was not wide enough.  I repeat what I said last year, that I believe the Minister framed the Bill and put it before the House with the best intentions.  However, the Gaeltacht has been shamefully neglected under that Act.  I do not say that the board established under it is responsible. Perhaps it is the lack of initiative that is responsible; perhaps the framework of the Act is responsible. Only one factory I know of in Mayo is under way and that is the one in Kiltimagh.</P>

      <P>The one in Ballina is only talk.  The order for biscuits is being talked about still but no biscuits have yet come out of it.  I do not say it is all a fraud but so far there is no factory there or preparation for one. In Kiltimagh there are visible signs, in the site levelling, which is at least giving employment to some of the country lads.  The Ballina factory has not shown above ground so far. Perhaps it is sprouting and the sprouts have not yet reached the surface.</P>
      <P>Why is some effort not being made where the greatest population is and from which there is the greatest emigration &mdash; the mountainous areas of Mayo, Galway and Donegal?  I was astonished to find that nothing had been done in Donegal.</P>

      <P>After one year's trial would the Minister examine the question as, if the initiative is not <Col N="402" /> forthcoming, the Act is failing in its purpose.  Every Act fails in spots, even with the best intentions, as the human mind cannot visualise every possibility and bring in a piece of legislation which will be absolutely the last word.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister.  If the Act failed in that respect and if the initiative is not coming from the people of the locality, something should be done.  I think the Minister was at one with me when we all hoped it would establish industries in the mountainous areas where there are big groups of population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see, if he looks up what I said, that it was hoped to result in establishing industries in towns and nowhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to maintain the towns we must do something for the rural population.  I did not understand that from the Minister when the Bill was going through and I do not think there is anything in the Bill to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense suggests that people who are starting industries will go to the places where they will get water supplies, transport facilities, housing for the workers, and so on.  If they are prepared to go to the undeveloped areas we will give them additional help, but only additional help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by the result of a Bill that we know what it is doing and where it fails.  The Minister must realse that it has failed signally in bringing employment into those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to adopt the attitude of taking the Minister by the throat simply because this Act did not work in the way the majority expected.  Emigration is greatest where the land is of the poorest quality.  In <Col N="403" /> the mountainous areas, there is the greatest congregation of people and the heaviest population.  Whenever there is poverty and privation, if you go to those areas you will find it at its worst.  If the Bill is not remedying that, I would impress seriously on the Minister the need to overhaul the whole Act and remedy any faults that have come to light.</P>

      <P>Two power stations in West Mayo is not bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in North Mayo.</P>

      <P>That is all to the good. If the factory in Ballina materialises it will do good, too.  The one in Kiltimagh is going ahead and we are proud of it, but from Bangor Erris to Galway Bay there is a huge stretch of country, densely population, from which there is the greatest emigration and there is no factory, no power station and no <Col N="404" /> attempt at anything.  I hope the Minister will not think I am talking politics. The Bill was intended as a genuine effort to induce the population to remain there.  In that area there is the hard core of native Irish speakers, where the tongue is spoken in its purity.  That little hard core is diminishing day by day and we should do something about it.  I want to impress that on the Minister, so that he will bring it to the notice of the Government and of his colleague the Minister for Lands.  During my time in office &mdash; and I hope this will not be taken as blowing my own trumpet but taken just as a pointer in order to get the assistance of the Minister &mdash; we realised that if we want to maintain people in rural Ireland the best form of employment is in afforestation.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
