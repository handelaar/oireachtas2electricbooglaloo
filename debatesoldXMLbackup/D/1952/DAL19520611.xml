      <P>On the Order of Business. Last night your attention, Sir, was drawn to a statement of a very slanderous nature which was made during the course of the debate on the Finance Bill by the Minister for Finance. I should like to know what redress the Labour Party are to have in regard to that malicious statement which was untrue and completely false as was demonstrated last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that it has always been the practice in this House when a Deputy states that a statement made by another Deputy is incorrect that the Deputy making the incorrect statement has been required to accept the denial?  We have stated absolutely and categorically that the statement made by the Minister for Finance was untrue, and the customary practice has been for a decent-minded Minister or Deputy to withdraw his allegation in the face of that denial. My position is this: the Minister should either prove his statement&mdash;and we have offered him opportunities to prove it&mdash;or he should withdraw it. That is the simple, honest position which any fair-minded person ought to face up to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, if a charge is made against any individual Deputy by any other Deputy in this House and the charge is denied, the Deputy making the charge is expected to withdraw it and is asked to withdraw it.  But this is a charge against a Party and must be regarded as a political charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed on the Second Stage the difficulty of finding one's way through the maze of amending Acts with regard to housing.  Can the Minister hold out any hope of a consolidation of these Acts in the future or at least that there will be something in the nature of a handbook or memorandum so that members of local authorities, apart from Deputies, can understand the relevant provisions? I think the Minister will agree that it is very difficult for members of local authorities to find their way around and know what the position is and something in the nature of simplification would be welcome if it is possible to do it.</P>

      <P>I understand that my Department is about to engage in that work and it is possible that I may make a statement on the matter in the course of the discussion on my Estimate.  The announcement that a start has been made on work of that nature does not mean that it is likely to come to a conclusion at a very early date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not explained the purpose of it.  I will not say that the Minister has treated us with scant courtesy, bearing in mind the atmosphere in which I want to discuss this Bill, but he has treated us somewhat cavalierly in giving us these amendments late last night.  I received my copy in stencil form about 8 o'clock last night.  Knowing that they were to be discussed this morning, I think the Minister might have given them to us a bit earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they were given to us at such short notice, I am afraid there will have to be a somewhat fuller explanation than there might have been had we had more time to study them and see the implications of them.  The Minister will appreciate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Mrs. Crowley was that in certain Gaeltacht areas it was and is the practice to extend the Section 7 grants to the recipients of these Gaeltacht housing grants and these recipients would be suffering a disadvantage inasmuch as the instalment of the grant paid prior to 1st August, 1950, would debar such Gaeltacht recipients from the Section 7 local authority grant.  I am putting down this amendment for the purpose of bringing the Gaeltacht areas into line with other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, in relation to the definition of a relevant grant this appears to be the appropriate place to get some information I want.  As between the Kildare Country Council and Naas Urban Council, there <Col N="1054" /> has been a considerable difference of opinion as to what is the official interpretation by the Minister's Department of the commencement date under the 1950 Act.  Originally we understood that the relevant date for consideration was the date of the signing of the Act, which was either 1st August, 1950, or 31st July, 1950.  We thought that no house in respect of which a grant had been allocated before that date, or a house commenced before that date, could qualify.  We then discovered that that was not the official interpretation. The official interpretation was that the house should not have been started before 1st March, 1950, and so far as the grant was concerned the relevant date was the payment of the last instalment.</P>
      <P>I had occasion recently to read certain correspondence addressed to the Naas Urban Council.  In a letter from the Minister's Department to the Naas Urban Council that body was advised that they ought to go back to 1st November, 1947, which was the relevant date under the 1948 Housing Act. There definitely appears to be some confusion and I would like on this section, because it does affect the whole interpretation of Section 7 of the 1950 Act and Section 9, 10 and 11 of this Bill, to know from the Minister the power a county council has to make a grant under Section 7.  Were they entitled to make their scheme in respect of any house commenced after the 1st November, 1947, or whatever the relevant date was?  Were they entitled to make their grant in respect of a house even though the ministerial grant had been allocated or the first instalment paid before the passage of the Act or even the second instalment paid before the passage of the Act? What was the position?  Undoubtedly there is some confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a copy of the circular which issued to local authorities the final paragraph of which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Finally the Minister wishes to make it clear that no provision should be made in any scheme under Section 7 for the payment of a supplementary grant in respect of any house for which a State grant was <Col N="1055" /> allocated before the 1st August, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;allocated&rdquo; is the important word in that paragraph and the way in which we interpret that word is &ldquo;paid&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Some local authorities are under the impression that it means &ldquo;approved of for a grant&rdquo; not that the first instalment should be paid.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that it is very necessary to make that clear. I know that some local authorities have refused to pay any supplementary grant on the grounds that a house was approved of for a grant before the 1st August, 1950.  Cork County Council brought in a scheme which specified anybody who had not got the final grant in April, 1950.  If that was the case, not &ldquo;having paid the final grant before August, 1950&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the building of the house affect the case or is it purely the payment of the Government grant which affects the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>That is the interpretation which we have placed on the operative word in that paragraph.  The amendment which the House has already accepted intends to apply a procedure to the Gaeltacht areas whereby where an instalment of the grant was paid prior to the 1st August, 1950, but the final instalment was not paid then the Section 7 local authority grant may be made.  This goes to establish that according to the procedure we have been following and the interpretation we have been placing upon the matter raised by Deputy Sweetman it is the date of the actual final payment which decides the procedure to be followed.</P>

      <P>If a person got the first part of the Government grant for the erection of a house in July, 1950, and the second half in August, 1950, he would be eligible for consideration for a supplementary grant under Section 7. Under the Bill as drafted if a person in a Gaeltacht area got a Gaeltacht housing grant for a new house he is eligible for consideration for a supplementary grant under Sections 9 and 10 only where the first instalment of the Gaeltacht grant was made after the 1st August.  Under the Bill as drafted that was the position and the amendment which the House has accepted clarifies that and places these people in the same position as people in other areas.  Therefore, according to our interpretation it is not a matter of when the erection of the house began but of when the final instalment was paid.</P>

      <P>They would be eligible for consideration for any scheme drafted under Section 7, but each local body remember had its own scheme and <Col N="1057" /> I have not got the different schemes before me.  All I can say is that any scheme prepared by a local body under Section 7 could be so framed as to permit of the payment of a supplementary grant where the first instalment of a State grant had been paid before the 1st August and the final instalment had been paid after the 1st August.  It does not follow, however, that all schemes were drafted in such a way as to permit local bodies to do that.</P>

      <P>The difference between the date of allocation and the date on which the grant was paid should be clarified.

      <P>That is not so at all. You are approaching the thing from the wrong angle.  If it has not been paid before the 1st August that is all right and no question could arise.  The point raised by Deputy Sweetman was this: since the operative date for the 1950 Housing Act was the 1st August, 1950, he wanted to know whether an applicant for a supplementary grant, who had begun the erection of a house maybe in 1947 or 1948, but had received the first instalment of the grant in respect of the house only by the 1st August, could be included in a scheme prepared under the Act of 1950 which would not come into effect until the 1st August.  I have tried to show that if the local authority so designed their scheme, such a grant could be paid by them.</P>

      <P>I understand quite well now what the Minister said, but that was not appreciated by local authorities and, with all respect, I do not think that it was appreciated by the Department at the beginning of the operation of the Act.  Certainly, we, in Kildare, were led to believe that we were not entitled to go back further than the 1st March, 1950. Where the date, &ldquo;the 1st March, 1950&rdquo;, arose we were never able to discover, but we were told that the building of the house had to commence after the 1st March, 1950.  We had some light on the matter only subsequently, quite recently, after the correspondence addressed to the Naas Urban Council, which was to the effect the Minister has just stated.</P>
      <P>I quite appreciate that the Minister under this Bill cannot make local authorities deal with the matter, but I want to say that where there was a genuine misapprehension, as there was quite definitely in our case, as to the date from which we were entitled to get our scheme to commence to operate, nothing in the Bill should prevent us now from putting through an amending scheme to cover it.  Now that I know the position, we will have an opportunity of dealing with it when we come to amendment No. 22, but I want to urge on the Minister that nothing should be done in this Bill which would prevent local authorities from rectifying the position as they were led to believe it existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with regard to the position in the matter of grants under Section 7 in my county, but there is another side which is giving trouble.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is competent for a local authority to withhold grants under Section 7 in cases where people have borrowed money under the Small Dwellings Act and to credit the amount of these grants to the liquidation of the loan.  That position has developed in my county and is giving rise to great annoyance.  Where people have built houses with the assistance of loans under the Small Dwellings Acts, the officials have now decided that the amount of the grants under Section 7 <Col N="1059" /> will be applied to the reduction of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being done in my county.  It is being done only in cases where the maximum loan has been borrowed, but the method of calculation is not what I understood to be the method intended.  I always understood that under the Small Dwellings Act you could borrow up to 90 per cent. of the value of the house, but a system has been devised now of getting the deputy engineers to value the houses and to value them at a very low level in order to bring practically all the houses erected under this within the ambit of the scheme, and people who built their hopes on making use of grants under Section 7 find now that, instead of drawing the money, which would amount to almost £100, they have to leave it with the county council to be applied in reduction of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a type of case about which I have never heard anything before.  I do not know that such a matter could arise, but the Deputy is aware that local bodies have considerable freedom in the matter of the conditions they attach to moneys provided under the Small Dwellings Act, and although, as he says, they are free to advance so far as the law is concerned a very high percentage of the entire valuation of the house, very few rural local authorities&mdash;it would not apply in the case of the Dublin Corporation, or Cork or Limerick, or some of the big built-up areas&mdash;make loans under the Small Dwellings Act up to the amounts they are entitled to make.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way it is, but they have their own reasons for adopting these practices.  If, in Roscommon, for example, a man is getting a loan under the Small Dwelling Act and a supplementary grant from the same authority and if he is getting what is regarded as a very large loan, having regard to the value of the house, the local authority could stipulate the conditions <Col N="1060" /> that the Deputy has referred to.  I am not going to express any opinion, because I do not know the details sufficiently well, as to whether they are wise in doing so or not, but that they have the right to do so I have no doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in raising the matter was to direct the attention of the Minister and the Department to the system adopted with regard to depressing the value of the house.  We find that the value of the house is estimated by the county council official at a figure considerably lower than what would be the market value.  A house which would normally fetch £1,100 or £1,200 is valued at £700 in order to bring it within the sphere of operation of this condition.</P>

      <P>The local council adopted Section 7 of the 1950 Act and the officials of the council were asked to devise a scheme.  They said that, in cases where persons had availed of the maximum loan, they would apply the amount of their grant under Section 7 to the reduction of the loan.  We did not object to that, where persons had availed of the maximum loan, because we thought they were referring to the 90 per cent. loan, but now we find that the maximum loan is calculated by the council engineers on the basis of the purposely depressed value of the house.  It is calculated by the addition of the amount of the State grant, plus 5 per cent., and that is considered the maximum grant to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the way in which the grant may be paid in cash or allotted in reduction of a Small Dwellings Act loan depends on the proportion of the loan to the value of the house.  Under the 1950 Act, a person building a house valued at £1,500 must contribute 5 per cent. himself, which is £75.  He gets £275 by way of Government grant, on the assumption that it is a water and sewerage house, which makes £350. That leaves £1,100 and, in Kildare, we give him a loan up to £1,150.  If he takes a loan, not of £1,150, but of £1,100, when it comes for us to make a supplementary grant under the definition here, we give him 50 per cent. in cash to bring him up to £1,150 and write off £225 of his loan.</P>
      <P>As we understand it, we are not entitled to pay such a sum as, with the Government grant and the 5 per cent. and the amount that there is on the loan, will exceed the value of the house.  Whether the supplementary housing grant is paid in cash or by way of writing off the loan must depend on whether the payment in cash would bring the applicant in over the 5 per cent. limit or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he borrows £1,100, he has to pay interest at 3¾ per cent. on £1,100.  Later on, you give him £50 and you reduce the loan by £225, the amount of the supplementary grant.  He originally paid interest on £1,100.  Does he have to continue to pay interest on £1,100 or on £1,100 less the £225?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The £225 is paid.  It operates in exactly the same way as if a man walked in with £225 of his own money and redeemed that amount of the loan.  Therefore, as he has paid interest on it up to the date the council grant is transferred over in reduction of the loan, as from that date <Col N="1062" /> he does not pay any further interest. He has to pay the fine that the Local Loans Fund exacts for paying back before the due date, but that is a trifling thing.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation are very anxious to transfer the ownership of tenant houses to their tenants by way of a tenant purchase scheme.  I have mentioned here on several occasions <Col N="1063" /> that we have at present 30,000 tenants occupying corporation houses, and the corporation feel that it is desirable, from a social point of view, that as many of these tenants as possible should be encouraged to purchase their houses under an approved scheme.  It was indicated to us in the corporation that this Bill might be availed of by the Minister for the purpose of giving sanction to local authorities to sell their houses to the tenants. I do not know whether that is necessary in the Bill or not.  I am simply asking whether it is proposed under this section to make regulations whereby such local authorities would be enabled to prepare schemes for the transfer of ownership under a tenant purchase scheme.  The Minister will agree that that is desirable and I think this may be the right opportunity to get the necessary sanction for the adoption and operation of such a scheme.

I am not expressing any personal view at this stage as to what the attitude should be now in regard to questions of this nature.  Schemes have been submitted to me and to my predecessor and while, as a general principle, all of us might be favourably disposed to that idea, there might be circumstances, and perhaps at the present time these circumstances do exist, in which one would not look so favourably upon implementing a scheme as they would in circumstances that were different.  Let me not go into that side of the question at all <Col N="1064" /> but merely say that there is no necessity to provide here for such a thing, since the law permits of its happening already, and if the local authority wishes they can do so, with the approval of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think this is the section upon which one should discuss the delay that there is at present in the payment of housing grants, and to express the hope that in future, under this Bill, there will not be similar <Col N="1065" /> delays.  This is the section which grants the expenses of inspectors who deal with this matter.  I think that Deputies on all sides, from what I hear in the way of gossip around this building, find that in some cases there is great delay.  Sometimes, quite frankly, the delay is not the fault of the Department's inspector, nor is it due to departmental action very often after a report is made.  I think it is unfortunate that there is not an earlier inspection before a person wants to start a house, especially at this time of the year.  It is unfortunate that there is delay sometimes in the appointment of the local engineer who is employed for the purpose, but it is much more unfortunate that there is delay in the payment of the final grants where that delay does not arise through the Department.  The delay in regard to inspections can only arise because the inspector is not satisfied with the work that has been carried out and because he requires something else to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a great lack of clarity in the statements by inspectors all over the country as to what is to be done.  It would very much facilitate applicants if the deficiencies in regard to housing, and in respect of which the payment of the grants must be held up, were more clearly pointed out.  I hope that, when this Bill becomes law and when the Minister is getting expenses under Section 4, he will make every effort to ensure that the delays which exist at present will not only be obviated, but removed.  Everybody knows that those who are engaged in the trade of supplying building materials are pressing for the payment of their accounts more quickly than they were inclined to do some time ago.  That means that there is further pressure on the applicant who is building to meet his accounts more quickly. All that emphasises the fact that applicants need to have these grants paid to them promptly.  I think every section of the House would welcome a statement from the Minister that he will ensure that there will not be delays in the future.  I remember the Minister saving, only a few weeks ago, that he had been through the position and had found that, in his opinion, there was not delay, and that the <Col N="1066" /> position was reasonably satisfactory. All that I can say in regard to that is that the reports which are given to the Minister by his Department must be entirely different from the experience of every member of the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what has been said by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy McGrath in regard to greater expedition in the payment of these grants.  I do not know what is the reason for the hold-up at present.  I often wonder whether it is due to the fact that the inspectorial staff for Cork County is not sufficient. Many people who have completed the work have to wait a considerable period before the inspector is able to visit the houses and make an inspection. I am receiving representations every other day from people telling me that the houses are now completed and asking me to try and get the inspector to call on them.  In some cases they have to wait for a couple of months, and the result is that they cannot get payment of the grants due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister and some of the officials in the Department are not fully aware of the annoyance and inconvenience that is caused to many of these applicants for housing grants.  They have to employ carpenters and masons and have to get materials on credit.  Naturally, when they have the work completed they press for payment.  In the cases that have come to my notice their complaints have been quite justified.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would tell us whether or not he is satisfied that the inspector who is operating at present in the County Cork is capable of carrying out all the work that has to be done, particularly in view of the fact that it is a very big area and that he also has to travel to County Kerry.  You have a very large number of applicants for construction <Col N="1067" /> and reconstruction grants, and it may be that he is not able to get around to all the applicants within a reasonable period of time and that some assistance should be given to him.  At any rate, everything possible should be done to remove the annoyance and inconvenience caused to applicants for grants by the over-holding of payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is a bottle-neck here.  There has been criticism of the Department in respect to delay in the payment of grants.  My experience has been that the delay is not in the Department but on the inspection side.  I would frankly ask the Minister to check up on that.  The inspectors doing Donegal live in County Leitrim.  I hope I am not telling any stories out of school when I say they got three reminders in regard to inspections and yet did not carry them out.  If I were the Minister myself I would have disposed of those gentlemen, certainly in regard to cases that came before me.  There is only one conclusion that one can come to in regard to these cases.  It is that these inspectors, who are architects or engineers, apparently have their own private work to do, and then take on housing inspections, in respect of which housing grants are payable, in adjoining or further away counties. When it comes to the evening, having done so many inspections, they clear back to their own county and leave other inspections undone.  That is causing very grave dissatisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is being blamed for not paying the grants, whereas it cannot pay the grants until the houses are inspected and notification given to the Department that the house is satisfactorily completed.  In my opinion, that is where the bottle-neck is.  The Minister should see that the moment an inspector accepts an appointment&mdash;it does not matter who or what he may be or whether he was politically appointed or appointed on his merits &mdash;he should carry out the duties he undertook to the Department because, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, builders' providers cannot now remain long without their money.  They are pressing these people to supply the <Col N="1068" /> goods night and morning in order to pay the accounts.  The man who has built the house cannot do anything because the inspector will not come to inspect his house and he cannot get paid until the inspector inspects the house.</P>
    <P>A lot of the odium that is being passed on to the Department really lies on the inspection side.  I think the Minister should take immediate steps to see that those gentlemen, whoever they are or whoever they may be, will discharge the obligations of the office which they understook from the Department.  When they are looking for the appointments they are quite active about that.  They will be on the spot immediately but apparently, when the appointment is got, it is got just simply as extra padding to their professional duties.  The two things do not fit in.</P>
    <P>In the area in which they live they have their own professional private work to do and then they have the public work to do in the adjoining county.  Those things clash.  They know the housing scheme will come to an end and that they will have to rely on their professional work.  They will thus pay attention first to their private clients.  There is no doubt but that is where the bottle-neck exists.  The officials of the Department are not to blame at all.  In my opinion, the weak link is that of inspection.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies in regard to the delay in the payment of the grants.  This has a slowing-up effect on housing in the rural areas. People building their own houses get credit notes from public utility societies but merchants are reluctant to accept these notes and supply the materials owing to the delay in payment.</P>
      <P>I know people who are living in their houses and to whom the grant has not yet been paid.  Nor has the merchant been paid.  He is continually looking for his money.  The situation is most unsatisfactory from that point of view. In my opinion, you cannot blame him for not supplying the materials when he is so long without his money.  This delay is slowing up housing in the rural areas and I would ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the other Deputies who have spoken on this matter.  I have experience over a very wide area and I find that the delay arises from a number of causes.  Sometimes it is, as Deputy McMenamin pointed out, a lack of sufficient inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I say it is, perhaps, lack of sufficient inspectors.  I would not make the other charge unless I personally found it so.</P>
      <P>I hear complaints from builders of slowness in inspecting the houses. There is also the fact that at times the money is undoubtedly not made available to the local authority.  Therefore, the local authority has not the money to pass on to the individual builder.  That has resulted at times in very serious situations arising, especially now with the tightened type of financial conditions which operates at this moment. That is liable to have a very serious effect on the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister to bring pressure to bear on the Department and on local authorities to see that the grants are made available as soon as possible.  The delay has an effect on the whole country quite out of proportion to the amount of money involved.</P>
      <P>In the building of houses there are so many different interests involved&mdash; business interests and the interests of wage earners, for example&mdash;that any fall down or slowness in the paying out of the money means a very great hardship on occasion for a very large number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>All Deputies have received complaints in regard to delays in inspection.  I was surprised to hear Deputy McMenamin say that this may be due to inspectors having other duties and not being whole-time workers.  I was under the impression that they were whole-time workers.  I thought the delay was mainly due to the fact that they have very large areas to cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in Leinster the areas allocated to particular inspectors are <Col N="1070" /> very large and that even in the case of whole-time officers it would be rather difficult for them to cover the entire area.</P>
    <P>There is another complaint which I have received and that is in connection with the delay in paying the full grant because of inspectors' reports in regard to persons not actually residing in the houses.  I have one particular case in mind of a man who actually resided in the house he built.  He is a tradesman with very limited means.  Yet. practically 50 per cent. of the grant is withheld from him.  Apparently, the inspector came to the conclusion that he was not residing in the house.  Being a single man, of course, he had not very elaborate furnishings or anything else in the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that man should be penalised.  At least, the inspector should have taken a little more trouble to check up before sending in a report which deprived him of practically 50 per cent. of the grant. These are matters which the Minister should look into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies who have spoken about the delay in the payment of grants on subsidy houses.  I can speak with a certain amount of authority in this matter.  Delays of well over six months have occurred in the payment of grants.  I can definitely state that local authorities can pay a sum of £1,800 to a tenant in half the time it takes the Department to pay the grant of £275.</P>
      <P>There is the question of the payment of final grants on houses.  Where interim grants have been paid, the final grant will not be paid on a house at the present time unless the house is occupied.  I suggest that this final grant should be paid when the house is completed on an undertaking by the proposed tenant to move in at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> You have a lot of people in this country who are planning to get married and who will not make final arrangements for their weddings until they see the house finished and until they have time to prepare to furnish and decorate the house.  The unfortunate builder must wait until the man is married and back from his honeymoon before he gets his money.</P>
    <P>I think there is an undue delay caused by certain overlapping of inspections of these houses, particularly for grant purposes.  Practically all subsidy houses at the moment are being built as a result of applications for a small dwellings loan.  Local authorities, through their buildings surveyors and housing engineers, are inspecting these houses, from the foundations up, at every stage of the development of their building.</P>
    <P>When the house is completed and certified for habitation by local authority engineers and, in the majority of cases, for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts loan, another two inspections must occur for the purpose of paying the grant.  All these inspections occur, the final one definitely, when people have been living in their house, possibly, for three or four months.  I can quote one particular case where a man with six children was living in a house for five months before it was inspected.  The payment of the grant was withheld because the locks on some of the doors were loose and because of some other minor details&mdash;damage for which the owner of the house blamed his own children.  These are small matters which cause a lot of dissatisfaction amongst people who are buying houses amongst people who are interested in the building trade.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to examine the method of the payment of the grant.  This grant is paid to a person to help him to buy his own house, but I cannot see why, if prior application is made, this money could not be paid direct to the builder.  The client has to be admitted to the house.  Otherwise the final instalment of the grant will not be paid to him.  There have been several cases, throughout Dublin, at <Col N="1072" /> any rate, where the client has got the final instalment and refused to pay it to the builder.  The builder can do nothing in such cases because the client has not got any money.  I am in the building trade myself, and what I have related above happened to me on three occasions.  These are problems which I feel, could be dealt with under this Bill.  The remedying of them would make the running of the Act easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will agree that these inspections are a safeguard to the person occupying the house or purchasing the house.  At the same time, there are considerable complaints everywhere because of the delays in making payments.  In many cases, those delays are due to the fact that the inspector is not notified that the house is ready for inspection. Where there are delays in that regard, people sometimes bring their grievances to the Deputy representing them, and he attends to the matter. However, those people who have not approached their Deputies are just as entitled to have their grievances remedied in the normal way.  Therefore, the channel through which the inspector is notified ought to be looked into.  Sometimes the delay may occur in the Department due to the fact that some little technicality has not been complied with.  At any rate, the channel should be explored and the inspections expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems referred to by Deputy Belton are different from those that have been mentioned here by other Deputies.  I have heard about the delays that are, from time to time, caused for one reason or another all through the country in the payment of grants to private persons, both for reconstruction purposes and for the building of a new house.  As the saying is: even if a man is a Minister, he has to earn his living as a Deputy.  He too, hears complaints in his own constituency about the delays that occur in the carrying out of initial inspections and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so easy to deal with this matter as some people would have one believe.  An inspector is assigned to two counties, where it is thought he will have just about sufficient work to <Col N="1073" /> keep him going.  However, the volume of work may increase at some particular time, and arrears will grow up.  The inspector establishes a practice for himself of dealing with so many cases per day or per week, and he sends the results of those inspections to his Department.  There would not be sufficient employment in his district for a second man all the time, and temporary relief is sought in order to clear off the arrears.  This occurs from time to time in Deputy McMenamin's county, in Deputy Murphy's county and in many other counties; an additional inspector clears off the arrears, and, perhaps, those arrears may occur again 12 months subsequently.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we are likely to achieve the results that we wish to achieve by simply trying to make everybody believe that all the blame is on the inspector's shoulders and on the Department's shoulders.  Naturally, public men are inclined to take the side of the person looking for the grant against the authority paying the grant. Anything that is said by any of us in favour of the individual applicant, however negligent he may have been in performing his side of the contract, will go down far better than if we take the other line.</P>
    <P>Here is the other side of the picture: the applicant makes an application for a reconstruction grant.  However, he does not describe on his application form what he wishes to be done, and the inspector is at sea.  He arrives at the man's house to find, very often, that the man is away.  Sometimes there is nobody at all in the house, but even if the man's brother or sister or some other relative is at home, they do not know what the applicant has in mind, and they are not aware of the extent of the work or the nature of the work which he wishes to be carried out.  The inspector is expected to come back again in a week's time or in a fort-night's time, but it may not be possible for him to do so.  The same state of affairs applies in the case of the original inspection, but it applies especially in the case of the final inspection for a reconstruction grant or for a grant for a new house, the applicant is away and he has not even gone <Col N="1074" /> to the trouble of leaving a note saying: &ldquo;You will find the key at such-and-such a house.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that it would be better if the inspector wrote to the applicant informing him that he would be coming to inspect the premises on a certain date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath is a very sympathetic man, but his sympathies are all on the one side.  It is not so easy for an outdoor inspector or for an inspector of any kind to make such a notification.  I have no idea what it must be like, but it is not always feasible for an inspector to write to an applicant and to say: &ldquo;I will be inspecting your premises at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock on a certain date.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If an inspector, in a place like Cork, tried to prepare a plan for himself by which he would notify applicants of his movements in advance, it would entail a good deal of thought and trouble, and might result in his not being able to get in the amount of inspections which would otherwise be possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that has not existed merely inside the last three, four or five years.  Since I came into this House, since Housing Acts were the order of the day, that has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further point in connection with people building houses. If a man waits until he has his house completed, he may say to himself that the inspectors will hold him back for a month, six weeks or two months. Therefore, he says: &ldquo;I am coming near my journey's end and I will write in advance of the work being done&rdquo;. Perhaps in that case the inspector will arrive sooner than he thought he would have arrived and he will not have a <Col N="1075" /> door painted or he will not have some windows painted or he will have some other work to complete.  The inspector cannot give him a final certificate and that also means that the inspector is obliged to make a double journey.</P>
    <P>Those are not the type of difficulties that were referred to by Deputy Belton but they are the type that arise for the appointed officer all through the country who has to deal with individual applicants here, there and yonder.  They present not only the inspector but the suppliers of materials, as Deputy Dockrell has pointed out, with difficulty.  They would like to help these people as I am sure many other traders would like to help them.  They are engaged in other work at certain seasons of the year.  They will do building work for a month or two at a slack period, then they will lie off maybe for two or three months and then go back to it again with the result that when the trader supplies him with material he is out of his money for a very long time.  I have received an appeal from traders asking me to try to do something for them because of the amount of money which was owing to them in the country.  It was not that they had any doubt as to their being able to collect it ultimately but the fact that a man is going to secure the money in a year or two does not suffice for the present time.</P>

      <P>These appointed officers are the nominees of the local bodies and they are very often people acting as assistant engineers, and so on.  I am not foolish enough to say that you have no delays that are occasioned by men who are negligent.  I am not even prepared to say that delays are not caused sometimes by a Department, by a section or by an individual dealing with a matter of this kind because of being a bit careless in letting a thing lie round for a week that could be handled sooner.  I am saying, however, that in the main as far as these rural problems are concerned there is a particular difficulty because of the fact that the people who are building these <Col N="1076" /> houses, and very often constructing them largely by their own work and their own effort, are people who have to earn their living otherwise and they just cannot carry on as would an ordinary builder who starts a scheme of work and finishes it, and expects to be paid according to the clock.</P>
      <P>I will certainly do what I can to eliminate any delays.  We have had from time to time conferences with these inspectors.  We do keep a check on the amount of arrears that are growing up in a particular area and we do try to control that and keep it inside manageable limits.  We will continue to do that but even doing your best you will find that, having regard to these factors and to many others that I can cite in this whole matter, it is quite impossible to devise any scheme that will be so satisfactory that no complaint will be heard from any quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like clarification on a few points.  Is there an obligation on a person who desires a housing grant to wait until the appointed officer calls before proceeding <Col N="1077" /> with the work?  Secondly, in the case of applicants for the reconstruction grant, the Minister has spoken of the difficulty of the inspector in informing applicants as to the time of his visit.  But there is also grave difficulty on the side of the applicants themselves.  I know applicants in my own parish who applied last February for reconstruction grants and made arrangements with the local tradesmen in expectation that in the course of a month or two they would require their services.  Everybody knows tradesmen are scarce and that it is difficult to obtain their services, especially during the summer months.</P>
      <P>In this particular case the inspector has not yet called and these people are afraid to commence work in case that when the inspector would call he would turn down the work because he had made no prior inspection and because there was no approval given for such work.  The Minister will appreciate that a person who applied for a reconstruction grant last February ought reasonably to expect to commence work in May and that he has grounds for being annoyed, particularly in view of the fact that these people have made arrangements with tradesmen and have to break these arrangements again and again.  Would the Minister tell me now what is the position of these people when the inspector calls? Having waited for four months for the inspector to visit him, if he proceeds with the reconstruction work on his own account, particularly when he has tradesmen employed for a given time, will he get no credit for that portion of the work which is done previous to the inspector's call?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not set out in that that he is going to wait for five or six months.  That is the length of time which has elapsed in the case I have mentioned because I handed in the application form at the beginning of February; now it is the 11th June and the matter is still in abeyance. Supposing the inspector does not call for the next 12 months, must he continue <Col N="1078" /> to remain in a dilapidated house or has he any redress?  It is outrageous that a person should have to wait so long.  Two months should be quite sufficient time to elapse between the date of the application and the inspector's visit.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading I asked the Minister to elaborate in his reply&mdash;and he missed doing so&mdash;the difference between the grants that the Minister is providing under this section <Col N="1079" /> in rural areas and the grants that are provided under the land project for bringing water to a farmhouse.  As I understand clause (a) of this section, it must have reference to a rural area and must, therefore, have reference to a farmer's house, not exclusively to a farmer's house, but it must include a farmer's house.  There are already arrangements under the land rehabilitation project by virtue of which a water supply can be brought to a farmer's house and I think there are arrangements also for it to be brought out to farm buildings.  As I suggested then, I thought it too good to be true to expect that the person concerned would get both grants, but I would like the Minister to indicate the delimitation of his grant and where the other will commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to give them two grants but, as far as I know, you cannot get a grant under the scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture to which the Deputy has referred for the actual installation of water in the house itself or the establishment there of the conveniences that are desirable.  Therefore, this grant here will extend to that type of work and is, therefore, different from the grant which is provided by the Department of Agriculture.  I must say that I did raise with the Department of Agriculture the desirability of handing over that portion of any scheme that they operated which referred to dwellinghouses.  I think it would be desirable if these were operated by the same Department. That has not happened, so far at any rate, and what is being provided for here is that a grant will be payable for the provision of water in the sense that I have tried to describe.</P>

      <P>Personally, I thought I understood this section until the Minister spoke.  Do I take it now that the purpose of this section is to provide a necessary addition to the scheme under the Department of Agriculture, where the water is brought only to the house, and that this money is to be <Col N="1080" /> provided for the distribution of the water through the house, so to speak?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that it is to supplement the other provision? There are houses, with all due deference to Deputy Sweetman, many houses, in rural Ireland which are not farmhouses and have no piped water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it could, but I assume the State is not going to give two grants for the same purpose.  I understood from the section that what it was trying to do was to provide for houses in hamlets and small villages where there is no water supply and that the agriculture scheme provides for farmhouses.  The Minister has gone on a different line altogether and it will depend on the regulations he makes.  As the section reads, it does not do anything at all about these regulations.  I think the Minister should make the House very clear now as to his intention.  Unfortunately, his intention is not here.  Are we to understand that he will make a regulation which will include provision for those who have got a piped water supply in the farmhouse under the Department of Agriculture scheme, that they will now be able to get an extra £50, or up to £50, from the Department of Local Government in order, say, to put in a bathroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one other point.  There is a phrase in clause (a): &ldquo;no public piped water supply or sewerage scheme has been provided or is being provided&rdquo;.  How wide is that &ldquo;is being provided&rdquo; held to be?  For instance, if a local authority has a large water scheme on paper, which everyone knows will not materialise for many years because of various difficulties, is that to be considered a scheme which &ldquo;is being provided&rdquo; or does the phrase &ldquo;is being provided&rdquo; mean at the time that the actual work is in hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister give us an answer to a specific case, which is the easiest way of dealing with it.  If a farmer, under the Department of Agriculture scheme, gets a water supply to his kitchen, I understand that under the Department of Agriculture he will only get the water supply brought to one point in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If he gets the grant to bring the water to the kitchen and if he has brought the water to the kitchen and if subsequently he wants to put in a bathroom and a sewerage system in his house, will he get his grant under Section 7 to do that additional work? I think that is the net issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the case that where a grant was paid from the Department of Agriculture, it was not our intention that a grant under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be paid in the same case and I want to say also that no grant for the provision of water will be paid under the Department of Agriculture scheme in respect of any dwellinghouse towards the construction of which a State grant had been paid at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum grant for a similar type of water supply so far as farms are concerned is £100 and the £50 here appears to be a very small grant for this type of scheme.  I have in mind people in villages where there is considerable difficulty in connecting up with whatever water scheme is available.  I suggest that this grant will be found to be inadequate.  Bearing in mind that the maximum grant for a similar type of water supply so far as farms are concerned is £100, I would appeal to the Minister, if at all possible, to increase that £50 to a sum something like the sum provided in the other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Minister's statement that this grant will be of no benefit whatever to farmers because a farm water supply grant would be of more benefit.  From what he said it is quite clear that a farmer cannot take advantage of this scheme if he proposes to initiate a water supply for his farmhouse.  Under such a scheme he would at least be assured of getting water to his house but the £50 grant which it is proposed to give here might only finance such a scheme to a limited extent.  If a full grant is available under the water supply scheme, so far as I can see the provision in this section would not be of any advantage to a farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has taken no heed of the explanation which I have already given, that a farmer who builds a new house and gets a State grant in respect of it, cannot get a grant from the Department of Agriculture for the purpose he has stated.  Agriculture will not pay a grant for the provision of water in respect of a house towards the erection of which a State grant has already been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of some people who have experienced tough luck in regard to the provision of such water supplies.  These people, when applying for grants for new houses, did not go in for the extra grant of £50, but when the house was completed they changed their minds and went ahead with the installation of water supplies.  They then made application to the Department for the extra grant and were turned down on the ground that such work was not included in the certificate of approval.  They were also turned down by the Department of Agriculture on the ground that the grant was available in the Department of Local Government and that they should have applied for that.  I wonder would the Minister consider the case of people who carried out works such as these?</P>

      <P>Will Deputies not admit the undesirability, in cases of this nature, of endeavouring to get me to explain something that will have to be covered at a later stage by regulations? All I can do is to reveal as best I can what is in my own mind as to the sort of thing that will be covered by these regulations.  I think it would not be desirable that I should be called upon at this stage to make definite statements.  In fact, if I were, I could not make myself as clear as some Deputies would want me to be. I do not think it would be a desirable thing, anyhow, because when we come to draft the regulations I might like to see these regulations drafted in a manner that would give the Department more freedom than any statement I might make here would permit or vice versa.  All I can say is that this grant is being provided for rural areas, for areas in respect of which no public piped water supply scheme is likely to be provided in future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we not all know that there are thousands of places where there is not the slightest possibility of a public piped water supply in future? That is the type of case this provision is designed to meet.  When the regulations are being drafted, I hope they will be drafted in a manner to give the greatest possible scope in reason to those who will have the task of operating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the type of place that Deputy Sheldon mentioned is concerned, the Minister suggested that this section is to be restricted to cover places in which it is not likely that the local authority will provide piped scheme.  That knocks the bottom out of this section so far as the vast majority of rural districts in the country are concerned.  Most progressive local authorities have in their minds schemes, or perhaps I should say plans, to introduce water schemes throughout the area of their authority as time goes on, but one cannot yet say for certain whether these schemes of local authorities will ever come to fruition. If the Minister takes the view that the test is whether such a scheme is likely to be provided or not, without any regard to the point of time, then so far as the rural hamlet is concerned this section will be of no use at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope candidly that, with the development of rural electrification and the development of automatic electric pumps, we shall have a system in the rural areas where ultimately there will be a small water tower and an automatic electric pump that cuts in automatically, without the necessity of employing caretakers or attendants. That will be the method of providing water supplies for hamlets, possibly in the very distant future in certain areas. If we are considering the lay-out of a long-term development scheme in the Kildare County Council, because I happen to mention that it might be possible to provide at some far distant date such a scheme for the village of Carbury, according to the statement which the Minister has made just now, <Col N="1085" /> nobody can get assistance to put in sewerage or water supplies in Carbury under this Bill.  The effect of such words as &ldquo;likely to be provided&rdquo; will mean that local authorities will not investigate the possibility of providing such schemes until they are right up against it.  It will, therefore, discourage planning in advance and discourage enterprise by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should reconsider his views on this section.  I have a sort of suspicion that the reason the Minister is trying to hedge on this section as to what he means by it is because the famous words go into the beginning of the section &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;. I have a suspicion that he is trying to defend his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and that there has not been an agreement between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance as to what exactly will be covered in this section.  I think the Minister is fighting a rearguard action in this connection and I have a certain amount of sympathy for him.</P>
    <P>I am still not clear, under this section, as to where the Minister begins in respect of the farmers' grant and where the Department of Agriculture ends.  I appreciate the point in regard to new houses.  Let us take an old house to which water has been brought, say, by a ram with the assistance of a Department of Agriculture grant and has been brought to one point in the house&mdash;the kitchen, the scullery or whatever it is.  Let us assume that, having got his supply of water perhaps a long way to the house with the ram, the farmer then wishes to put in the amenities of a bathroom, flush lavatory and a septic tank.  Does he or does he not get a grant to do that work under this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Sheldon, I would say that I have expressed the view that it would be undesirable for me at this stage to strike a firm line for myself as to what the regulations to be made under this section will include.  I think the demonstration we have had from Deputy Sweetman is a proof of the wisdom of my taking that course.  He drew attention to the expression <Col N="1086" />&ldquo;likely to be provided&rdquo;, and laboured that expression to show that it might mean that the rural hamlets would be neglected and that that would be relied upon by the Department to say: &ldquo;The Kildare County Council contemplate a water scheme.  It may take 15 or 20 years.&rdquo;  There is no such intention. The expression &ldquo;likely to be provided&rdquo; does not mean anything of the kind.</P>
      <P>In our family, we have our rows before we come to this House and not afterwards.  We do not do the financial business of the country in the manner suggested by Deputy Sweetman. Whatever we may come into this House with, and whatever it is going to cost, we try to determine in advance what the sum is going to be.  As I say, there is no tendency on our part to pull these quick ones, one over the other.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the drafting of regulations under any of the sections included in this Bill I can only say that we will endeavour to draft regulations that will give the utmost freedom to those who are operating them so as to ensure that they will serve as fully as possible the purpose for which they were intended.  I have stated that it is not likely at all that a grant could, in any circumstances, be provided in respect of the house that Deputy Sweetman has cited where a grant had already been received from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I heard the Deputy at Question Time some time ago cite the case of three farmers who might desire to pool the amount of the grant under the agricultural scheme and bring a sort of common pipe-line to serve three houses which might be fairly adjacent to each other.  I was deeply interested when I heard the Deputy's supplementary questions and, maybe, like himself, I was disappointed with the reply.  In the discussion of a section like this, it is impossible to state exactly every type of case that will arise and how it will be covered.  All I can do is to assure the House that I cannot for the life of me see that, under any circumstances, we can give two grants in respect of the same house.  Subject to that condition, I want to assure <Col N="1087" /> Deputies that when these regulations are made they will give the utmost freedom to those who are operating them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to review&mdash;I do not mean now&mdash; this matter of the two grants.  I fully appreciate that two similar grants should not be made even from two separate Departments.  The Minister should re-examine that position with regard to a farmhouse which has a grant to bring water to it under the Department of Agriculture scheme.  I do not think it is quite fair that a person who has that grant should be debarred from this one.  This is to provide not only a water supply but also sewerage facilities.  I am sure the Minister will agree that his concern in this measure is not the same as that of the Department of Agriculture.  The purpose behind the two grants is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister should now give a hard and fast opinion, but I should like him to review in his own mind the question of the possibility of a farmer getting this grant even if he has got the Department of Agriculture grant.  It does not <Col N="1089" /> seem to be fair that farmers should be deprived of this just because they have been energetic enough to proceed under the other scheme.  I think the Minister should give sympathetic consideration to this point when he comes to make his regulations.</P>
    <P>On the question of what is likely to be a scheme or what is a scheme, the Minister appreciates that we are all concerned to see just what value this will be to the rural community.  I admit it is not fair to expect the Minister to come down to a hard and fast line as to what regulations he will make, but I think he should be able to give some general indication of what is in his mind about this question of a future public supply.  I admit that I am arguing from the particular to the general, but what I am thinking of is something in my own constituency, the Finn Valley regional water scheme which has been rather pruned but there is still there the skeleton of a scheme to supply a very wide area.  All I want from the Minister is an assurance that where there is that type of scheme in view which has not any prospect of being concluded in a reasonable time he will not sit down and make regulations because there is a reasonable chance of a scheme with the result that a whole area will be cut off.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in this matter from my constituency point of view&mdash;there are no farms in south city&mdash;but I am interested in the justice of the case and I should like to put this before the Minister.  Suppose there are two farmers, A and B, whose dwellings are an equal distance from a road along which the main water supply goes. Suppose A brought in the water to his house under the agricultural scheme and got a grant of £20; in other words, the cost of bringing in the water supply did not absorb the whole of the sum he could have drawn.  He now has water to his house but not through his <Col N="1090" /> house.  His next door neighbour, B, brings water under this scheme to his house and it costs him £20.  He is now able to have in hands £30 more towards getting the water circulating through his house.  It seems to me that he is placed in a more favourable position than his next door neighbour just by pure chance.  Would it not be possible, where the full amount of the grant was not drawn under the agricultural scheme, for the farmer to draw the balance under this scheme?</P>

      <P>I must say I do get the Deputy too clearly, but I can see how awkward it could be in certain cases when you examine this problem of the provision of water in private houses by individual owners and how unfair it would appear to be also.  For example, under this grant for the provision of water you may have a farmer who would first have to get the water. Perhaps he would have to sink a pump or erect a tank to collect the water from the roof and he would have to incur considerable expense.  He would then have to install the water in the house itself.</P>
      <P>You have the case of a man where the water is there in sufficient quantity to serve his purpose.  He will have a far less expensive task in connecting his house and providing himself with certain amenities.  There is no means by which we can get over that.  Where a man has got a grant from the Department of Agriculture to connect water to his house the operation may be a very expensive one; it may be so expensive that one must have sympathy for him since he cannot get any help or encouragement from the State.  I am certain that cases will arise in which one would like to make some contribution but when we come to frame the regulations, no matter how open we may make them, we shall have to adhere to the general principle that a grant will not be paid from two different Departments in respect of the same work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there is some difference but when a man receives a grant from the State to connect water to his house, if he is really deeply interested in the job, he will go ahead and complete it. <Col N="1091" /> If he does not do that, I do not see any possibility of our giving him a second grant under any circumstances for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a particular instance to the Minister.  Take the case of two farmhouses in one of which the occupier is lucky enough to have a water supply within a few feet of his house.  Now, prior to there being any State grant at all that man was able to put a tap in his kitchen from a well outside very, very cheaply. His neighbour, on the other hand, had to go 400 or 500 yards to get water and until the State grant was instituted he was unable to have a tap in his kitchen.  Would the Minister not agree that it is rather harsh that the first man, who was so fortunately situated, is now in a position to get a grant of £50 to go on with the job while the second man cannot?</P>

      <P>We are here to try to find a means of dealing with it.  I want to ask the Minister another question. Sub-section (1) provides that the grant may not exceed £50.  Has the Minister determined the basis upon which he will make the amount of the grant available?  Will it be a flat grant of £50 if both bath and flush lavatory installations are put in and a septic tank or will it be a grant like the reconstruction grant of 50 per cent. of the expenditure up to £50?  Will it be like the excess £50 that is added in for a new house bringing the amount from £125 to £175 or from £225 to £270?  Will it be a percentage of expenditure or a flat grant of £50 if by the installation the house is brought up to modern amenity standards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

He pointed out that where it costs A and B £20 each under different schemes to connect up water, B then has £30 left with which he can bring water through the house while A only gets a grant of £10 from the Department of Agriculture after spending £10, making a total of £20.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We decided that we would oppose this section as it stands on this stage of the Bill with a view to making such amendment in it as might appear necessary as a result of this discussion on the Report Stage. We were afraid that if we did not deal with it in that way there would be a danger of our being caught, as we were undoubtedly caught on the Tourist Traffic Bill in our amendments which were ruled out of order on the Report Stage of that measure.</P>
      <P>We wish to put very strongly to the Minister that in relation to these grants to be made by local authorities the rateable valuation limits for the several percentages of grants set out by the Minister in Section 9 are altogether too low.  There seems to be a desire on the part of the Minister to restrict the operation of these local authority grants, perhaps with a view to encouraging local authorities in certain areas to come in with a scheme where they have not already done so. In doing so, the Minister is undoubtedly penalising very severely those local authorities that have already come forward with schemes and had the schemes sanctioned and who will now have to reduce very substantially indeed the means limits that have operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those counties where there is already a scheme in existence for local authority grants and where that scheme is being reduced and slashed, as the County Kildare scheme will be slashed by this section, this will undoubtedly have the effect that the provision of new houses by people will suffer a very serious setback.  Apart <Col N="1095" /> from the actual cash reaction it is bound to have a psychological reaction. We in County Kildare take the view&mdash; and I would urge the Minister to take the view&mdash;that every house which is built&mdash;no matter what the size of the income of the person who built it is within very large limits&mdash;either directly or indirectly lessens the necessity for the local authority to provide houses for the people in the county.  The Minister's figures restricting the 100 per cent. grant to farmers with a rateable valuation of £12 10s. are, certainly as far as County Kildare is concerned, entirely ludicrous.  I have not sufficient experience of other counties to know whether £12 10s. might be a reasonable figure.  Perhaps it would be in counties on the western seaboard or in parts of Longford for example.  As far as County Kildare is concerned, however, it means in effect that no houses will be built by farmers which will qualify for the county council grant.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which we are not satisfied to accept and which all of us on every side of the political field in County Kildare would strongly urge the Minister to amend.  Our scheme in County Kildare has up to now been that we would pay grants to persons who derive their livelihood solely from the pursuit of agriculture whose poor law valuation does not exceed £100, a person who comes within the definition of agricultural labourer or a person whose income does not exceed £800 per annum.  The income figure comes in more properly I think under Section 10 than under this section.  To suggest that any person in County Kildare with a valuation of £35 or over is not a person who needs some assistance from the local authority to build his house is to show complete ignorance of the situation which exists in our county.  I suggest that the Minister would be far better advised to make some high overriding limit and if a housing authority in an area where they have very much smaller land valuations than we have in South Leinster wish to bring down their limits in their area let them do so.  But do not bring in a section which will penalise housing <Col N="1096" /> authorities which have adopted a progressive attitude, a section which will not merely penalise them but will have a disastrous psychological effect on people building.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles to which we have heard reference earlier in this debate to-day and which is a trouble in most local authority areas is the difficulty with present costs of repairing local authority houses.  In addition, all local authorities are finding a difficulty regarding the cost at which they must provide new houses.  All of us will agree that it is much easier and cheaper for an applicant to build a house for himself than it is for a public body to do it.  He can put in a certain amount of time himself and a certain amount of supervision which a local authority cannot manage even with the best possible clerk of works and above all when the house is built he can ensure that his repair bill will be kept within measurable bounds because when small repairs are required they can be done without waiting for the local authority's repair gang to come around.  All those things make it incumbent upon local authorities and good business for local authorities to do everything in their power to urge people to build for themselves rather than sit back and trust to the activities of the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say perhaps that the fact that farmers should build would not ease the position for ordinary agricultural labourers but of course it would.  Every house which is built helps indirectly to ease the pressure upon the local authority.  If he is going to throw this douche of cold water across counties which have adopted a progressive scheme then I am afraid that with these two sections the Minister will do a very bad day's work in retarding seriously the provision of new houses in those areas.  It is good business for a housing authority to have houses erected because it indirectly eases the pressure on them. It is good business also because it means that the valuation of the county will be increased and that the local authority will get more money in rates in the long run.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> If we sit down and compute what interest must be paid over perhaps 30 or 40 years on the loan which the local authority must raise to pay these grants, if we consider that on the debit side and consider on the credit side the rate which will come in from the new valuations which will be created when applicants build their own houses, we will find that the cost to the local authorities of every grant which means that a new house goes up is very small indeed.  It would, I suggest, pay the Minister very well indeed, pay him handsomely, to adopt a less niggardly approach to the whole problem of local authority grants under Sections 9 and 10 and to give to the local authorities concerned a greater measure of freedom to meet the needs and the circumstances of their individual cases.  This should apply particularly to counties where a scheme has already been in operation and where any diminution of the advantages of that scheme will have a psychological effect which the Minister will find it very hard indeed to overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain the purport of this section.  Prior to the Finance Act, 1935, a not unusual method of evading death duties was to put money on deposit in the name of more than one depositor.  On the death of one of the depositors, the amount automatically passed to the survivor, in the absence of any provision to the contrary.  In 1935, it was decided to try to close this loophole and, accordingly, Section 33 of the Finance Act of that year provided that, where a sum exceeding £100 was deposited with a bank in the joint names of two or more persons and one of the depositors died, the bank might not pay any of <Col N="1098" /> the money to the survivor or survivors, or to any other person, until the bank had received a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners certifying that there was no outstanding claim for duty in connection with the death of the deceased in respect of such money. This was subsequently amended to allow payment to be made <i>ad interim</i> and we are now proposing to amend the existing law by raising the limit of the deposits which may be cleared from £100 to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the provision of the 1935 Act by which that restriction was imposed which the Minister has mentioned, we would, I think, all be in agreement.  The 1935 Act provided that the limit was to be £100 at a time when every estate over £100 was liable for estate duty.  We have now arrived at the position at which estates up to £2,000 are free of estate duty and it seems to me, therefore, that the Minister in providing a limit of £500 is being unnecessarily cautious. It is going to mean unnecessary administrative trouble for the survivor of the joint deposit, for the Revenue Commissioners and for the banks, and I think he could quite safely and without any danger of avoidance of the duty for which people are liable increase the limit beyond £500.  Will the Minister tell us why the principle in operation previously, which was to have the same limit in the 1935 Act as was free of duty is being departed from and we are now to have a substantially smaller limit in this section than in the duty section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there were two figures of £100 limit in each case was purely concidental.  A person may have considerably more assets than he has on deposit, as the Deputy is aware, and the one had no relation to the other.  That is precisely the principle upon which we are proceeding now&mdash;the one things may not have any relation to the other.  It does not necessarily follow that because a person has less than £500 on deposit, his estate, when he dies, may not exceed £2,000 and may not come over the limit.</P>

One of the provisions of the 1947 Supplementary Budget which the Deputy's Party retained when they got into office was the imposition of a stamp duty at the rate of 25 per cent., unless there was a certificate that the person becoming entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property was an Irish citizen or came within one or other of a number of classes specified.  These classes, however, did not include a body corporate without a share capital and neither did they include a body corporate incorporated in the State after 15th October, 1947, whose issued shares were held by any body corporate incorporated in the State after the same date, where the issued shares of the parent corporate body, to put it that way, were wholly or mainly held by Irish citizens.

      <P>I am glad the Minister has introduced this section&mdash;I wronged him when I said that Section 18 was the only section.  If the Minister goes back to the introduction of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, he will see that it was urged vigorously upon his predecessor at that time that the spouse should be included as the other spouse is being included in this section.  Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance at that time, resisted furiously in the other Chamber an amendment I advocated at the time to include the other spouse.  I confess candidly that it slipped my mind when I was in a position to urge it on Deputy McGilligan.  I am glad to see that the Minister is now making up for my lapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is virtually the same.  When the stamp duty rates on transfer of land and houses were increased in 1947, as the Deputy reminded the House, provisions were made for relief in certain cases.  The relief was restricted to cases where persons transferred property by way of gifts to their children or other younger relatives or brothers or sisters. It has been represented that hardship may be caused by restricting the relief to transfer between persons related in this way.  This point has been met generally by the section which we have just passed.</P>
      <P>It has been represented further, however, that hardship may arise from the fact that the existing relief in relation to gifts or voluntary dispositions does not extend to sales.  That is the vital difference.  It does not cover the case, for instance, where brothers or sisters may want to sell their interest in the family holding to a member of the family who is remaining on to work the land.  Accordingly, this section is designed to cover that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems satisfactory. Might I mention one thing arising on sub-section (3), which provides that the adjudication procedure must be carried out in this case? That is very right and proper.  I might mention that&mdash;though the position has improved in recent times&mdash;there has been a great amount of delay in the adjudication office due, I think, to the extreme pressure of work.  The Minister might appreciate that each <Col N="1103" /> new section that we bring in which says that there must be adjudication&mdash; which is the ordinary practitioner's way of describing the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners under Section 12 of the 1891 Act&mdash;will throw more work on that branch of the Revenue Commissioners.  If there is delay there, it causes the public very considerable inconvenience and I hope the Minister, therefore, will bear that in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill, as stated in the Long Title, is to provide for the adoption of children. I am sure that it is not necessary for me to make any case to convince the House of the desirability of that purpose.</P>
      <P>For a number of years there has been a growing demand for legal adoption. Numerous suggestions for legislation have been made to the Minister for Justice in this House, and resolutions calling for legislation have been passed by the Corporations of the Cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, by county councils and other local authorities, by trade unions and by various other organisations.  I feel sure, therefore, that the principle of legal adoption will be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a simple one and does <Col N="1105" /> not call for detailed explanation.  It consists of five Parts.  Part I contains the usual definitions and preliminary provisions.  Part II deals with the making of adoption orders; Part III with the effects of adoption orders; Part IV with the registration of adoption societies and Part V contains miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II provides for the establishment of a board which will be empowered to make adoption orders. The board will consist of a chairman and six ordinary members appointed by the Government.  The chairman must be of judicial standing or be a barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing.</P>
    <P>Adoption orders may be made only in respect of illegitimate and orphan children, and, subject to the exception provided in Section 19 in favour of existing adoptions, the children must be not less than six months and not more than seven years of age.  An application for an adoption order may be made only by a married couple, a widow or a relative of the child and subject to exception in favour of relatives, applicants for adoption orders must be at least 30 years of age. An adoption order may not be made without the consent of the mother of the child if she is alive and of the guardian or any other person having control of the child, unless the board dispense with consent on the ground that the person concerned cannot be found or is incapable of giving consent by reason of mental infirmity.  The adopters, the parents of the child and the child must all belong to the same religion.  Provision is made for a special birth register for adopted children.  All adopted children will be re-registered in the special register, and that register or any birth certificate issued from it will not disclose the origin of an adopted child.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from Part II, there are two matters on which I would like to make comment.  Some people may think that the provision limiting adoption to orphans and illegitimate children is too restrictive and that in some circumstances the adoption of a legitimate child who is not a full orphan <Col N="1106" /> should be permitted.  I am advised, however, that there is a danger that the Bill would be help to be unconstitutional if it provided for the adoption of legitimate children whose parents are alive.  The Constitution declares the rights and duties of parents towards their children to be inalienable, and any provision for the permanent transfer of those rights and duties, even with the consent of the parents, might be unconstitutional.  The main need for adoption arises in connection with orphans and illegitimate children.  The Bill provides adequately for them, and I think it is better to deal with them only than to risk making the Bill unconstitutional and perhaps shipwrecking the whole proposal.</P>
    <P>My second comment is in respect of the provision in Section 12 that members of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church and the Religious Society of Friends will be deemed to be of the same religion.  That provision was included at the request of the representatives of the religions referred to.  Since the Bill was introduced the House of Bishops of the Church of Ireland have informed me that they do not think it desirable that their church should be included in the provision.  The section will, therefore, require amendment.</P>
    <P>Part III, which deals with the effects of adoption orders, seeks to place an adopted child as nearly as possible in the same position as a child born in lawful wedlock to his adopters.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides that societies may not engage in arranging adoptions, unless they are registered with the board, and it provides that the board may require a society to furnish information in regard to its activities.</P>
    <P>Part V places restrictions on the sending of children out of the State, prohibits advertisements relating to adoption and prohibits payment in connection with adoption.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should make it clear that the Bill does not interfere in any way with informal adoptions.  At present, without legal adoptions, many people undertake the upbringing of children <Col N="1107" /> other than their own.  The Bill will not interfere with that, even in cases where the circumstances would prevent the making of an adoption order.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say this.  The Constitution recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The purpose of this Bill is not to allow the relationship of adoption to be substituted for the family, but to enable children who do not belong to a family, to secure through adoption the benefits of the family.  The Bill introduces to our law the new principle of adoption and deals with relationships which are the basis of our society.  In a matter like this it is better to go too slow than to go too fast, and I would ask Deputies to bear that consideration in mind when putting forward suggestions for amendment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must assume, speaking personally, that the Minister has got over the difficulties with which I had to contend.  In the main, these difficulties were purely of a religious type.  I have to assume that he has got over these difficulties because I do not believe for one moment that the Government would make these difficulties permanent.  Therefore, I am assuming that he has got over these problems.  Looking at the Bill, I am not satisfied that he has.</P>
      <P>While I am in that difficulty, at the same time I do not propose to oppose the Bill in any way but I do suggest that the Bill will have to be examined with a view to seeing that it meets the requirements.  The Minister says that the demand for legal adoption has been very great.  It is rather significant that one of the grounds upon which the Minister himself refused to bring in legal adoption at one time was that there was no demand for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assert that such a statement was made.  The agitation, therefore, was fostered to a certain extent by that Ministerial statement. When the legal adoption people came to me, they said they would be able to get the resolution carried.  They have succeeded in doing that.  It was a snowball resolution because, when I became Minister.  I did not see any reason why legal adoption should not take place.</P>
      <P>This legal adoption is for illegitimate and orphan children only.  The difficulty about the illegitimate child is that a large number of unmarried mothers try to avoid scandal when they get into trouble.  They go to Dublin or they go to some city or town in the country to avoid the publicity. They get in touch with charitable organisations.  I regret to say that they are willing and ready at that stage, owing to their stress of mind, to sign any undertaking to give away their right to that child.  It is true that a number of charitable organisations, not of the Catholic Faith, are prepared to take these children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan can make his own case.  This is too serious a matter for a fractious little interruption of that type.  I had not finished my sentence.  The Deputy might at least have the manners to wait.  I said that the charitable organisations&mdash;it is true that Catholic and Protestant charitable organisations equally do it&mdash;take in the child and the mother assigns her right.  The legal adoption order can only take effect with the consent of the mother.  When she signs that undertaking, the biggest object she has in mind is to conceal the fact of the birth.  She does not at any point want to be brought into court or before this board to admit that she is the mother of that child.</P>
      <P>Therefore, cases will arise, whether in the Catholic, Protestant or any other home that is set up, where almost every child will be an abandoned child and the consent of the mother will not be available as the Minister has said. Therefore, a mother has signed away her right to a child.  For the purpose of being impartial, let us assume that it is a Protestant mother who has assigned the child to a Catholic home. That Catholic home decides to have that child adopted into a Catholic home.  The judge and the board have to ask whether the consent of the mother has been got.  There is no mother.  The child is an abandoned child.  The same thing applies in the case of a child assigned to a Protestant home.  Has the Minister provided against that in his Bill?  Let him answer that question. I do not want him to answer it here.  Let him answer it according to his own conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The orphaned child is all right.  It is born in wedlock and there is no difficulty in the long certificate being available for that child, if and when required.  But we have got to remember that when the legal adoption of either child takes place it will now take the name of the adopters and be reared up as MacEoin or Boland, according to the <Col N="1110" /> home it is in.  That will be the name and anybody who says that the child is not the son or daughter of the adopters will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The result is that the child is brought up believing itself to be the son or daughter as the case may be of these adopters.  Unfortunately, some day the story will be told in the school, college or elsewhere and the matter will be thrown at the child. That child will receive a shock when it comes back to inquire from the parents what its name is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the grounds for the Legal Adoption Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Cowan please make his own case? When that happens the child receives a shock.  We do know, in fact, cases where, when these things were disclosed, there ensued such a shock that it ended in self-destruction in at least one case in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a serious matter and I do not know how it will be got over.  The point is made that legal adoption will give a home to every child capable of being adopted. That, of course, is untrue.</P>
      <P>In Britain they have legal adoption for a considerable number of years. The chairman of the Royal Commission that set it up said on several occasions that it was a failure.  Although the Act has been amended four times in Britain, it is admitted that each time it was a failure.  The Legal Adoption Society in England assert it is a failure but they both put forward different causes.  The chairman and his committee said that the reason it was a failure was because the regulations were not strict enough.  They are both agreed that it is a failure, but they attribute the failure to different causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of children capable of being adopted in Great Britain is very large.  One particular society has 5,000 children in its home and it is rather astonishing that out of that number only 137 were capable of being adopted. <Col N="1111" /> illegitimate children.  Of that number 71 were not trained enough for adoption, that is they were not seven months old.  That meant that only 66 children were trained enough for adoption.  Of these, 17 had been offered to would-be adopters.  Twenty-two were serving a probationary period with adopters with a view to finding out if both parties got on well together. This meant that only 27 out of 5,000 were left for parents.  I will cite the conditions that this home lays down here and now.</P>

      <P>They are illegitimate children and orphans&mdash;the type that will be covered under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Church of England lays down the following conditions for the would-be adopters.  The husband and wife intending to adopt a child must both be in good health, have ample means and be practising members of the Church of England.  They must get a certificate from their Rector saying that they are members of his Church; they must get a certificate from two vestry men and they must get a recommendation from the local probation officer.  Strange as it may seem the number of people in the Church of England who would be able to fulfil these conditions is very few. Deputy Cowan can try to disprove that if he wishes.</P>

      <P>And they sound like interruptions to the speaker.  I was pointing out that conditions are laid down and care taken in the matter of adoption by the Church of England. I do not want anybody to say that the Minister, through this Bill, is doing something he should not do if he takes equally good care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that this Bill meets these requirements. A board will be set up which will have <Col N="1113" /> the power of signing away the rights of a child.  Even though there is only an infant in question, his rights under the Constitution should be guaranteed. Yet, the child is going to be signed away by an order of a court&mdash;not an open court&mdash;not in accordance with the Constitution.  I am not going to go into the constitutional side of the matter again; I must assume that the Minister has made arrangements to cover it.  I will approach the Bill as an ordinary layman.  I wish the Bill every success.  Let me be clear on that point, but I want the House to realise that if they pass it they should not expect that it will do everything they want it to do, that it will make legal adoption something that can happen overnight, and that there will be no difficulty about it.</P>
      <P>I had decided to go into a lot of detail, but I feel that it is better not to do so.  The Minister and the Government must have satisfied themselves that the Bill protects the interests of our youngest citizens.  Where a mother, under the stress of circumstances, signs a document signing away her child, I do not believe there is any law that the Dáil can pass which will make that signing-away legal.  During my term of office as Minister, I found cases in which the mother of the child turned up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one particular case she was happily married in America.  She told her husband about her first lapse and it was decided that the place for that child was in the bosom of the new family.  That child had to be recovered for that mother and for that family. Failure to do so would have created a spiritual and mental worry upon that woman that you could not get over.  The result was that we had to get that child for her and I am glad to say that that child is now in the normal family that it ought to be in with its own mother.  The moment this Bill is passed and that adoption order is made that mother, under the law as it will be passed, cannot get that child back under any circumstances. But remember this, that even though she was an unmarried mother, she constitutes the home for that child, she and that child constitute the <Col N="1114" /> family, she is responsible before God for bringing that child into the world, she is responsible for its well-being and training to bring it back to the Almighty that gave it to her, and that there is no law that can be passed that will take away that right from her.</P>
    <P>If this Bill has got over that I am satisfied.  I must assume that it has when the Minister has brought it in. I am aware that a committee of the bishops met and decided certain matters but what I am not satisfied about is that this Bill meets the requirements they laid down.  However, if the Minister says that they have, then I will accept that.</P>

      <P>Are you finished? If the Minister says that he is satisfied that he has met all the requirements of the Hierarchy in that I am satisfied. When he has that done I wish every success to the Bill, but I trust that in 12 months' time or in less than 12 months we will not have an amending Bill and when that has been passed, another one, so that we will start amending and chipping and chopping until we will not know where we are and with every step will be one step further on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has been able to do what I failed to do, what he failed to do himself for a considerable length of time and what every That 137 was made up of orphans and Minister for Justice in this State failed <Col N="1115" /> to do.  If he has succeeded in overcoming these difficulties I say: &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo;  There is nothing that I can say on the Committee Stage that would be helpful because the Minister himself must take the advice of his advisers, his legal advisers and his administrative advisers in the Department who have a great deal of experience in this matter.  They know all the difficulties fairly well.  There is not a difficulty to be contended with that they are not aware of.  With these few remarks I wish the Bill success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing this long-overdue Bill before the House. This Bill will bring happiness to thousands of homes in this country. People have adopted children and looked upon them as their own for many years but always with the dread that something was going to happen that would cause them to lose those children.  This Bill will ensure that such people will be protected from any such danger.</P>
      <P>While congratulating the Minister on bringing in this Bill we must congratulate the Adoption Society of Ireland for their work and their persistence in going through the country and organising public opinion to such an extent that everybody who listened to them really believed the necessity for such a Bill.  This body of voluntary workers went to different parts of the country.  I met them down in the City of Cork where I attended their meetings.  I never saw a band of workers who had anything so much at heart as these people had this idea of adoption.  One of the greatest workers among them was a man who had a family of his own.  He was fighting the cause of people with adopted children although this problem did not arise for him personally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we saw in the newspapers the statement of the Catholic Hierarchy that legal adoption was not against Catholic teaching, we felt assured that there would be no difficulty in putting this Bill through the Dáil.  The Minister is not taking any plunge in <Col N="1116" /> the dark.  He knows what he is doing. I have here a copy of the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, dated February 8th, 1951, in which the last speaker, Deputy MacEoin, is reported as saying that no parliamentary draftsman had yet been found capable of drafting a Bill that would meet the requirements of the ordinary Christian State.  That was in reply to questions put to him at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  When listening to his speech just now I got the impression that he was trying to discover all the impediments he could to this Bill and at the same time he said that he wished it to go through the House and wished it good luck.  Notwithstanding that he was endeavouring to point out all the harm it would do.</P>
    <P>He was speaking about religion.  It is very clear in Section 12 that the adopters will have to be of the same religion as the child.  He also spoke of abandoned children.  It is agreed between all denominations that foundlings will be regarded as belonging to the Catholic Church, being the predominant religion in this country.  I do not want to take up too much time in dealing with this Bill, but I have a good deal of experience of people who have adopted children and who cherish them very often more than other children are cherished by their natural parents.  The reason is, I believe, that in the case of adopters they generally have only one child and they pour all their affection on that one child, where as in the ordinary family where there are several children love is shared around between them equally.  In the case of an adopted child, in practically all cases, the love is centred on one child. People have said to me that the blood tie is something that they do not think of.  They regard the adopted child as their own and love it as if it were their own. Their one dread is that, after years of care and attention and love, the child may be taken from them.  I do not think there would be any justice in that.  No matter what Deputy MacEoin may say, if a child is left and abandoned practically, an illegitimate child or an orphan, I do not think <Col N="1117" /> there would be any justice in taking it from the adopters.  It would be all wrong that the people who neglected that child for five, six, seven or ten years could have the right to take that child.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make the child legally the child of the adopters in every possible way.  I know a case in Cork where two pretty comfortable people adopted a child and wanted to make provision in their will that, if they died, the child would get their property.  The solicitor pointed out to them that if the three of them were travelling in a motor car and met with an accident and if the child lived after the two of them had died, the relatives of the child would be the next-of-kin and not the relatives of the adopters. Difficulties like that will be safeguarded against in a Bill such as this because the child will be the legal child of the adopters.</P>
    <P>Many of us who are on boards of assistance and other boards know the numbers of children that are boarded out to people who are paid a certain sum for keeping them.  We know that after a certain number of years, when the child goes over the age up to which a sum for maintenance is paid, many of those people keep the child if the board considers that they are suitable people to have the care of the child. That child grows up believing that he is the child of those people.  Like the people who are not paid in respect of the child, in a great many cases they show the same affection for that child as they would for their own child.</P>
    <P>I have met cases of boys who were seeking jobs and who had been reared in such homes.  I met one foster mother who came to me crying that she could not show the birth certificate to her adopted child.  She said to me: &ldquo;He believes that he buried his father two years ago and that I am his mother and I cannot disillusion him.&rdquo;  This Bill will remedy a lot of injustice in such cases.  I am sure everybody will agree that the punishment should not be placed on the child, who has had nothing at all to do with the illegitimacy. Why should that be passed on to the child?  The Legal Adoption <Col N="1118" /> Society claim that there is no illegitimate child; that there are illegitimate parents.  There is a certain amount to be said in favour of that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a while ago that children who were not orphans or illegitimate could not come under the Bill.  I know of one particular case where a marriage was broken up very early and the child is living with people who adopted her and with whom she has been for about seven years.  They are an ideal Catholic family.  I wonder could the Minister do anything under the Bill to cover adoptions that have already taken place.  If children have been adopted for a certain number of years by people who can be vouched for by local clergy and everyone else, it is a terrible hardship on them now to find that they will not come under this Bill.  I realise the dangers of such a clause if it would allow adoption in future.  I could very well see the possibility of some parents even selling their children to good homes for a certain amount of money but, where children have been adopted already over a number of years, would the Minister consider whether he can do anything in their case?  I am sure there are cases in addition to the one I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin was talking about the necessity for this Bill.  From a paper published by the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, I understand that for each ten-year period from 1900 to 1945 (with the last ten years considered as 1933 to 1945) the average annual registration of illegitimates was as follows: 1,468, 1,595, 1,706, 1,893, 2,124.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of scope for a Bill such as this and such a Bill will bring great happiness to many people.  It will allow all those children to stay in the country, having been reared in the country, whereas at present they have to fly out of the country because they have no name or anything else and feel ostracised.  I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those who are delighted at the introduction <Col N="1119" /> of this Bill by the Minister.  I fought my campaign at the last general election on a number of issues.  One of them was the mother and child scheme without a means test and the second was an Adoption Bill.  I made it specific and clear that I stood for those two things.</P>
      <P>It is just as well that the House should consider how the Adoption Bill became a matter of paramount political importance.  We are one of the few civilised countries in the world that have no adoption laws.  Social workers and members of the judiciary from time to time have expressed their view in regard to this matter.  The late Judge Gavan Duffy, who was one of our greatest judges, an outstanding judge, in fact, I think, the greatest judge that this country has produced, certainly since the establishment of the Free State and perhaps for a long period prior to that, said that an Adoption Act was a most urgently needed law reform.</P>
      <P>Many of us came across this problem from many different points of view.  I came across it first and foremost as a solicitor practising in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, I have been connected with the adoption of hundreds of children, every one of whom was adopted within a few weeks of birth, adopted by a society or societies approved by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Having come up against these practical situations, I could never understand why there was some objection to the introduction of a Bill which would put adoption under some legal control.  During the time that the present Minister was Minister for Justice in a previous Government, in my capacity as a private citizen and as the adviser of certain people who had adopted children, I had asked him, personally and by letter written by me in my capacity as solicitor, to introduce a Legal Adoption Bill.  When I became a member of this House, supporting the inter-Party Government.  I availed of every opportunity to ask the then Minister to introduce a Legal Adoption Bill and I co-operated with the adoption society, and with Deputy McGrath who was honoured by the <Col N="1120" /> society by being asked to introduce a Private Members' Bill dealing with adoption.  We pressed the then Minister, Deputy MacEoin, to introduce an Adoption Bill and we understood, and the society understood, from him that such a Bill would be introduced at some time in the near future.</P>
    <P>Great was our surprise when it was announced in this House, not by Deputy MacEoin but by Deputy O'Higgins, if I remember correctly, that the Government had decided not to introduce the Bill and the rumour went around this House, and it was freely stated in the corridors of this House, that the Government had taken that line because the Minister for Justice was advised by the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin that it would be wrong to introduce a Children's Adoption Bill.  I never believed that.  I could not for one moment believe that any person with any knowledge of Catholicity would give such advice to a Minister or a Government.  I am glad to know that I was right in the view I held because subsequently when these Deputies who were interested in this subject said: &ldquo;We will test the matter,&rdquo; and when we co-operated with the Legal Adoption Society and had a Legal Adoption Bill drafted and introduced into this House by Deputies McGrath and Dockrell representing the two biggest Parties in this House&mdash; representing, I may say, every Party in the House because it was with our consent and approval that these two Deputies were selected to present that Bill to the House&mdash;we had an announcement from the Hierarchy that that Legal Adoption Bill was not contrary to Catholic teaching.  I think it is unfair and improper that it should be rumoured around that the failure to bring in that Bill was due to the fact that the Archbishop of Dublin had condemned an Adoption Bill under any circumstances.  I think that was entirely unfair to the Archbishop of Dublin.</P>

I think if it was wrong to assert that there was an objection to an Adoption Bill, that that should be scotched now.</P>

      <P>That is the sort of thing that should be scotched now. We in the adoption society and the Deputies who are in favour of legal adoption, said: &ldquo;We shall test this; we shall prepare a Bill and introduce it.  We shall see if that Bill will be condemned&rdquo;; because we were satisfied that it could not be condemned. We had provided in the Bill, so far as we could, every safeguard that could be given to children&mdash;not only Catholic children but children of other religions. Every safeguard we could think of, we put into the Bill.  The Minister decided that the Government would take over the Bill and introduce it. The Minister has introduced a better Bill than we could draft because, as private Deputies, in the preparation of that Bill we were limited by the rules of this House as to the sort of Bill we could bring in.  We were limited to making that Bill a function of the judiciary.  As private Deputies, we could not set up the sort of board the Minister sets up.  We had to limit our Bill to make it a function of the judiciary so as to keep it in order and so that it might be moved in this House.  I am glad to say that the Minister took over that Bill.  He has provided much better machinery than we could provide because we were limited by the rules of procedure of this House.  The Minister has introduced a Bill which has been welcomed by every organisation concerned with the question of the adoption of children.  It is not a simple matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the shock that a child gets when it finds out for the first time&mdash;perhaps when it is 19, 20, 21 or may be even older&mdash; that it is illegitimate and is not the child of the parents it is generally supposed to be.  That is a tremendous shock.  I have seen it myself during the emergency.  Time after time, parents came to me in my professional capacity and asked me to prepare a statutory declaration to enable their child to get a permit to travel abroad. I have seen these men and women, <Col N="1123" /> often old people, coming in and seeing me privately and telling me about this child they had adopted that was not their child but that it always believed that he or she&mdash;because I have had to do it for both sexes&mdash;was their child. They could not bring themselves to tell the child the position and they asked me to do it.  It was not the sort of job that I liked to do.  It was very difficult and very touching.  I do not want to experience that again&mdash;and I will not experience it and nobody else will experience it when this Bill is in operation.  I have had to prepare statutory declarations that this child known as A.B. was, in fact, C.D., and then the passport was issued not in the name A.B. but in the original C.D.  That was the shock.  It was the very serious shock that, in my knowledge, led to one suicide and one attempted suicide.  The unfortunate person who attempted suicide has been in a mental hospital since.  These are incidents within my own limited experience of the sort of shock that came about.  Deputy MacEoin talks about that shock as if it were not one of the reasons why charitable organisations and Deputies of this House have, for many years, been trying to get an Adoption Bill made law.  This Bill will help to put an end to that type of shock and those processes of self-destruction to which he referred.</P>
    <P>We had the other case&mdash;the blackmail case&mdash;to which Deputy MacEoin referred.  I have seen that, too.  A child is handed over, abandoned, in fact, to decent parents who are pretty well-off.  They came to love that child. The original mother knew where the child was.  She knew the affection that was poured out on that child by the adopting parents.  Time after time, she went to those parents and demanded money in sums from £10 to £100.  She blackmailed them to get that money.  If they did not pay it up she threatened that she would take legal proceedings to recover her child from them.  Nobody could say that that sort of conduct should be permitted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it has happened time and time again.  That is why, when I <Col N="1124" /> go to a society to ask the society to adopt a child, one of the rules that society makes&mdash;and that society is a society approved of by the Archbishop of Dublin&mdash;is that the mother will not know who adopts the child.  The child is handed over.  The necessary moneys are handed over to the society to provide for the adoption of that child.  The one strict rule is that the mother will not know who adopts that child because those societies know the dangers of blackmail and they are doing their best to provide against it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned&mdash;although subsequently he corrected it&mdash;children who are adopted by Protestant societies.  I interrupted and said that they are also adopted by Catholic societies.  I have never seen a child of one religion adopted by a society of another religion.  The majority of the children who are adopted in Dublin are Catholic children adopted by Catholics or by Catholic organisations. There is no question of proselytism at all.  I hope that will be made clear in the discussions on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin read out to us the experience of some Protestant society in England.  I do not know why that was read out by him.  I must say that I did not get to the bottom of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He read out the very wise precautions that were adopted, precautions that, in fact, are adopted by our Catholic societies here who adopt children.  They ensure that the adopting parent is a parent of good character and that every qualification mentioned by Deputy MacEoin is there. These are only proper precautions to be taken by such a society.  I am satisfied that the board which the Minister has suggested in this Bill, and that will be set up under this Bill, will take those precautions, and more precautions if necessary, to see that those children will get a decent start in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the experience within the past few years of children being adopted by people in America.  We can make no legal provisions here for the adoption of children but children <Col N="1125" /> were adopted from different homes&mdash; institutions known as homes&mdash;throughout the country by people from America.  We could see these children being taken out, being placed in an aeroplane and going right across to the United States of America to be adopted by parents of whom we had no knowledge except the amount of money they might have for that purpose. There were no precautions in regard to that adoption and nothing could be done about it.  The children could be adopted, flown across the Atlantic to America and kept there where they would be under no control of our Minister or of our courts.  Under this Bill, they will be under the control of the Minister and of the board set up under this Bill when it becomes an Act, and under the control of this House, if needs be.</P>

      <P>This is a most desirable Bill.  It is a Bill which every Deputy should be delighted to welcome. It is a Bill which Deputy MacEoin said he welcomed, but he set out to throw an enormous amount of cold water on it, for what purpose I do not understand.  The board which the Minister will set up will be an experimental board.  I do not know, but I take it that he has decided on the numerical membership of the board on what I might term the <Col N="1126" /> religions of the country.  I take it that the Minister will endeavour to see that the viewpoints of the different religions are represented on the board. I am perfectly certain that no matter what membership the board is comprised of they will give every consideration to matters related to the religion of the child or the religion to which the child might be expected to belong.</P>
      <P>This is a very important advance in our social legislation.  As I said, we are one of the few civilised countries that have no adoption laws.  We are now by this Bill making provision for these laws.  I am glad the Minister has introduced the Bill.  It is much more satisfactory that he should do it than it should be done by private Deputies, but the matter was so important that private Deputies on all sides of the House were determined to bring in such a Private Members' Bill if it were not done by the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said he had no suggestions for the Committee Stage.  I have no suggestions for the Committee Stage either, except one in which I support Deputy McGrath, that where there has been an adoption prior to the passing into law of this Bill, where that adoption has been successful, where the character of the adopting parents is beyond reproach, where the child is happily living with the family, some small amendment will be introduced into the Bill to legalise that particular adoption.  That is the only amendment I will have to make to this Bill which must commend itself to every Deputy.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would like me to relate the history of the Bill up to this stage I will do so and I will show that Deputy Captain Cowan, Labour Deputies and Fine Gael Deputies all had something to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the formation of the adoption society individual Deputies were canvassed both inside and outside the House and succeeded in forming branches of the society in different centres throughout the country and in convincing other Deputies, if they were in need of convincing, that there was dire necessity for the introduction of such a measure.  Those Deputies who were returned here in 1948 voluntarily formed a committee.  That committee frequently met the representatives of the adoption society and the representatives of other kindred societies. There were several meetings and several interviews with Deputy MacEoin when he was Minister for Justice.  The committee believed that their efforts were meeting with some measure of success until the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis of 1951, when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy MacEoin, <Col N="1130" /> made a speech giving the reasons why it was impossible to introduce a Bill and stating also that it was impossible for any parliamentary draftsman to frame a measure which, in the words of the then Minister, &ldquo;would meet the requirements of the ordinary Christian State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy M.E. Dockrell, Deputy Larkin and other Deputies from both sides of the House refused to believe that statement.  Shortly after that the then Attorney-General, in the course of the inaugural debate at the King's Inns, made what might be described as a more legalised case for the Minister's statement a few days previously in trying to establish why it was impossible legally to draft a Bill that would meet with Christian requirements and based on Christian principles.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputies refused to believe that it was impossible and with the assistance of the adoption society a private Bill was drafted.  I think the drafting of that measure was almost completed before the change of Government. That Bill was subsequently introduced and, as everybody knows, it was then taken over by the present Minister for Justice as a Government measure.  Deputy Captain Cowan is quite right when he refers to the difficulties that existed in relation to the drafting of a satisfactory Bill by private Deputies.  Certain restrictions tended to make the private Bill more unwieldy than the present measure. It required a rather involved process of going before the courts and the formation of societies applying to the courts for official recognition.</P>
    <P>Now, when the Minister took over the Bill he was able to set up this board which had the desired flexibility that would obviate the necessity of court applications and obviate also the delays that would occur as a result of such applications in the making of adoption orders.</P>
    <P>I think it is right to say that this is social legislation in its truest sense. It is social legislation of which this House may well feel proud.  It is very easy to describe Bills increasing old age pensions and children's allowances as social measures and to welcome them as benefiting the people, but in <Col N="1131" /> the strict social sense I think this measure will benefit the people and prove to be a credit to the legislators of this State, more beneficial to the people than all the monetary social legislative measures that have been enacted hitherto.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin naturally finds himself now in a rather difficult position. In his opening sentences to-day he welcomed the Bill and he followed up that welcome by endeavouring to throw as much cold water as he could on the Bill.  Indeed, he almost prophesied that it would be a flop.  He hoped, with his tongue in his cheek, that there would be no amendments.  I do not anticipate that there will not be amendments. I do not anticipate that fresh legislation will not be introduced at some time in the future.  It is almost impossible to provide in such a Bill against every contingency that is likely to arise in connection with an application for the adoption of a child or to make provision governing every case in which it is desirable an adoption order should be made.</P>
    <P>I need only point to the Adoption Acts enacted in other countries in the past.  In Canada there is a series of Adoption Acts which are masterpieces of parliamentary draftsmanship.  Even though the first was an outstanding measure of its kind and was believed to be as perfect and as watertight as it could be, the Government of Canada ultimately found it necessary to introduce several amendments.  The same is true of England.  There we had a series of Adoption Acts, each one sealing up gaps that were apparent in the original Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister claims for one moment that this measure is completely watertight and that it will meet every case and every contingency likely to arise in connection with the making of adoption orders.  I believe that the Minister knows that a start had to be made some time and he has made a fairly good start with this measure.  Because this Bill has the support of so many Deputies and because it is about to receive the unanimous approval of the House, I hold that it is a Bill which must be <Col N="1132" /> required in many parts of the country. If that were not so, it would have been impossible to have formed here what I describe as the inter-Party Committee of Deputies to put through this legislation originally.</P>
    <P>Despite that unanimous support, a leading article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about five or six weeks ago denouncing the introduction of this Bill.  That leading article passed almost unnoticed.  I thought there would have been a clamour by the adoption society and other kindred societies which desire to have this legislation enacted.  To illustrate the type of mind behind this article I think I ought to read a few paragraphs for the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a moral to be learned from the introduction of the Adoption Bill.  Little has to be said of the measure itself.  It sets up a steam-hammer to crush a nut.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I need comment on the nuts this steam-hammer will have to crack, but the enactment of this piece of legislation will certainly bring joy to many a household throughout the country.  The leading article says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An unwieldy and possibly costly body is to be established to make adoption orders instead of vesting the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole reason why jurisdiction was not vested in the Circuit Court was that such a system would have been costly and unwieldy as well.  The reason that this body was set up &mdash; a body which I do not believe will be costly &mdash; was to make the system of making adoption orders more flexible and one of which people could more cheaply and easily avail.  The leading article continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Admittedly, the Bill contains all reasonable safeguards against the possible abuse of the system of adoption.  Having been enacted, it is safe to prophesy that little more will be heard of the Bill.  It scarcely touches the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The moral to which we have referred is that it pays to make a clamour.  There was no real demand <Col N="1133" /> for this Bill from the public or from any considerable section of the public.  The case was made for it by a small section, which clamoured loudly and persistently for this so-called legal reform, and the Government, putting aside infinitely more urgent business, set its draftsmen and its printers to work and yielded to the pressure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was ever a greater case of sour grapes in the journalistic life of this country, but it would be hard to beat this one.  The <i>Independent</i> obviously approaches this matter from a purely political point of view and begrudges this Government their achievement in bringing, in being bold enough, if you like, to bring this piece of legislation before the House.</P>

      <P>It does not matter.  I am contending that there must be some political reason for this leading article in the <i>Independent.</i>  Whether the need for the Bill has existed for three years or 30 years, the fact is that the real demand for it made itself apparent only in the last five or seven years when the Legal Adoption Society and other societies of a kindred nature were established.  We now have this Bill in its Second Stage in the Dáil and I think it has the almost 100 per cent. goodwill of the other side of the House, with a few reservations on the part of Deputy General MacEoin. Subject possibly to a few minor amendments there is no reason why the Bill should not be enacted within a couple of weeks and let us hope that it will. If it becomes apparent in future that other amendments are desirable &mdash; as we anticipate may happen &mdash; let us deal with whatever hard cases turn up and introduce amendments, thus sealing up the Act and making it as good as we possibly can.</P>

      <P>Appreciating the purposes for which the Bill has been introduced, I heartily welcome it.  It meets with the unanimous approvel of the House.  Efforts have been made by Deputy Cowan and to a lesser extent by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, to make us believe that although Deputy MacEoin welcomed the Bill he proceeded to throw cold water on it.  Instead of that he only pointed out the various problems which will present themselves.  He pointed out the very elaborate precautions which the Church of England has taken to ensure the achievement of the purposes for which the English legal adoption system was designed.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tried to claim credit for the present Government in this matter.  Let them have any credit which is due to them, but I believe that the real credit is due to the Legal Adoption Society, which did all the spadework and put forward the various problems for the consideration of the public representatives who were actively interested.  Then the results of all the spadework done by the society was codified to enable a Bill of this nature to be presented to the House in the form of a Private Deputy's Bill coming unanimously from all sides of the House.  Therefore Deputy Lynch should not go too far in claiming credit for the Bill, as credit is also due to the society.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary stated &mdash; and rightly &mdash; that this problem has been very much in the public eye for the past six or seven years, but listening to Deputy Cowan a few minutes ago, one would imagine that the problem presented itself only in 1948.  He then tried to blame the previous Administration for not having succeeded in bringing a suitable Bill through the House, but we must realise that during that period there was a Fianna Fáil Minister, and that the problem was put to him.  There probably were difficulties which caused him to fail to bring suitable legislation through the House.  It was a <Col N="1135" /> matter which was fully considered in all its aspects, and we have reached unanimity.  I feel that it is rather unfortunate that some of the previous speakers have tried to bring controversy into the debate considering that the Bill has been unanimously accepted and has the blessing of all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been called to the statements published in the daily newspapers of 10th June, 1952, to the effect that Córas Iompair Éireann are considering increases in bus fares and whether he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Press announcement to which the Deputy refers.  By Section 20 (2) of the Transport Act, 1950, it is provided that the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann may fix, demand, take and recover such charges as the board thinks fit for services provided by it.</P>
      <P>The charges to be made by Córas Iompair Éireann were covered by the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1951, made on 2nd January, 1951, but, by direction of my predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, dated 17th April, 1951, all rail, road and canal charges for passengers and merchandise traffic carried by Córas Iompair Éireann were removed from the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1951.  The statutory position is, therefore, that I have no function in the matter, which is one solely for decision by Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not power to sanction or refuse to sanction any proposals coming from Córas Iompair Éireann for increased charges and, before he gives his sanction to any increase in bus fares, will he hold an inquiry and find out the cause? May I ask, further, if he is aware that the Dublin Corporation within the past six years sent 10,000 families to the outskirts of the city into houses for <Col N="1138" /> which they must pay increased rents? These increased bus fares now will mean a further imposition on these families and I ask him not to sanction any further increase in these fares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as sanction is concerned, the question does not arise. Córas Iompair Éireann do not have to seek my sanction for increases in charges and neither must they inform me of their proposals in that regard. If, in fact, Córas Iompair Éireann have the intention of increasing their charges, it is hardly necessary to conduct an inquiry to find out the reason for it.  Córas Iompair Éireann are losing money heavily.  It is, I think, already clear that their losses in the present financial year will exceed considerably the amount of subsidy provided in the Estimates.  They are under obligation by the statute passed here in 1950 to conduct their undertaking so as to keep their receipts and expenditure in line.  If they are not doing so, they have to consider how to remedy that situation, and it may be that the alternative to increasing charges would be to reduce services and, incidentally, employment.  It is a matter solely for decision by Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>On the contrary, the position is that the obligation on Córas Iompair Éireann to pay their way was <Col N="1139" /> put on them by an Act passed by the previous Government in 1950.  Let me remind the Deputy that last year there was no provision in the Budget for any subsidy to Córas Iompair Éireann and that this year's Budget contains a sum of £1,300,000 for that purpose.</P>

      <P>The dance tax was not in operation during the years 1947-48 and 1948-49.</P>
      <P>The approximate net receipts from the duty for the financial years 1949-50 to 1951-52 were as follows: 1949-50, £108,000; 1950-51, £132,000; 1951-52 £140,000.</P>
      <P>From the best information now available, the net receipts for the year 1946-47 up to 31st July, 1946, when the duty was abolished, were approximately £25,000.  Some explanation of this figure becomes necessary, as an amount of £76,099 was given as the receipt for the same period in a reply to a parliamentary question on the 21st June, 1949.</P>

    <P>It has always been necessary, as regards adhesive stamps sold in post offices, to apportion sales as between the various forms of entertainment. Since the reimposition of the duty on 1st July, 1949, it has been found that for earlier years, inclusive of 1946-47, <Col N="1143" /> the proportion of such sales attributed to the dance tax had been considerably overstated.</P>

      <P>The tobacco and beer duties are, in the main, charges on raw materials rather than on manufactured <Col N="1144" /> commodities as sold to the public and official statistics are compiled on that basis.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The firms advertising on Radio Éireann have to supply the supporting musical programmes, at their own expense.  The total cost of the advertising, between broadcasting fees and programme costs, is, consequently, fairly heavy, even with the use of commercial records; so that the broadcasting authorities are naturally slow to insist on the employment of &ldquo;live&rdquo; artistes, involving advertisers in outlay which some of them may not be in a position to undertake.  However, we would like very much that any firms that can afford the cost would engage Irish artistes of good standard for at least part of their programme and we have taken the opportunity from time to time of urging on individual advertisers the desirability of doing so as far <Col N="1161" /> as practicable.  I hope we may see some further development in that direction.</P>
      <P>Whether the programmes are made up of commercial records or personal performances, I consider that advertisers should aim at a good standard, and I believe that, by doing so, they will not lose the popular appeal necessary for the advertisement of goods.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was about to say that I gave the Bill my wholehearted support. The Bill does not seem to me to be altogether satisfactory, and I earnestly hope that, where the Minister finds defects in it and where he finds that it does not remedy the grievance which it set out to do, he will take steps to improve it until he makes it a success from the point of view of people who have adopted children.  The Minister has made a certain number of people who have adopted children very happy as a result of this Bill.  I congratulate him on accepting a measure which was very carefully thought out by the adoption society and by members of this House.  I was one of the members of this House who, five or six years ago, found it extremely difficult to get anybody to take an interest in this matter.  However, when it became public it was found that there were a very large number of people who had adopted children anxious that this Bill should be passed, so that the children would be protected.  They found difficulty either in giving the children their own name or in procuring a birth certificate for them.  The result was that where the adopting parents died the adopted child, where this child was looked on as one of the family, found himself in great difficulties.  I have known of a case where a girl thought that she would share in a small property when the father of the family died.  It turned out that she was an adopted child and that she was not aware of the fact.  This discovery caused the girl great heartbreak and it also caused great heartbreak among the family.  I earnestly trust that when the Minister comes across defects in the present Bill, he will remove them. It appears to me to be a step in the <Col N="1169" /> right direction and I hope that the House will give it unanimous support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In company with other Deputies, I welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House, and its adoption by the Minister and by the Government.  It is an important step, and an important move in the social legislation of this country.  Indeed, a step in this direction has been long overdue.  I feel that the Minister is wise in taking the line in this matter which he has indicated.  Probably all that we would wish for is not in this Bill but, at least, it is a beginning, and progress will be made.  The situation can be examined when the Act has been in force for some time.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which I sincerely regret, and a matter to which I think the Minister should give further consideration. I am referring to the constitutional difficulties which he mentioned.  I am not concerned with the neurotic demands of film stars so far as legal adoption is concerned, but with the urgent problems which we have in this country&mdash;problems arising from day to day, particularly in the part of the country from which I come. In that area there are migratory parents who have, in many instances, abandoned their children.  These children have been left in the care of relatives.  However, when the children are reared, and when the parents think they can make use of them, they reclaim them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies were speaking in this House about the psychological effect on some adopted illegitimate children of finding out, on reaching the age of 19 or 20, that the people upon whom they had looked as parents are not their parents at all.  I would like somebody better qualified than I am from a medical point of view to explain to the House the psychological effect on children, who have been reared up to the ages of ten and 12 by their grandparents, of taking them away without their own consent and without the consent of the grandparents.  I believe the psychological effect is, indeed, very dangerous in these cases, and I feel that some method should be adopted and some means found under this Bill of dealing with the problem.  The case <Col N="1170" /> arises in this way down the country, particularly where the mother dies, in many cases in childbirth, leaving a few young children.  The father possibly emigrates and these children are taken over by other relatives, by the grandparents or brothers and sisters of the parents of the children.  As I say, these children are almost reared, and when they come to the age of 13 or 14 the parent who in many cases has not done anything to contribute to their support or taken any interest in them from the time they were left with their relatives, comes back to take them.  As is quite natural where these children have been living with grandparents or other relatives, the relatives have become very much attached to them and have treated them, and are treating them as their own children; then one of the surviving parents comes along and upsets that position and insists on taking the children away.</P>
    <P>We have also had a big increase in this kind of thing since the outbreak of the last war.  I have come across a number of cases where children were sent back by parents, Irish citizens, who were temporarily resident in England, to relatives in this country at the beginning of the last war.  In many cases after some three, four or five years, during which these people have failed to make any provision towards the support of these children, when the children have started to grow up, the parents are coming back here or trying to take the children back with them to conditions that possibly would be much worse than the conditions in which they now live.  It is quite true that some provision is necessary on the lines that are in the Constitution.  It is also true that this is a modern problem that is arising in these cases, and I feel that some provision could be made to deal with this issue outside the principle laid down in the Constitution to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>Another matter which strikes me about this Bill is that, going through it from end to end, I do not find any provision at all for naming the other type of children that this Bill deals with.  I thought that one of the main defects in the law was that, unless the <Col N="1171" /> name was provided, people have to go to the expense of a deed poll in order to give those children a name.  So far as I can see, there does not appear to be a provision here for naming them. There is a kind of negative section&mdash; sub-section (2) of Section 14: &ldquo;A notice in regard to an adoption order shall not refer to the child's natural parents, former surname, place of birth or otherwise to his origin.&rdquo;  Apart from that, I can find no provision under this Bill for legally naming an adopted child with the name of the parents. Surely, if these provisions are being made under this Bill it should not still be necessary for any purpose to put the parents to the expense and the trouble of acting through the form of a deed poll in order to name an adopted child.  It is a matter which I feel will defeat the whole purpose of the measure unless some provision is made in Committee.  If I am misreading the Bill, I am sure the Minister will inform me, but except in a negative kind of way that particular matter seems to have been overlooked.  I compliment the Minister on having the courage to introduce this Bill and get it through this House.</P>

      <P>With all these smoke-screens that have been raised by some of the Deputies' colleagues in regard to this Bill one would think there was something extraordinary in it, that we as reasonable men and women in the House could not discuss the matter. When it was announced during the period of the Coalition Government by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that that Government would not introduce a <Col N="1172" /> Legal Adoption Bill I thought there must be some extraordinarily insurmountable difficulties there.  But this Bill, as presented to this House, seems to me to deal with a matter that badly wanted to be dealt with and, to my mind at all events, there does not appear to be anything in the Bill that should cause the House or any Deputy in the House any grave concern.</P>
      <P>The only complaint that I really have about the Bill is that it does not evidently deal with the case of children whose parents have left them and the problems of some of those children. I hope that between this and the Report Stage of the Bill, the Minister will find some way of dealing with it. This is the first time this legislation has been introduced here, and when the Bill is on the Statute Book I am sure the Minister will find the House sympathetic if he finds in the working of this Bill any difficulty that needs to be dealt with by amending legislation.  At all events the Minister has made a start, a start that is long overdue in connection with this matter in this country.</P>

That is the underlying purpose of the Bill and whilst there may be, here and here, a point that will need to be dealt with at the Committee and Report Stages, I feel that, in the main, this is a Bill which gives great satisfaction to all sections of the community.  I welcome it and propose <Col N="1173" /> to deal with certain minor points on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to make a few points.  I have not had an opportunity of going through the Bill fully but I would like the Minister, in concluding, to deal with this matter that occurs to me in relation to the entire question of legal adoption.  As a matter of fact, I had the benefit of reading, prior to its drafting, the original Bill which was introduced here as a Private Members' Bill, and I was concerned to find that under these provisions it was possible to have a natural mother or a father alienating their rights to a child under circumstances whereby their consent to alienation was not voluntary consent.  I mean by that that a mother of an illegitimate child, by reason of hunger, want or poverty or matters of that kind might enter into an arrangement whereby she alienated her rights to her child and then, years later, perhaps her circumstances improving, set out to enforce her natural rights.</P>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of considering the Bill fully in relation to this, but I do notice that in Part II provision is made for the making of adoption orders, and in Part III, under Section 24, the effect of an adoption order is dealt with.  In Section 24 (b) it is provided that the mother or guardian shall lose all parental rights and be free from all parental duties with respect to the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my personal view that no Parliament is entitled to destroy the natural rights of a parent in relation to a child unless there is a full and free consent. I can imagine circumstances in which such a full and free consent could not be given.  It might be given verbally; it might be given in writing by a parent who, by circumstances, is driven to get rid of the child, but on examination later those circumstances would preclude the possibility of a voluntary consent.  I hope the Minister will be able to satisfy me &mdash; I am sure he will &mdash;that care is taken under the Bill to ensure that every precaution is taken before a parent proceeds to deprive himself or herself of natural rights in <Col N="1174" /> that respect.  Whatever good intentions might be behind our legislation here, we can never under any circumstances interfere with rights which exist anterior to this Parliament and which are natural rights.</P>
    <P>I hope on Committee Stage to be able to explore this matter in detail and, if there are any defects in that respect, I am quite certain the Minister will consider sympathetically amendments designed to safeguard a situation such as that.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I, with Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies, welcome the proposition contained in the Bill of providing here some method for legal adoption.  I do not think it is an occasion for Deputies to say across the House: &ldquo;We are great fellows because we have done this&rdquo;.  The facts are that for many years the want of this Bill has been felt in the country.  The problem created by the illegitimate child did not start in 1948.  People from another planet coming to the Strangers' Gallery in this Assembly, and listening to speeches such as we heard from Deputy Cowan and Deputy Moran, might perhaps think that this accident of birth was something that followed the events which led to the formation of the inter-Party Government. That, of course, is absurd, but it is the only way of dealing with some of the contributions on Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The facts are that we in this country in relation to many matters of this kind are far behind other countries, including our neighbours across the water.  Our ideas in relation to legal reform are antiquated.  There are many urgent problems of legal reform that require to be dealt with.  Such reforms have been carried out in Britain as early as 1925 and in the period from 1925 to 1930.  We are far behind them in relation to many of these matters.</P>
    <P>The blame, if there is to be a blame, must be apportioned equally between succeeding native Governments from 1921 to date.  Since, unfortunately, some Deputies speaking from the lefthand side of the Chair have sought to introduce a political element into this discussion, may I say that, as we all <Col N="1175" /> know, no credit for the introduction of this Bill should go to any Party in this House?  The credit should go entirely to a hard-working conscientious body of people outside this House who for years back have advocated some measure of legal adoption.  I refer to the Legal Adoption Society.  It was merely because that society, week in and week out, month after month, year after year, continued to press their claims for such a measure that eventually the Bill was introduced. There are, unfortunately, other people, other sections, other classes that are affected by the need for legal reform that have not available to them a society such as that and who, accordingly, are unable to ventilate their claims for legal reform in other respects.  I mention that because it is unhappy that matters of this kind should be drawn into the realms of political controversy.</P>
    <P>Both sides have been equally to blame, if anyone is to blame.  Both sides have been equally negligent, if anyone was negligent.  Certainly, some 30 years after this Parliament was established, there is no Minister and no Government that can derive any satisfaction from the late entry of a Bill designed to bring about legal adoption.</P>
    <P>The first step, and the only step so far, under our law in relation to legal adoption was taken in 1930 in the Legitimacy Act of that year.  It was taken before the present Government came into office, when this country was ruled by its first native Government.  That was a halting step but it provided that where the parents of a child born out of wedlock married, by a simple procedure the child could be declared to be legitimate and, having been so declared under the procedure set out in that Act, was entitled to all the rights accorded to legitimate children.  That was a very considerable step, taken 22 years ago.  It started the trend towards a more humane approach to these problems.  It is a pity that the procedure initiated in the Act of 1930 was not carried on by the succeeding Government which came into office two years later.</P>

      <P>We have heard conservatism defined as &ldquo;change in continuity and continuity in change,&rdquo; but maybe in matters of this kind we can be too conservative.  We can maintain an undesirable condition of affairs merely because it has been always there and it is not a thing concerning which any one of us can derive any satisfaction.  I am speaking purely as a person &mdash; I suppose I should not speak at all in the circumstances&mdash;who has not considered this Bill in any detail, apart from what I know of previous efforts to introduce a Bill of this kind. I do think that there are certain fundamental matters that must always be considered in relation to any measure of legal adoption.  It is beyond our power to interfere with the natural law.  In relation to children, natural rights can only cease in circumstances of full and free consent on the part of the natural parent.  No legislation of ours can change that.  I am sure that that particular matter was present to those who drafted this Bill.  If proper precaution in that connection has not been taken in the Bill, I am certain that the Minister will consider the matter at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do want to say, in conclusion, that it is a rare thing for this House, even for an hour or two, to be asked to consider any measure of legal reform.  An occasion such as this is far too infrequent in this House, and that fact, which is known to all of us, illustrates an extraordinary situation in this country, because the law &mdash; the common law, the statute law or whatever it may be &mdash; consists of the rules which regulate intercourse in society amongst all individuals in the State. It is of the utmost importance that these rules and regulations should not inflict hardship or injury upon any section of the community.  We pass laws here from day to day and from week to week, and we get very bothered about them, but we leave unchanged and untouched an entire mass of legislation and of common law rules which are antiquated and out of date, which come to us from a period of 100 or 200 years ago, and which have no <Col N="1177" /> relation at all to the requirements and necessities of modern society.</P>

      <P>They go back further than that.  I know that, in my experience of the last two years or so, I was interested to learn from the present British Home Secretary that, in the British House of Commons, some 15 years ago, there was established from amongst members of Parliament of both sides a particular committee in relation to legal reform. That committee has sat through different Houses of Commons and has considered regularly each quarter matters arising in relation to the problem of legal reform.</P>

      <P>I only want to say that the work of that committee in the British House of Commons &mdash; it is an old bone of contention of mine &mdash; has led to the introduction in Britain in the last ten or 12 years of some of the most useful Bills dealing with injury and accident claims and a variety of other things which ordinarily would always be neglected in a Parliament more concerned with political and economic matters.  I want to say, finally, that I welcome this Bill.  I think it is somewhat belated in its arrival, but the fault is not confined to any side of the House.  It is a good measure, and I think the Minister, who, by the accident of politics, happens to be the member of the House to introduce it, deserves every congratulation.  Let us not forget that a tribute is due to the body who sponsored it outside, the Legal Adoption Society, a body who maintained public interest in this problem despite the rebuffs they got from both sides of the House.  They kept the problem before the public until, eventually, this Bill was introduced. <Col N="1178" /> I hope that, at a later stage, we can go into the details of the Bill more carefully, but the principle of the measure is a praiseworthy principle, and I certainly welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I am also interested in the question of legal reform and I think before we left office we were about to set up a committee of the type to which the Deputy refers, a committee presided over by a High Court judge and with representatives of the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society?  What became of that proposal I do not now know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a suggestion while the inter-Party Government was in office that if the lawyers on both sides of the House got together, perhaps some standing committee of Deputies might be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that, so far as I am concerned, I am claiming no particular credit for introducing this Bill.  I have to admit that what Deputy MacEoin stated is true, that I did say on one occasion in 1943, although I did not recollect it at the time the statement was made, that there did not appear to be any demand for a measure of this kind.  That was referring to an investigation which had taken place three or four years before &mdash;about 1939.  We all know that there has been a demand for the Bill ever since.  As I stated in my opening statement resolutions calling for such a measure were passed by the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation and questions were asked here by Deputies in regard to the matter at various times.  There cannot be any doubt whatever that there is a demand for the measure now, otherwise public representatives would not have concerned themselves so much with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there were difficulties in the way and I think not the least valuable part of the work done by the adoption society was to take steps to have these difficulties largely removed. It was they who approached the Churches and asked for their views.  I certainly join in the tributes paid to the adoption society.  It is largely due <Col N="1179" /> to their activities and to the co-operation which they got from all sides of the House that it has been possible to bring the Bill before the House.  I am aware that when we were in opposition, Deputies from all sides of the House were trying to find some way to bring in a satisfactory measure of this kind. As the Bill stands, I think it is fairly satisfactory though I agree that we shall have to amend it in certain details.  Any defects that may be found in the Bill will get every consideration from my Department.  All I want is to get as good a Bill as possible through the House.  We all know that no matter how well we may try to do it we shall have amendments as time goes by when we find that provision has not been made for something which it is necessary to provide for.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised the point about consent.  I am satisfied that that is well covered by Section 15, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A consent shall not be valid unless it is given after the child has attained the age of six months and within three months of the application for adoption.</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  If the mother of an illegitimate child changes her religion within 12 months before the birth of the child, her consent to the adoption of the child shall not be valid unless it is given after the child attains the age of one year.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in relation to religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am imagining the case of a mother in dire circumstances, perhaps starving.  We have all heard of the child left on the doorstep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy can find any way of safeguarding it better than we have done in the Bill, we shall be glad to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We can consider it later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think religion is as well safeguarded in the section as <Col N="1180" /> it can be.  I do not think there is any necessity for the provision which Deputy Moran thinks is necessary.  The form of the Second Schedule is the same as that for a legitimately born child.  Only the Christian name of the child is given.  The name of the adopted parents will now be on the register and the Christian name of the child.  We are satisfied, on the advice we have got, that that is all is necessary.</P>
      <P>Most people were in agreement on Deputy Moran's point about legitimate children who are abandoned by their parents.  I do not think there is any way of getting over that provision in the Constitution which says that the right of parents is inalienable.  We are informed that we would jeopardise the whole Bill if we tried to take from the inalienable rights of parents.  Although there may be the hardships which the Deputy mentions, I do not think we will be able to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Section 24 not seem to deal with that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moran raised the point about legitimate children who are deserted by their parents and who come back to them later on when they are grown-up and able to work and to be of use to them. I do not see how we can get over that difficulty once the children are legitimate.  We would be afraid of interfering with the constitutional rights of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the reception which the Bill has received.  I want to say again that I claim no particular credit for this Bill.  The speed with which it was brought in was due, undoubtedly, to the introduction of the Private Bill.  I had to declare my attitude when it came up for Second Reading.  I went to the Government and told them that I thought that such a measure was long overdue.  I was always keen on bringing in this Bill and I would have done so before when I was Minister for Justice if I could have got over the difficulties.  We had to make a decision. I suggested that we should tell the Dáil that we would bring in a Bill <Col N="1181" /> which might be more satisfactory than the Private Members' Bill.  That is the reason for the speed.  I think I can say that if it had not been introduced I, personally, would have tried to bring in a Bill myself.  I hope this measure will be successful and, as I say, I am glad that it has been well received.  If, in the course of its operation as an Act, it is found to be wanting in some respect, then there is nothing wrong with some Minister's <Col N="1182" /> coming back and endeavouring to amend it in accordance with the steps shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered provisionally for Wednesday, 25th June, 1952.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, the 17th of June, 1952.</P>
