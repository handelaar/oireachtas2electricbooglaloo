      <P>The increase in barley prices last year, which was much <Col N="875" /> greater than the reduction this year, did not lead to an increase in the price of Irish whiskey to the public, and the reduction in the price of this year's barley will not involve any reduction in the price of whiskey to the public. The prices of other types of spirits are not controlled.  While the price of beer is at present under examination, it must be emphasised that it is affected by other manufacturing costs as well as barley.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a foreign firm holds a contract from the Electricity Supply Board for the erection of fuel oil storage tanks. Before this contract was placed, the board was informed by the Irish Structural Steel and Ironworkers' Association that the type of work in the specification was not of interest to its members.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the circular forbidding civil servants to identify themselves with political candidates is still in force and if he is aware that, according to an election address issued on behalf of one of the candidates in the Seanad by-election now pending, that candidate is sponsored by the head of an important office in the Civil Service, and if he will state what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>I regret to say that so far as. I have ascertained the names of three civil servants were appended to the election address of one of the candidates in the Seanad by-election.  Each of the officers concerned has been asked <Col N="883" /> to submit an explanation of the occurrence to the head of his Department who then reports to me on the matter.  One of the officers has stated that his name was appended to the address without his consent.  I have not yet received a report in the other cases.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I would take a very serious view of this matter, having regard to the fact that two of the officers are in what might be called key positions in the Civil Service, if their names were appended to the address with their consent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly withdraw the remark here.  Will the Minister say who are the candidates who have been supported by civil servants and who are the candidates who have had the names of these civil servants as assenters to their papers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to mention names in this matter, but with reference to Deputy Mulcahy's earlier suggestion, I wish to say that I regard it as a public duty on the part of any member of the Oireachtas to ensure that civil servants, and particularly higher civil servants, do not take an active part in politics.  Election to this House is a political operation and <Col N="884" /> membership of this House is a political status and no person can engage openly and actively&mdash;he is free to vote and to hold his own opinions&mdash;in these elections without participating in politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad is part of the Oireachtas.  I am afraid I have to remind the Deputy of that.  The two Houses of the Oireachtas, with the President, are the political constitution of this country.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister, in view of the answer he has given to the question, put in the Library a copy of the circular to civil servants which is referred to in the question?  I submit that the Minister's answer raises quite a number of important issues and, for the information of members of both the Dáil and the Seanad, I ask if the Minister will put a copy of the instruction referred to in the question in the Library?</P>

      <P>The circular is <Col N="885" /> No. 21 of 1932.  It refers to an earlier circular issued in 1926 and goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While the Minister appreciates that it would not be feasible to anticipate every occasion of the kind in question that might arise for consideration, he desires to lay down specific directions on the following points, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  An official shall not be a member of an association or serve on a committee having for its object the promotion of the interests of a political Party or the promotion or prevention of the return of a particular candidate to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>(2)  An official shall not support or oppose any particular candidate or Party either by public speaking or writing.</P>
      <P>(3)  An official shall not make any verbal statements in public (or which are liable to be published) and shall not contribute to newspapers or other publications any letters or articles, conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest, or which concerns the political action or position of the Government or of any member or group of members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister advert to the fact that in the circular which he read out he speaks of election to the Dáil, not election to the Seanad? Will he say, also, whether any reproof has been addressed to the secretary of the Department of Finance and to the assistant secretary for their animadversion on Government policy before the arbitration committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are those who might not be civil servants, who might be on the fringe, and in fact there are civil servants members of one Department, who are members of an organisation which, I understand, is affiliated to the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I want only to get this clear.  Is the Minister himself fully satisfied that the circular defines fully the type of civil servant who is excluded from these activities as distinct from minor State employees? I have in mind, say, people who are employed as labourers or skilled men on State farms or places like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they would be covered, but it is well for every public employee to preserve a proper discretion on the matter.  It is of vital importance to the taxpayer and to the general public that there should be no doubt about impartiality in administering the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it has been decided that purchasers of houses which are at present owned by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Land Trust will be exempt from the 3 per cent. stamp duty which at present applies to purchasers of nonsubsidy houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of ordinary sales of lands and houses to Irish citizens and analogous classes of persons the 3 per cent. rate of stamp duty is not payable unless the consideration for the sale exceeds £950. Actually, where the consideration does not exceed £500 the rate is only 10/- per cent., and for considerations <Col N="887" /> between £500 and £950 there is a graduated scale of duties rising from 1 per cent. to 2.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is no special relief or exemption from stamp duty in favour of sales of houses by the Irish Soldiers' and Sailors' Land Trust.  As I have already indicated, however, the 3 per cent. rate will not apply in any case unless the consideration for the sale exceeds £950.</P>

The remaining four, being managed and controlled in Great Britain or in the Six Counties, are granted exemption from Irish income-tax under the terms of the agreement between the Government and the British Government in respect of double income-tax.  I would remind the Deputy that this agreement is on a reciprocal basis and that the banks with headquarters here who do business in the Six Counties or in Great Britain get a corresponding exemption from income-tax there. The four banks which are exempt from <Col N="888" /> Irish income-tax are, however, liable to Irish corporation profits tax on profits arising in this country.</P>

      <P>It would be unwise and unfair to landowners to circulate, as suggested, the additional information referred to in the question, even though it is the practice to disclose (somewhat reluctantly I may add) information of this nature in reply to parliamentary questions about particular estates.  I personally doubt, as did my immediate predecessor, the wisdom of having estates or lands named in such questions and I certainly do not propose to take any steps which would disclose further details of Land Commission negotiations.  Owners of land are entitled to have their dealings with the Land Commission treated with a reasonable degree of privacy.</P>

      <P>The House would probably appreciate the need for that regulation in respect of certain types of employment in a State Department.  In the particular case which I have in mind, and which I referred to the Minister for Agriculture last week, a married man with nine children applied for agricultural work on the Johnstown Castle State farm. Because he was dismissed from the Garda Síochána ten or 11 years ago, he was denied employment at a wage, I suppose, of £3 10s. or £3 15s. per week. Surely the Minister ought to reconsider this black list at least in respect of that type of job?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought in the circular letter of the 21st ultimo as to the amounts represented by local authorities' undertakings in respect of binding commitments of prospective borrowers has in some cases either not yet been furnished or has not been furnished in sufficient detail to enable a decision to be reached as to how far concessions are possible.  Where sufficiently detailed information has not been furnished the local authorities are being asked to clarify the position further and to classify the commitments.  I recognise that this may in some cases involve rather lengthy investigation and I have, therefore, decided, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to consider first those commitments of which there can be no doubt and to admit as a charge against loans from the Local Loans Fund at the old <Col N="903" /> rate of interest the amount of such loans comprised of proposed advances to individual borrowers in respect of which mortgage deeds had been completed before the 6th October whether such advances remain to be made either in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>It is the practice of the Dublin County Council to warn prospective borrowers that they could not assume that advances to be subsequently made to them would bear interest at a particular rate.  Nevertheless I feel that it is equitable to extend the decision in favour of borrowers in other areas to those similarly circumstanced in Dublin County, and this will accordingly be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in respect of some cases&mdash;in Dublin County, at any rate&mdash;where the mortgage deeds were not completed, the persons involved have received notification from the law agent giving them 14 days to complete the deeds on the basis that the rate to be charged will be £5 15s. per cent.?  Is the Minister aware that these are cases in which the position is so advanced that the cheques are actually written and are available for issue by the county council?  Will the Minister take these cases into consideration and will he give them the same treatment as he now suggests will be given in cases where the mortgage deeds were completed before the 6th October?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, arising out of the communication sent by him to the local authorities, the Dublin County Council has taken, through its law agent, action of the type I have described, and that persons whose cases were so fully advanced that their cheques were actually written in the county council offices were given 14 days in which to put their names to mortgage deeds involving them in an increased rate of <Col N="904" /> £5 15s. per cent.?  Does the Minister not consider that these cases are absolutely on all four with those in which the mortgage deeds were completed before the 6th October?  Does he not realise that the position in which these people are placed, and in which they are being urgently pressed to sign certain mortgages, if they are not going to lose certain rights, flows from his action and from the circular letter issued by him to local authorities?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I shall have to repeat myself.  I said the reply which I had given did not imply that only those cases in which a mortgage deed had been completed would receive favourable consideration.

The delivery also includes correspondence posted at the General Post Office and College Green, Dublin, up to 4.45 a.m. and correspondence received from Great Britain by night packet at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>If an early morning delivery were to be provided instead approximately 50 per cent. of the entire mail matter at present delivered at midday would not be delivered until the following morning.</P>
      <P>On balance, an earlier delivery would not benefit Bunclody and I do not, therefore, propose to make any change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>In accordance with arrangements made between the Whips the main Wireless Broadcasting Estimate, together with some other Estimates, was agreed to without debate before the recess on the understanding that a token vote would be taken at the opening of the new Session.  In virtue of that agreement I am bringing this Supplementary Estimate before the House to enable Deputies to debate the broadcasting service generally but I have also taken the opportunity of making provision for expenditure not anticipated when the main Estimate was framed.  I have in addition drawn attention in the Estimate to the proposal to establish a broadcasting council in order to seek the approval of the House for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will not wish me at this stage to go over the individual sub-heads of the main Estimate to explain the variations.  The figures have been in the hands of Deputies for some months.  I shall at the same <Col N="918" /> time be glad to give Deputies any information that may be required in regard to the various sums asked for in the Vote or in connection with any aspect of Radio Éireann in which the House may be interested.</P>
    <P>In addition to the primary purpose of providing an opportunity for Deputies to discuss broadcasting generally I shall now explain the need for the sum over and above the token provision which would ordinarily have been sufficient for the purpose of a debate.  The gross sum required in the Estimate is £20,000, but extra Appropriations-in-Aid are expected to be available from sponsored programmes to the extent of £7,000 thus reducing the net sum required to £13,000.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the £20,000 gross extra sum required is the cost of providing a morning programme with two news bulletins.  The need for providing for a service of this sort was not of course foreseen in connection with the main Estimate.  The morning service began on the 12th July when the newspapers became involved in the printers' strike.  Judging from the commendations received from many quarters the early programmes had a widespread appeal.  The news contained local items which could not be got from the B.B.C. or any other station and it might be said we had a distinctive programme with which no other broadcasting organisation could compete.  When the newspapers were about to reappear strong public pressure made itself felt to continue the morning programme as a permanent arrangement and we have acceded to that demand.</P>
    <P>The morning opening will this year cost £11,000 of the £20,000 required in the Supplementary Estimate and it will cost £15,000 in a full year.  The balance of the £9,000 required is needed mainly for the payment of extra performing right fees and extra fees to advertising agents.  Performing right fees are based on licence numbers and when we increased the licences by 35,000 in a special drive this year that involved an automatic increase in the performing right and other copyright fees.  In the same way more sponsored programmes mean <Col N="919" /> extra commission to the advertising agents and this is borne on the Vote.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that as against this Supplementary Estimate for £20,000 gross we expect to have receipts from licence and sponsored programmes higher than expected by £21,000.  This is due to the &ldquo;drive&rdquo; and to better facilities for sponsored programmes.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the beginning I have shown in the Estimate an expenditure of £500 as remuneration for the members of Comhairle Radio Éireann, the establishment of which the Government has approved.</P>
    <P>Before describing in detail the re-organisation of Radio Éireann I feel I should very briefly refer to the general progress of Radio Éireann and outline what I hope are reasonable aspirations for the future.</P>
    <P>I should refer first to protests received from time to time that listening is not possible because of local electrical interference with reception and that a licence fee should not be expected in such conditions.  I have every sympathy for listeners whose enjoyment of broadcast reception is lessened by interference although the number of complaints received is not large in relation to the number of licence holders&mdash;about 1,000 per year for 380,000 licensees.  Obviously the Department cannot waive the licence fee because some interference is experienced.  The Department is bound to insist on the fulfilment of the legal obligation to pay the fee on wireless telegraphy apparatus irrespective of listening conditions, and further, I think Deputies will appreciate that it would be quite impossible to administer the licensing regulations if waiver of payment were allowed for interference or for a set being out of order.</P>
    <P>In connection with this question of interference listeners should appreciate that the sources of such interference are innumerable&mdash;every faulty light switch in the country is a potential source of interference.  Quite obviously therefore some interference will exist at times in most places.  We are doing everything possible to keep the trouble down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> As I mentioned earlier we have made provision to put a further van on the road for this work.  We have demonstarted the effectiveness of fitting suppressors to electrical apparatus at the recent exhibition by the wireless trade in Dublin and we had some illustrated radio talks about interference at the same time.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to listeners who experience interference, however, to ensure that their set is not at fault and that they have a satisfactory earth and aerial before they make a complaint. Twentythree per cent. of all complaints are due to faulty wireless sets. Listeners could also do a great deal by local co-operation in having electrical sources of interference suppressed.  The Department's technicians have generally to travel long distances to trace down sources of interference, and fit suppressors where desired.  A great deal of this work could be done without expense and delay by listeners themselves in co-operation with the local wireless trader and with the owners of electrical plant.  In fact, our inspectors are now organising local area drives to this end.</P>
    <P>The House will be glad to know that extra studio accommodation in the General Post Office planned in 1947 is now ready.  This will give some relief from the congested and otherwise very unsatisfactory conditions that now exist.  The provision of these studios is the utmost in the way of studio accommodation that can be obtained in the General Post Office but, of course, really satisfactory broadcasting accommodation cannot be provided in a building designed for a totally different purpose from broadcasting.  There will still be a serious lack of office accommodation and it will be most difficult to get such offices in the already overcrowded General Post Office building.</P>
    <P>A specially designed broadcasting headquarters such as is provided in practically all the countries of Europe will be the only solution for proper broadcasting accommodation.  A recent rearrangement of existing studio space in the General Post Office has given improved facilities for handling sponsored programmes and the station is <Col N="921" /> now accepting advertisers who were on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>New up-to-date transmitters have been ordered for the Athlone, Dublin and Cork stations but the cost will not fall into the present year.  The Athlone transmitter will be of the same power as the present transmitter i.e., 100 Kw. This is the maximum power permissible under the European broadcasting plan to which this country is a party.  The Dublin and Cork transmitters will be each of 5 Kw. power instead of the present power of 2 and 1 Kw. respectively. When the transmitters have been installed&mdash;probably towards the end of next summer&mdash;reception conditions should be much improved, particularly for those who listen to the present very low power Dublin and Cork stations.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the new transmitters will probably help a good deal to get over interference from foreign stations which is being experienced to some extent by all countries throughout Europe.  This is, of course, distinct from the local interference to which I referred earlier.  Because of the large number of countries in Europe close to one another&mdash;as compared with say America or Australia&mdash;all of whom need wavelengths for the provision of a national broadcasting service the broadcasting bands in the European area have been congested for a number of years.  Matters are now further complicated by the international situation.</P>
    <P>We have made arrangements with the City of Cork Vocational Committee for the incorporation of broadcasting studios in a new school of music which the committee is preparing to build in Cork.  When this building has been completed the Cork broadcasting artistes will have very much more comfortable conditions than they have in the present rather primitive studio accommodation in the city.</P>
    <P>Many improvements and developments have taken place in the programme organisation during the year, such as the extension of the feature &ldquo;Beginners Please&rdquo; to Cork, where a large audience took part in <Col N="922" /> the feature with the light orchestra, and more recently to Sligo.  It is hoped that a local &ldquo;Beginners Please&rdquo; will be held in other centres.</P>
    <P>A balance and control officer has been added to the organisation to ensure that the programmes will be broadcast with more fidelity than was possible hitherto.  In addition to programmes of traditional music and of songs in the native language we are doing something to popularise songs in English with a national flavour.  The &ldquo;Balladmakers' Saturday Night,&rdquo; a very popular feature, is an example of this.</P>
    <P>I shall be referring later to the hours of broadcasting in this country but I should say here that, while the over-all period of broadcasting during the day has remained practically stationary for a long time, the amount of work that went into the preparation of the programmes, even up to recent years, was only a fraction of that which is put into it now.  The public may be aware of that in a general way because the Press gives much more attention to broadcasting in special radio columns than it did formerly.  The fact that there are such daily radio columns is in itself evidence that the newspapers consider broadcasting worth more attention now than was the case.</P>
    <P>As I said, the appreciation of the general public for improved presentations is of a broad nature and it may be no harm for me to give some idea of what work is involved in raising standards.  In the first place, although the hours of broadcasting have not been extended, the number of programmes broadcast now in a week as compared with 1939 has been raised by about 50 per cent. (from about 100 a week to approaching 150 a week). These figures include the additional news in the morning.  We have had to increase the numbers of programmes by gradual stages.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting at present has very much more interest than it had ten years ago for the public and the Press, Departments of State, churches, cultural bodies, voluntary associations, sports bodies and other bodies, and <Col N="923" /> practically every section of the community which has some message to give demands an allocation of broadcasting time as a right.  With technical developments we are also in a better position to get outstanding programmes from abroad.</P>
    <P>To increase the number of programmes and to give space to meet the more extensive demands being made on broadcasting the station has to resort to expert &ldquo;packing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many of the fairly long types of solo item of former years which required comparatively little rehearsal and preparation have been severely cut down.  At the same time the music department of the station which provided ten items per week in 1939 now provides 24 items a week.  The other sections of the station have increased their contributions in somewhat similar proportions.</P>
    <P>In former years the rehearsal of programmes was wholly inadequate and it was not uncommon that programmes were put on the air without a single microphone rehearsal.  While space restrictions still make it impossible to have anything like as many rehearsals as would be desired the position has been changed very radically in that respect in recent years.  The number of hours rehearsal in 1939 was 538; in 1950 it was 1,457.</P>
    <P>Recording of programmes, particularly recording on tape, makes it possible to produce programmes that would have been quite impossible until a few years ago.  It facilitates speakers who cannot attend during broadcasting hours and it enables interesting items assembled individually by outside broadcast officers, script writers, descriptive news writers, and sections in the station to be brought together, edited and broadcast as a single programme.</P>
    <P>Rehearsals for recordings, and the recordings themselves are, however, more complex than the rehearsals for live programmes and they take a great deal of time to carry out. Recording sessions were practically unknown until a couple of years ago. In 1939 there were only 62 hours of <Col N="924" /> recording sessions while in 1950 there were 4,500 hours.</P>
    <P>The examples I have given of the compression of programmes made necessary by the increased demands on broadcasting space and of the more elaborate nature of the individual programmes will give the House a fair idea of the extra volume of work that has to be put into broadcasting generally without increasing the total hours of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>To give the arrangement of programmes all the meticulous attention they now need as compared with former years, the station organisation will require some strengthening if planning is to be done less hurriedly, for the better presentation of talks and other features, for more complete technical balancing of the programme as it goes on the air and for other matters connected with programme presentation.</P>
    <P>Even with a larger licence fee the financial resources which broadcasting can earn of itself will not be sufficient to procure all the facilities needed and some improvisation must continue to be made if the present rate is maintained. We are at a disadvantage as compared with even very small countries like Denmark which has 1,200,000 licence holders for a population of little over 4,000,000.  I consider on the whole that the Radio Éireann programmes are very good allowing for the somewhat inadequate organisation and the inadequate studio space and the very rigid control exercised in regard to innovations.</P>
    <P>I have referred immediately above to the gradually increasing responsibility demanded from broadcasting executives over the past ten or 12 years.  I should now like to refer to my own short association with broadcasting and my general outlook on it. I wish to make it very clear in the first instance that I have taken a deep, personal and immediate interest in the administration of Radio Éireann, in the formation of the programmes and in all other matters pertaining to the service.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if I were to give my ideas on the function of <Col N="925" /> Radio Éireann in a very general and simple way, in the hope that they will be approved.  The ideas are not original.  In the main they are a reaffirmation of the traditional policy. They have been indeed adopted by the best broadcasting systems in Europe.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of Radio Éireann is to provide entertainment in an Irish setting to suit every taste to be found in our community; from our own and foreign dance music to classical compositions; from Irish and universal variety shows to debates in Irish and English on Irish and universal themes; from traditional music and songs from the four provinces of Ireland in Irish and English to operas and songs in every language from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is my particular object to make the programmes, in so far as they are based on Irish settings, distinctively Irish in character and year by year I hope to increase still further the already considerable volume of material, coming to us in greater quantities, particularly from the Six-County area.</P>
    <P>I must now follow with some very obvious generalisations which appear to be forgotten by the many correspondents who write to the newspapers, and to ourselves, complaining of the Radio Éireann programme.  Firstly, the taste of our listeners demands a varied programme.  If the results of &ldquo;Listener Research&rdquo; in Great Britain or, say, Belgium, were to be compared with a similar investigation if made here, the preferences in regard to the content of the programme would be found I believe to be somewhat similar.  In order to satisfy everyone a very considerable part of the programme would have to be in relation to universal themes, sometimes in an Irish setting and frequently not so. Without having yet made an accurate study of our listeners' wishes I am perfactly certain that in common with every country in Europe, light music would come very nearly at the top of the list in respect of volume demand. The &ldquo;Hospitals' Request&rdquo; programme indicates a preponderating interest in light dance music, a particular interest in certain foreign singers, a very <Col N="926" /> modest interest in Irish songs, with a very slight demand for semi-classical and classical music.  It would also be true to say that the taste of people living in the countryside as distinct from the inhabitants of our cities and towns is more conservative and more racy of the soil and there is a continual demand for ballads.</P>
    <P>It is well for the House to face the fact that if any particular item is broadcast in excess of what our listeners wish they will instantly transfer to the B.B.C. or to some other system, and because of this, letters from correspondents in the newspapers demanding more of a particular type of programme are utterly useless as they give no clue as to what the actual proportion of the various types of broadcasts should be.</P>
    <P>Here I must sound a warning note. There is undoubtedly a demand for our own music, instrumental and vocal, and we do our utmost to satisfy it.  Let no one, however, have any illusions.  A great number of the young people in this country have adopted light variety, operatic and Anglo-American dance music as their folk music along with our own melodies, in the same way as other European countries, even those whose predominating language is not English.</P>
    <P>The universality of the English language increases the force of Anglo-Americanisation taking place all over the world and to offset this we shall have to make a far greater and more prolonged effort in the future to present our own music, drama and literature to our listeners in a way which will engender their abiding love and admiration.</P>
    <P>As in the case of all good broadcasting institutions abroad the Radio Éireann programme is weighted to provide palatable, cultural entertainment with an emphasis on our own creative and traditional culture and possibly of a somewhat higher standard than we would expect to be asked for by &ldquo;popular&rdquo; demand.  As I said before, I know that light music would head the list here as in other places in the collated results of any listener research investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> The Radio Éireann programmes do contain quite an amount of light music and other items of the lighter type.</P>
    <P>The programme also includes a proportion of more highbrow items not really justified in a single programme but inevitable if we are to pursue the right policy.  We cannot give way too much to what I might term demands by the more vocal section of the community in the setting of standards.</P>
    <P>As a nation which claims cultural traditions, we should cater for the smaller but less vocal section whose tastes do not lean to mass-produced foreign entertainment and, of course, we must play our part in the work of helping to restore the national language.</P>
    <P>I feel that any dissatisfaction that may exist in regard to the proportions of the programmes devoted to serious and popular items lies to a great extent in the fact that all of them have to be sent out in one general programme. If listeners had running concurrently two home programmes from which to select the items of their choice&mdash;light or serious, as the case may be&mdash;there would, I think, be less criticism that Radio Éireann is high-brow or lowbrow.  I shall be referring later in my statement to the question of a second programme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, incidentally, a few moments ago the question of ascertaining listeners' tastes by modern methods.  Listener research is, to my mind, vital as a check on programme planning and as a means of keeping programme heads at the top of their form, and I intend to inaugurate this valuable service.</P>
    <P>The object of any good radio service should be to intermingle light programmes with more serious items requiring a greater degree of concentration in such a manner that at least a good proportion of listeners will leave the radio on before the lighter item commences and after it terminates and can, we hope, be induced to enjoy a varied programme.  The quality of the more serious items must be of the very highest to achieve this result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> In all I have been saying it will be obvious to Deputies that the ordinary school programmes could not possibly provide stimulating ideas and information on matters of vital importance, such as knowledge of how the Government works, knowledge of legislation, knowledge of the day-to-day economic problems of the country; nor can they learn very much of the recent history of Ireland nor of the national revolution.</P>
    <P>The knowledge which they glean of Irish music and song must be supplemented by Radio Éireann.  Radio Éireann has already played a vital part in this work.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important to state that while Radio Éireann as a provider of entertainment must to some degree supplant other forms of entertainment this is not our ideal.  Apart from offering light entertainment in reasonable measures our purpose should be to encourage young people to read good books, to go to concerts, to engage in animated fireside discussion and to organise more debates and to sing a greater variety of Irish and other good songs.  There is so much mass-produced entertainment these days that for Radio Éireann to encourage a kind of dullness of mind would be appalling.</P>
    <P>Probably the most noteworthy innovation during the year which will help to lead our people to think critically on matters of public importance&mdash; cultural, social and political&mdash;was the introduction of unscripted discussions on controversial subjects including discussions on matters of current political interest.</P>
    <P>Many people had expressed the fear from time to time that as a nation we were too immature politically to permit free broadcasting discussions on current matters on which there were considerable and perhaps violent differences of opinion.</P>
    <P>I did not hold that view and I am glad to say that experience has proved that I was right.  I authorised the broadcasting service to permit people with different opinions, political and otherwise, to express their views freely on a wide range of controversial <Col N="929" /> subjects&mdash;the only limitations being, broadly, the observance of the decencies of debate and the avoidance of libellous statements.  The discussions are fulfilling all that I had in mind from them.  Many debates have been held in which persons prominent in the life of our nation have expressed their opinions frankly but without rancour or heat.</P>
    <P>In the development of our debates we have a feature of great importance for the future of the country.  The world has become immensely complex. In the political life the following of political trends has become much more difficult.  It is absolutely essential to help young people to become mature in mind so that they may question carefully all the obvious panaceas to bring about human perfection and at the same time understand the part now played by State institutions.  They need to have faith in their country by far more knowledge of our economic potentialities, our art, music and drama.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting can do much to make us all interested in the now immensely complex galaxy we call Ireland.</P>
    <P>The freedom of speech now allowed in broadcasting debates has been of very great advantage to us.  I should mention incidentally that from my researches abroad I have found that debaters require much rehearsal and a training in the habit of radio debate, which is different from any other kind of discussion.  I found also that even in England with its huge population that a trained first-class chairman of debate is a rare bird.  Much advantage is gained abroad by beginning debates for less experienced people on the nursery slopes at times of the day when there are very few listeners.</P>
    <P>In addition to the debates I arranged for a weekly commentary on the proceedings of the Oireachtas.  Since the feature started there has hardly been a single complaint that the summary did not give a balanced account of parliamentary proceedings of the week. In fact, the feature has been widely commended.</P>
    <P>Next, I should draw the attention of the House to the development of <Col N="930" /> music in this country.  I should like to make special mention of a scheme which I introduced this year for the purpose of making it somewhat easier for local musical societies to undertake the organisation of concerts by the two orchestras.  I invited business firms throughout the country to sponsor concerts by either the symphony or light orchestra.  The response of the business organisations has been splendid.  A number of sponsored concerts have already been held and others will be held.  The business firms get some advertisement from their association with these concerts but I prefer to think that their primary object is to help in the diffusion of good music.  These concerts have immense possibilities for the creation of a live interest in music among our people.  They give confidence to the many musical societies which I am glad to say are springing up in many parts of the country and are an inspiration to small orchestral combinations like those conducted in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I need scarcely tell the House that every broadcasting organisation requires the services of a symphony orchestra&mdash;as well as of other orchestras.  I am glad to say that our symphony orchestra is not alone filling its broadcasting function of playing in the studios and providing recordings and relays from outside concerts, but it is giving the country an opportunity of hearing personal performances of classical and semi-classical music which our people never had before. The light orchestra also progresses.</P>
    <P>The number of musical societies grows apace all over the country and the number willing to undertake the sponsoring of concerts by the Radio Éireann Orchestras is also growing.  I have visited concerts held in various provincial towns as in Dublin and I have noticed that the audience consisted of people of all ages and grades in society.</P>
    <P>The Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra is gradually becoming the national orchestra of Ireland, playing in public, filling large theatres, such as the Theatre Royal, and playing with soloists of international repute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> I am determined to build up this orchestra until it achieves a European reputation.  For this the minimum initial standard to which young Irish musicians must aspire must be secured by the services of short-term contract players from abroad who will be as welcome here as they are in other small countries.</P>
    <P>When the orchestra is thus established, it should be possible to find a permanent conductor who believes he can, in the course of a few years, make the reputation of the orchestra and his own by hard work.  In due time, let us hope, we will have an orchestra manned by at least 90 per cent.  Irish players.</P>
    <P>Indeed, every country in Europe, from the smallest to the largest, has one or more brilliant symphony orchestras&mdash;some of them are internationally famous and go on tour.  Most of them have resident internationally educated and famous conductors.  A very considerable number of these orchestras consists of non-nationals to a varying degree up to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Classical music is international in character, and for its exponents in interpretation and execution there cannot be too rigid confinement to national boundaries.  I should say that in countries with much affinity to our own, such as Italy and France, virtually everyone is interested in classical music whether light or serious, and the humblest worker in these countries considers such music as part of his normal entertainment.  I fully believe that the same progress towards an appreciation of good music would be evident here in the future.  Indeed, love of our own music is inextricably connected with love of good music in general.  I know that people interested in good music will need assistance and encouragement from such bodies as the recently formed Arts Council.  A tremendous effort will be needed if we are to compete with, at least, the musical establishments and academies of the smallest countries.</P>
    <P>I should say that apart from the provincial concerts to which I have referred, I hope to arrange for the <Col N="932" /> symphony orchestra to play popular classical music with soloist performers in a Dublin theatre on Sunday nights next year and I trust the audience will give this, for us, entirely novel programme, a fair hearing.  We also intend to continue the children's concerts wherever the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra plays.  These concerts have been an immense success.</P>
    <P>Concurrently with our efforts to raise orchestral standards and because I have had to invite guest players from abroad I have been giving close attention to another aspect of the problem, that is, the question of the improvement of music teaching facilities which will enable young Irishmen to take their places in our orchestras.  I know that there is vital need for the establishment of more master classes under teachers of distinction to give our students the opportunity of reaching concert standard at home.</P>
    <P>There have been developments in this connection and I am glad to know that the Royal Irish Academy of Music, which has received a moderate increase in its grant, has already appointed over seven new instructors for the various classes of instrument.  It is also offering some 14 scholarships, mainly for wind instruments, to those who wish to avail of the instruction from these teachers and are capable of doing so.</P>
    <P>The professors for these special classes are our guest players in the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  I have every confidence that improved organisation and facilities for teaching will bear good fruit and place us eventually on a level with the conservatories of other countries.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, until we can turn out pupils in numbers up to the level of those in first-class orchestras we shall on every occasion on which new players are required for the Radio Éireann Orchestra, give auditions to any individual instrumentalists at home with a view to securing their places in it.  They will always be heard by an impartial board, including members who have a natural desire to give a chance to native talent.</P>
    <P>It would be just as well to be frank, however, and say that even in relation <Col N="933" /> to our small population of 3,000,000 a great deal more needs to be done in the development of the highest class of teaching both in regard to voices and instruments. I fully hope and believe that the Arts Council will have this matter actively in mind.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of music, I should say that Irish music should be played in this country and, indeed, outside it to a far greater extent than it is.  The extent of our orchestral arrangements is, however, woefully inadequate.</P>
    <P>I commend this work of arrangement for instruments varying in kind and number and for voices to those who have the ability and interest to take part in it.  Given proper arrangement there are many beautiful Irish airs which should be played as often throughout Europe as <i>The Blue Danube, Rhapsody in Blue, Old Man River</i> and so on.</P>
    <P>Even in our countryside the variety of songs sung at local concerts is very limited.  Not one-twentieth of the airs available have been arranged to suit the multifarious tastes of all communities.</P>
    <P>I think at this point that I should appeal to all those thousands of people in this country who gain a livelihood from the expanded tourist industry. Tourists leave here £25,000,000 in a normal post-war year.  A great deal of this trade can be kept for this country provided varied entertainment is offered.  We have a climate that can be capricious.  We have a hospitable and courteous people and some of the most beautiful scenery on earth, but much more is required if we are to continue to bring visitors to our shores.  The tourists who come here are of various categories but it is only too obvious from seeing them during the summer period that a very large number of them are the kind of people who appreciate in a reasonable way good music, foreign and Irish, and good plays.  They consist of the kind of people of very modest incomes who enjoy holidays where scenery, good talk, sport and some kind of special entertainment are all available.</P>
    <P>If in the time to come currency <Col N="934" /> restrictions grow lighter and there should be no war, we will have to make a very great effort to interest them in continuing to come here, and we shall have to provide for their entertainment, both in music and in other spheres.</P>
    <P>The international festival idea has been developing all over Europe and in our own country, both as a means of bringing new cultural entertainment to the citizens of a country and of attracting tourists.  The Edinburgh Festival, where great orchestras and choirs perform, where Scottish music and dancing are heard and seen at their very best, is an example of note, and there are many others besides.</P>
    <P>If we are to bring more people to this country in the periods when there is hotel accommodation, we must have a great forum where spectacular entertainment can be given.  For this purpose, we need some building which can be used as assembly rooms, possibly as a theatre and also as a concert hall.  It is to be noted that even in the summer months the repertory theatres are packed with foreign visitors and seats have to be secured well in advance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the question of constructing a concert hall-cum-assembly rooms-cum-theatre in Dublin is now the subject of active investigation.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Radio Éireann, I wish to commend the notable efforts of those who are in touch with the Dublin Corporation in connection with a site for this purpose.  I commend also in this connection the activities of the Music Association of Ireland and of the recently formed committee which is working on the concert-hall project. There should be continuous festivals of one kind or another in this country and far greater amenities for international congresses.</P>
    <P>The direct interest of Radio Éireann in this matter is, of course, that we should have somewhere for the orchestra to play in public and give us a larger scope for our general musical activities.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, may I say again we should have a concert hall here, play good <Col N="935" /> and light music there in order to encourage Irish musicians and players; in order to make it worthwhile for Irish singers to be trained who will come back home and find there are people who are willing to listen to them; in order to procure a proper home for opera; in order to encourage more Irish composition and the arrangement of Irish traditional music in new settings?</P>
    <P>While on the subject of music in general I should say that I have had to encourage the director of music to raise by several notches the standard of singing and I have disappointed as a result some of our most faithful contributors. Everything I have done in this connection is in accordance with what is the great need of the nation at the present time and about which there is no, or should be no, Party disagreement, the need to raise standards in every walk of life.  In some aspects of national life we have succeeded in achieving standards equal to or superior to those of other countries.  In many others, we still have a very long way to go.</P>
    <P>In connection with the many demands by societies and individuals for radio time, I suppose many members of the House know that actors, singers and debaters who sound good in parish halls, in Dublin theatres and in drawing-rooms may be absolutely hopeless when broadcasting unless they are trained to broadcast and unless they have the natural quality of voice which is pleasing over the microphone.</P>
    <P>Lastly, may I say that our repertory company has been highly praised from many quarters?  I hope our listeners will find the quality of production ever improves.</P>
    <P>In speaking of the various types of programme offered by Radio Éireann I should advert to the general policy maintained in regard to news and announcements related to State activities in order to present the true picture to the House.  Firstly, the Dáil Debates are summarised in the news.  Secondly, annual political congresses receive approximately equal time in the news programme.  Thirdly, Radio Éireann in common with other broadcasting <Col N="936" /> stations reports the announcements of Ministers made at public functions if these are considered to be of news value.  Fourthly, Ministers occasionally deliver short addresses on special recognised occasions such as the Budget announcement or on Easter Day.  The frequency of all these is proportional, generally speaking, to the volume of similar reports in the daily and weekly Press taken as a whole.  I should add that, since the end of the war emergency period, there has been no change whatever in the principles governing the broadcasting of political news.</P>
    <P>Information on State activities, whether made available by official announcements or by Ministers at functions, requires a greater proportion of radio time because the complex character of government requires so much explanation.  This is the position under all administrations.  Compared with Great Britain and taking all governmental publicity in its widest sense into account, we are more conservative. I have come to agree with my predecessor that to interfere either direct or through the director with the news staff, all of whom have prolonged experience, is most unwise, and that complaints in relation to the four types of news above-mentioned are sporadic and very infrequent.  Criticism of the Dáil debate reports is very rare indeed and is generally based on the fact that to explain a Bill takes longer than to criticise it, and on the fact that from time to time Deputies of any one Party may find the debate report unbalanced on a particular occasion.</P>
    <P>The news editor must be allowed to choose what is worth while reporting and by long tradition he endeavours to balance a debate on a controversial issue within the ambit of a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>Bearing all the above considerations in mind I would express the hope that, without making the news and discussion services the subject of narrow Party comment, Deputies will co-operate in giving serious consideration to the following ideas for future development which will, in fact, give a better balance to political controversy in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Radio Eireann, in fact, is one of the few stations in Western Europe that does not transmit stated political broadcasts by political party representatives in proportion to their numbers in between elections and during a general election.  Alone in Western Europe members of the Oireachtas do not debate together in threes and fours or with others on controversial topics with a political flavour.  So far as concerns an extension of programme where political thought is expressed, I have succeeded only in arranging for freedom of debate by the public in general and in encouraging the director to inaugurate the Saturday Dáil Commentary, which has proved popular.  I should like to have an expansion of the service considered by introducing these additional universally accepted types of programme. On the one hand, subject to the ordinary rules governing the prohibition of personal attacks on individuals, the heads of Parties could be free to nominate their speakers for stated and general election political broadcasts.</P>
    <P>The Parties will equally have to agree on the proportion of time to be allotted as in other countries where there are broadcasting parliamentary committees of an informal character. The Government itself as in many countries will have to be assured that the contemplated programme can proceed without any reasonable chance of failure through absence of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The director on the other hand, as in other countries, while ensuring political balance, would have to be given sole and absolute discretion as to the choice of back-bench Deputies and Senators for inclusion in Radio Éireann studio debates and there will be unavoidable heart-burnings.  Broadcasting is an art and there would be Deputies and Senators who, though excellent on the platform or in the House, have not the gift for microphone controversy.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day, whoever it may be, may decide that as long as the evening programme remains at five and a half hours nightly any extension would result in too much time being <Col N="938" /> given to political controversy although the extension could be limited.  Caution will be wiser than rash innovation.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will appreciate the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Summarising all this, everyone in Radio Éireann from the Minister to the scriptwriter, from the director to the youngest engineer, should and I believe does desire to fire the imagination of our listeners, to stimulate their interest in the manifold tapestry of music, literature, folklore, history, art, drama, sociology and political thought which means Ireland.</P>
    <P>When Deputies are considering the overall plan submitted for their approval, I would remind them that the development of broadcasting must be part of a long-term policy&mdash; improvements must come slowly and continuity in general policy is essential if Radio Éireann is to play an absolutely vital part in the renascence of this nation.</P>
    <P>I now come to our proposals for reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Since 1926 our broadcasting service has been controlled and operated as a Civil Service sub-department under the Post Office.  In the same way as other State Departments, financial control has been exercised in some detail by the Minister for Finance and by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and its authorities and accountancy system followed the general fairly rigid pattern of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>This system was not suited to a mass entertainment and educational service which had to work by the clock for 364 days of the year.  Radio Éireann shuts down only on Good Friday.  The difficulties of operating such an organisation on ordinary State Department lines was recognised very early and Ministers for Finance have from time to time delegated financial authority to the Post Office for broadcasting purposes to a greater extent than in other Departments.  These delegations have helped to solve some of the problems that beset broadcasting in the earlier years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government have now recognised that <Col N="939" /> far greater financial flexibility is needed to enable broadcasting to run smoothly and to give the public and the State the very varied service which is now expected from it.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann must function with the speed and the vigour of a newspaper.</P>
    <P>Apart from an easing of the financial rigidity of the State system, the radio requires scope to give broadcasters wide latitude to express their views. Direct identity with a State Department tends to hamper such freedom because the Department fears that the broadcasters' views may be taken as its own.</P>
    <P>With these objects in view, the Government has now approved a fundamental change in the broadcasting organisation.  As Deputies know, under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has the statutory responsibility for the operation of the broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>Two alternatives presented themselves immediately.  Broadcasting could be the function of an independent corporation controlled by the issuing of a licence at regular intervals by the Government, a number of powers being reserved such as licence fee, international regulations, policy in regard to programmes in Irish, etc.</P>
    <P>This appeared to the Government to be too extreme a measure in a small country such as our own and it was decided that a measure of limited delegation would best serve our purpose for the present.</P>
    <P>We can, however, without a change in the legal position of broadcasting, bring arrangements into force which will give many of the advantages of a board or corporation type of organisation and will afford valuable experience as to the flexibility such a body would bring to broadcasting.  The results of this already far-reaching change will be a guide if in future a more fundamental legal alteration is still contemplated.</P>
    <P>The Government has now approved the setting up of an intermediate type of organisation.  The Minister for <Col N="940" /> Posts and Telegraphs will remain in legal control of broadcasting and will continue to be legally responsible to the Oireachtas and to the public for its activities.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, however, to appoint a comhairle of five persons who will advise and assist the Minister in the conduct of broadcasting and will be responsible under him for the general control and supervision of the service.</P>
    <P>The members of the comhairle will be brought into the public service under Section 10 (2) of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, and broadly speaking they will take the place of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in assisting the Minister in the framing of policy and carrying on the administration of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The members of the comhairle will give part-time services to broadcasting and there will be part-time remuneration at the rate of £500 per annum for the chairman and £300 per annum for each of the other four members.  The period of office of the first council will be two years from 1st January next.</P>
    <P>The names of the first council are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Charles Brennan, Managing Director Brennan Insurances Limited; General Manager Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances, Limited; Director Insurance Corporation of Ireland Limited.</P>
    <P>Patrick Lynch, Lecturer in Economics, University College, Dublin, and previously Assistant Secretary to the Government and Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Padraig Mac Con Midhe, Principal Teacher, St. Patrick's Primary School, Holywood, County Down.  Mr. Mac Con Midhe is also Lecturer in Irish in St. Mary's College, Belfast; President, St. Brigid's Summer School of Irish, Rannafast; Secretary, Comhaltas Uladh and member of An Coiste Gnótha, Gaelic League.  He is a trustee and an ex-president of the Gaelic Athletic Association and he was for long a member of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>Seán Ó suilleabháin, Archivist Irish Folklore Commission.  Mr. Ó Suilleabháin is the author of standard <Col N="941" /> works on folklore.  He has lectured for, and is a member of, a number of learned bodies and has represented this country at cultural congresses in many countries in Europe as well as in the United States.</P>
    <P>Theodore William Moody, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and Professor of Modern History in Dublin University. He is a member of the Irish Manuscripts Commission; a member of the Cultural Relations Committee of Ireland; a member of the Royal Irish Academy and a Fellow of Royal Historical Society.  He is joint editor of <i>Irish Historical Studies.</i></P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that I have taken note of the fact that successive Governments have tended to ask for the invaluable services of a number of worthy people who can be found on many boards and committees.  Because of the special character of the broadcasting service, I have done my best to secure the services of men either young or fairly young, all with some experience of administration or with other first-class qualifications who will be not too burdened by the responsibility of holding other directorships. The period of office, as I have said, is for two years and as the new organisation will be in its initial stage of development no member of the comhairle will object if I say that should there be changes at the end of the first period of office this will be due to the necessity for bringing fresh points of view to the aid of the Minister in the direction of a service in which novelty is a constant need; it will not reflect on any member's competence.  As I have said the direction of broadcasting is a vocation and I have used my intuition more than anything else in believing these men to have the administrative gift of providing good management and of co-operating with the director.</P>
    <P>I wish also to announce that I am about to promote Mr. Charles Kelly, the present Director of Broadcasting, to the position of Director of Savings in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In his new post, Mr. Kelly will be responsible, under the accountant of the Department, for the direction of <Col N="942" /> the Post Office Savings Bank and for the further stimulation of savings by publicity and other means through the medium of the bank and Savings Certificates. The Post Office Savings Bank, which has £56,000,000 to the credit of holders, now form one of the largest banking institutions in the country, and it is essential to have this important post of Director of Savings to strengthen the direction of the bank and certificate service and to enable its facilities to be kept constantly before the public.  Mr. Kelly's promotion will take effect as from 1st January.  I wish here to thank Mr. Kelly for the services he has rendered to broadcasting as director for four years and previously in other capacities in the station. During Mr. Kelly's period of office there have been many broadcasting developments in the way of recorded programmes, the recruitment of staff, actors, producers and scriptwriters, the development of provincial and studio concerts by the orchestras, and so on. These matters impose a great strain on a director&mdash;in fact, the position is recognised to be one of the most difficult in the State service.  It is, therefore, a position in which change after an interval of some years could be looked forward to as a normal occurrence. I wish Mr. Kelly every success in his new post.</P>
    <P>The direction of broadcasting is, as I have said, a vocation akin to that of an editor or theatrical producer.  The Director of Radio Éireann which, in a small organisation like ours, corresponds with the head of a programme service in a larger organisation, should be a professional appointment and have no relation to any other consideration. A director may be able to write programmes within a limited field but his principal quality will be that of the man who can find talent, inspire others to formulate programmes and have the genius to produce an overall programme enjoyable to people of various tastes.  A day's programme, as I have said, is something like a newspaper edition but far more difficult to produce.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that, <Col N="943" /> for at least a period of transition from the old to the new broadcasting organisation, we shall secure the services of such a person as director in Mr. Maurice Gorham who will give the Minister and the comhairle the benefit of his wide and varied knowledge and control of broadcasting in Britain and America.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gorham comes of well-known Connemara families on both sides.  His father was dispensary doctor in Letter-frack. Maurice Gorham, after his education at Stoneyhurst and Oxford and a period in literary and political journalism, joined the B.B.C. in 1926. Among the important and responsible positions he held there were editor of the <i>Radio Times</i> for eight years and Head of Broadcasts to North America, and of Services programme.  He initiated the B.B.C. Light Programme and reopened the B.B.C. Television Service in 1946 after the war.  Mr. Gorham resigned from the B.B.C. in 1947.</P>
    <P>He has written well-known books on broadcasting and television as well as various newspaper and magazine articles and numerous scripts for the B.B.C.  While our resources are very small as compared with the B.B.C., and Mr. Gorham knows that to be the position, I am satisfied that his wide knowledge of broadcasting and the ingenuity he must have acquired in solving the problems and difficulties that daily confront programme planners in the large independent broadcasting organisation with which he has been associated will be of immense help to us here in making the most of the resources and talent available in the period of change.  Mr. Gorham has agreed to come as temporary director on 1st January next. Perhaps I should say that Mr. Gorham is fully cognisant of Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gorham will have as his immediate superiors the comhairle whose names I have already made known, all of whom are steeped in Irish tradition and I am convinced that he will be able to improve the programme along the lines I have indicated and which are so vital to the preservation of our national distinctions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> I explained earlier that there was some want of flexibility on the financial side in trying to operate broadcasting on the lines of the normal Government accountancy system with detailed finance authorities.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Finance and the Government have agreed to simplify the broadcasting financial procedure. An annual grant will be made for broadcasting equal to the total of the receipts from licence fees and sponsored programme fees and very wide financial delegations will be given by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the annual grant the cost of expensive equipment and buildings to such extent as may be agreed upon by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be provided by subsidy.</P>
    <P>No charge will be made against broadcasting in respect of the various services which are at present provided free to broadcasting by the Post Office and other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I should explain that these revised financial arrangements will not add any substantial sum to the amount available for broadcasting, as the various items, such as buildings, equipment and the services rendered by other Government Departments, are at present provided for broadcasting free, by a year to year undefined agreement.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements, however, enable the broadcasting authorities to know in advance by an accepted formula the amount of money that will be available in a particular year and they can plan more definitely ahead. The new arrangements will also permit of more freedom to spend whatever annual sum is provided in the annual vote.  The money can be used in the most advantageous way and with the necessary expedition without having to watch whether a particular item is covered by a particular authority in a particular form.  Consideration is also being given to the question of simplifying the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting as presented to the Dáil each year with the object of bringing it a little more in line with the type of financial statements provided by semi-State <Col N="945" /> broadcasting organisations.  The result will be freedom for instant innovation, freedom to devote funds for new types of service and adequate flexibility in staffing matters.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Minister will still be responsible legally for the operation of the broadcasting service, and, of course, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, he will have to continue to exercise direct control over such matters as wavelengths and international radio regulations.  The Minister and the Government will be actively interested in such matters as the help to be given by broadcasting to the language movement, the scope of advertising programmes, and the principles governing religious broadcasting. Beyond these matters and the laying down of general policy about maintaining a fair balance in political views and policy matters of that sort, it is my intention to give every latitude to the comhairle and the director in the running of the broadcasting service.  Indeed, I shall expect them also to help me by their advice in large matters of policy.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters which I propose to ask the comhairle and director to examine as soon as they conveniently can.  One is the question of an extension of the hours of service. I feel personally that this should be by way of providing a second programme.</P>
    <P>I know we cannot have a full second service on the lines of the B.B.C. Light or Third Programme, but I think that we could have a modest separate transmission from the Dublin and Cork stations perhaps for a short period at week-ends in the beginning.</P>
    <P>The second programme should commence about the time the new transmitters are installed in 1953.  The comhairle will be able to give me some proposals, I hope, at an early stage as to the type of extension of service that would be suitable and feasible.</P>
    <P>As a result of visits to many broadcasting stations abroad, I am convinced that our broadcasting organisation at home needs a considerable overhaul. Technically and artistically, the production of programmes is now a <Col N="946" /> much more complex business than it was even a few short years ago, and it is essential that modern broadcasting organisations should keep abreast of the latest developments, whether in equipment or production technique, to enable them to give that polish to their programmes which makes the difference between merely good and excellent programmes.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I am sure the comhairle will examine is that of a broadcasting headquarters.  Some extra studios have been practically completed in the General Post Office and the final touches are awaiting the supply of some special furniture through the Office of Public Works. These studios are the limit of the accommodation that can be obtained in the General Post Office.  I know that there will be many practical difficulties of magnitude&mdash;financial, technical, etc. &mdash;in the provision of a headquarters for broadcasting which will prevent its realisation for a very considerable time.  The preliminary steps in the matter could, however, be undertaken and I hope that this can be done.</P>
    <P>We are the only country in Europe without a fine radio station and if we are to aim at the minimum requirements for a small country, two five-hour programmes on every day, we must build as soon as possible.  The building, moreover, should be capable of partial conversion to television later on.  The finance for such a building depends, of course, on the capital being available and is a matter of high Government policy.  Deputies may take it that Radio Éireann can never play the full part envisaged for it by successive Governments until we have constructed this building.  As an incentive to higher standards in every walk of life and in every vocation, the expenditure would, I believe, prove to be of enduring value.</P>
    <P>I must refer finally to the wireless licence fee.  There was only one small increase in 1940 in the original licence fee of 10/-, that is, to 12/6.  A fee of 12/6 a year or 3d. a week is fantastically small when compared with the cost of any other form of entertainment. For that fee, a listener has a choice of numerous performances all over Europe <Col N="947" /> and outside by world famous orchestras, of classical plays or of any other entertainment desired.  Such performances could not be heard regularly in a theatre at any fee because of the huge expense.  The fee of 12/6 a year, which incidentally is the lowest in Europe, is also entirely out of proportion to present costs.  The amount of expenditure from the Wireless Broadcasting Vote for 1939-40&mdash;the year before the increase was made from 10/- to 12/6&mdash; was approximately £67,000.  The expenditure for 1950-51, the latest year for which appropriation accounts are available, was £220,000.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the main Estimate this year, the expenditure is still going up considerably, due to a great extent to increases in salaries and fees. The sum in the Broadcasting Vote does not cover the cost of the services given to broadcasting by other Departments or the cost of buildings and expensive equipment.  As I have said, the Government has agreed to provide these services by subsidy.</P>
    <P>Licence holders would not at the same time expect the subsidy to extend to the ordinary expenditure from the Broadcasting Vote to provide the daily programmes.  If the service is to be extended for a beginning in the manner I have indicated, by a short second programme, the present licence fee will not cover the cost.</P>
    <P>The fee must, therefore, be increased. I have not yet decided what the increase should be or the date on which it should begin.  I wish to assure the House and licence holders, however, that the higher fee is for the purpose of meeting the cost of improvements in the programmes by way of longer hours or better finished programmes.</P>
    <P>Considering that the broadcasting service will still be subsidised heavily for buildings and other matters, I am certain nobody will object to making some extra contribution for the purpose of meeting the cost of actual programme preparation and presentation.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that, so far as ultimate programme expansion is concerned, we shall be limited severely by <Col N="948" /> the ultimate potential number of licence holders.  The number of households in the country is, as I understand, about 650,000, and the ultimate number of wireless licences will be less than that number.  This will certainly limit the degree to which a small country like ours can produce expensive programmes over a long stretch each day.</P>
    <P>We shall at the same time continue to do our best to give programmes of as high a standard as the resources given to us by the licence holders will permit.  I can put the problem in another way.  We can spend a given number of shillings over the 12/6 on the improvement of the existing service and on a short second programme. Above that given increase, we can spend another given number of shillings in providing a double five-hour programme, but for this we need a radio building.</P>
    <P>It only remains for me to thank the broadcasting staff for their loyalty and devotion to duty during the year.  I wish also to thank the members of the advisory committee for the continuance of their assistance.  I had not, of course, an opportunity of expressing my thanks on the main Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech was a lengthy one, but the portion with which we are mainly concerned deals with the proposals to establish a comhairle or advisory council which has been described as a new deal for Radio Éireann.  I should like to say at the outset that we consider that, when this decision was arrived at, it would have been far better to establish a separate statutory corporation.  I noted from the Minister's speech that the Government considered the advisability of such a course, but decided on some intermediate course between the arrangement which at present exists and the establishment of an independent body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who has considered this matter at any time, when it was discussed here or when the programmes provided by Radio Éireann were considered, has, I think, inevitably come to the conclusion that the system under which Radio Éireann operates is entirely unsuited to our conception of a <Col N="949" /> radio station.  It may be that, in the initial stages, no other course was open and that, when the station was established in 1926, it was the easiest method of providing a radio service for the country; but with the substantial development that has taken place in radio technique and all we associate with radio programmes in the past quarter of a century, it is obvious that the procedure followed by Radio Éireann is quite unsuitable and the system under which it operates inadequate to provide a sufficient radio service for the country.</P>
    <P>Civil Service procedure is totally unsuited for a radio service.  Civil servants are responsible, through their Ministers, to the Dáil and consequently they are naturally cautions.  When criticism is voiced of Civil Service procedure and regulation, too often people are apt to forget that the Civil Service was never established for the type of service that Radio Éireann is expected to give.  Similarly criticism is occasionally made that because civil service procedure is followed there is something defective in the service given.  Merely that civil servants follow Civil Service procedure should be no grounds for criticism and on occasions it would be quite wrong and improper for civil servants to operate on a basis other than that laid down by tradition and by Civil Service regulations, but to expect a proper radio service administered by a State Department, as Radio Éireann is by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, is to refuse to face up to the very great changes that have taken place in the development of broadcasting.  The type of service which listeners not only in this country but elsewhere expect once they pay their licence fee could not be provided by a body established under the direction and control of the Dáil as laid down in the Statute.</P>
    <P>With the development the Minister has announced we may expect an improvement in the service.  The names of some of the members of the council are familiar to a number of people.  I can speak with personal experience of some of them and I think that their inclusion in the comhairle will materially assist the Minister and his Department in providing a better <Col N="950" /> service for Radio Éireann.  I think, however, that it would have been far better if the Minister had established an independent body.  On that body he could appoint the persons concerned or some of them with others if necessary. He could then under defined statutory limitations and subject to certain financial arrangements provided under the Act allow them to proceed on an independent basis.  One of the great criticisms in the existing situation is that the radio service will continue to be the subject of discussion here in the House and from time to time of criticism from political angles.  If I understand the Minister's proposals, although the members appointed to the Broadcasting Council will be appointed under the Civil Service (Regulations) Act it will be an advisory council not an executive council charged with responsibility for the administration and direction of the day to day activities and policy of Radio Éireann.  This whole question is one that wants consideration.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood me because of the translation of the word &ldquo;comhairle&rdquo; which I understand refers to advice.  In order not to confuse the House I may not have described it properly.  This is to be an executive council charged with supervising the activities of Radio Éireann, not merely an advisory council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it will guide the Minister and his Department. Although the Minister now says that it will have executive functions, the Minister, as he stated in his speech, will still be responsible legally for Radio Éireann.  He will be responsible for the Department to the Dáil and consequently Radio Éireann will not have the independence one might expect.  If an independent statutory body were set up Radio Éireann would have the same independence as a number of State organisations or bodies. From time to time the criticism is <Col N="951" /> made that there are too many State bodies and too much State interference. Probably in some cases that criticism is justified.</P>
      <P>In some cases considerable sums of money may have been spent unwisely. The decision to set up these bodies was, however, taken either by the Government or by the Dáil on the recommendation of some member of the Government, and, consequently, the decision to restrict their activities or limit their powers or functions may be taken at any time by the Dáil if it so wishes.  On this occasion we have been presented with some sort of intermediate body.  It will advise the Minister and to some extent have executive functions, but whatever these functions may be they will not be carried out independently, because, ultimately, the Minister has legal responsibility.  This departure may mean improvements.  I hope it will, but it must proceed on the basis of accepted Civil Service procedure and Civil Service regulations, and the Minister must continue to accept his statutory responsibility for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of which Radio Éireann is a part if it is to discharge its normal functions.  The Secretary of the Department will be the accounting officer in the same way as the head of any Department is responsible for a subsidiary section of that Department no matter what type of work that section may have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a discussion on this matter there is, of course, ample scope for discussing different programmes, for expressing personal opinions on the type of programme that should be given from the station, for expressing individual tastes, preferences and views on particular aspects of the programmes. In the main, these matters should be left to the persons appointed for that type of work.  On the basis of a canvass made by Radio Éireann public taste should be catered for.  I do not think that any individual Deputy has a particular right to speak authoritatively for or against a particular type of programme or to speak of activities which should be considered by Radio Éireann, but there are some matters which have been adverted to <Col N="952" /> by the Minister in the course of his opening speech which require some comment.  He suggested that he favoured the development of political broadcasts.  I think we would all welcome that.  I think that for too long we had adhered to the old procedure whereby political controversy was excluded from Radio Éireann. But, here again, the difficulty arises that I mentioned at the beginning.  If a Minister is responsible to the Dáil&mdash; no matter what Party he may belong to, or what his own particular views may be&mdash;the members of the Dáil who are not in agreement with his views or who may not be members of his Party will be under the impression that the political broadcasts, either by the time or by the slant which is given to them, tend to favour the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>If the control and direction of Radio Éireann were under an independent autonomous body it would be impossible for that criticism to be levelled and certainly it would be weakened in its effect.  It is only natural and human for people to consider that the particular Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who may be in office at the time is influenced by Party or personal or political considerations and that those who differ from him do not get the same opportunities for expressing their viewpoints.  The system which has been adopted elsewhere may or may not have much to commend it.</P>
    <P>I think some of the news services introduced recently of providing an account at the end of the week of the Dáil proceedings were reasonably well-balanced. However, it is impossible to believe that the news bulletins are always as well-balanced as these talks&mdash;not because more time may be given to Government pronouncements or to Government views than is given to the Opposition but, in the main, because of the preponderance of time which is given to ministerial announcements. It does not always follow that a speech or a statement made by a Minister is of news value.  Some of them may be, and others may not. Similarly, it does not follow that because a number of Deputies make speeches all the speeches are of equal value though each Deputy may think <Col N="953" /> his own particular speech merits inclusion in the news.  I think some consideration should be given to editing on a very efficient basis the news services of Dáil proceedings and of Dáil speeches.  The type of service which is given in Britain&mdash;&ldquo;In Parliament To-day&rdquo;&mdash;appears to me to conform more to the service which is broadcast from Radio Éireann on Saturday evenings and which, in effect, gives a more accurate representation of views expressed in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I come now to the general question of news bulletins.  The ordinary evening news bulletin, with the exception of that portion of the bulletin which is confined to reports on Irish events, is, in the main, a repetition of the B.B.C. and a repetition of what appears in the evening newspapers.  It is, of course, true to say that the evening newspapers do not circulate in all parts of the country and that consequently those people who have not the newspaper service available to them probably get some news value out of the news bulletins but, in general, I think the evening news bulletins leave a lot to be desired.  In contrast, I should like to say that the morning news bulletins which were introduced during the strike in the printing trade are quite good and provide a useful service.  I think the male announcer is first-class and deserves praise for the manner in which he does his work.  If an improvement in the news service can be effected it should be carried out as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to the fact that it is his intention, and that he thinks it is the responsibility of Radio Éireann, to provide programmes of our own music, drama and literature.  I think everybody will agree with that outlook.  The Minister went on to refer to the fact that the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and the Light Orchestra provide music of the highest standard.  In that connection, I want to mention a matter which has caused considerable ill-feeling amongst musicians in the country.  I refer to the large number of non-nationals who are members of the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  I know that it will be stated that these <Col N="954" /> persons are, in the main, only temporary employees, but the inclusion of a number of these persons has meant the dismissal or the termination of the services of a number of persons who, formerly, were employed by the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  Two members whose services in the Radio Éireann Orchestra had been terminated played with the Hallé Orchestra when it was in Dublin recently under Sir John Barbirolli.  The fact that these persons are regarded as competent to play in an orchestra with the reputation of the Hallé Orchestra shows that they were competent musicians.  The position which exists at the moment, whereby a number of persons who are members of the Radio Éireann Orchestra are in a continuous state of uncertainty because of the large-scale dismissals has, I think, worsened the prospects of securing an orchestra which will have not merely a high reputation, but which will have in it persons who are contented with their conditions of service. I do not think that our musicians cannot learn from some contact with musicians abroad.  I do not think that they cannot be improved by being enabled to study with foreign orchestras, but I think they should be provided with the opportunities of equipping themselves by, if necessary, travelling abroad rather than by being replaced, even on a temporary basis, by persons who come here from different parts of Europe.  If we want to have an orchestra with an international reputation it should be an Irish orchestra.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We can listen in to any station in Europe and hear an orchestra from another country but, at the moment, the Radio Éireann Orchestra is some sort of international orchestra broadcasting from Radio Éireann.  I think it is only right that our people should have the best standard available and an orchestra with a first-class reputation but it should be composed of Irish musicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that we have had good conductors, that some of the conductors have come here from abroad and that the Radio <Col N="955" /> Éireann Orchestra has improved.  Many years ago, when the Army band was first established in this country, the band got the services of a foreign conductor, the late Colonel Fritz Brase. He did not bring in a foreign band. He trained members of the Army and established, not merely one band but a number of bands with high reputations &mdash;bands which were subsequently conducted by Irish conductors who, in some cases, had been trained abroad and who had equally high reputations. I think that, in the same way, it is possible for the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra to be trained to the same high level, and the fact that some members were regarded as suitable for inclusion in the Hallé Orchestra, on its recent visit to Dublin, supports the view that there are available in this country musicians comparable with those of any other country, if they are given a reasonable chance.  It is a fact that, in addition to the foreigners in the orchestra, the Director of Cór Radio Éireann has recently been replaced by a non-national, or a person of foreign extraction.  I do not want to raise controversial matters here merely for the sake of raising them but it is only right to say that there is a strong feeling amongst Irish musicians on this matter.  Consideration should be given to their views as well as to the hardships that this situation has caused to a number of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that it was hoped to give greater variety in programmes and he spoke of the sponsored programmes.  I think anybody who listens to the sponsored programmes at lunch-time must be surprised at the type of music broadcast.  Unless one heard specific reference to the fact that the industries concerned were situated in this country, and that the goods were manufactured in this country, one would not get that impression from listening to the music.  I am fortunate in that I never have time to listen to the lunch-time programme because sometimes I am told the programmes would blow the head off any listener.  I think, as Deputy Breanndán Mac Fheórais suggested to-day by way of <Col N="956" /> parliamentary question, some censorship should be imposed on the form of entertainment given.  It is of course only natural to expect that the firms concerned will present as vigorously as possible the merits of their own goods or whatever type of service they render, but interspersed between these sponsored programmes there should be more variety.  Where the fare offered consists of a whole series of sponsored programmes one after another, it is like a blitz attack on listeners.  While one programme may have as its main object the boosting of one particular type of goods or services, when it is followed by another programme of a similar kind, the repetitive nature of the programmes becomes somewhat tedious to listeners.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that more commodious studio accommodation is required but he did not say that it was proposed to provide new studios.  While some improvements have been made in the existing studio accommodation at the G.P.O., the studio accommodation there was never designed to provide proper facilities for a radio station.  Consideration should be given to the establishment of a separate broadcasting station.  I do not think it is necessary to have a very elaborate or costly station.  There is always the danger that when a desire is expressed for some new building or some new service, the most grandiose scheme will be put forward and that some person charged with responsibility of providing the outline of such a scheme, will elaborate on the necessity for a grandiose building or for an elaborate type of administration.  I think it should be possible within the limits of our financial resources and within the limits of the services which we are expected to provide, to build a reasonably commodious radio station and to have available there adequate facilities for broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The proposals announced envisage an alternative programme.  That programme should be different from the programme normally provided.  An effort should be made to ensure that it will be a different type of programme not merely an alternative programme. If a person wants to hear an alternative <Col N="957" /> programme he generally turns over to another station or to another wavelength for that particular station.  But if an alternative programme is merely a repetition of the normal programme, then it cannot have the same attraction. I should like to suggest that the new comhairle should consider immediately the possibility of providing a different programme under whatever name it may be called&mdash;a second programme or an alternative programme.</P>
    <P>The proposals which were announced here by the Minister mark an improvement on the services that have existed hitherto.  The only criticism which I should like to express is the one I mentioned at the outset, namely that it would be far better&mdash;and I believe if proposals were brought in here to that end, agreement could be reached on the matter&mdash;to come to a decision to set up an autonomous statutory body or corporation.  Any discussion on radio services either here or elsewhere may result in conflicting views being expressed.  Recently an effort was made to get some form of an all-Party agreement in Britain in order to provide new legislation or a new scheme for the B.B.C.  That effort failed but the mere fact that it failed is no reason why an effort should not be made here to get agreement amongst all Parties for the setting up of an independent statutory corporation to deal with broadcasting and to lay down general lines of policy which could be incorporated in a Bill. The proposals which have been announced here have the merit that some improvement is proposed but it is fair neither to those concerned with the broadcasting service, to the advisory committee nor to the comhairle, to expect them to give to the country a proper radio service if they have not either independence, the legislative sanction or the autonomy which the persons concerned with the running of such a service should have.</P>
    <P>I consider that the proposals are in the main acceptable and if the Minister can persuade his colleagues in the Government and the Department of Finance to lessen its control and the financial restrictions under which Radio Éireann operates, then we shall support any legislation or any measures <Col N="958" /> which he may bring before the House for that purpose or, at any rate, support the general intention of such a measure.  There may be differences of opinion afterwards as to the form of legislation or as to the type of statutory body which should be established but in general we support and recommend a decision to establish an independent body which would promote broadcasting.</P>

      <P>As one who, during the years which have passed, particularly the struggling years of Radio Éireann, spoke constantly on this Estimate, I did my part, both here and outside, with writers, musicians and organisations to have proper conditions established in Radio Éireann.  I must admit that, during recent years, the general condition of things there has improved.  I do not think anyone will take exception to that statement&mdash;that the general condition of things has improved.  However, I do not desire to say very much on this Estimate, but I do feel it my duty, following Deputy Cosgrave, to speak here as Chairman of the Municipal School of Music, and to say that I disagree profoundly&mdash;in this I think I am expressing the views of the great majority of people associated with music in the city and also, in my opinion, of the great majority of my own constituents&mdash;with the development in connection with the symphony and light orchestra of Radio Éireann, and to say that it is not in the best interests of this country.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that we want an orchestra of international standard if we have to bring in internationals to make it that.  If the money that is paid out of taxation in this connection is for anything, it is to nurture Irish talent in whatever direction it is available. That has always been the tenor of my speeches in this House on Radio Éireann and on kindred subjects.  I, therefore, fail to see how those who agreed with me in the past will disagree with me now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made many pertinent remarks during the last few weeks, but I think that the most impertinent observation that has come from him during the last few days is in the current issue of a journal called <i>Radio Review.</i>&ldquo;Completely inadequate,&rdquo;<Col N="959" /> is the description by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Erskine Childers, &ldquo;is the training of musicians to concert standard in this country.&rdquo; Now, it all depends on what the criterion of &ldquo;concert standard&rdquo; is.  If the criterion of concert standard is a standard on a par with the best to be had in other places in the world, well then, possibly, we do not come up to it in every aspect.  I say this, and I say it here deliberately&mdash;I say it from my association with people whose services have been dispensed with in Radio Éireann during the last few weeks&mdash;that they are as competent as any who have come here to replace them.  Yesterday, I heard of two more dismissals during the last few weeks.  There was one man who had been playing for nine years with the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and he was replaced by a German musician.  He is a man with a wife and family.  I suppose he can go elsewhere to seek employment.  However, whether these people are equal to, or better than, our own musicians, my contention is that what the Irish people want to hear is an Irish orchestra which can be gradually coached along until it reaches the stage of perfection which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs so earnestly desires.</P>
    <P>We have a very short, in fact we have practically no, tradition in this class of music.  We all must realise that this country did not get the same chance as continental countries to develop on those lines, but no continental country of which I am aware, set about building up a musical tradition in the way that Radio Éireann and the Minister are attempting to do, by putting their native musicians on the roll of the unemployed and by bringing in people from the far corners of the earth.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister, who are the people who select these people from the Continent?  Who are his scouts?  Who are the people who say that these musicians are superior to our people, and who are the people who inform him that these are the best performers?  I do not know who <Col N="960" /> are the people who inform him that these people are good teachers.</P>
    <P>A scholarship scheme has now been announced in the public Press in relation to one institution in this city.  I have no rivalry, except a friendly rivalry, with any of the musical establishments here, but there are a number of musical establishments in this city which have turned out excellent performers over the years.  The Minister, I can only say, must have been stone deaf during the last 25 years if he attended the Feis Ceoil and did not hear the comments of competent adjudicators, who are changed regularly every year, on some of our performers here.  However, as I say, this is my protest here I want the Minister to understand that this policy will be opposed.  It will be opposed with all the vigour that I and people associated with me in the musical life of the city can command.  That is my last word here to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>After the lengthy speech that we have had from the Minister, I feel somewhat disappointed because from Press reports I was expecting to hear that the Minister had succeeded in taking Radio Éireann, lock, stock and barrel away from the Department of Finance.  Unfortunately, that is not so.  Civil servants, because of their training, always take the safe side&mdash;the side of caution&mdash;and no matter what the Minister may wish or desire he will find that he will be up against the problem of being told that certain things cannot be done.  I am sure he has already found that out for himself.  Therefore, the Minister, while we all wish the new organisation every success, will I fear be faced with the problem which many of his predecessors were faced with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has rightly pointed out that the head of the Department will still be the accounting officer and will, because of his training, be on the side of safety.  So far as the amount of money to be allocated is concerned, it will not matter if the Minister receives £50,000 more than the licence fees bring in, he will still have to contend with the accounting officer, who is responsible to the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that if the Minister had succeeded in persuading the members of the Government to have an independent body, he would have had the support of the House.  The problem that I have referred to will still be there, even though you have a comhairle or an advisory body.  The Minister will be answerable in this House for Radio Éireann.  Even so, there will be opposition members who will feel that they are not getting a fair show.  I am satisfied of that from my experience in the broadcasting station.  In 1948 when I was a few months in office I reported to this House that I was not satisfied a Civil Service Department was the best that could be put in control of our radio station.  In 1928 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs took control.  We opposed that control tooth and nail but the responsibility was nevertheless handed over.</P>
    <P>In 1948 I stated I would give the director and the staff full freedom of action.  I stated they had my complete confidence.  I am glad the Minister has promised the new body the same freedom of action in their work, but the fact remains that he will still be responsible to this House for broadcasting and we will have here the inevitable questions, irrespective of whatever Minister is in office, asking why a particular individual was not given more time on the air as compared with some other individual.</P>
    <P>The news editors are trained professional men.  They know their work, and I am glad the Minister has adopted the same principle as I did.  He never interferes with them.  He leaves them to act at their own discretion.  It is only natural, however, that out of a sense of loyalty to the Minister they should try to keep on the safe side, and for that reason I am afraid that we will continue to have here year after year discussions and questions in connection with Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have no comments to offer on the proposed personnel of the new council. I believe they are all qualified, worthy men.  No matter what names the Minister may submit there will always be some people prepared to criticise.  The new council should be given a fair start and every assistance in their task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> The Minister stated that the people in the cities and towns are conservative in their tastes while the people in the rural areas are more racy of the soil and there is from them a continual demand for songs and ballads, but we have not enough variety.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the employment of foreign musicians, I regret the Minister has seen fit to reverse the undertaking I gave publicly here that I would employ no more foreigners or non-nationals in Radio Éireann.  Pressure was brought to bear on me to employ a trumpeter and a bugler who were non-nationals.  I was told that these men had been in the country for years and utilised their spare time in giving lessons and training others.  I held they could not be giving value for the money they were receiving by way of fees for such lessons and training since we could find no bugler or trumpeter of our own suitable for appointment to Radio Éireann.  I therefore refused to appoint these two men. Now, the Minister has seen fit to reverse that decision and some more non-nationals have been employed.</P>
    <P>We are paying £55,000 per year for a symphony orchestra.  The Minister has stated that he will have a ballot taken to find out what the wishes of the people are.  I believe 80 per cent. of the people never listen to symphony concerts.  There are two concerts weekly in Dublin.  If a provincial town asks for the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra they must put up £400 before the orchestra is allowed to go down there.  If the people in Dublin want high-class, high-brow music let them have it.  Why should the ordinary licensed holder living in the hills have to pay extra for his licence in order to benefit the people in Dublin? He never listens to the symphony orchestra.  Yet £50,000 is spent per year on that symphony orchestra and now we are told that many of those engaged in it are non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy McCann has protested against their employment, and I hope that, as a result of his protest, some action will be taken.  If Deputy McCann is sincere, he will get an opportunity of putting his words into action in order to show those in <Col N="963" /> control that, irrespective of Party, we are in favour of Irish musicians being employed as far as possible.  We do not want to see them thrown on the roadside.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said he is in favour of having more Irish songs and Irish ballads broadcast.  In that part of the country in which I live there are no cinemas and there are no entertainments. The people have their battery sets and they turn on to the B.B.C. The people in the rural areas do not want first-class drama.  There are many local festivals that could be broadcast.  There are local plays which would meet the requirements of the ordinary people if they were put on the air.  If a play is produced in a local hall the hall is packed.  Why not give the people who are unable to attend an opportunity of hearing that over the air?  That would be better than giving the people the symphony orchestra two or three nights in the week at a cost of £55,000 per year.</P>
    <P>I know it is not possible to satisfy everybody, particularly when so many people come along as experts to criticise.  I am not criticising.  I am merely making suggestions, and I wish the Minister every success in the effort he is making.  I hope he will go further.  He will have the support of all Parties here.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised at the silence now in relation to the short-wave station.  When we were in Government the present Taoiseach, the present Minister for External Affairs and the present Minister for Finance were all howling in condemnation of us because the short-wave station was not put into operation.  The Taoiseach mentioned at the time that he recognised it would cost money.  Nevertheless he said it should be put into operation.  The Minister for External Affairs stated there was no necessity for negotiations with Mexico or Copenhagen or anywhere else, though I assured him at the time that we were awaiting the conclusions of a conference that was then sitting in Copenhagen. In 1949, the then Government gave an order that the short-wave station was to be put into operation <Col N="964" /> and we were to give half-hour broadcasts daily to America and Canada. To-night there has not been a word about the short-wave station.  Why the silence on the part of the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance, both of whom were so very vocal here when they believed it was necessary to have a short-wave station?  It could not be postponed for six months.  They required the short-wave station to counteract the half-hour broadcasts from Belfast with Partition propaganda.  The Government are now nearly one and a half years in office and the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance have full control, but we have not heard one word about the short-wave station.  At that time it was pointed out by the Department, when it was proposed to have a short-wave station for broadcasting to America, that the American people had not any short-wave receiving sets.  Therefore arrangements were made to get &ldquo;frequencies&rdquo;, which they succeeded in getting at Copenhagen.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make some statement as to what is to happen with regard to the short-wave station.  Will it be used for the second programme or has the Minister made an arrangement with another country which is very anxious to get &ldquo;time&rdquo; on the short-wave station?  If the Minister does not propose to proceed with it he might consider the question of selling &ldquo;time&rdquo; and using the &ldquo;frequency&rdquo; he has so as to bring in more money and have more money at his disposal.</P>
    <P>Then, the Minister has not said a word about television.  I recognised some years ago that it was a matter which we should be cautious about. The question had to be very carefully considered as we could not afford to spend the huge sum of money which other countries spend on television until we had a better idea about it.  I am sure the Minister must now realise that there have been great developments in regard to television and that it will be installed in the Six Counties in a few months' time.  That being so, has the Department or has the Minister considered whether there is any way of making an arrangement <Col N="965" /> with the Belfast station for television in the Twenty-Six Counties?  I am sure the Minister has been viewing some television programmes here as I have in my own town where there is a very good reception.  Although these have to come over the intervening hills and across the water, there is a very clear reception in Wicklow, as I told the Minister before.  Perhaps the Minister could make some arrangement such as I have suggested.  I am aware that we could not establish a television station and go on spending a huge sum of money until we know definitely how television will develop and whether there will be any changes in the next few years.  But, pending a definite solution of the problem, I think the Minister will be forced within the next 12 months by the public demand for it, now that our friends across the Border are to have it, to make some arrangement to provide television for the people in other areas who are not privileged as some people in Wicklow are at present.  I understand the difficulty of the Minister.  It is a question of money.  But, as the Taoiseach pointed out about the short-wave station, the money had to be found and we will have to get money by selling &ldquo;time&rdquo; if necessary for having our own station.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the officials in the radio station.  We know that the Post Office is not an ideal place for a station.  We know their difficulties and the inconveniences they have to put up with.  We know that they are tied up by Civil Service regulations and in regard to money by the Department of Finance.  But, on the whole, Radio Éireann has done very well, no matter how certain people may criticise it.  If they realised the problems which the station staff have to face in trying with a small amount of money to satisfy and cater for the people, then they would appreciate the difficulties and realise that they have got on very well on the whole.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the director of the station, as the Minister said, has been promoted.  I was afraid, on account of comments made here, that a certain Minister would not be a party to it. The director had his own difficulties in trying to satisfy the tastes of the <Col N="966" /> different people and I am glad the Minister has appreciated his work, knowing as I do the work he has done and the inconvenience and the problems that he had to face for four years.  We hope that his successor will have a better time and will have greater support than the present staff had for the last few years.  As I said, Radio Éireann has done very well.  If we had an independent company running it there would still be people to criticise owing to the different tastes of individuals.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take the matter into his own hands and not have any more foreign musicians coming into the country.  I am not a great musician, but travelling around my own constituency I know the people are determined about that.  They are against what is happening in connection with the symphony orchestra and are all out to do certain things as a protest against the employment of these foreigners.  There is no use trying to convince these people that we have not Irish musicians who are quite capable.</P>
    <P>As I said, I welcome some of the things mentioned by the Minister.  I ask him, however, to give us some information in connection with the short-wave station and what his idea is about television.  Is there any hope in the immediate future or within the next 12 months of a short-wave station?  Will &ldquo;time&rdquo; be sold to any other country or will he utilise it for the second programme?  I hope the staff of the station will get every support that can possibly be given to them.  With the limited money which he has at his disposal the Minister should take a freer hand.  He will have the co-operation of all Parties, and I hope he will be able to fight the Department of Finance and convert his colleagues to the necessity of having broadcasting in this country free from any political or Government interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one matter on which I can congratulate the Minister.  We have heard very often from Ministers about what collective responsibility in Government means.  I congratulate the Minister on the <Col N="967" /> collective responsibility with regard to one thing, and that is his hint about an increased charge for licences.  If collective responsibility means anything to the Ministers of the various Departments it is in connection with an increase of revenue of one kind or another.  It is for that and that alone that I have to congratulate the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is one item on the Radio Éireann programme of which I have not a hard word to say and that is what is called &ldquo;The Week in Leinster House&rdquo;.  In my opinion, that is very fair.  It gives a very honest account of what happens and a fair crack of the whip to all Deputies.  That is the one item that I can refer to here in what I would call a happy mood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke for about an hour and ten minutes, the greatest length of time for the reading of a statement by any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I ever heard in this House.  In it he discussed what he found out during the time he was abroad.  As regards Radio Éireann, he spoke about our plays and our music, Irish settings and Irish characters.  He referred to Radio Éireann as satisfying our own people. He spoke about native talent, and so on.  I want to tell the Minister something he and the officials of his Department will not like, and it is this: Many of those dramatic and musical productions foisted on the public by Radio Éireann have reached an all-time low level in my opinion.  They betray an equally low level of intelligence and lack of decency and common sense in the people who allow such productions to go over Radio Éireann.  As regards being educational or entertaining, Radio Éireann is neither one nor the other.  On the dramatic side plays are broadcast from time to time over Radio Éireann that belittle the Irish people, our manners and our intelligence. Not so long ago&mdash;I could give you the date; I will not name the play &mdash;a play was broadcast with special reference to our Garda force which brought them down to the level of &ldquo;the Peeler and the Goat&rdquo;.  Within the last ten days I listened to a play being broadcast which referred to the home-made bread and home-made cake, and <Col N="968" /> to the landlady pressing the guests to eat more of it; it portrayed how one of the guests kept dumping the bread under the table to the dog, and how the landlady praised him for all he eat.  Later on he found the dog did not eat it, and he had to eat it himself. I wonder whom all that fun is for.</P>
    <P>It may be fun to the Minister, to his officials and the people responsible for it in Radio Éireann.  It is no fun to the Irish people.  If foreigners listen to that stuff they get the impression that we are inhuman, that we are a savage people who will eat the leavings of the dog.  When the Minister was abroad I wonder did he hear comments on those things?  In my time out foreign I heard those comments. Foreigners believe we are that class of people.  It may be all right for Deputy Cogan to laugh but I do not see any amusement in that class of thing.  No other people would allow a mockery to be made of their citizens or to be made a laughing stock of as Radio Éireann allows it to be done to our people.  It is my opinion that we would be better off without a Radio Éireann than to allow it to be making a mockery of our people in that way. I intend to oppose that kind of thing in every way I can.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to the satisfying of our people.  I wonder if doing the stage Irishman satisfies our people?  I wonder is that the Irish setting to which he refers?  Is that the Irish character to which he refers?  Is there any Deputy on either side of the House who would agree that before the eyes of foreigners we should be set up as people of that description?  He referred to radio as more important than the daily Press. If it is, he and the officials of his Department have quite a lot to answer for in allowing stuff of that description to go over the air to be listened to by foreigners who honestly believe that we are the type of people that Radio Éireann makes out we are.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that that class of presentation will continue.  I have no doubt that the Minister will not prevent it.  I do not believe either that he or his officials or the people responsible <Col N="969" /> for it will prevent it until such time as they are compelled by this House to do so.  I would ask the Minister to say when he is replying whether he is aware that such stuff is carried on. Does he listen in to the programmes? Is he aware of such so-called fun and amusement?  Where is the fun and at whose expense is the fun&mdash;at the expense of our own people?  It is no fun for them.  It may be fun for the foreigner but it is a bad day that an institution of our Government presents stuff like that to poke fun at our own people for the amusement of foreigners.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his statement that we want entertainment for foreigners.  I suppose the entertainment is the class of entertainment to which I referred.  I want him, when he is replying, to tell me and to tell this House: will that kind of entertainment be stopped?  Is any more of that going to be allowed through Radio Éireann? If it is, the sooner Radio Éireann is abolished along with the new council and the old one, the better for this country.</P>
    <P>As regards the musical side, that is only a jazz band in my opinion.  It is neither entertainment nor anything else.  There is no other point I wish to raise but I will watch closely; I will wait for the Minister's reply and I ask him to be definite on behalf of his Department that no more of that dope, the stage Irishman, the pig in the parlour, <i>The Peeler and the Goat,</i> the Irishman eating the bread left by the dog, will be presented on Radio Éireann.  I want the Minister to state that that will be prevented and that our people will not be held up as a mockery so that foreigners can have fun at the expense of our people through programmes put over the air by the authority of a Parliament that is supposed to represent the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that we are going to have a new council to manage the affairs of Radio Éireann and broadcasting generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood from the Minister that the comhairle would be in charge of its own affairs very largely and would not be directly answerable to the <Col N="970" /> Minister.  There was some doubt on that.  No Deputy would like to see a body set up which would be entirely independent of this House.  We have had experience of bodies of which we wish we had a little more control.  It is necessary that the body should be under the control of the Minister but it is very welcome news that the broadcasting system is about to be given a freedom to manage its own affairs that it has never had. That should mean that a new outlook will prevail in broadcasting circles.  I think the Minister is to be commended in that respect.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister give his support in the House to the question of the provision of a concert and assembly hall.  That is a matter with which I am very deeply concerned. I should like to say to those members of the House who might wonder what precisely a concert and assembly hall has to do with broadcasting generally that one of the things which an orchestra or those who put on plays need is an audience.  The presence of an audience means that the orchestra and players do much better work.</P>
    <P>If we had in Dublin a first-class concert hall, public concerts could be given on every occasion that the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra play. Such a concert hall would be very useful for international congresses or assemblies which might be held in Dublin.  It is not generally known that certain international assemblies have wished very much to hold congresses in Dublin but have been unable to do so owing to the fact that we have not an assembly hall suitable for their various requirements.  A concert hall would be of tremendous benefit, therefore, to the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the very vexed question of the orchestra.  We are proud of the work which the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and the Light Orchestra are doing.  In the comparatively short period of their existence they have improved their standard very much and that has improved musical standards generally.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there has been a very high standard of pianoforte playing.  Dublin is a well-known centre of first-class <Col N="971" /> piano technique.  That high standard of technique, which is very well known and established throughout these islands and further afield, did not come about accidentally.  It came about through the genius and devotion of one man who came to Dublin in the nineteenth century.  He devoted his life to raising the standard of playing of his pupils.  That had repercussions throughout the country and, as a result, the Irish school of pianoforte playing gained a very high reputation.</P>
    <P>In my opinion we are one of the most musically gifted races in the world. We may possibly be the most gifted. We certainly have amongst our people very, very musically gifted persons. Our people were receptive of the first-class training which was made available. Up to that point, Ireland had not been famous in any way for pianoforte playing and was on a par only with the British Isles, which had not any standard worth speaking of during the nineteenth century.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our symphony orchestra and light orchestra composed entirely of Irish people.  It is a tragic thing that a married man should be dismissed from the orchestra. I have only heard that mentioned here. I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and I will be interested to hear from the Minister the facts of some of these cases.</P>
    <P>We have never had in Dublin the same standard in the teaching of string and other instruments as we have had the good fortune to have in the case of the pianoforte.  We have had, of course, many highly gifted teachers of singing, although we have not been a centre of singing comparable with Milan or other Italian centres. Deputies want Irish people to be employed in our Irish orchestra, but they also want the standard of playing of our orchestra elevated to the highest international level.  I feel very strongly on that matter, because I have faith in the musical genius of our Irish people.  I do not say that to court popularity.  I say it as one who has been associated with music and the musical people of Dublin all my life. We should try to create in Dublin the <Col N="972" /> atmosphere in which musical genius can flourish.  If that is done we will produce instrumentalists who will enhance the reputation of our country.</P>
    <P>This country has produced great singers, despite a lack of facilities for instruction.  Owing to the historical circumstances of this country our people have not had the opportunities of getting musical training, or indeed in many cases the ordinary musical voice teaching, yet in spite of that we have produced an amazing number of world beaters.  We have produced John McCormack and Margaret Burke Sheridan&mdash;those are just two of the names that come to my mind&mdash;people whose musical genius has been known and apparent to everybody in the musical world.</P>
    <P>I want to see our musical people given opportunities in and through the radio orchestra to develop the genius which I know they have and which every musical person knows they have. On the one hand, we do not want to see Irish people put off an orchestra. I think that is something that is very sad and something that no Deputy in this House could stand over.  At the same time, I am sure every Deputy wants to see the Radio Symphony Orchestra at least as good as the Hallé Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra or the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  I might say, in that connection, that the American orchestras are staffed entirely by foreign musicians.  I am not saying that in favour of our staffing with foreign musicians, but it is a fact. Everyone here wants to see our orchestras second to none in the world. We can do that by bringing in foreign teachers.  The teaching of music, and indeed of ensemble playing, is a very difficult and exacting profession.  There are certain people who can be trained or who have the natural genius to succeed as solo players, but they may not have the same ability or technical skill to succeed in the difficult ensemble playing which is necessary in a great orchestra.  I am sure it would be the wish of this House to see that we have the maximum number of Irish musicians employed in our Irish orchestras and that we are working towards the goal of a 100 per cent. <Col N="973" /> Irish orchestra staffed by Irish musicians.  At the same time, we want to see our people trained so that they can produce this innate Irish musical genius and show it off to advantage, as I believe it will if it gets half a chance.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to give our Irish people the opportunity of having first-class teachers.  That is the ambition I would hold before the Minister and his advisers in connection with the Radio Symphony Orchestra.  I trust that the House will agree with me on that.  One or two speakers talked about the orchestra as if its standard did not matter.  Its standard does matter very much.  It is one of the things on which Ireland is judged and our culture and our attitude towards the things of the mind are judged.  I trust that the Minister will settle the differences with the Irish people in the orchestra.  I want to see him training our people in music, as we have now got an opportunity of producing musicians in a way that we have never had before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to intervene briefly in the debate on this Estimate to make a few remarks in reference to broadcasting generally.  I am not going to voice a personal opinion as to the type of programme I would like, as we have been hearing personal opinions too often here on this subject.  I congratulate the Minister on having established this body which will take care of broadcasting in the future.  The members comprising it are not men with a one-track mind.  It is important that they should have divergent views on broadcasting, since the important point with regard to our programmes by and large is that they should be varied.  No section of the community has any right to impose its will on the broadcasting authorities to dominate the programmes throughout the year.  Every section has its own interests which should be catered for and I feel that the body which the Minister now proposes will take full cognisance of that important feature. I hope they will not be like many of the speakers we have heard here, that they will not take purely a Dublin outlook on Radio Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> We must remember that radio has brought to the lonely homes on the hillsides and in the backward counties a means by which the people can entertain themselves in the long, lonely, dreary nights.  The people who are compelled to remain in those areas &mdash;from which many are fleeing every year&mdash;are entitled to get more than their share of the type of programme which will entertain them and for which they are clamouring from Radio Éireann.  While a great many listeners live in the City of Dublin, it would be a grave mistake for Radio Éireann to cater largely for the city listener alone.  The bias should be on the type of programme which the rural listener would like.  I submit that too much of the high-brow stuff is not desired by the people in rural Ireland. I am not pretending to be competent to judge these programmes but I certainly know that a very large section of the listening public who like and prefer the traditional music feel that they do not get sufficient of that type of programme.  I suggest that no particular section should be allowed to enforce their will so as to get entirely the type of programme they desire.</P>
    <P>One speaker thought that our sponsored programmes were a disgrace. Others seemed to think that they were quite interesting.  Personally, I think that the sponsored programme is one that is, perhaps, turned on more often than any other programme by the housewife.  I do not think they should be discouraged.  In fact, I think they provide a great deal of entertainment at a time when it is most needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not mention any names but at least it introduces a lot of variety and gives a variation to the sponsored programme.  The first <Col N="975" /> speaker on the Opposition Benches was dissatisfied that the Minister had given complete authority to this body to control Radio Éireann.  That is the important point in this discussion.  It would be a mistake if the Minister did not maintain some control over that body.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Donnellan decrying some of the plays that were produced recently.  He maintained that they were of the stage Irishman type and a disgrace to Radio Éireann and to the people who were responsible for them. If we are to have control over that sort of thing, then it is not advisable that we should hand over to an independent body statutory rights and complete control of Radio Éireann without giving the Minister the authority to control the programmes which are prepared by them.  What other means of redress would we have if such programmes were &ldquo;dished up&rdquo; daily by a body over whom we would have no control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We could sack them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have to sack one every day.  It is essential that the Minister should maintain some control, as he has, over the present body to ensure that this House will at all times be able to intervene if and when it thinks that broadcasting is not being suitably produced for the majority of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>There is one other little matter which I have always thought militated against the chances of people living far away from Dublin, the amount paid for talent.  The amount paid particular artists was never sufficient to induce that type of artist who lived at a distance from Dublin to come up occasionally to take part, if they were permitted, in any of the broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees paid on such occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;usually work out in such a way that the particular artist who travels from Donegal, Sligo or Cork is out of pocket by the time he <Col N="976" /> returns home.  That is not an inducement to talent living in those decentralised places.</P>
      <P>I think there are two ways in which that could be remedied.  One way, of course, would be to increase the fees.  I think they have been increased during the last year, but they are still very inadequate.  The other remedy would be to have more relayed programmes from the provinces, which would enable the local talent to take part in the local hall, and in that way give the listening public a chance of hearing the talent available in the different areas.  The system of having relayed concerts from the provincial centres should be encouraged, and the fees paid to individual artistes from outside areas should be increased.</P>
      <P>The number of persons who listen to wireless programmes in the rural areas is not, I understand, in proportion to the number of city listeners.  It is a rather small proportion of the total. That should not in any way be taken into account in the arrangement of programmes.  Many of those who listen in the city would be quite satisfied to hear programmes that would have a rural bias.</P>
      <P>I think that the body now taking over control of broadcasting should ensure that there is a rural bias and that a type of programme which is appreciated by those people in the outlying areas, particularly in the rural areas, should be specially provided. The bias, as I have said, should be on that type of programme.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister upon setting up this body.  I believe that he is perfectly correct in maintaining control of it.  If he had established it as a statutory body with absolute control of broadcasting, I think we would have had very much comment as to the personnel of the body and a great deal of criticism would be expressed one way or another with regard to the likelihood of there being bias towards one particular section or another.</P>
      <P>With regard to political broadcasts I always felt&mdash;I am only expressing a personal view&mdash;that during the days of the Coalition Government the Ministers and speakers of that Government got more than their due.</P>

He made some reference to the political bias likely to be operated by the authorities.  Having said that much, I hope that the body now being appointed will exercise its control impartially having due regard to all political sections.  As I said at the outset, I hope they will not be a one-track mind body, that they will cater for a variety of people and not for any particular section that might try to enforce its will in regard to what they believe.  If they like a particular type of programme it should not follow that everybody else should be made listen to that particular type of programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to intervene in this debate for a brief period in order to bring to the notice of the Minister a few matters in which I am very keenly interested.  At the outset, I believe that it is only fair to say that the general public have a very high appreciation of the work of Radio Éireann.  As mentioned by Deputy Brennan, in so far as the rural and more isolated districts are concerned, Radio Éireann is the only source of entertainment for many people residing in those places.  It would be very difficult for Radio Éireann or any concern similar to it to devise a system and draw up programmes that would please everybody, and I feel sure that if there were 1,000 different programmes not everybody would be pleased.  I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister and his officials with regard to devising a system which will be pleasing to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have addressed themselves to this question of music, and Deputy Everett mentioned that, in Radio Éireann, we have a number of foreign musicians employed.  I cannot see the necessity for employing any foreign musicians because, so far as the people of Cork and, I am sure, of <Col N="978" /> the country, are concerned, they have much more faith in and appreciation of Irish music than any foreign music. I believe we have sufficient Irish artists to cater for the musical needs of the Irish people, and I should like to see included in programmes for the future much more Irish music than has been included in the past.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I addressed a question to the Minister, a question of somewhat local interest, with regard to interference with reception in West Cork.  The Minister referred to it in his opening remarks and, in his answer to that question, he mentioned that interference was more prevalent in West Cork than in any other part of the country.  He assigned a number of reasons for it, but I am of opinion that the Minister has not taken the steps which I believe he should have taken to remedy the grievance of the people of that area or any other area where such interference exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there were something like 1,000 complaints from the country in general, but I can tell him, so far as reception in West Cork is concerned, he could find 1,000 people there with that complaint.  I ask him now to see to it, because it is his bounden duty to give to the people in areas where reception is not what it should be every opportunity of getting proper reception.</P>
    <P>The second matter I want to refer to is a matter in which I have a very special interest&mdash;the inclusion in the weekly sports review of a commentary on bowl-playing matches.  Bowl-playing is one of the oldest and manliest of Irish games.  It is the traditional game of the people in Cork County, a game which has been played there for generations back.  No one seems to know how it originated or when, but when we have commentaries on every other type and form of sport, many of them completely foreign in origin, it is entirely out of place that a game which is 100 per cent.  Irish and patronised by almost every person in County Cork and to a limited extent by people in every county in Ireland, should not get what it is entitled to, a weekly commentary from Radio Éireann, the same as other games.  So far as the submission of details <Col N="979" /> regarding bowling matches is concerned, I believe he will have little or no difficulty in getting the full facts with regard to them and I hope that in the not too far distant future, along with having bowl-playing on the roads in County Cork, we will have it on the air from Radio Éireann as well.</P>

      <P>Cork is no unimportant part of Ireland, and without Cork Ireland would not be what it is. I am quite serious in this matter because it is a matter which was brought to my notice by various sportsmen, not only in my own constituency and in South Cork but in Deputy Keane's constituency of East Cork and in the Cork City area&mdash;the complaint that this game should be completely isolated, not only from the bulk of the Press of the country but from Radio Éireann as well.</P>
      <P>I hope that, as a result of my intervention in the debate, the Minister will take much more active steps than he has taken in the past to improve matters for the many radio owners in West Cork who complain with regard to interference with reception and, secondly, to remedy the long-standing grievance of the bowl-playing public of County Cork in regard to giving this manly Irish game the recognition which it deserves.  I hope also that, as a result of setting up this new body, general improvements to meet the needs of the different sections of the people will be brought about in the radio.  I, for one, can say I am convinced that Radio Éireann is doing the best it possibly can to meet the needs of the Irish people and that it will continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to impress on the Minister what has already been impressed on him by Deputy Murphy. We have a good deal of complaint in West Cork about interference and I <Col N="980" /> should like the Minister to indicate to what extent they have been able to overcome certain engineering and technical difficulties which I know exist. The Minister might be able to tell us in a general way what the prospect is. Any people who have any experience of dealing with radio problems know that difficulties have arisen in connection with wavelengths&mdash;the proximity of wavelengths to each other, overloading of wavelengths and crossing of wavebands; but there is this consistent and persistent claim, particularly in the area which Deputy Murphy and I have the honour to represent, that there is a peculiar type of interference there which at times practically obliterates completely any reception from Radio Éireann.</P>

It is an experiment and I hope it is going to be successful.  If the right personnel are selected and the right view taken by the board, and if there is the co-operation necessary to bring to a harmonious conclusion the efforts of the Minister and the board, we may get an improved scheme of programmes.  It is a very vexed question and a very difficult question for anybody to give a constructive suggestion on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the case has already been effectively made that quite apart from the general hardship which this additional taxation will impose on different sections of the community, it will impose a very special penalty on hackney owners and drivers who render useful service to the community.  These people depend upon the use of cars for their livelihood; they are small people who have been finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet in recent years.  The proposals contained in my amendment provide for a reduction of 25 per cent. in their tax.  I thought that that might be a simpler way of achieving the result which I think many members of the House felt should be achieved.  It would be easier for local authorities in <Col N="982" /> calculating the amount of road tax in respect of hackney cars and taxis to be able to reduce the full amount by 25 per cent. than to go back and find out what the tax would have been were it not for this Financial Resolution. That is the point of view which I adopted.  The amendment provides for a rebate of 25 per cent. in the case of every mechanically propelled vehicle which is used solely or mainly as a taxi or hackney car plying for public service.  I would urge the House to adopt the amendment.  I do not think that its cost would be very significant from the Minister's point of view and it would relieve an additional burden from a section of the community which is already hard pressed.  I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment in a reasonable frame of mind and that he may find it possible to accept it.  By doing so he would meet the wishes of the House as a whole as a great many members on his side share our views on this matter.  I hope therefore that he will be able to indicate that he is in a position to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (h) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) notwithstanding anything contained in this Resolution all owners of mechanically propelled vehicles which are used as agricultural lorries shall not be subject to the increased rates of duty set out in the Resolution.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to seek a measure of relief for agricultural lorry owners.  At the present time, the owner of an agricultural lorry not exceeding two tons is required to pay £25 per annum.  Under the new proposals, the owner of an agricultural lorry will be required to pay not less than £46 per annum and probably much more.  I have already spoken regarding this matter in the course of the debate and consequently I do not intend to enlarge on it now.  I want to hear whether the Minister is prepared to accept this amendment.  Proportionately speaking in relation to the lighter vehicles, this impost upon the users of agricultural lorries is heavier than the impost on the other sections of the community who are using light vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have heard from the Deputy who moved this amendment some cases of which he has experience in which this proposal would inflict a hardship on any farmer.  I looked at the figures. They show that there are 747 such vehicles in the country.  I looked around to ascertain the way they were distributed.  I thought that many of <Col N="985" /> them might have been used for the haulage of milk to creameries and I expected to find the largest number of such vehicles registered in the milk-producing areas.  To my surprise, however, that was not the case.</P>
      <P>Of the 747 vehicles classed as agricultural vehicles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 310 or 320 were registered in Dublin, about 100 in County Meath and a fairly large number in Westmeath.  In fact, the great majority of these vehicles were registered within a few counties.  In the areas in which I expected to find that such vehicles would have been taxed, such as Limerick, the number was as low as three or four.  I came to the conclusion that these were not, in fact, agricultural vehicles in the sense of being owned and operated by people who were engaged solely in agriculture.  I came to the conclusion there was no good reason why they should have a special rate of tax.  I know a few of these vehicles myself; I know people who own them, and I think it would be completely inaccurate to suggest that they were vehicles entitled to a special rate of duty from the point of view of being owned and operated by those who were solely concerned with the pursuit of agriculture as a livelihood.  For that reason, I decided this concession, which to my mind was abused, should be withdrawn and that these vehicles should pay the same rate of duty as other vehicles, having regard to their capacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House, or has he any information as to what these vehicles are primarily used for?  Are they used by market gardeners or for bringing liquid milk to the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To tell you the truth, I had some difficulty in discovering what they were used for.  A number of them were used to my own knowledge for purposes that certainly would not qualify them for exceptional treatment on the grounds that they were used for agricultural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister in his investigations find that quite a number of them were used for conveying <Col N="986" /> vegetables and garden produce to the markets in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in Rush alone, an area in which the holdings are practically all small, there are over 100 agricultural lorries taxed.  I think the Minister's statistics will show that these lorries are used for the purpose of bringing vegetables and farm produce to the city.  They are not used for the haulage of ordinary commodities. Many of them are used as milk lorries by farmers carrying their own goods.  If there are 300 such agricultural lorries in this county, he knows himself the heavy burden that will be imposed on the owners of these lorries which are bringing quite a large proportion of the food supplies of the city to the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this to the Minister. The number of these licences is relatively small.  I suggest that the concession is availed of by a limited portion of the agricultural industry. I think the figures the Minister himself has given would suggest to the House that this concession is mainly of value to two categories of persons in the agricultural industry&mdash;the market gardener and the purveyor of liquid milk to the city consumer.  I always understood that it was the desire of every Party in this House to sustain the farmer who was working for himself.</P>
      <P>If there is any category of farmers in Ireland who are manifestly operating on very small acreages, who by intensive cultivation are working for themselves, and who are notoriously amongst the most industrious residents on the land of this country, it is the North County Dublin market gardeners.  Market gardening is one of the most highly-skilled branches of agriculture.  It is one of the branches of agriculture which require a degree of personal attention and hard work which must often baffle those who are not accustomed to the kind of life these people in North County Dublin have worked out for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this must be borne in mind. This industry, I do not think, has ever <Col N="987" /> produced millionaires on the north coast of County Dublin.  These market gardeners are all small men.  Does this House advert to the fact that by altering the taxation on their lorries, Dáil Éireann does to these men one of two things?  We levy upon them for evermore a tax of 10/- per week or we say to them: &ldquo;Having shaken yourself from the obligation of starting out at midnight with horse and cart, as your father and your grandfather did, to walk into the Dublin market, we now require you to go back to the practice of walking the roads of County Dublin,&rdquo; as we saw them do 20 or 25 years ago, with horse and cart, from midnight until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, in order to reach the Dublin market.  Do we in this House for the sake of the revenue it may involve, consider it equitable to go to a limited number of market gardeners in North County Dublin and tell them: &ldquo;Either you will pay hereafter in perpetuity a heavier tax than Dáil Éireann proposes to levy on any other body of people in Ireland in your circumstances, or you will go back to the kind of life your father or grandfather had perforce to live in order to exist at all&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>How often must I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the doctrine that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs is all very well, provided you are not the egg?  I do not think that if this matter was reviewed calmly in this House there are six Deputies here who would deliberately vote to put a tax of 10/- per week on a body of small farmers of this kind, with the alternative that they can avoid this tax by giving up the practice of leaving home an hour before the market, as they now can by the use of motor transport, or of reconciling themselves to walking all night, with one of the family taking his turn as night walker for a week or a fortnight until some other member of the family relieves him of that chore.  Is there any Deputy who thinks that it is desirable to force back on people who have escaped from it that mode of life again?</P>
    <P>We pass legislation here to prohibit night baking. to provide compulsory <Col N="988" /> half-holidays for agricultural workers, to compel shops to close at a certain hour lest the employees in them should be required to work unduly long hours but, quite casually, we say to a small body of men who are rearing families on small holdings, &ldquo;in your case we are not going to legislate to prevent you working long hours; we are going to give you this attractive alternative of working all night or of paying 10/- a week for the rest of your days to escape it&rdquo;.  If that were done in the old days by the British House of Commons, I think that the story of such an iniquity perpetrated against our people would have gone round the world; but here we do it casually, without thinking or caring what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The market gardeners in North County Dublin are never going to bring much grist to my political mill.  I am not even acquainted with a single one of them, but I thought that I shared with the present Minister for Local Government at least some solicitude for the agricultural community, whether they were our neighbours or whether or not they belonged to another branch of agriculture in another part of the country.  I expected that the present Minister for Local Government would react <i>prima facie</i> at least in favour of those people, and that he would insist on a very strong case being made to him for withdrawing this concession from a section of the agricultural community before he would bring in a proposal of this kind to the House.</P>
    <P>I do not know who owns the agricultural lorries which are not operated by the market gardeners.  I presume a considerable number of them are used by milk farmers around the County and City of Dublin to carry the milk into wholesalers, though I am aware that a great many wholesalers go out and collect the milk themselves.  I think that the Minister might with perfect propriety have told us, in so far as he had been informed, what he believed the bulk of the lorries were being used for.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point to Deputy Burke who represents North County Dublin.  He usually talks here like a roaring lion on anything that <Col N="989" /> transpires in any part of the country. I feel like asking to have the bells rung to bring him in.  But Deputy Burke knows North County Dublin, although he is a Mayo man himself. He is a charitable kind of man, and I want to ask him, does he think that the neighbours amongst whom he is now living should, in their circumstances, be presented by this House with the alternative of paying 10/- a week or of walking the roads of County Dublin from 12 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock the following morning every day of the week?  Surely, the Minister will agree with me that a case has been made which requires consideration.  I should like the Minister to tell us&mdash;he is a small farmer himself and understands the circumstances of small farmers and how hard it is on market gardeners who live on small holdings&mdash;how he reconciles it with his conscience to ask this House to do what he admits he is now doing, and that is to withdraw from those people a concession which they have enjoyed for a long number of years.  I think there is a case there to be met by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving my support to this amendment I want to say that it was only during the period in office of the inter-Party Government that I came to know exactly how a number of small farmers in the north part of County Dublin live.  These small farmers consider themselves well off if they have five acres of land, and by sheer hard work and thirft they are able to make a living for themselves. I would imagine that they own the greater number of the lorries to which the Minister has referred.  Perhaps five or ten of the 380 lorries referred to may be owned by milk vendors.  I want to tell the House that, in my experience, these people have been asking the Department of Lands to increase the amount of land they hold so as to enable them to increase their output. During the last 15 or 20 years they have got rid of their horses.  The crops which they would require to produce to feed their horses are now being made available for human consumption for the benefit of the people of this city. The Minister may not be aware that, under this proposal, he is hitting at <Col N="990" /> the most thrifty and hardworking section of the farming community in this country.  That is what the rejection of Deputy Rooney's amendment will mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say that before I made this decision I went into this question as fully as it was possible for me to go.  I think Deputy Dillon was right in accusing me of the likelihood of taking, in relation to the agricultural industry and those engaged in it, a fairly lenient view if I were satisfied that the concession was not being abused.  I approached the matter in that frame of mind, and decided that this concession was being abused.  It is all right to talk about the market gardener as if he were the only type of person likely to take advantage of this concession.  Any man engaged in any business in any part of the country, who was the owner of a piece of land could, and in fact, did take advantage of this particular concession.</P>
      <P>I happened to meet a man, a businessman, after the publication of the White Paper.  He said to me: &ldquo;Does that mean so-and-so?&rdquo;&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; I said.  I asked him: &ldquo;Are you one of those people who took advantage of it?&rdquo;  He laughed and said: &ldquo;Yes, I have been enjoying the concession for 25 years.&rdquo;  I said to him: &ldquo;Well, it is going to end now as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot complain; I have had a fairly good spell.&rdquo; I have a fair suspicion that the number or percentage of the 800 odd people who took advantage of that concession were people of that class.  You start off and you make these concessions.  The only result is, there may be cases where one would like to let it stand if one could be sure that it would not be abused.  When one comes to consider the small amount of difference it will make to the market gardener, it would clearly not be worth the risk.  The rate of duty on the type of vehicle used by the market gardener&mdash;that is, the two-ton truck&mdash;was £25; henceforth it will start at £30 with an increase of £4 per quarter.</P>

I do not believe that what I am proposing here will have the results Deputy Dillon anticipates when he talks about what our grandfathers and their grandfathers before them did driving along the roads at night bringing produce to the city in horses and carts.</P>

I came to the conclusion that these vehicles are being used in the main by a certain section of the community and, in my view, that section is not entitled to describe itself as agricultural in the sense in which it was intended the concession should apply.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister meet us to this extent: where he knows that abuse has crept in would he retain the concession where the owner of the vehicle can <i>bona fide</i> satisfy the Department that he is <i>bona fide</i> entitled to the concession?</P>

      <P>I am asked to make all these stipulations.  If the hardship were to be extreme and if the <Col N="992" /> additional tax were to mean real hardship in any particular case, then I might be urged along these lines. There is nothing in these proposals that will inflict any hardship sufficient to warrant my making any reservations. In every case in which reservations are made abuses are bound to creep in.  In addition to that we have aimed at securing a certain sum of money and everything adds up.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to assure the House and Deputy Dillon, who has expressed the view quite correctly that I should, even as Minister for Local Government, have some regard to my background and to the knowledge that I have of the people who are engaged in agriculture whether as market gardeners in Rush, County Dublin, or milk producers in Limerick.  It was exactly that I had before my mind when I came to examine this matter, and I concluded that for the little hardship it would mean to a very small number and the little additional cost it would impose it would not be fair or right that such a wide range of interests should get away with this special concession.  I must ask the House to accept the genuineness of my approach and to say that I could not accede to the suggestion made by Deputy Collins to amend the proposal in the manner indicated.</P>

      <P>In that part of the Resolution dealing with agricultural tractors the tractor owner who now has to pay £8 tax and who hitherto has been paying £6 must satisfy the authorities that he is living solely on agriculture.  Could the Minister not adopt that principle here and make it applicable to the market gardeners and the small farmers for whom the lorry is an essential part of their livelihood? That method would cut out any abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That method is not part of this code and the Deputy is aware that that method has created a good deal of confusion in the courts and everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am asking the Minister to do is to adopt the same wording as appears in Resolution No. 2 dealing with the £6 tractor, because <Col N="993" /> before the £6 will be accepted the owner must satisfy the authorities that he is living solely on and from agriculture and that any increase would inflict grave hardship on a very deserving class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The lorry is not in the true sense of the word an indispensable part of the man's living because the fact is that he can live and did live on the horse and cart basis.  I think it is very wrong of Oireachtas Éireann deliberately to shove people who are getting their living out of the land down to a lower standard of living from which they, by their own exertions, have escaped in this generation.  Surely it is a good thing and something of which we should be glad that the market gardeners supplying the City of Dublin can now live a relatively normal life, get up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and have their produce in the market without the necessity of these nocturnal pilgrimages which most of us who lived near Dublin were familiar with in the past.  If one was coming into Dublin at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning, one would meet these men plodding into Dublin with their horses and carts.  Surely it is a cause for rejoicing that they have escaped from that.</P>
      <P>The effect of these proposals will not be to condemn these men to get out of business.  They will not get out of business.  They will go back to the horse and cart.  They will have to, because they will starve if they do not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to do as best they can.  I suggest to the Minister <Col N="994" /> that this is a very harsh thing for the House to do.  They are small men. Their kind of life is probably not familiar to many Deputies here.  Surely the proposal made by Deputy Blowick meets the very objection the Minister appears to have, of the danger of abuses of this concession.  I did not gather from what he said originally that there were people all over the country abusing the concession.  I understood he got his impression from a study of the localities in which these special £25 licences are used, to wit, Dublin, Meath, Westmeath and, I think, Wicklow.  I do not think he can give us any convincing information as to the nature of the abuses he believes existed.</P>
      <P>We are making a case which he is not in a position to counter in respect of the market gardener.  I am afraid he will have recourse to the argument that one cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  I hold it is not right to do this.  Each one of these men has struggled from the position of having to compel one of his family to walk the roads at night in order to move into the position in which he can live normally like the rest of us.  By our action here we now propose to force him back again.  I think that is very wrong.  It is the kind of injustice every Parliament is prone to do simply because it is powerful. We can avoid doing this injustice.  If we do not avoid it, it is because we are too lazy to face it and to leave the purpose of the Minister's Resolution substantially untouched while inserting in it a saver which would protect a very small group of persons from what will be a very real hardship for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved to report progress I had been impressing upon the Minister the problem of interference in the area that I represent.  I had endeavoured also to tackle the question of a radio programme. It is as yet too early to gauge whether or not the formation of the new board will be a success.</P>
      <P>I certainly wish it success and would like to see the idea bring forth the fruit that the Minister hopes it will.  There is a good deal of common sense in the approach of Deputy Brennan regarding the personnel of the board.  It will be necessary to have people of varied and divergent views on it, in order to get the fullest value from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I would like the Minister, if he has the information, to indicate to us whether his Department has been able to get any popular slant on what is wanted in Radio Éireann programmes. We have the vexed question of the extent to which we can use the radio for the propagation of our language and popularisation of our native and traditional music.  I subscribe to the idea that to make our station distinctive it is necessary to have a strong flavour of the Irish language and an equally strong flavour of the Irish musical tradition.  I am not a person who would advocate the exclusion of other interests in an unreasonable way. Where we wish emphatically to develop a consciousness of our own significance and individual culture, the medium of our radio station must be of considerable import.  It might be well for the Minister to have that particular angle thoroughly investigated.  Naturally, there are people who feel that the programmes are not Irish enough, while there are some people who put forward the view that there is too much Irish and too much of the traditional aspect about the station.  I would like the Minister to ensure that when an arrangement has been arrived at as to the extent to which the time will be used for the benefit of the language or the popularisation of traditional Irish music, that time will be used to best possible advantage to forward the revival of the language and the music.</P>
    <P>I would like to ensure that we get the very best type of artist.  That inevitably leads to the question that unless adequate remuneration is offered to artists of the best standing they will not come forward.  In particular, whether we are dealing with traditional Irish music and singing or programmes in the Irish language, there should be a premium put, if necessary on the payment of these artists to ensure that we get the very best possible in that sphere.  Otherwise, we are not doing full justice to both the language and the cultural background in it and in Irish music.</P>
    <P>We come, then, to that vexed problem which is causing a good deal of agitation, the question of the rapidly increasing number of foreign <Col N="1002" /> artists&mdash;instrumentalists, in the main&mdash; who are coming into the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra.  I am a great believer in quality in an orchestra, but we must approach this in a rational way and try to equate quality and employment.  Unless the quality is of a unique distinction and of a unique value, it can hardly justify the exclusion of an Irish artist of reasonable standard.  We should not replace him by a foreign artist whose standard and technique, though it may be slightly better, is not of such superiority as to warrant his being described as a specialist.  I know this is a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I know there are certain facets of musical education in which we have shown a tremendously strong national capacity, and that there are other facets, particularly in the string and wind instruments, in which we have not proved ourselves of the same calibre that we have been able to prove ourselves, as suggested by Deputy Dockrell, in the pianoforte exercises. You come back to the problem of where the division line lies.  I know it is a vexed problem, and I am not going to try to make it any more difficult for the Minister. I suggest to him, in all earnestness, that where an Irish artist has to be sacrificed for a foreign artist, to improve the general quality and tone of the orchestra, he should do that type of replacement for the shortest possible period, and in the meantime he should use his good offices to ensure that there will be available teachers to enable those Irish artists to replace the foreign ones.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently intimate with the problem to be able to say whether the Minister has been justified in letting go the number of Irish artists who have gone.  Even conceding that, I would like to hear whether he has been able to make arrangements for qualified teachers to enable any person so displaced to improve his standard, so as to be able to compete to get his position back in that orchestra in the immediate future.  We have fallen into the mistake too often of bringing over foreign experts for various purposes. They come initially with the idea of training Irish personnel in a particular <Col N="1003" /> field, but we ultimately lose sight of that idea and find ourselves ending by the expert becoming a permanent feature.  The Minister should strive, to the best of his ability, while keeping the standard of the orchestra as high as possible, to ensure that, in the very near future, he may put the orchestra on the air with the same standard but composed exclusively of Irish personnel. I can understand the Minister's difficulties and I am not going to press him.  I feel that if the Minister gives the House and, through the House, the country an assurance that this is a transitory period for the orchestra in which he is endeavouring to build up in class, quality and technique Irishmen at home to replace any of the foreigners who have come in he will allay a lot of worry.</P>
    <P>With regard to broadcasting in general, there are features of Radio Éireann which have an infinitely greater appeal than others.  That, I suppose, is inevitable but I would suggest to the Minister that one feature in particular&mdash;that of Question Time upon which I have questioned him in the Dáil and which was of tremend-our popularity&mdash;should be revived.  It created tremendous interest when it became more or less a roving feature that went from area to area.  Many times it was staged in conjunction with concerts for local charitable purposes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It became in itself a tremendously popular feature for the radio listener. The type of competition it led to was much appreciated in the areas in which it was held.  It was a pity to find popular features, which were due to the initiative and effort of people thinking behind the scenes in Radio Éireann, dying out.  I would press the Minister, if I can, to get more and more features of the type of newcomers competitions with a musical content.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is going to increase the cost of our wireless licences.  If he is going to do that I suggest it will make available extra money that can go into small prize funds to encourage latent talent <Col N="1004" /> in the country.  We suffer from one thing in regard to our radio programmes. I think the Minister will agree that we have not been able to get an individualistic Irish programme. It does not matter whether it is Anglo-Irish in the sense that the artists are going to sing songs of an Anglo-Irish nature or play instruments that are not traditionally Irish.  I feel that we have never succeeded in getting that type of fresh, youthful kind of clean talent that one associates with the newcomer and the fledgling.  We have not been able to get that type of programme across in Radio Éireann but it has been a remarkably successful feature of other radio stations.</P>
    <P>Even though we may be limited in many ways in regard to finance in connection with our general radio programme, we have a lot of hidden talent that could be unearthed by way of small, attractive competitions of the nature to which I have referred.  Such competitions would give us freshness and would be of inestimable appeal.</P>
    <P>I am not at all anxious to enter into the controversy as to whether the music is too heavy or too light, whether we should have more symphonies and chamber music or whether there should be a development towards the top twenty tunes of the dance bands.  That is a problem that provides a headache for the Minister's Department.  Where you have universal interest you have a diversity of taste that it is impossible to satisfy and you can only meet the problem on the best possible basis.</P>
    <P>I think we could have a slightly more rural bias in regard to our programmes. We are up against a problem which has become more severe in recent years, the problem of rural depopulation.  There is no doubt but with the advent of present weather conditions the radio has become the centrepiece of the family in rural Ireland during the long evenings.  We could, if the Minister thought fit, lean a bit towards the type of programme that has a significant appeal for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is one type of programme that could be considered by the Minister's new board, a varied type of instruction for the farming community, not of the professorial type but of the informative <Col N="1005" /> kind of fireside chat.  This type of programme could deal with certain fertilisers and certain agricultural machinery that might aid the farmer in his harvesting.  It should feature problems immediately germane to the farmer's own countryside.</P>
    <P>The type of talk I have in mind is not that of a learned gentleman giving volumes of statistical information or endeavouring to state the facts seratim; rather is it the type of talk where the problem is discussed in a way familiar to the Irish farmer.  In it would be discussed the pros and cons of one type of barley as against another, and of one brand of oats as against another.  This should be featured in a simple, conversational way.  It might be of immense value. There is a rapidly growing consciousness in rural Ireland among the farming community that there are new tricks and new grades of grain that can be of considerable advantage to it.  If the Minister could have these matters discussed in an informal way on the radio, he would perform a tremendously valuable service to the community, particularly the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>In general, the Minister and his Department are not making a bad job of running Radio Éireann at all but there are facets that merit our condemnation and criticism at times.  The Minister would do more justice to himself and to his Department if he explained some of the highly technical difficulties and some of the various wavelength and waveband complications over which he has no control and which tend to cause a good deal of disturbance to listeners throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is a particular disappointment that Radio Éireann are not going to branch out into some television effort.  There are a number of people in this country who are trying out television sets.  They are getting mixed and varied receptions, the type of reception that could be vastly improved by any kind of a station at home.  I hope the Minister may be able to indicate to the House that the question of non-entry into the television field is purely of temporary duration, that his <Col N="1006" /> Department are at the exploratory stage in regard to the prospects and possibilities of that particular facet of radio entertainment and that we may in the future look forward to that development.  If we could put across from Ireland, through Radio Éireann, Irish culture, Irish dramatic art at its best and what is the grandest sight of all, young Irish boys and girls dancing Irish dances, there would be nothing more advantageous to the country than television.</P>
    <P>It is too early, as I said, to know whether the Minister's experiment with regard to control of the station will be a success.  I think it is the duty of the House to give it every chance of being a success and to wish the Minister luck in the selection of the personnel of the board.  It is also the duty of the House to give the board an opportunity of doing their job to the best of their ability and to reserve our criticism until such time as criticism is warranted.  I wish them luck. Any improvement in the general scheme of control of our radio station and in the general scheme of our programmes will be more than welcomed by listeners.  I conclude by saying that we feel it our duty to give them every chance to be a success and to offer no adverse criticism until such time as they, by their actions, have merited it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by previous speakers with regard to the employment of Irish musicians in the radio orchestra.  I understand that there are a number of good men, men who have gone through all our schools of music, including the Army School of Music, who feel highly qualified and who are prepared to enter into any test for places in Radio Éireann.  They feel, for some reason or other, that there is a prejudice against them, and the mere fact that they are prepared to undergo any test in competition with anybody from outside shows that they have confidence in themselves.  I ask the Minister to recognise that, in the musicians' union here, there are a number of highly qualified men on the unemployed list who had hoped that they would get employment on their merits&mdash;and not as a favour from anybody&mdash;with the orchestra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> I often wonder why we use the words &ldquo;Radio Éireann&rdquo; and why we do not use the phrase &ldquo;Ireland Calling&rdquo;.  Those people who are in a position to receive our station's programmes would love to hear that phrase, instead of Radio Éireann. That is an old-established name at present, but the use of the phrase &ldquo;Ireland Calling&rdquo;, especially if it is a good programme, would be a way of advertising our country.  I would not suggest any change other than the use of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  Let others call their part of Ireland the name they want to adopt, but we should hold on to that name in everything we do, whether in regard to music, tourist development or cultural programmes of any kind.</P>
    <P>I have no complaint to make about the programmes being broadcast.  I have heard congratulations offered, but at odd times one will hear a grouse by somebody with a fad for a special kind of music.  We recognise, however, that the Minister and his officials have to broadcast programmes to suit all tastes and, on the whole, I think they have succeeded reasonably well. My only complaint is with regard to Irish musicians not getting a fair chance in their own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that, since the inception of radio in our country, great progress has been made, but I suppose we are peculiar in that we are always aiming at improvement and tend to forget the progress we have made.  When we approach our radio broadcasting service, we speak as if it related solely to Irish home users.  We are prone to forget that we have a large number of listeners outside Ireland and one has only to travel a little to find to one's amazement, how many people listen to our radio service, particularly on short-wave broadcasts.  In England, Scotland and Wales, there are large numbers of people whose origins are Irish and who listen regularly, or as often as reception is suitable, to our broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when discussing whatever form of programme broadcast by Radio Éireann, we should have regard <Col N="1008" /> to one thing, that is, quality in every sphere of the station's programmes. Quality should be the keynote of every programme we broadcast.  That involves the personnel and the musical instruments used as well.  We must recognise that, no matter what programme is put over at a particular time, it is not going to receive unanimous approval or acceptance.  One person likes one form of music and another likes another type; one likes a particular type of vocalist, while others like another type.  We should, however, try to please as many as possible and should aim at having quality at all costs.</P>
    <P>There is also a responsibility on the station with regard to the use of records for broadcasting and I want to suggest to the Minister that he might get somebody&mdash;this new body, if you like&mdash;to go over the collection of records in the station and get rid of those that have served their time well and replace them with new records. There is nothing more ugly than to hear a good orchestral piece played from a record that has seen better days.  In the same way, I suggest that great care should be taken with regard to the instruments used, and particularly the piano.  There have been occasions when the piano in Radio Éireann has not been first class, whether due to the fact that it required tuning or was badly placed from the point of view of being properly broadcast.  The greatest care should be exercised to see that the instruments are so placed near the microphone as to ensure good quality and these instruments should be constantly under observation, the same as human beings who have to appear before the public.</P>
    <P>When we come to news I would suggest that the Minister might consider a new form of editing.  We have news over Radio Éireann which mainly concerns our own people here and it should be diffused in a manner which would present to them its real meaning.  We also have news, however, which we wish the rest of the world to hear.  That news should be edited in a manner by which according to the best judges it would be properly <Col N="1009" /> understood by those abroad who, we wish, will listen to it.  Again we should relate news from abroad in a factual manner without a slant or propaganda attaching to it.  I have heard from time to time news over our radio with words used which could have been changed. I have heard news about disturbances abroad&mdash;matters we may not know much about&mdash;which reminded me of the time when news about Ireland was broadcast to the world and colleagues of mine like Deputy General MacEoin were described as &ldquo;would be assassins.&rdquo; We must be careful when we are giving news about events abroad rot to put a slant or propaganda on it. We should just give the facts.</P>
    <P>Continuous attention should be given to complaints of interference with reception.  The matter was raised here over a period of years and I must say that the Department did go to great trouble to investigate the causes of interference and find means of removing it.  Somebody should be specifically appointed to keep a continuous watch that it will not grow up again and that machinery or plant will not be used with a complete disregard for the interference caused to listeners in the immediate neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the possibility&mdash;I know it is a question of money&mdash;of giving us more broadcasting time.  It is sometimes awkward that our station turns off at, say, 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 5.30 or 6 o'clock.  He should consider whether our station could not ultimately develop more broadcasting time without this blank spot in between.</P>
    <P>There is another manner in which our station could be used.  Deputy Collins might have had it in mind though he did not utter the idea.  Our station is of immense value as an instrument to attract tourists.  The tourist development bodies might be able to co-operate with Radio Éireann and some time might be made available for programmes to attract tourists.  In this connection, of course, a short-wave station would be of immense importance and I hope that it will be considered.</P>
    <P>An announcement should be made <Col N="1010" /> from Radio Éireann inviting listeners to send in suggestions and complaints. Both the person who sends in the suggestion or the complaint and the station should regard this as something among friends, one trying to help the other.  It should not be on the level where a complaint comes in from a person who is bad-tempered and is received by somebody who is equally bad-tempered and benefit to the community does not result.  Listeners should be regarded as friends of the station and the station equally as a friend of the listeners.</P>
    <P>I believe that the service which the station has rendered to the public in broadcasting S.O.S.s cannot be exaggerated or overstated.  They have been a great help to people in trouble or distress and the station deserves credit for the manner in which it has helped the country as a whole in that respect.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to television. I would strongly beg the Minister to go slow.  We are only at the beginning of the development of television. Even if a station could be made available for a certain part of the country it would be very expensive, but more than that, people would have to buy very expensive sets which might be obsolescent in a very short space of time.  It might be better from all angles to wait and go a bit slow on the development of television until we have developed ordinary radio diffusion up to the level we would wish.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister mention that there is likely to be some increase in the charge for licences.  I do not think that the public would complain of a small additional charge if they got additional service.  If we give due attention to the quality of what we send over the air people will not cavil at this small charge which the Minister will, I am sure, deal with in his reply and make more clear than he did just in announcing it.  I have no complaints to make.  I have made these suggestions in good part.  I have made suggestions on other occasions and they have been well received.  I hope that my suggestions this evening, for what they are worth, will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just what I was going to say.  However, lest the Minister should not have made up his mind, there are just a few points which I should like to submit for his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that the people affected by this Bill are, perhaps, the most deserving people in the community and, viewed from the national standpoint, deserving of immediate consideration.  It is the universal complaint that people in remote areas, people living on back roads and particularly people living along the long lanes and boreens that branch off from the back roads, are leaving the country because life for them there has become intolerable.  Surely it is unfair to expect, for example, that a young girl with her life before her should decide to marry a small farmer and live at the end of a long lane a mile or two miles from the road.  This Bill seeks the aid of local authorities with a view to solving the problem of such roads.  There is already in operation a scheme under which residents along a laneway can put that laneway into repair and secure a grant for so doing provided they contribute a portion of the cost.  If their valuation is over a certain figure, the portion of the cost of the repair of the laneway which they are called upon to contribute is fairly substantial, particularly if a costly job is involved and if the laneway is fairly long.  People so affected are often faced with the following difficulty.  The <Col N="1012" /> contribution they must make is fairly substantial.  When the lane is repaired it must be kept in good condition or else it will deteriorate rapidly and then those people who subscribed towards its repair will find that after two, three or four years the road is as badly in need of repair as ever it was.</P>
    <P>If we could even get a decision on this Bill that would allow the county council to come in and maintain such accommodation roads after they have been repaired under a rural improvements scheme, it would be something. I do not think that that would altogether satisfy the proposer of the Bill but I think it would go a long way towards satisfying quite a number of Deputies.  We feel that if a group of people subscribe a substantial amount towards the repair of a laneway leading to their houses, they should have an assurance that the laneway will be kept in a proper state of repair.  It would be a step forward if the county councils were empowered to take over such laneways after they have been repaired under a rural improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made last week was that the county councils should, in certain cases, have the legal right to co-operate in a rural improvements scheme by subscribing a portion of the cost.  We must bear in mind that the circumstances of each particular application for a grant vary greatly.  You may have a comparatively small number of people on a comparatively long stretch of laneway.  I use the word &ldquo;comparatively&rdquo; because the comparison is as between valuation&mdash; the valuations of the applicants and the cost of the work.  If the valuations of the respective applicants are comparatively low and the work is costly, then the contribution they would be called upon to make would be fairly substantial.  If a local authority were permitted in certain cases of hardship to make a special contribution, I think it might ease the situation.  We all realise that county councils, being, in the main, representatives of the ratepayers and responsible to the rate-paying community for their administration, are not very anxious to take on additional obligations.  If this Bill were enacted, I think it would be utilised only to a <Col N="1013" /> limited extent in many counties, but it might be utilised to relieve cases of extreme hardship, and that, I think, would be its main justification.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to a legal problem.  A number of cul-de-sac roads are being maintained at present, because they were being maintained prior to the enactment of the Local Government Act.  That, in itself, constitutes a certain inequality as between one set of ratepayers and another, and it seems to establish a case for a reconsideration of the whole position.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister looks into this Bill he will find that there is a good deal to be said for its general principle.  I have not the Bill before me at the moment and I am not sure whether its wording meets entirely the case which it is intended to meet. There is a reference in the Bill to a &ldquo;road of general public utility.&rdquo;  There might be a difference of opinion on the interpretation of that expression. There might be some argument as to whether a road leading only to the residences of certain ratepayers is a road of general public utility.  It is a debatable point.  I should be inclined to think that such a road is of general public utility since anybody wishing to call on the residents along that roadway would use it and even a parliamentary candidate might, at election time, have occasion to use it.  Therefore, I think that it would come within the definition of &ldquo;general public utility.&rdquo; I am sure that the Minister will approach this Bill sympathetically, whatever he may decide to do in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook on the last occasion on which this Bill was being debated, to have this whole question examined and to come back and give <Col N="1014" /> the House some idea of what our decision, as a Government, was upon this proposal.  I must confess that, while I have a fair knowledge of the problem of accommodation roads and cul-de-sac roads in a great part of the country, I find some difficulty in understanding what exactly the problem is with which Deputy McQuillan, the mover of this Bill, had to deal.</P>
      <P>A cul-de-sac road in my county would not at all be considered by the county council, unless in very exceptional cases, as a road that should be taken over for repair and maintenance by that body.  We have thousands of miles of such roads.  We have also thousands of miles of accommodation roads that are not cul-de-sac roads, but lead from one road to another, and the maintenance of which is not the responsibility of anybody, other than those who use them.  I find that the law in regard to these two classes of roads under Section 25 of the Local Government Act of 1925 is that the local authority is entitled to take over for repair and maintenance any accommodation road connecting two county roads, which has a minimum width of 11 feet.  That section was inserted by the Seanad in the 1925 Local Government Act.</P>
      <P>Before that provision was inserted in that Act, the law so far as I can discover enabled local bodies&mdash;county councils and others&mdash;to repair any road and take over the maintenance of that road if they were satisfied that its degree of public utility warranted such a decision.  The only reservation or qualification to that power was a review later by the Local Government Auditor as to whether there was, in fact, that degree of public utility that warranted the decision. It seems as if the Roscommon County Council ran into some trouble on that matter and, as Deputy McQuillan stated in moving the Bill, they were surcharged, the surcharge being removed later by the Minister, although in removing it he held that it was lawfully made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking at the figures showing the tendency of local bodies all over the country say in the last 20 years in regard to this whole question.  I find <Col N="1015" /> that between 1931 and 1951, 3,000 additional miles have been added to the road system of the country by county councils of the country.  Of these 3,000 miles, 500 were added in 20 years by the Roscommon County Council. There are some counties, in fact, where there are no additions at all, and there are a great many counties where the mileage added in 20 years was very small.</P>
    <P>Of the 3,000 miles, Roscommon added, as I say, 500, and I think Galway added something in excess of 600. These figures do not seem to suggest that the law, as it stands, is such that there is any great need to clamour for an amendment of it.  After all, if you are able to add 500 miles to the road system of Roscommon with the law as it is, having regard to the fact that this is regarded as the most heavily-roaded country in the world, it is not bad going.  I have, then, considerable doubt in my mind as to the need for an amendment of the law, in view of what it was possible to achieve, under the law as it is, as demonstrated by the two councils I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>However, there are other thoughts that occur to my mind on this subject. I have found that there is always a tendency on the part of county councils, if there is any impediment in their way or if there is any danger that they will run into trouble such as the Roscommon County Council seemed to encounter in regard to the surcharge which I have mentioned, for the members of such bodies to say, when the back-of-the-hill dwellers complain of the condition of the roads: &ldquo;Oh, well, that is the decision of the Department of Local Government.  We would be only too happy to do so-and-so and we, in fact, were doing so-and-so; we were determined to make provision for the repair of an additional road mileage, cul-de-sac and otherwise, if it were not for the fact that the Department of Local Government, the Minister and the agents of the Department, came down on us and prevented us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sometimes, I believe, these charges are levelled against us when the councillors themselves are satisfied that it is not a bad thing to have the protection <Col N="1016" /> and the shelter of the Department, to have, if you like, that overriding approval of the Department which enables them to take a fairly loose line on questions like this in the knowledge that they are subject to review and that if, on review, they are found not to be sensible they are rejected, and rejected without placing the onus on an individual councillor or on councillors as a body.</P>
    <P>I can see the danger that would arise from the acceptance, not maybe of what is in the Bill which Deputy McQuillan has moved, but from what, I think are the ideas which are running through his mind.  It is not my duty to defend here the course that was pursued by previous Ministers for Local Government.  I would remind Deputies that, over a period of 25 years, this is an issue which has been debated not only in this House but down through the country.  I think that Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Local Government when my own council was first surcharged in this regard. I have heard different Ministers make the case, inside and outside this House &mdash;it was a fairly good case and is still a good case&mdash;that we are a heavily roaded country, and that, high and all as the rates are, and generous as Deputy McQuillan would like to be in regard to these accommodation and cul-de-sac roads, in no county are they striking a sufficient rate to maintain even in a reasonable way the roads that are already on the county councils' sheets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has hit the right note now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, what is likely to be the position if the power which is sought here is made use of to any considerable extent?  Some months ago, for some reason or other that I cannot explain now, we were slow in announcing to local bodies the allocations from the Road Fund for this year. We endeavoured to have these allocations notified before the rate was struck, but we did not succeed in all cases.  It is like a dream to me that some members of this House who are members of the Roscommon County Council which, in this year, struck a fairly reasonable rate for road maintenance, <Col N="1017" /> were disappointed because they did not know of the increased grants from the Road Fund.  I interpret that disappointment as meaning that, if they had known of the increased grants, they would not have a rate as high for road maintenance, although the roads, to which their maintenance would be directed would not earn any grants whatever.</P>
      <P>That approach on the part of Deputies, who are members of local bodies, to the road problems of the country is scarcely consistent with the request made here to be given not only wider powers but the unquestioned right to take over any road which the council may decide and make it the responsibility of the council and of the ratepayers for the future.</P>
      <P>In spite of the fears to which I have given expression, I am inclined to take the view that it might perhaps be best to do as Deputy McQuillan has suggested, because I agree with him when he says that the county councils are composed of sensible bodies of men, and that it is scarcely likely they will run, amok if the impediment is removed.  I have explained, as briefly as I could, all that they could do in this regard even with the law as it is. Weighing one thing against another, I have decided to accept the proposition that has been made by Deputy McQuillan: that to whatever extent this local government auditor review affects the carrying out by a council of work of the type which Deputy McQuillan has in mind, and which I am sure other Deputies have experience of, I am prepared to accept the principle that that impediment should be removed.</P>
      <P>This problem, apparently, is not the same in every county.  Deputy McQuillan has endeavoured to provide an instrument that will meet it as he knows it in Roscommon.  I am not even sure whether this instrument, which is now before us, would be adequate for that limited purpose.  I am almost certain that it would not be adequate if applied to the whole country because, as I say, the problem is not the same everywhere.</P>

    <P>There is a Local Government Bill to <Col N="1018" /> be introduced shortly.  I do not think it will be introduced this session, but it certainly will next session.  Between now and then I will have this question further examined.  From what I have seen of it, it is more involved than some would appear to think, but as I say, I will have it further examined by our own people, at the same time giving the assurance that, when this Miscellaneous Bill is introduced it will contain a provision which will apply not only to the type of case which Deputy McQuillan has in mind in regard to Roscommon, but which will provide an instrument giving to local bodies all over the country power to deal with this problem as they see it in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Some of my own advisers have urged upon me that I should endeavour to retain some control.  I am prepared to say now that I have resisted that advice, though I see the danger that can arise.  I see the problems that will arise for local authorities because of the change we are proposing to effect.  It has been submitted that members of local authorities are responsible men.  I believe they are responsible men, and if they undertake this work they must undertake it in the full knowledge that they will have to face their own ratepayers and strike a rate sufficient to enable them to carry out this work.  I am prepared to take a chance and to remove this impediment, leaving local authorities not only in relation to accommodation roads, but also in relation to those they themselves consider should be taken over, repaired and maintained as a county charge to shoulder the responsibility fairly and squarely without reference to me and without any excuse for saying, as they say now when the auditors visit them: &ldquo;Oh, yes.  We would do so and so and such and such if only the Department and the Minister would allow us.&rdquo;  That is my approach to this matter.  I think it is undesirable that we should have a short little Bill like this converted into an Act of Parliament.  I think the whole matter should be more thoroughly examined.  I assure the Deputy that my aim will be to give to local authorities the freedom he and others think they should have.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the additional road mileage in the different counties.  He said he did not think there was any need for this Bill. The Minister is aware that this additional mileage is made up of those roads that the local bodies agreed to take over.  He is also aware that the roads in question are roads connecting two public roads, for otherwise they could not be done.  I do not think these are the roads Deputy McQuillan has in mind.  The Minister may be generous in accepting the Bill as it stands.  I know Deputy McQuillan is sincere and honest.  I know he means well.  I congratulate him on this Bill.</P>
      <P>For three and a half years it was my duty to deal with roads and with officials. Knowing their opinions as to what roads should be done and what roads should not be done I believe that this Bill, without any disrespect to Deputy McQuillan, is not worth the paper it is written on.  The Minister can accept the Bill because it will not do one bit more than what has been done up to this because the Bill has in it the qualification &ldquo;if such road authority is satisfied that the road is of general public utility&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was such a clause in relation to the old rural improvements scheme and the full cost of the grant could be given for a road that was of general public utility.  If I had had a sledgehammer during the years in which I was in control of the Office of Public Works I could not drive into the heads of the officials what general public utility means.  Their idea was that it meant nothing.  As far as this Bill is concerned it will mean the same thing, nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy McQuillan is deceived by the Minister's acceptance of the Bill.  Is the Minister innocently pretending to accept it, knowing well that it means nothing? Will Deputy McQuillan withdraw the Bill in view of the Minister's statement? Will he postpone it until such time as he sees what the Minister intends to do?  The Minister has said that this has been an issue for the last 25 years.  More shame to this House that it has been an issue for that period.  It will be left an issue for all <Col N="1020" /> time if this phrase &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; is left in it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan stated last Friday that everybody in this House mouths pious platitudes; something must be done for the people in the rural areas. The Minister was very sympathetic to-night.  He knows the people in his own County Cavan who live on these culs-de-sac and boreens.  His sympathy went out to them.  Not so long ago, when I brought in a motion whereby smaller contributions would be asked from people with very low valuations, the Minister was one of those who voted against it.  His sympathy was not sincere then.  It is just as sincere now.</P>

      <P>Their sympathy then was not for the people in the boreens and the cul-de-sac roads, and the Minister's sympathy is just the same to-night He can accept this because his officials have told him: &ldquo;It does not matter.  It does not make one bit of difference.  You can accept it.  It will cost us nothing.&rdquo; The Minister laughs, but he knows well that I am telling the truth.  He knows it to be a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Moran saying the other night that it would not be a bad thing, and Deputy Cogan certainly said it would not be a bad thing if the roads done under the minor improvements scheme were kept in repair. The people who contributed to get these done are contributing to all the <Col N="1021" /> public roads.  People who have lived on cul-de-sac roads for years and years have contributed their share to the public highways of this country. Why should they be asked to contribute now for the roads into their own homes?  Why should not a bigger grant be given to them?  Why should not the Department of Local Government give a greater contribution to the local authority for those people who have been left suffering for many years while living on these by-roads, even though they have been contributing towards the public highways?</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Moran was just as sympathetic as the Minister.  He was one of those who marched into the Lobby not long ago and said the people on the cul-de-sac roads must pay their share under the minor employment scheme, that they should pay a larger contribution.  Deputy Cogan said that there were no cul-de-sac roads in Wicklow.  That is very strange.  I have not come across any county in Ireland where there are none.  The Minister's own county has quite a share of them, and so has Galway, as Deputy Killilea can tell you, and so has County Mayo.  Every county has its share of these roads.</P>
    <P>I know quite well that the chief objection to this will be the extra mileage of roads.  There is not a county engineer but will be objecting and saying it is increasing the mileage of roads.  They are the people who do not want this.  The officials of the Department of Local Government have advised the Minister to accept it.  I hope that at a later stage of this Bill when the matter of &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; comes up some Deputy or Deputies will put down an amendment, or that Deputy McQuillan himself will put down an amendment, to make it very plain what they require.  Deputy McQuillan the other night referred to five or six or eight cottages on one of these roads.  My idea is that if there is a road leading into a village or to a house that is used by the people that road should qualify.  If it does not, this Bill will be absolutely of no use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan had some misgivings although he seconded this.  I suppose he was doubtful as to what the Minister <Col N="1022" /> would do in regard to it.  I suppose he felt that if the Minister did not accept it he would have to vote against it.  That was his trouble.  I would ask Deputy McQuillan to make sure that the Minister and his officials will not succeed in leading him astray with regard to what his intention is.  I know the type of roads that he intends should be put under contract and repaired under this Bill.  I know that this affects every Deputy representing a rural constituency in this portion of our country.</P>
    <P>Taking the Minister's assurance that he is acepting this Bill is not going to get Deputy McQuillan one bit further. I hope when this Bill comes up again some Deputy or Deputies will put down an amendment with regard to the words &ldquo;general public utility,&rdquo; because if they are left in the Bill it will be a question of civil servants deciding what &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; means.  So far as they are concerned their position will be what it always was&mdash;that nothing is a general public utility, no matter what road you bring before them, as happened when I was in office for three and a half years.</P>
    <P>Very often Deputies made representations to me to have the full cost of a road given under the rural improvements scheme because it was of general public utility.  When I put it before the officials that such a road was a general public utility the answer was that it was not, that we could not give the full cost.  The same thing will apply to this Bill as it stands.  These same gentlemen will say that a road is not a general public utility.  Except this Bill is amended it will not assist in any way in having one of the roads of the type Deputy McQuillan has in mind kept in repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not one bit surprised at the Minister's technique a moment ago.  Like myself, the Minister is an old county councillor and he knows all the answers with regard to public utility, cul-de-sac and accommodation roads.  I wonder if I am correct in stating that a cul-de-sac road must be 16 feet wide instead of 11 feet under some classification?  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. His gesture, little and all as it is, will <Col N="1023" /> show up the insincerity of a lot of our county councils who undoubtedly slash their road engineer's estimates year after year.  They cut them down to the very minimum.  Under the managerial system, the manager cuts the engineer's estimate and the council cuts the manager's estimate.  How is the Department going to differentiate between the mean councils and the others?  All of them are out for retrenchment at times and some of them come along asking the Department or some other body to do something that is absolutely within their own province.  Deputy McQuillan's case is a good one.  The Minister's statement is very good also.  If he is going to incorporate in this Bill a provision giving full authority to the county councils&mdash;even if it came down in a circular it will be very encouraging for some of us who have from time to time tried to gain acceptance by the county council of the estimates presented by our technical experts.</P>
      <P>I was amazed at the seconder of the motion a moment ago.  He presided at a meeting in the Mansion House two years ago which set up an association called the Ratepayers Protection Association.  I am sure every member here, irrespective of whether he is a member of the county council or not, will appreciate that any work that will be done in this line must come within the province of the Cork County Council, the Roscommon County Council, the Carlow County Council or whatever other county councils do the work and I am afraid that unless Deputy McQuillan is able to prevail on the Minister to do something under his Bill in the line of allowing grants for these particular roads when they are completed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite entitled to suggest something to Deputy McQuillan.  I do not know whether Deputy McQuillan is a member of the Roscommon County Council.  He should realise all those things you have given <Col N="1024" /> him so generously to-night, with one exception, and that is the taking over of the roads when they are satisfactorily done.  Under Section 25 of the Local Government Act if the road is done to the satisfaction of the deputy-county engineer or the county engineer, the county council may take that road over.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon, I have got nothing except what we have at the moment, and if you want gratitude for giving me nothing I do not know how I am going to give it to you. I do not know whether other councils have operated the members' proposal scheme.  In Cork they did, and it was related to the improvement of roads such as Deputy McQuillan sets out in this Bill.  The double-barrelled expression &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; is very hard to interpret, particularly when you are dealing with officials and more so when you are dealing with officials from the Board of Works. The county council engineers will as a rule respond to the general opinion of the council.  I have seen the term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; applied to a boreen where only two people were living and, I think, three was the minimum at one time.  However, to say &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; is making a three-barred gate.  I would be inclined to omit the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; if I were Deputy McQuillan, and leave it &ldquo;public utility&rdquo;.  After all, under the term &ldquo;public utility&rdquo; even one could come under the category if he could not get relief from any other source, but when the word &ldquo;general&rdquo; is added the Deputy is opening a laneway that will be a cul-de-sac.  I was wondering if the Minister had an open mind on this question.</P>

      <P>I think he stated that he knew Deputy McQuillan's mind.  I may not be as good a psychologist as the Minister, and that may be a left-handed compliment I am paying.  Any man who can give away nothing with a good decent gesture must be a good psychologist.  I say the onus is on the local authority pure and simple.  All that needs to be done is to tell them to carry on with any work that is of public utility.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will always be in the generous mood he has been in to-night.  There is no doubt about it, whether he has only recently developed it or not, the Minister's display of psychology to-night was the best I ever witnessed. However, we will be delighted if the Minister will say something to engender a sense of responsibility in the retrenchment men, members of the Minister's own Party in the county council to which I belong.  I hope he will encourage them to do their duty to the people they are representing and to the unfortunate people who, through no fault of their own, are contributing, as Deputy Donnellan said, to road maintenance all their lifetime, and that this will give them an impetus to carry out their responsibilities instead of slashing grants as has been done in the Cork County Council for the past few years.  We are doing nothing except maintenance on roads.  Let us hope that the Minister, in his wisdom, will say a few words to the members of his own Party who are also members of the Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the principle of this Bill, although, like other Deputies, I think it might be improved by redrafting.  Certainly, at some other stage, it should be somewhat amended.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it would be impossible to estimate precisely what is the intention or at least what is the intention of some members of the House.  It may be well to quote what Deputy McQuillan has suggested and see if it would meet with the approval of other members here.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without going into that point&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; that is, the question of public utility</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;in any detail, I think &lsquo;public utility&rsquo; should mean that if eight or ten families live in a village and that that village is served by a cul-de-sac road or a stop-end road, that that road can be described as a public utility.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to rub the Minister the wrong way.  This is a very important matter, which is of particular concern to people in County Roscommon, as has been pointed out by Deputy McQuillan.  I want the House to realise that this is a particularly thorny question in County Roscommon by reason of the action of the Land Commission.  They acquired and distributed a considerable acreage of land in Roscommon and built houses and created a completely new townland, into which they made closed, dead-end, roads.  That is why, perhaps, Roscommon comes into the picture more than any other county.  If the Land Commission had not acted in that way we would not have half the problems that we have.  I referred to that particular matter when dealing with the Estimate for Lands.  There is a considerable mileage of dead-end roads of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the question of county roads in order that the Minister might enlighten me because the problem of the repair of such roads as were mentioned by Deputy McQuillan differs in various counties.  Deputy McQuillan mentioned that at one stage Roscommon County Council requested permission from the Department to <Col N="1028" /> repair those roads entirely out of our own rates and that request was turned down by the Department of Local Government.  I am amazed to learn from Cork Deputies that they have been carrying on that system in Cork for a number of years.  Deputy Keane has referred to &ldquo;councillors' proposals.&rdquo; Each councillor was allocated roughly £300 or £350 to repair roads that would not qualify under any of the definitions of &ldquo;approved road.&rdquo; Nevertheless, members of Cork County Council could provide money out of the local rates for the repair of those roads and yet, when Roscommon County Council requested permission from the Department of Local Government to do that very thing, permission was refused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The county engineer had to decide whether the road could be properly taken over or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could not be any question of that in the case to which I refer because, as Deputy McQuillan has pointed out, over a long period of years we had been repairing a number of roads.  Then, in 1947 a surcharge was levied to the extent of £2,800 and those roads which had been repaired by the local authority over a long period could no longer be so repaired. It is rather peculiar that there should be one local government law for the people in Cork and a different law for the people in Roscommon.  There seems to be something wrong somewhere. An explanation is due to the members of Roscommon County Council as to why there should be withheld from them that authority which was given to the members of another local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it does.  At least, we would like equality under the law.  I am delighted to hear that the Minister is prepared to allow local authorities to carry out this work.  I am more than delighted that there is that difference between his proposal and Deputy McQuillan's proposal because, as Deputy Donnellan has said, <Col N="1029" /> those people who have been living on these neglected roads for years and have been paying their contribution to the main roads and the county roads for other people and, as a last resort, when no other remedy seemed to be available, would be obliged to put their hands in their pockets to pay for their own roads.  The Minister has indicated that there will be Government legislation covering this matter and he has enlightened me on the point that they will be regarded as county roads.  That is going some of the way to give these people justice although I would suggest that, if justice were to be done, substantial grants should be made available to put these roads into a proper condition before they are taken over by the local authorities.  This matter has been pending since 1898.  Naturally, the roads are in a very bad state now and it would require a considerable amount of money to put them into repair. If the finances of the State would permit, justice demands that these roads should receive priority and that a substantial amount of money should be allocated for the purpose of putting them into repair.</P>
      <P>With other Deputies, I hope that when the legislation is introduced we will bury the phrase &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; which nobody in any Department of State or official capacity is capable of interpreting.  In my opinion, it was a legal ruse and was purposely inserted in the 1925 Act.  If Section 2 of Deputy McQuillan's Bill were to be embodied in the Minister's Bill, it would be a grave mistake not to stop at the third last line and omit &ldquo;if such road authority is satisfied that the road is of general public utility&rdquo;.  Otherwise, it will start the whole argument over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where even one solitary family happens to live on a dead-end road and are taxpayers, they are bearing their share of the State charges, and is there anybody who would suggest that because they reside at the end of one of these culs-de-sac they should be debarred from the ordinary amenities enjoyed by other citizens?  In my own area there is one complete village or townland of 21 houses where from 1902 <Col N="1030" /> to 1947 the road was repaired triennially by the local authority, but when this surcharge came along nothing further could be done on it.  I believe that if it had not been for the existence of county managers the county councils would have taken the risk of surcharge and would have repaired such roads; but county managers are supposed to be the enlightened people in county administration, they are supposed to put the council right on all matters, and they are not going to take the risk of surcharge. In that particular case I saw a grave injustice being done.  I had legal advice obtained on it through the county council, and when I differed with their junior law authority I referred it to senior counsel, and he concurred with the solicitor and agreed that the road could not be described as a road of public utility.  That road was the only means of ingress and egress in that particular townland; without it the people could not go to Mass, fair or meeting, nor could they be attended by priest or doctor.  I want to be fair to the officials of the Department, and admit that that is not the view of certain officials in the Custom House.  Notwithstanding that, I am assured by our auditor that even if the Department should agree he would still regard it as a case for surcharge, or recommend it as such.  For that reason, whatever form of legislation is used, I think we should omit from it completely the term &ldquo;of general public utility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Moran who mentioned here last week, quite rightly, that local authorities were more interested in urban dwellers than in rural dwellers.  It has often been a cause of extreme concern to me, as a member of a local authority, that councillors will not hesitate to provide thousands of pounds for an urban scheme, but if a question arises of paying a few thousand pounds to remove grievances like this they become immediately very parsimonious and careful about the expenditure of public money.  I would like to see this question, which has been so long neglected in the past, get priority from local authorities in the future. Whatever money is necessary to put <Col N="1031" /> such roads into a proper state of repair should be expended on them and the amenities of urban dwellers should take secondary place.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accepted the Bill in principle.  It is open to any Deputy to put down an amendment on the Committee Stage, as I am sure all stages will not be taken to-night.  Deputy McQuillan is to be congratulated upon the success his Bill has achieved.  Again, I want to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he has met the Bill. In these circumstances, I think that further debate is not of very great advantage.  Deputies who think the Bill should be amended can put down amendments for the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Bill gives the county councils full authority to do what they think fit.  The Minister says he agrees with that, and proposes to give them that sanction.  The Civil Service do not come into the matter at all.  It is then for county councils to do as they think fit themselves.</P>

      <P>This Bill introduced by Deputy McQuillan will have an amount of sympathy from all Deputies representing rural areas.  In a statement made by the Minister to-night, he pointed out all the difficulties, and I thoroughly agree with him that, when county councils get this power, it will not be such plain sailing as some people may think.  Deputies who are members of local authorities know quite well that the local authorities are very reluctant to provide even a fair contribution for the repair of the minor roads.  I wonder if Deputy McQuillan is 100 per cent. wise in his approach to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he had put it to the Minister for Local Government, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the Board of Works, to provide that local authorities would have power to contribute towards the making up of those cul-de-sac roads where a grant was given from the Board of Works, I think that would be more desirable.  In my humble opinion, much more money will be provided under the rural improvements scheme than by local authorities for <Col N="1032" /> these roads.  Many of them would cost £500 or £1,000 to widen and make suitable for public transport.  This is a problem Deputies should think out well.  Local authorities, though they have the power at present, have not taken over roads that join two public roads.  I am sure they could take over several hundred extra miles of roads if they were so minded to provide money to maintain them.  That is so in every county in Ireland.  There are many roads which they would be legally entitled to take over, but they are not prepared to do so as they are not prepared to put up money to maintain them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan to-night accused, first of all, the Minister for Local Government of having voted against a motion of his to increase the grants under the rural improvements scheme. The Minister denied that and Deputy Donnellan withdrew the charge.  He made a further charge that the Minister might not have voted against it but all the other members of Fianna Fáil voted against it.  I want to deny that.  I say it is untrue and I would ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to request Deputy Donnellan to withdraw that statement.</P>

      <P>On the 23rd November, 1949, a motion was moved in this House.  It was in the names of Deputies Commons and Beirne.  I am quoting the Official Dáil Debates of that date, column 1321, Volume 118. The motion was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the present Government contribution of 75 per cent. under the rural improvements scheme is inadequate and should be increased to 90 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Beegan said that he objected to the withdrawal of the motion.  The motion had asked for 90 per cent. for all rural improvement schemes and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance promised to give a 90 per cent. grant to all under £6 valuation, and leave the grants as they were for any valuation over £18.  At column 2168, Volume 118 of the Official Dáil Debates for the 7th December, 1949, Deputy Beegan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I object to the withdrawal of this motion.  Deputy Beirne's name is also put down to the motion and it asks for 90 per cent.  Deputy Commons and the Parliamentary Secretary are making class distinction so far as that is concerned; their point is that 75 per cent. should go to the wealthier classes and 90 per cent. to the others.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Deputy McQuillan, for giving us an opportunity of ventilating some of our grievances in regard to by-roads and cul-de-sac roads.  So far as I and my Party are concerned, I think we took a very deep interest in this matter on at least two occasions one of which was that mentioned by Deputy Allen.  The other was an occasion many years before that, very soon after I came to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 8th February, 1946, a motion was put down in the names of Deputy Cogan and myself asking for the repeal of this objectionable and obnoxious section of the 1925 Act enacted here by a man of foreign nationality, as we <Col N="1036" /> would now call him.  I emphasised at that time that we were just holding out that section to perpetuate the memory of this Bill.  I thought it was wrong for a National Government to cherish the memory of those people who in their day indulged in obstructionist tactics and created, particularly in rural areas, a state of discomfort.</P>
    <P>When I read this Bill, like others who spoke here, I had a certain objection to it.  I saw a loophole in it.  I know Deputy McQuillan is as sincere as myself and I have heard him not only in this House but also in the Roscommon County Council, of which I have the honour to be a member, advocating the repeal of this section of the Act.  He has made a strong case for it on more than one occasion at Roscommon County Council.  I am glad he had the courage and the patriotism to do so.  It is a patriotic thing to do something for the people in rural Ireland in particular.  I am charmed and delighted to have as a colleague one who is taking a practical interest in the people of rural Ireland.  I honestly say it is a sincere interest.</P>
    <P>When I read this Bill, I saw the loophole in it.  I saw the phrase &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo;.  I met a few of my colleagues in my own room and said to one in particular&mdash;the Deputy on my right: &ldquo;I will bet a fiver that the Minister will accept that Bill as it stands.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I do not think so.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I will give you two to one he will accept it.&rdquo;  I am not a gambler.  I do not gamble but, having seen the little flaw in the Bill, I knew the Minister would be quite safe in accepting it.  The Minister was quite safe in doing that.  The three words I have referred to weaken the effect of the Bill, in my eyes.</P>

No one can say that in this case I have done so to gain any political advantage, because the case in question is not really in my constituency. <Col N="1037" /> However, whenever I am approached by people from any quarter and when facts are made known to me which make me feel that an injustice has been done, I consider it my duty to take whatever action I feel is necessary in order that the injustice may be rectified, if possible.  Even though I have no great hopes that this will be done, I consider it my duty to bring any matters of this kind to the notice of members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>A vacancy existed for an auxiliary postman in Knocknagoshel, North Kerry, and, on 23rd June last, a man was appointed to fill the vacant post temporarily.  This man had all the necessary qualifications for this post. He had five years' service in the Army during the emergency.  He has five young children ranging in ages from six years to six months, and he, his wife and five children live in a labourer's cottage with his father.  He was recommended, or should be recommended if there were justice, from the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>It is known that in that area no other applicant could possibly qualify to that extent and I might remind the Minister that that is one of the necessary qualifications for an appointment to such a position.  He was not only registered at the labour exchange but was drawing the highest sum in unemployment assistance from that exchange, so that he had the qualifications of his military service, his recommendation from the labour exchange, the fact that he was married with young children, and so forth and he was the man who was recommended, or should have been recommended if there was no outside force brought to bear on the postmaster for the area.</P>

    <P>This man has carried out his duties efficiently and well since last June.  He had all the necessary qualifications, but, lo and behold, he gets notice about a fortnight ago that his services would be terminated as from 1st November last and now a new man has come in. So far as I know, the man who has been appointed is 43 years of age and has a service medal awarded to him as from 7th July last.  I want to point out that the question of a service medal does not arise so far as the <Col N="1038" /> qualifications necessary for appointment to the position of auxiliary postman or any other type of postman are concerned.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the point.  The Minister did not answer the questions we asked.  He said that part-time postman vacancies are filled from lists of persons supplied by <Col N="1040" /> employment exchanges&mdash;the man for whom I speak was already recommended by the labour exchange&mdash;and from applicants already in temporary employment&mdash;the man for whom I speak was temporarily employed since June, and did his duty efficiently and well.  I do not want to say too much, I do not care what Government is in office, but I always believe in decency and honesty in public life and that positions should be given in order of merit.</P>

      <P>On to-day's Order Paper, I had a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seeking certain information as to the methods employed in filling the position of postman in Knocknagoshel in County Kerry.  I am not satisfied with the reply, inasmuch as it does not give the information I sought in the question.  The only information I can glean from the reply is that the person is 43 years of age.  On the same Order Paper I had a question to the Minister for Defence asking when the service medal was issued to the applicant.  We are aware that, in the filling of appointments, certain rights are given&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to men who served either in the emergency forces or during the pre-Truce period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance the age of the appointee speaks for itself.  This man was only 13 years of age towards the end of the hostilities of the 1916-1921 period.  That fact, and in particular the fact that the man did not receive the medal in sufficient time to qualify him for a special allowance indicate, we suggest to the House, that the medal was given so that the present Government would have an alibi to fall back upon in making an appointment that is purely political, and in leaving out of consideration the fact that the other applicant was a young man who was acting in a temporary capacity, who had been for five years a member of the Defence Forces, and was discharged with a first-class discharge from his commanding officer, who was married, who was recommended by the postmaster and by the labour exchange, and who is homeless&mdash;he resides with his father in a cottage. I said that he is married; he is also the father of a family of five, whose <Col N="1041" /> ages range from 12 months to six years.</P>

      <P>The man for whom we speak lives with his father in a labourer's cottage and gave five years' service in the National Army. Now he has been turned out of the position he occupies in the service of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs so that a political appointment might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appointment, to the minds of many members of the House, stinks of political prejudice inasmuch as we are informed in a separate reply that the appointee was given a service medal although he was between 12 and 13 years at the time when active service was necessary to qualify for such recompense from the State.  It is significant that in the Minister's reply he states that the appointee could not qualify for a special allowance under the Act.  It is a scandalous thing that a young man, the father of a young family, residing with his father, in an acting capacity in that post and with no black mark against him, should be turned out so as to create a job for another man.  We are told by the Minister that he is not in a position to furnish the House with the details we ask regarding the qualifications of each candidate for the position.  Therefore we availed of the opportunity of the Adjournment to bring the matter before the House so that it would be properly aired and to voice in the strongest possible manner our abhorrence of the methods employed in <Col N="1042" /> making this appointment.  I think that to resort to a second Department to provide an alibi for this action is nothing but pure political jobbery.</P>

      <P>The question of the appointment of an auxiliary postman at Knocknagoshel, County Kerry, has been raised.  I happen to know something about it.  From my knowledge of the district and of the people living there I am satisfied that the man who was appointed is suitable in every respect.  He is a married man with a family.  To my knowledge, he has been doing temporary and holiday duty as postman in that district for the past 15 years.  I am sure he did the work to the satisfaction of everybody. He is a man with a good national record and, for his services in Fianna Éireann he holds a national service medal.  I am surprised to find Deputy Palmer, Deputy Lynch and Deputy D.J. O'Sullivan raising this matter in the Dáil.  Presumably it is due to the fact that another candidate who happens to be the secretary of the local Fine Gael club, was not successful.  I believe that the Minister made the right appointment in this case.</P>

      <P>Deputy Palmer spoke about decency and honour in public life.  I am glad to say that since I had the honour of being made Minister there have been virtually no complaints in regard to the appointment of postmen.  I have a responsibility for ensuring justice.  I am satisfied that I have exercised that responsibility with decency and honour in all the cases that have come to my notice and in all the appointments I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> I think it is most unpleasant to debate the relative merits of candidates on occasions such as this and I do not propose to do it.  As the Deputy knows well, regulations in regard to Army service and I.R.A. service were made about 1946.  These regulations have been left unchanged by the last Government, by the Government before that and by the present Government. Regard is had to the comparative means of candidates, to their general suitability and to the comparative length of service of the candidates concerned&mdash;a matter to which Deputy Palmer does not seem to have adverted.  He chose to give his own views on the means of the candidates. He implied that there is no particular honour in being a member of Fianna Éireann.  He implied that for a young lad of 12 or 13 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to carry out the responsibilities, on active service, of a member of Fianna Éireann is something so trifling that it can be disregarded compared with Army service &mdash;all of which matters are highly contentious.  He did not have regard to the comparative period of service in the Department of the postal service of the candidates in question. Apparently he had no regard to that matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the ultimate responsibility for this appointment, and I am <Col N="1044" /> satisfied that I made it in the public interest.  If Deputy Palmer and Deputy D.J. O'Sullivan chose to wallow in ideas of corruption and suggest that there was some ridiculous conspiracy between me, the Minister for Defence and the person appointed in regard to the date on which the candidate received his military service medal then I cannot stop them.  I think it is loathsome because it implies that there are three persons in this connection who are corrupt.  The Army Pensions Board designates a certain person, a referee, to award these military service certificates.  He does so in an impartial manner.  He is not interfered with by the Minister.  I do not know whether Deputy Palmer is making these allegations of corruption because, in some way or other, the last Minister for Defence interfered with the award of military service certificates in order to secure the employment of postmen: I have no such knowledge and I am not making the allegation against him.  However, on behalf of the present Minister for Defence&mdash;to whom, actually, this question should have been addressed and who would be well able to answer it in this House&mdash;I want to say that the suggestion of connivance between two Ministers and a member of Fianna Éireann is revolting.</P>
    <P>I desire to say again that I appointed this person in the public interest.</P>
