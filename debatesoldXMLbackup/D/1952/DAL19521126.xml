      <P>Statistics are not available covering transactions in all classes of goods and services to enable single comprehensive figures to be given for the purchasing power of the Irish £ in October, 1951, and in October, 1952, as compared with October, 1939.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that at the ruling retail prices £1 would, in mid-August, 1951, have purchased the same quantum of essential goods (including rent) as 9/9 at mid-August, 1939, while the August, 1939, figure corresponding to £1 in August, 1952, was 8/11.  Corresponding data for the month of October are not available.</P>
      <P>For goods purchased at wholesale, it is estimated that for £1 in October, 1951, and in September, 1952, the relevant figures for October, 1939, were 7/8 and 7/6 respectively.  Statistics for October, 1952, are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The estimates for goods purchased at agricultural prices are that for £1 in October, 1951, and in October, 1952, the corresponding figures in October, 1939, were 7/9 and 7/5 respectively.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a customs free area in the port of Dublin has been raised from time to time.</P>
      <P>The provision of customs free facilities would involve reserving an area of the port exclusively for this purpose. The area would have to be provided with all the usual portal facilities, including berthage and warehousing. There has been no indication that these facilities, if provided, would attract additional business to the port on a scale which would justify the heavy expenditure involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to the statements issued by Córas Iompair Éireann which appeared in the public Press on 20th and 21st November. These statements indicate that increased bus services will be provided at peak hours on routes 35, 40 and 40a to Finglas, Ballygall Road and St. Margaret's as from 1st December; that, from the same date the No. 6 service from Nelson Pillar will be extended from Proby Square to Yankee <Col N="5" /> Terrace, Newtown Park Avenue; that Córas Iompair Éireann hopes to extend the No. 14 bus service to Annamoe Drive, North Circular Road, and to restore the No. 15 bus service to its original city terminus at Upper O'Connell Street before Christmas; and that it is probable that the new Kilmacud service will be in operation by mid-December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware (1) that on 29th December, 1950, the Civil Service Commissioners held a confined competitive examination for appointments to posts as clerical officers (male and female), the competition being confined to persons recruited for service as temporary clerks in employment exchanges; (2) that 68 qualified but up to the present only ten have been established; and (3) that vacancies are being filled in his Department from permanent clerical officers or writing assistants from other Departments while members amongst the 68 qualified as above are being passed over; and if, in justice to those who qualified in the examination of December, 1950, he will arrange to have them appointed according as vacancies arise until the whole 68 are established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 25 and No. 26 together. A competitive examination for appointments to posts as clerical officer (male or female) in the Department of Social Welfare was held on 29th December, 1950.  The competition was confined to persons recruited for service as temporary clerks in employment exchanges. The number of posts offered was not less than ten should so many candidates be found qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> Sixty-eight candidates qualified and ten have been appointed clerical officers.  Further appointments may be made but a decision as to the number will depend on the number of clerical officer posts shown to be available by the review of the basis of staffing in employment exchanges necessitated by the introduction of the new scheme of social insurance which is proceeding at present.  I cannot undertake to reserve all vacancies for clerical officers in employment exchanges for candidates from the examination.  The Deputies may, however, rest assured that the claims of the remaining qualified candidates will be sympathetically considered when it comes to filling posts for clerical officers in employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Appointments of writing assistants to employment exchanges are being made to fill vacancies for such officers arising out of the general reorganisation of the work of these offices in August, 1950. These appointments do not, therefore, affect the position as candidates from the examination referred to are eligible only for clerical officer posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause of the delay was that there was a doubt as to whether she was a person who would come within the terms necessary to qualify for a grant.  When that matter was being investigated a further question arose as to what the amount of the grant should be.  These two matters are in process, I hope, of being straightened out and as soon as they are the balance of the money will be paid to her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>Sometimes a question arises as to whether a person is in <Col N="19" /> receipt of a pension or some source of income which might entirely influence the final decision in a case.  It would not necessarily follow that on receipt of an application, or indeed after the inspection by the inspector, this information would emerge at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the certificate of approval is issued on the basis of information which is inaccurate, or perhaps without having all the information before the Department, it is questionable whether the certificate of approval would mean anything at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance introduced a token Vote into this House for the purpose of permitting the House to discuss the effects of his administration on the country, and he interposed between the discussions of the matter by the House three hours and five minutes of statements by him that have no reference &mdash; good, bad or indifferent &mdash; to the matter we are required to discuss.  On the last day upon which he was discussing the question, significantly and certainly enough he took the halter which public opinion has hung around his political neck and he gently twisted it around the neck of the Taoiseach, then around the necks of his colleagues and then around the necks of the other members of his Party, as much as to say, whatever is happening to anybody out of all this it is happening to the whole lot; that is, it is not simply going to be the Minister for Finance who will be the victim of public judgment but he is going to see that it is hung around the necks of the whole lot.  He need not be a bit afraid. We are discussing the Minister for Finance's Estimate from the point of view of the effect that it has on the people and if the Minister thinks that by his kind of trickery to-day and by that type of insult in not carrying on discussion in a way that was normally anticipated, in view of the little he had said with regard to the real matters and in view of the substantial explanation which seems to be required about things that matter, he is going to prevent this House from doing its duty, then he is very much mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister bases his case on the fact that the last Administration destroyed everything and that he had to come and arrange to do some drastic and violent things in order to secure that the country was put right.  He deliberately set out in his Budget policy this year to reduce employment in this country, to reduce the consuming capacity of our people, to reduce the money in their pockets and to destroy in every possible way the outlook <Col N="32" /> on the country's economy, the outlook on the country's way of working that the last Government were beginning to stabilise.  The inter-Party Government set out to maintain the cost of living at a stable position if they could not reduce it, to increase employment, to increase the hope and the courage of our people in building up their economy here, to teach the people that they had a strong credit, that their capacity, resources and ability were such that they had a credit to capitalise; that they should use that credit and build on that credit.  In various ways, the people were grasping the idea of what national credit meant and how it could be used, how employment could be increased and how the cost of living could be kept down.</P>
    <P>Taking the period 1947 to 1950, one finds that the cost-of-living figure in the middle of 1947 was 184, that it was 184 in the middle of 1950.  The cost-of-living figure based on retail prices had been kept at a level over that three years.  During that period industrial earnings had been increased by 18.5 per cent.; agricultural wages had been increased by 19 per cent.  The cost of living remained steady for three years and increases in industrial and agricultural wages were 18.5 and 19 per cent. respectively.  The cost of living had been maintained steady in spite of the fact that import prices had risen by 5.9 per cent., wholesale prices had risen by 11.4 per cent., and agricultural prices had risen by 15.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>That was the effect on the ordinary standard of life of the people.  During that period, the people had been induced to utilise and to gather their savings in this country so that they could be used for the building up of the country.  In plans for the development and strengthening of our economy, the improvement of our amenities, the stabilising of our people's lives in decent homes, the Government showed the people a number of ways in which our credit could be used.  Year after year they were asked to give of their savings to a Government loan so that, with taxation kept down, as it was, the economy of the country could be strengthened by the proper use of the <Col N="33" /> country's savings and revenue might be increased at the lower rate of taxation. That was done.</P>
    <P>The Minister then comes in and, following up their disastrous attempt to discourage and dismay the people by difficulties that were arising, when the cost of living was rising in the middle of 1951 as a result of the impact of the Korean war on the situation, undermining the people's confidence, hit them with the violent Budget of this year, in which they took an additional £11,500,000.  That, together with the attack on the cost of living, when they reduced subsidies to the extent, I submit, of £8,500,000, completely disrupted the people's approach to the balance between wages and the cost of living and threw the whole economy of the people with regard to financial credit to the winds.</P>
    <P>Last year, instead of going to the people and collecting the people's savings, which they now suggest it is necessary to collect, they left the people in the position that they gave them no opportunity to put their savings into a Government loan and they took £24,000,000 that had been left as a reserve in the Marshall Fund and squandered it absolutely and completely. In doing that, they did two things.  By their failure to go to the people for their savings, they broke the continuity of the people's thought in the matter of savings.  By throwing away the £24,000,000 that was left there out of the Marshall money, they threw away a reserve that should have been kept by their side so that, when they wanted to add a small amount to the people's savings to meet their capital programme, it would be available and, in addition, it would be available to protect them against the demands of financial interests for higher interest rates.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to get the situation right in many respects after the blow that was struck by the Fianna Fáil attitude in 1951 and this year, but this country has survived more from the Fianna Fáil people than even their latest blow, big as that is.  The resources of this country and the character of its people are such that it will survive even the blows that Fianna <Col N="34" /> Fáil have been striking in recent months.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking around the world to-day will understand that any country, no matter how favourably situated, requires the balanced minds of its people and the co-operation of all minds and classes to overcome their difficulties.  It has been the unfortunate experience of this country, due to the mentality of the Minister and his colleagues, that in the 30 years of the existence of the State there has never been given an opportunity to the people or Parliament to envisage any single problem in its full perspective in relation to the power of our people to deal with it, the desire of our people to deal with it and the possibilities of dealing with it.  Every single major problem has been trampled underfoot by the partisanship and personality of Fianna Fáil, regardless of the fact that this country struggled for its freedom and parliamentary institutions in the interest of the people as a whole and succeeded in getting such parliamentary institutions as it has by the efforts of all the people.</P>
    <P>The problem to-day is, not so much to gather the whole of our financial strength and the whole of our resources, but to gather the minds, integrity and intelligence of our people, to pool their brains and spirit in order to deal with these things.</P>
    <P>In the discussions that we have had with the Minister for Finance in recent weeks in this House and in his contribution to this debate, he has left no word unsaid, no gesture unmade that he thought could in any way, obscure, bedevil and divide the minds of our people in dealing with this particular matter.  We want to get away from these matters in this discussion here. We want the House to look in a simple and sincere kind of way at the Minister's policy and the results of it.</P>
    <P>Taxation has been raised.  A shilling has been put on income-tax. A shocking and bitter inquisition is being carried on at the present moment by a specially devised machine of the Income Tax Commissioners to harry every person and every employer to get after income-tax payers who, in particular circumstances, are in <Col N="35" /> arrears.  This is being done at a time when, due to the economic situation in the country, many of them are quite unable to meet the demands on them that would have been made if the administrative machine dealing with the collection of income-tax had been properly working in the past; and now, at a very bitter moment for some of them, in addition to the ordinary increase in income-tax, a general inquisition is being carried out.</P>
    <P>We want to persuade the people and different sections in the Dáil that there was no necessity for the increase in income-tax or the substantially increased taxes that were imposed this year.  The policy that was being pursued of low taxation, better and increased industrial development, maintenance of employment, the keeping down of the cost of living, where it was rising substantially even in Great Britain, was a policy that was possible by the co-operation of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister made very considerable play, in a long drawn-out explanation, on the balance of payments and what their ideas were with regard to the balance of payments.  The returns circulated to-day have given the Minister his answer, showing that everything he said was political eyewash and political propaganda for the purpose of obscuring the intent he had in mind, the old intent of the Fianna Fáil Party, to keep the people in as close a grip as possible, to dip their hands as deeply as possible into the people's pockets for that purpose and to secure to themselves in every possible way the position of dictators of policy for people's lives, either by regulation or by rule or by the rule of the purse.</P>
    <P>The latest blow the Minister has struck our economy is the launching of the £20,000,000 loan at 5 per cent.  I would ask Deputies who want to examine what the case was for putting the interest rate as high as that, to examine the information that is available. They will find information in the <i>Record and Statistics Supplement</i><Col N="36" /> to the <i>Economist</i> for various months. Taking the savings in bonds 3 per cent., redeemable on the 1st September 1960-70 and the savings in bonds 3 per cent., redeemable on 15th August 1965-75 we can look back at the gross yield for the latest date of redemption, quoted in the records systematically given every week in this supplement. Deputies will find that in the case of the first mentioned, the bonds redeemable 1960-70, the gross yield quoted for the latest date of redemption was, on the 15th November, £4 3s. 9d.; on the 4th October, £4 4s. 11d.; on the 6th September, £4 2s. 6d.; on the 2nd August, £4 7s. 9d.; on the 5th July, £4 4s. 10d.; and, going back before the change of bank rate, on the 1st March 1952, £4 5s. 6d.; and a year before that, £3 8s. 0d.  At any rate, there you have in the latter months before the Minister went for his loan, an equivalent type of Government security showing a gross yield, assessed on the latest date of redemption, of £4 3s. 9d., £4 4s. 11d. and £4 2s. 6d.  Taking the savings in bonds 3 per cent. redeemable 1965-75, we find the figures for the 15th November 1952, £4 3s. 11d.; for the 4th October, £4 4s. 0d.; 6th September, £4 2s. 0d.; and 2nd August, £4 7s. 0d.  This shows that an equivalent British security of that kind was less than 4½ per cent., whereas the Minister goes out and puts a blister of 5 per cent. in interest for his borrowings on the people of this country in a most outlandish and cruel way.</P>
    <P>We have seen the results of that imposition on those people who, in the spirit of hope and confidence introduced by the inter-Party Government into administration, were marrying their own savings with the credit available to them from the local loans funds, so as to establish themselves in houses.  That class of people who contribute so much to our general society and our general production here but who cannot expect to be housed by the local authorities, were, under the impulse of the greater increase in hope and confidence brought about by the three years of inter-Party Government, putting substantial amounts of their own money and utilising the credit of the country to build up their homes.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now the figures for <Col N="37" /> the development that has taken place there.  Borrowers under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts borrowed from their local authority funds that &mdash;except in the case of the City of Dublin, I think &mdash; were provided by the State through the Local Loans Fund. In the year ended March 1947 they borrowed £4,600; in the year ended March 1948 they borrowed £8,600; in the year ended March 1949, £162,700; March 1950, £1,816,000; March 1951, £2,273,000; March 1952, £3,460,000. That borrowing reflected people in this country who had savings of their own, who wanted to build their own homes and establish their families, making use of the State credit that was offered through the Local Loans Fund to help them, to add that to their savings and build a new Irish home. Everybody knows what the result of the Minister's increase in interest rate has been on them.  It brings us back to the queer kind of influence that has operated in this country for so long in financial circles, where every possible obstacle is placed in the way of building houses for the people or helping them to build their own houses.  Our minds go back to the old days when it was Arthur Griffith's dream to have an Ireland where every man owned his own house.  From the very first time the State was set up effect was given to that impulse to put people into secure and satisfactory homes.  One of the first things that was done in the way of expanding capital was that two thirds of the cost of the original set of houses that were built by local authorities as long ago as 1922-23 was provided by the State in order to gear up the wheels of the building industry here, in order to prepare it, after the troubles of the First War, to fulfil its function, to give the people habitations in which they might live and rear their families and develope their culture.</P>
    <P>From the very first, there has been a violent financial attack on the policy of utilising capital for the building of houses.  We have had the classical example here that has been quoted before.</P>
    <P>I quote from page 167 of the Report of Inquiry into the Housing of the <Col N="38" /> Working Classes of the City of Dublin, 1939 to 1943.  The quotation is headed: &ldquo;State Responsibility for Raising Capital.&rdquo;  It goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For a long period the corporation found little difficulty in raising on the public market whatever capital they required for their activities, but in September. 1938, the city manager reported to the housing committee, that the next instalment of the five-year programme demanded the provision of approximately £3,500,000 to £750,000 of which they were already committed; that there were difficulties in raising money by issue of stock at that time; and that an adequate assurance of the necessary funds should be secured before entering into further commitments.</P>
    <P>Between November, 1938, and April, 1939, however, £1,000,000 was secured, £275,000 from the Bank of Ireland and £750,000 from the Hospitals' Trust Board.</P>
    <P>Negotiations took place with the Banks' Standing Committee on the matter of raising £2,000,000 by issue of stock, but in January, 1939, it was intimated to the corporation that the banks could not underwrite a public issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In January, 1939, the banks of this country announced to the Dublin Corporation that they could not underwrite a public issue of £2,000,000 for the building of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. Two reasons were given.  One was &ldquo;the uneconomic character of the housing programme, aggravated by the high level of building costs&rdquo;.  In 1939 it was uneconomic to provide, after seven years of Fianna Fáil administration, houses for the working population in the City of Dublin. The money could not be spent then in January, 1939, on the eve of the war because of the high level of building costs.  That was the first reason given.</P>
    <P>The second reason was: &ldquo;The magnitude of the sums required for the corporation's five-year programme of public works.&rdquo;  I think that is the classical example of the outlook of <Col N="39" /> those in this country who are, if you like, the custodians of our national credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want to come to.  Somewhat later we were concerned with the rate of interest that was being charged even in 1945. We felt that the credit of this country properly used would bring about a more realistic state of affairs in the matter of the price that the Irish people would have to pay in respect of the capital required for development purposes.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter on the Central Fund Bill in 1945 and at column 1359 of the Official Debates of the 14th March, 1945, the Minister for Finance, excusing the Banks' Standing Committee, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They have their obligations to the community, just as,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;the bricklayer, the engine driver, the farmer and everybody else has responsibilities.  But I do not see that the banks are obliged to run themselves into bankruptcy, even to build houses for the Dublin citizens, very necessary as that work is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position at that particular time was that the Government stood aside and brought no influence to bear on the Banks' Standing Committee.  The ministerial mind is again shown in the statement made at column 1361 of the Official Debates, dated 14th March, 1945:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another aspect of the difficulties of the Dublin Corporation, in particular at that time of which Deputy Mulcahy speaks and at other times, was that bankers are commercial men and must make a financial success of their institutions in the interests of their shareholders.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a difficulty a couple of years ago when the Dublin Corporation again looked for £5,000,000 to carry on their housing programme and when they were refused any kind of accommodation or recognition at all by the Banks' Standing Committee.  The Government of that time had to send for the Banks' Standing Committee and they had a <Col N="40" /> discussion with them.  As a result, the accommodation which the Dublin Corporation required was given them.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputies who are anxious to look at this matter in a detached way that when the members of the Government met the Banks' Standing Committee at that time they had not their cap in hand.  They discussed a serious problem with men whom they regarded as having functions by reason of their being the Banks' Standing Committee. We tried to bring them to a realisation of their function.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At 3½ per cent. the loan of £5,000,000 by the banks in Ireland to the Dublin Corporation brought in to the banks an annual net profit of £80,000 a year for the period of the loan.  There was no danger of the banks in their capacity of being analogous to bricklayers, carpenters, farmers and other people like that going bankrupt by reason of the fact that their function was operated to enable the corporation to get the houses built that were wanted here.</P>
      <P>To-day we have the Minister for Finance throwing aside the £24,000,000 of the Marshall Aid money.  If it were necessary for the Government to take formal powers to see that the Dublin Corporation were provided with the necessary money to go ahead with their building programme, the £24,000,000 was there as a reserve to be used, while the necessary machinery was being put into operation.  When the Minister for Finance threw aside that money, he did two things.  He threw away any protection he had against the obscurantist mind that operates with regard to housing in the banks here and threw away the protection he had against that particular kind of financial outlook on the housing of the people that seems, not only in this country but in other countries, to put every possible obstacle in the way of getting the people into houses as a &ldquo;gad is gaire don scornaigh&rdquo;&mdash; cutting the knot nearest to the people's throat &mdash; if they are to live to rear their families and carry on the productive work of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that he now is in the position that he is successfully stopping housing.  The stream of people who were building houses, creating homes under the Small Dwellings Acts and making use of these loans, the figures of which I gave a short time ago, has <Col N="42" /> now stopped.  It is stopped, at any rate, except for those people who have fairly substantial incomes.  The normal marginal person who is able to use this machinery and who formed a very large part of those who were using it, as shown by the anxiety created by the recent situation brought about by the Minister, is being cut out and there is the financial and economic problem of seeing how these people are to be dealt with in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by paying the 5 per cent. rate for the £20,000,000 he got recently, has struck a very severe blow at the financing of our capital work not only for Government and private people but for local authorities.  The position has not yet disclosed itself to local authorities, but disclose itself it soon will, and the result will be that the unemployment and cessation of production that has already hit the building industry will hit many of the other development works that are being carried on under local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that loan of £20,000,000 have been got at less than 5 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position ought to have been quite clear.  It was perfectly clear that there was substantially over £10,000,000 a year available in savings from the people, and, with the understanding that that opening was available, there would be greater sums ready to be made available.  There was a sum of about £6,000,000 coming in yearly through the Post Office Savings Bank and the small savings certificates.  The capital development schemes that require to be attended to, visualised over three or four years, were fairly clear and whatever deficiency there might have been in the savings available from the people could have been made up by the proper utilisation of the Marshall Aid moneys and we had in hand all the financial resources to deal with the capital schemes required for the next three or four years, schemes which, once effectively carried out, would leave the country in a very strong position to go ahead with the general economic and social life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has created a situation <Col N="43" /> which is one of great concern to anybody who reviews the economic situation as a whole.  In the meantime, however, the Minister has shut his eyes quite definitely to the position he has created with regard to unemployment. Every month that has passed has shown an increase in the number of people on the live register.  If we go back to January last and take the figures for the months down through the year, we find that there were 7,800 more unemployed in January than in the year before; in February 11,100; in March, 9,700; in April, 12,900; in May, 11,800; in June, 8,800; in July, 10,700; in August, 9,400; in September, 6,700; and in October, 8,400; without any statistical information available to us as to the number of people on short time in various industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, in dealing, in an alleged way, with the presentation of his Estimate has completely shut his eyes to the unemployment position created here, to the position with regard to the country's credit and the use of its resources for carrying out capital development work, the fall-off in industrial output and the enormous difficulties which, in their family life, people are meeting, as a result of high taxation, high cost of living and resultant unemployment.  It is no wonder the Minister should come in here and try to obscure the situation by his talk for three and a half hours in which he introduced every single word that could possibly fret the minds of the people on purely personal and political matters.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that he should come in to-day and try to trick the House which expected him to deal with some of the other matters he promised to deal with, such as the condition to which he is reducing the Civil Service by his talk on arbitration and the teaching fraternity by the way in which he is robbing them of the established arrangement that a conciliation and arbitration board would be set up.</P>
    <P>These are things the Minister cannot escape either by insulting the House or confusing the issue in the House.  They are all there to be met by the people and the longer the Minister <Col N="44" /> carries on his antics, both here and outside, instead of facing up frankly to the problems confronting the country and to his responsibility in the matter, the greater will be the sufferings the people will have to go through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to a considerable part of the debate initiated by Deputy MacBride on his motion dealing with the Central Bank and I listened also to the debate that took place on Deputy Dillon's motion.  I understood that, when we came to discuss this token Vote, an opportunity would be available to the House to consider in a serious way this whole problem of currency and monetary control, and the position in which the country finds itself to-day because of the financial policies that have been pursued over the past 30 years.  I have been somewhat disappointed that the debate has not reached the standard that one would expect it to reach.  It is perhaps unfortunate that the House did not have the benefit of Deputy McGilligan's contribution on our problems following on the very long speech we had from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the House will have the benefit of Deputy McGilligan's contributions.  He is one Deputy who, I and quite a number of Deputies believe, has made a very deep study of financial matters, if one interprets correctly what he said here on the debates on the Central Bank Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin has said on occasion that the Labour Party specifically asked that Deputy McGilligan should be Minister for Finance in the inter-Party Government so that he might give effect to some of the ideas he had expressed in the debate on the Central Bank Bill in relation to the reorganisation of our monetary system.  The great difficulty in a discussion on monetary matters here is that too few Deputies apparently are acquainted with the intricacies of finance and monetary control and the result is that the debate on such matters is generally left to a few individuals and carried out with the usual Party thrust and parry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> I thought that was particularly so when I saw the terms of Deputy MacBride's motion recently in regard to the Central Bank.  Deputy MacBride objected that the Central Bank had not given us a report of their proceedings in the way that a football club would do it.  He put the point that under the Statute the only report they are required to make to the House is one showing the number of meetings held, the personnel that attended and the decisions taken.  He maintained that they have no right to express their views in what might be construed as a political fashion in such a way as to affect the general policy of the country. I think that is too narrow an approach to the matter.  I have no objection to the directors of the Central Bank, or to anyone else, expressing views.  The only objection I have to their views is that they appear to be antiquated and out-of-date, and people who express antiquated views in 1952 ought not to be in the position of governor or director of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Money, currency and monetary control and all the other expressions current in financial circles often create difficulties.  Undoubtedly the subject of finance contains some very complicated definitions, definitions that are deliberately put about by the bankers themselves for the purpose of confusing the issues and for the purpose of preventing the ordinary people understanding what goes on in the banks.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an authority on finance but I do endeavour to understand its relation to our national needs. I look on money, as I think every Deputy does, as having no value in itself.  I believe that is generally accepted.  Money is simply a voucher to enable goods and services to be exchanged.  It is a device for transferring wealth.  It stands to reason that if a nation is to be happy and contented there must be sufficient money in circulation to enable goods and services to be exchanged freely amongst the members of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary, yes.  I <Col N="46" /> think that is a sufficient definition of money and the purpose of money in so far as this debate is concerned.  Money has not the same value in one century that it has in another.  Three hundred years ago one might buy a cow for a few shillings.  Those were supposed to be the good old days but this country could not be kept running to-day if farmers had to sell their cows for a few shillings each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an enormous change in the value of money to-day as compared with the value it had prior to the First World War. Up to 1914 one could do amazingly well on a £.  To-day one can get very little for a £.  The value of money changes from century to century, from decade to decade and often from year to year. Every country should be in the position of so arranging its business that there will be a sufficiency of money in circulation to enable goods and services to be freely exchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When banks were first founded they acted as something in the nature of a trustee organisation.  Money was deposited with a bank.  The bank held it, paid interest on it, lent it out and returned it when the time came.  The money in which banks dealt at that time was money actually lent or lodged with them.  They held it in the same way as trustee securities would be held.  In time &mdash; I do not want to spend too long on this because it is purely historical &mdash; the function of the banks changed.  It is now a well-known fact and accepted by every economist and financial expert that banks lend out more money than they receive on deposit from their customers.  Statistics prove that for every £100 the banks get in they can lend out £1,000.  They consider themselves to have a very safe margin if they have £10 in hands for every £90 that they hand out.  The money that the bank hands out in that way is not money that is lodged with them or that is the property of any individual in the State.  It is money that they themselves create and lend out at an interest rate which they fix. They do that, as Deputy Hickey says, <Col N="47" /> on the credit of the country.  Deputies who speak in this House often forget that important fact.  They forget that the banks create money &mdash; and create as much as nine times the amount of money that is lodged and invested with them.  They lend that money out at interest and it is out of that interest that they make their very big profits that enable them to carry on in the luxurious way they do in this country. Even in small towns, you find three, four or five banks, all of which have luxurious premises and reasonably large staffs.  The money that they use for that purpose is money that they themselves create.  For a long time they tried to conceal that fact.  For a long time they did conceal it until, eventually, investigations showed that that was the position.</P>
    <P>We had the position, as mentioned by Deputy General Mulcahy, that the Government had a discussion with the banks in regard to money that was required for housing purposes in Dublin.  I asked Deputy General Mulcahy if the Government had any power to compel the banks to lend that money to the corporation &mdash; and, of course, the Government had no such power.  As a result of the discussion, apparently, the banks agreed to lend money to the corporation at 3½ per cent. &mdash; for which the corporation charged 4 per cent. to the people to whom they lent that money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the speech of an Independent Deputy on a matter of grave concern.  In my view, no Minister and no Government should have to sit down with the bankers and, by threats or otherwise, extract money from them &mdash; money that is required for a public and social purpose such as the building of houses.  Whether it be the Minister in the last Government or the present Minister, there should be no question of it.  The laws of this country should provide for the relationship between the banks and the Government and for the duties, obligations and responsibilities of the banks to the people.  I think the Government&mdash; whatever Government it is &mdash; should investigate very fully the position whereby banks create credit out of nothing by entries in their ledgers and lend that money out at 3½ per cent., 4 per cent., or 5 per cent., as the case may be.  They do it, not because it is their duty to do it or because a demand or a request, as the case may be, is made to them by the Government of the day.  That is the position of money and the position of banking as I understand it.</P>

    <P>Into all this problem of banking and money we had, since our State was established 30 years ago, two major efforts to deal with the financial position of the State.  I think those two major efforts are contained in the Central Bank Act and the Currency Act.  They followed from the reports of commissions that had been set up by the Government of the day.  We <Col N="49" /> set up a Central Bank.  That Central Bank was deliberately deprived of a function that it ought to have &mdash; the function of equating currency and credit with national production and the needs of the Irish nation.  While the Central Bank is a Central Bank in name it is not a Central Bank in fact. If we are to deal with the problems that confront us &mdash; and serious problems confront us as a nation &mdash; this House will have to consider seriously the question of amending the Central Bank Act at an early date so that the Central Bank will be given the power to provide the currency that we need for purposes of national production.  If the ordinary commercial banks can manufacture or make money &mdash; or create credit, as it is called &mdash; for their own purposes and their own profit, I think it is necessary, if we are to maintain our freedom, that our Central Bank should have the power to create credit for purposes of national production.  If we want to build houses &mdash; as we must build houses &mdash;we should build those houses not on money borrowed at 5 per cent. or 4 per cent. but on money created by our Central Bank and made available to our local authorities and to the Government at a nominal rate of interest.</P>
    <P>During the last war the British Government could obtain money from the joint stock banks at a very low rate of interest.</P>

      <P>They could obtain as much as they required.  If the war had lasted for another ten years, they could have obtained from those banks all the credit they required at that low rate of interest.  We in this country are concerned now with a war.  It is not a war against another nation but it is a war against poverty, slum conditions and unemployment.  In that war, we are entitled to use the very same implements in regard to finance that are used by big powers in the wars that they fight with other nations.</P>

      <P>If we have a Central Bank that will equate our currency and provide the credit we need for national production, then we can be happy about it.  Whatever money would be necessary to keep this country going would be provided by, or under the authority, or by the power or direction of that Central Bank.  Until we do that, we are in the unfortunate position that our Central Bank cannot create one pound note without having a British pound note as backing for it.  That is a bad position.  In previous debates in this House reference was made to the position of New Zealand &mdash; how New Zealand met the crisis, how New Zealand broke the link with sterling, how New Zealand had a different exchange rate, how it had an internal money system related to sterling and how it was necessary for New Zealand to do those things to end unemployment and to put an end to the impoverishment of their farmers and bring prosperity to the country.</P>
      <P>I think every Deputy should make it his business to study the steps taken by the Labour Government in New Zealand to deal with the very serious crisis that affected New Zealand at the time the Labour Government was called to office there.  In that study there are many valuable lessons for this country.  If our Central Bank is permitted to carry on as it is, we are entirely at the mercy of the British banking system.  I have the feeling, so far as our own commercial banks are concerned, that if there is any application made to them in a big way for money, they are advised, and take the advice and directions, from the Bank of England and the British joint stock banks.  I think very few Deputies would disagree with that statement of the relationship that exists between our banks and the British banking system.  It seems to me that a necessary step to be taken is to take control of our own finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate, references have been made to inflation and to deflation. The Minister has quoted a speech made by Deputy McGilligan in which he referred to the dangers of inflation and to the corrective steps that might <Col N="51" /> have to be taken in regard to them. I think there has been too much talk about the dangers of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>About the danger of deflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think deflation is much the more serious danger but unfortunately it seems we are being pushed into a deflationary situation and a deflationary situation would be bad for this country.  Deflation will lead to unemployment.  It will lead to ordinary shopkeepers being unable to sell their goods and ordinary people being unable to buy the goods produced by our manufacturers. If the ordinary people cannot buy the goods that are being produced by our manufacturers, it means that people employed in these industries will lose their employment and you will get into a very vicious circle because once the spending power of the people is injuriously affected, it has its reaction right round in a circle. The farmer will have difficulty in disposing of certain of his produce; the manufacturer will have difficulty in disposing of the goods he makes; the shopkeeper, the distributor or the retailer will have difficulty in selling and gradually, in every link of the chain, there will be unemployment, and unemployment at the moment leads only to one thing and that is emigration.  The more people who emigrate to Britain the fewer people there are in this country to buy the goods manufactured by our manufacturers or produced by our farmers.  So that this deflationary process that has set in&mdash;at least I think it has set in&mdash; will have injurious results on the economy of the country in that it will lead to if persisted in or pursued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I just want to deal with the matter in my own way. It will lead to unemployment and emigration and the more emigration we have, the fewer people there will be to buy goods here and to keep the economy of the country going, resulting in more unemployment and more emigration. I think that any Government that is in power will have to consider <Col N="52" />&mdash;we shall all have to consider&mdash;in the national interest what is the best policy to pursue in that regard.  It seems to me that reasonable inflation within control is the proper way in which you can deal with the present position, that we must give people more spending power.  By giving people more spending power, we create a better market for our manufacturers, we bring business to our distributors and retailers.  We create new employment in industry and in the distributing lines.  The more money that is to be spent, the more of the farmers' produce can be bought by our own people. Only in that way can we arrest the drain of emigration which in itself assists and creates unemployment.</P>
      <P>I think I said at the beginning that the members of the Central Bank who would give the advice to the Government that has been given in the report for last year are not the right men, in my view, to have in charge of our currency or our monetary affairs in 1952.  I think the same remark applies to the advisers of the Minister for Finance, whether the present Minister or his predecessor.  I was amazed some years ago when I read the report of the Drainage Commission.  On that Drainage Commission was an official of the Department of Finance and he brought in his own report, so far as I recollect.  I did not think that I should have an opportunity of taking part in the debate this evening and I intended to look up that report and have it for reference.</P>
      <P>He brought in a report in which he opposed drainage.  The country, he said, could not stand it.  That was his mentality, as it was the mentality of the bankers ten or 15 years ago that it was wrong to spend so much money on houses.  The advisers of the Department of Finance have been there for nearly 30 years and they are in a groove.</P>

      <P>Anyway, the view that I have formed over a number of years is this: that we are, and have been for 30 years, on the wrong lines and that we have got to change them.  I have listened to Budget speeches made by Deputy McGilligan and I have listened to Budget speeches made by the present Minister for Finance, and I could see no difference between those speeches.  Deputy McGilligan gilded some portions of his to make them taste a little better.  The present Minister served them up just as they were.  That was the only difference that I could see.  I say that as an Independent Deputy who believes that there is a great lot to be done in regard to finance control if this country is to be prosperous.  I certainly will not get into an argument between the Minister and Deputy McGilligan as to what either of them said in any year, but when I examine their speeches I find that both of them have said the same thing.</P>

      <P>I am putting forward the view that it is necessary to have a big change if this nation is to be saved.  I remember the time when the financial adviser of the then Minister for Finance advised him to take 1/- off the old age pensioners.  Men like them, who would so advise, should be brought out to the block and have their heads cut off.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say, and I do say, that men like the governor and directors of the Central Bank who give the advice they do give would, in other times and in other countries, be placed on the block, because the advice which they have given is bad advice, and dangerous advice for the country.  We have just got to face up to that situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy talked about getting money from the Post Office, and getting money here and there.  That is only toying with the problem.  Deputy MacBride was only toying with the problem when he talked about the proceedings of the Central Bank and said that we should have a record of the times they met, who was present and what they decided.  That is only toying with a serious problem.  I think that I am entitled, having looked at this for 30 years, to come to the conclusion that all is not well in regard to our position with finance.  We want new advisers and we want new experts. Other countries do not object to going outside and bringing in an acknowledged expert to give them advice.  I read that some of the Mediterranean countries brought in Dr. Schacht from Germany.  We could do very well by bringing into this country a person of acknowledged authority.  I think it will be accepted by everybody that the Civil Service is not the place in which a man can be trained to be a financier, the type of financier that will be able to run the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned war earlier in my speech.  If, for any reason this country were to be involved in a war to-morrow in which we would spend millions of money, our financial advisers could not stop that war with their advice.  There are only two things they could do. One would be to do the best they could to provide the finance, and the other would be to commit suicide.  That is all they could do.  They dare not say to the Government: &ldquo;No, you cannot go on with the war, you have not enough money to fight it.&rdquo;  But we are engaged in another war: in a war <Col N="55" /> against poverty, in a war against the slums and in a war against unemployment. Why should these alleged financial experts say to the Minister: &ldquo;No, you cannot fight that war; let our people continue to live in the slums; let them be hungry and let them take the emigrant ship: no, you cannot do it, because that is the sort of finance that we learned when we were part of the British machine, so you just cannot do that&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I have spoken on this matter because, I think, it is necessary that the viewpoint which I am expressing should be voiced here in the House.  This country of Ireland is ours.  It does not belong to the political Parties on either side; it belongs to all of us, and it is our duty, when we see a serious situation, to try and get out of it.  I want to see more money, more purchasing power, being put at the disposal of our people. I want to see our civil servants, our Guards, our Army and our teachers paid enough money to enable them to live a decent life.  I want to see those people being given purchasing power to enable them to purchase the materials which our shopkeepers and our retailers have to offer, and which our manufacturers and our farmers produce.  I want to see our old age pensioners, our widows and their orphaned children and our pensioners of all kinds in receipt of purchasing power so that they may be enabled to buy the things which they need, and so that they may be able to live an ordinary Christian life in a Christian country.  I want to see our agricultural workers, our skilled craftsmen and our unskilled labourers all getting a decent wage, and I want to see our farmers and producers getting a decent income from their hard work.  It is clear, from the way in which we have been carrying on for the last 30 years, from the way in which we have carried on under the financial system that we inherited, that that cannot be done.  It can only be done by a new approach.  I think that we can have that new approach if only we determine to have it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, when he spoke on the Central Bank Acts, did give expression to views somewhat like <Col N="56" /> those which I am now expressing.  He did give expression to quite a number of views in regard to monetary reform and monetary reorganisation, but, unfortunately, although the matter was put to him time and again by questions in the House, he did not avail of the opportunity he got as Minister for Finance to bring in the amending legislation which would enable these things to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they are powerful or not, the point is that it will take a long period of education before our leading politicians come to a decision to change things as they are and to use our finances in the interests of the people.  A lot of the problems which cause trouble and confusion here can only be solved if we take the proper steps to solve them and the principal and primary and necessary step, in my view, is to give powers to the Central Bank that will enable it to operate in the interests of the Irish people, that will enable it to provide the money that we need for housing or for works of a productive nature at a rate of interest that will be reasonable, perhaps ½ per cent., perhaps 1 per cent. but no more than that.  But we are in pawn at the moment to the commercial banks, who apparently do not yet understand their responsibility to the Irish community.</P>
      <P>There was a very bitter fight to establish this House, a very bitter fight to achieve freedom and liberty in this country, but a fight was never fought for the purpose of enabling a few people who have control of the banks to strangle the life-blood of this country, and that is what they are doing.  As I say, as an Independent Deputy I can only express my view and my view is that this reorganisation is necessary and must take place and I should like to hear other Deputies who believe in that idea express it, because I think it is time that we did take control of this very vital matter of our own finances and our own monetary policy.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speech we have heard from the Deputy <Col N="57" /> who has just sat down, one could hardly believe that in the month of April this year he voted to cut subsidies and to impose taxes upon the beer and tobacco of the people.  He did that while voting for a Budget which was framed at least on the advice of the bankers, certainly on the advice of the Central Bank, and particularly on the advice of the officials whom, apparently, he is so anxious to condemn now.  That was the Deputy's action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see that. The Deputy says that my language when Minister for Finance was the same.  Let us not bother about language, and look at the activity.  I spent three years and a bit reducing taxation, developing certain capital schemes, inaugurating a new method of capitalising those schemes, and that was met by a tornado of abuse from the time the new Government came into office until April this year.  Then we reached the culminating point, that what was done in three and a half years was all wrong, was recklessly extravagant and was leading to the destruction of the State.  Deputies were asked to rally round and vote for the cuts in the subsidies and for the heavy taxation which the Budget imposed.  Deputy Cowan is one of those who went into the Lobby to support that, and actions speak louder than words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long ago, after the Siege of Troy, the lady who had brought it about was apostrophised and it was said that hers was the face that launched a thousand ships.  Deputies around the Minister can speak of him now as the man who lost thousands of votes and is rapidly bringing a lot of Deputies to the point when they will talk of the time when they were members of Dáil Éireann, and when they will be given, I suppose, the honorific title of ex-T.D. Looking at it in retrospect, however, it will be very lacking in consolation. I have no doubt that that will be their fate and that that is why Deputy Cowan made the speech he made to-day. But his actions in the Division Lobby speak much louder than his <Col N="58" /> words.  I agree with a lot of what he said, but I do want to prove that the speech he made this evening is in complete contradistinction to the life which he has been forced to lead by giving loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party since they became the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You got the same advice as they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I undoubtedly got much the same advice but I objected to the advice I got to over-tax, to tax for a surplus, and I refused to do it. I said that I believed that the present Minister got exactly the same advice but the difference was that he took it. The Minister opened his speech on this matter by pretending that it was in defence of the White Paper of 1951.  It is not necessary to go into the whole details of this White Paper, but there are two or three startling things in it which should be referred to in order to get a correct view of the White Paper.  Deputy Dillon, in his motion, spoke of this, I think, as a disreputable document and stated that it was tendentious nonsense and should not be produced before Dáil Éireann.  Leaving out the rhetorical phrases, I agree with the Deputy that the White Paper was misleading.  I cannot understand how it came to be written, except that the Minister himself took, so to speak, the gloomy side of the advice given to him and hid the offsetting good points which might possibly have been made to him.  In any event the White Paper is on record as saying, on page 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The inescapable conclusion is that substantial relief to the balance of payments can only be achieved by importing less.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the mood.  There are two ways of dealing with the balance of payments so as not to leave any deficit: one is by exporting more and, if that is not possible, the second is to confine oneself to slashing imports.  Of course, there is a middle way open by doing a little of both, increasing exports and possibly collapsing imports, where that can be done without damage to the political or economic programme of the Government.  But here definitely on page 8 we have it that: &ldquo;The <Col N="59" /> inescapable conclusion is that substantial relief to the balance of payments can only be achieved by importing less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Remember, when we started on the programme which it was alleged brought about this terrific unbalance in the payments, we were moving in the region of forecast.  Possibly there was something in the nature of prophecy about it.  We made a forecast after getting all the advice possible, after surveying the figures supplied and making up our own minds with regard to such things as tendency to improvement or, still further, dis-improvement, with regard to the terms of trade and with regard to all the various matters that had to be brought into the picture before a view could really be formed.  We thought that improvement could be achieved through exports.  When we examined the imports we felt that the imports situation in itself was likely to mend &mdash;that imports would lessen in volume and that their price would be balanced by the better price likely to be got for our exports.  Many of our Deputies made that case here on the Supplies and Services legislation last year.  We pointed out that the terms of trade had gone against us on account of Korea&mdash; that, of course, was on the import side &mdash;and that the terms of trade were likely to improve when the swing in prices affected the value we were getting for our exports.  We pointed out that a good deal of the imports were due to stockpiling which we ourselves were doing for Government Departments, secondly, to stockpiling which we had asked traders to do through the city and through the country and, thirdly, because many private citizens, reading the signs as we read them, thought it necessary in their own interests to do a little stockpiling each on his own.  We pointed out that that period of stockpiling would come to an end as a result of satisfaction or satiety or because of a change in the world situation that would render stockpiling unnecessary. In addition we pointed out that the prices we would get for our exports were likely to rise when the Korean incident which had raised the prices <Col N="60" /> of the things we bought had had its full effect and given us increased prices for what we sent to the British or other markets.  Finally we pointed out that due to the measures we had taken the volume of exports could increase and would increase.  That was the plan we had.</P>
    <P>The White Paper disavowed all that. The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from it is that a substantial relief in the balance of payments could be achieved only by importing less.  What are the facts?  We are now outside the region of forecast.  We now can see the figures.  Can anybody deny that when the end of this year comes and we have a complete balance as far as international payments are concerned, the 50 per cent. improvements will have been achieved not through cutting imports but through increasing exports either in volume or by getting better prices for them?  What was the likely deficit in the balance of payments? This, it should be remembered, is a document produced and presented to the House in October, 1951.  The addendum on page 15 shows that it took into consideration the figures for imports and exports for September of that year.  Therefore it can be regarded as a document based on nine months of the calendar year of 1951. Paragraph 30 in page 13 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The forecast of the deficit in the balance of payments in 1951 is based on favourable assumptions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It meant that it probably could go worse but that the balance could not be any better than was forecast.  The paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Full account has been taken of the normal seasonal increase in both the volume and price of exports in the later months of the year.  Assuming an uninterrupted flow of imports the deficit in the balance of payments is likely, therefore, to be in the region of £70,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was not a forecast to any great extent because the addendum brought the information up to date at the end of September.  There were only three months ahead for which anything in the nature of a guess had to be made. Yet, published in October, fortified by <Col N="61" /> the September figures and with only three months to run, the forecast is a deficit of £70,000,000.  When the end of the year came that figure was shown to be falsified by £10,000,000.  Deputy Dillon makes the point that it was £10,000,000 in a quarter of the year.</P>
    <P>Those are the two main features of this White Paper on which the Budget was based.  Its inescapable conclusion was that the only way to achieve a better balance in our payments on the international side was to import less, and, secondly, that the deficit in the balance of payments was likely to be £70,000,000.  On the 14th of November, 1951, the present Minister is reported in column 725 of the Official Report as saying: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The assumption on which the deficit of £70,000,000 in the balance of payments for 1951 rests is that the excessive imports over the last five months of the year will be £10,000,000 greater than in the last quarter of 1950, as compared with an increase of £31.7 millions in the first eight months of the year over the corresponding period in 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then this was solemnly stated in the House: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the basis of the available figures, there is no reason, no rational ground, for changing the estimate of £70,000,000 deficit in our balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although the White Paper is only an October Paper it is based on the figures for the first nine months of the year and £70,000,000 is the figure.  By mid-November the Minister has got another month and a half to consider the whole matter and there are only six or seven weeks of the calendar year to run.  Yet he bases his whole policy again on the fact that there will be a deficit of £70,000,000 in that year.  We say that that was falsified to the extent of £10,000,000, and that that £10,000,000 error is, so far as the Minister is concerned, confined to the last six weeks of the calendar year and, so far as the White Paper is concerned, confined to a period of three months &mdash; the last three months of the calendar year.</P>
    <P>There were two assumptions: that there was a bad deficit which was likely <Col N="62" /> to be £70,000,000 in 1951 and likely to be £50,000,000 in the financial year 1952/53 and on those assumptions regarding the deficits the Budget policy was framed.  The Budget policy was also framed on what the White Paper said: that the only way to rectify the balance was to cut imports and that exports, so to speak, were out.  The Budget was later introduced on the 2nd April this year and in column 1124 of the Official Report on that day the Minister is recorded as saying this: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Allowing for a favourable turn in the terms of trade, for some drawing-down of stocks and for increased tourist income, the balance of payments deficit which we faced at the beginning of 1952 was about £50,000,000.  The only way, therefore, to achieve a reduction in this figure is for the Government to bring its receipts and expenditure into closer accord and for the community as a whole to save more and to spend less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that that is the April, 1952 mood developed from the White Paper of October, 1951 and from the Minister's own views expressed in November, 1951.  Continuing after the portion I have already quoted, the Minister said: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot afford the present scale of spending abroad in excess of our current external earnings.  It is an unhealthy economy in which net saving has ceased, consumption has outrun income, and even existing domestic capital is being in part maintained by realising external assets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again the emphasis is on cutting: &ldquo;We cannot afford the present scale of spending abroad in excess of our current external earnings&rdquo;.  According to the forecast there was to be a deficit in the year we are in of £50,000,000. From that the Minister went on to say in column 1127: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a necessary corollary to those two conditions of the economic recovery there must be the greatest restraint in relation to increases in income whether in the form of profits, wages or salaries.  Our urgent need is <Col N="63" /> for an increase in thrift and saving which, at the expense of a temporary and voluntary reduction in personal spending, would provide resources for the capital development which is required to sustain and increase our living standards.  More spending would simply mean greater imports of consumer goods, a wider gap in the balance of payments and a more rapid depletion of external capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After that the Minister came to the heart of the matter in column 1138, where he said: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have given careful thought to this problem over recent months.  They are satisfied that, as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living and as essential foodstuffs are no longer scarce, there is now no economic or social justification for a policy of subsidising food for everybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the same column he pointed out: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ease the process of adjustment to real costs, it is not intended to withdraw the food subsidies completely this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister wanted a bit in hand, probably for the health scheme next year, through a further cut in the flour and bread subsidies.  Am I wrong in assuming that the Budget policy has been one which aimed at reducing the spending power in the hands of the community?  If the food subsidies were cut, as the Minister cut them, was it not quite clear to the Minister's mind that there would be less money in hand to spend on certain other things?  He expected that the same amount of bread and flour, sugar and tea, would be consumed but as these would cost more, the conclusion clearly was there would be less money in the people's hands to spend on such things as items of apparel, houses and house furnishings. I suggest that that policy was clear.  It was to stop the inflow of purchasing power into the hands of the people; in that way you would stop the excessive spending abroad, and in that way you would be in line with what the White Paper called &ldquo;the inescapable <Col N="64" /> conclusion&rdquo;, namely, the only way of getting substantial relief in our balance of payments is by importing less.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the White Paper had those two grievous errors.  It stated the deficit to be £70,000,000, when only six weeks after, in November, we had the Minister's statement showing us that the calculation was £10,000,000 out on a quarter of the year.  In order to rectify the position as it had been stated, number one, that the deficit last year, would be £70,000,000, although it was not, and the deficit this year would be £50,000,000, there was, of course, a great need to collapse purchasing power in the next five months, and that the Budget set out to do.</P>
    <P>As I said in regard to these matters, after the war in Korea had started the Government information was that prices were rising and the cost of necessary imports was going to fall much heavier on the community than before.  We must remember that we were in the region of forecast, possibly in the region of attempting to prophesy what was likely to come.  As I said, it was not a rash forecast.  We made our forecast based upon our judgment. That judgment was based upon figures that were presented to us, figures that showed the actuality, figures that tried to project themselves into the future. We took into consideration the trend of trade and examined the objects which were likely to be purchased at the enhanced prices.  We were very much in the region of forecast and we did make our programme.  The programme we had before our minds was not to any degree lessened or diminished in the amount we intended to spend because of what had happened.  We felt there were certain correctives to be applied. We felt the balance of payments would not be as big when certain accidental matters had passed.  We felt also that the terms of trade would take up in our favour.  In addition to all that, we felt that the export situation was improving and that we would have more money arising from those exports to spend on those necessary imports.</P>
    <P>I suggest that what has happened since the outbreak of war in Korea to this particular date has shown that our <Col N="65" /> programme was a good one and that in so far as we did forecast anything, the forecast was an accurate one.  I want to put in contradistinction to that the forecast of the White Paper of October, 1951, the Minister's forecast in November, 1951, as well as the Minister's forecast made on 2nd April, 1952.  Again to mark the contrast, this surely must be taken into consideration: the Minister was not so much prophesying or forecasting as we were.  He had evidence through the months that had gone, the last three months of 1951 and the earlier months of 1952.  These months gave him evidence as to the change in trade.  These months certainly showed him, according to the Tánaiste here recently, that the terms of trade had substantially altered in our favour in the first three months of the year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all this they went wrong, and they went wrong in a way that has hurt the community and has led to the outbreak of indignation on their part which gave us a new Deputy to this House.  There was no necessity for the Budget harshness of 1952.  As far as that necessity was based upon wrong figures, then the Minister is responsible for accepting the wrong figures.  If he is still relying on the same type of figures now being produced he ought to learn from the past particularly when that error is so near to him.</P>
    <P>This year we are told the situation has improved.  It has improved and as regards the international payments side, exports are responsible for half of that improvement.  In so far as it is a question of reducing imports, the terms of trade are helping there.  We were doing stockpiling when we thought it was necessary and the community, following our lead, were doing likewise because they thought it was necessary.  That stockpiling is now apparently over.  Not merely is that the case but the Central Bank report this year calls attention to the fact that the situation in regard to imports is due to what they call destocking. That does not mean stockpiling.  It means running down not merely the stocks brought in on the programme of stockpiling but it even means running <Col N="66" /> down the stocks of tobacco which we had and of which we left a two years' supply to the Minister.  The same thing will apply to many other commodities where many years' supplies of different items were left.  A fictitious improvement to that extent in the balance of payments has been achieved by the Minister and his Government through running those stocks down.  I do not know what the argument this time is on the part of the Government, but coming from the Minister it is that he is trying to gear our whole economy to a war situation.  In any event there is an improvement and the improvement was marked even in October 1951. It was more marked in November 1951. It was so marked that the Minister could hardly have failed to realise it when it came to his Budget in 1952 except for the fact that he had gone moaning up and down the country and it was not opportune for him to retract at that time.  The country had to be made pay for all the advice that he got that was bad in itself and was worse on account of his taking it.</P>
    <P>We did feel it was necessary to keep the programme under review although we did not modify it.  We did not feel there was any necessity to modify it. We felt confident that what we were doing was correct.  We felt that the bad times anticipated were due to the Korean upset and even though the war in Korea itself had not passed, we felt that there was no reason to alter the orderly and systematic programme we had set before ourselves.  We did on that occasion what must have been unexampled in the history of this country.  We called into conference the editorial representatives of the four daily newspapers of this country in the autumn of 1950.  We told them what we were doing.  We explained our programme to them.  Part of the terms used to that group was that it was quite certain that there would be a marked disequilibrium in the balance of payments on account of what we are doing, and that that would occur pretty well immediately.  We told them that we were not anxious about that.  We were not anxious because we did not believe that it would have a repercussion of a permanent type upon the economy of the country.  We put the <Col N="67" /> cards on the table before the representatives of the four daily newspapers in the country.  We did tell them we relied upon them, on account of a danger we indicated to them, not to give publicity to this matter at the time.  The danger we pointed out to them was that as we were going in for stockpiling, if attention was suddenly directed to the marked deterioration in the balance of payments situation or to any great increase for a couple of months in either the value or the volume of imports, it would make it much more difficult and more expensive for those whom we were sending to purchase stores which we thought were necessary stores for Government Departments.  That is in the memory of the four editorial representatives of those papers who met me and colleagues of mine.  They know that in 1950 we anticipated that there would be a worsening of conditions on the surface and temporarily. We warned them of what we were at and we told them why we were going to continue along the path we were travelling.  We exposed our hand to them and we explained to them the reason why we thought that was not going to be of any future harm, that the situation would rectify itself.  We gave them data upon which we came to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>So far as prophecy was concerned, so far as forecasting was concerned, we had a programme.  We had a programme that was not indifferent to the circumstances of the time.  We had a programme that in no way neglected the immediate bad return that there was going to be from it but we were confident that the programme would work out.  We felt so firm in that belief that we did, as I say, what must have been unexampled in the history of this country, by making that clear to four editorial representatives that that was the plan and that that was going to continue, that it was likely to have certain results, which would be passing, and that the new situation would develop along the line we forecast because of the examples that we gave them and the arguments that we used to them.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that and notwithstanding, <Col N="68" /> as I say, that we were forecasting and that there was no great certainty about matters, the Minister imposed this Budget of 1952 on the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan talks here to-day about the bankers and his hatred and detestation of bankers.  He also criticised the Minister for having accepted the advice that came to him, as he puts it, through banker channels, or, else, through people whom he puts in at least as poor a category as the bankers themselves.  It is too late for a Deputy Cowan or any other member of the Party that accepted the Minister's arguments to speak in the circumstances. The Deputy accepted the Budget and the Deputy and other Deputies had pointed out to them that there was a philosophy behind the Budget, the philosophy of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that it was based upon these two fundamental errors in the White Paper &mdash; the one that said we could only achieve good in the bad situation that there was represented to be by cutting imports; and the second, that in the year towards which the Budget was looking, a deficit of £50,000,000 had to be contemplated. We challenged both these figures as well as one other matter and against us were all the Fianna Fáil Deputies and the four or five satellites who were in support of them.  They were in support of a policy that was clearly stated and made clear in argument &mdash; it was, that money had to be taken out of the people's pockets by taxation of a fierce type as, otherwise, that money would be spent in such a way as would call for imports from England and, therefore, this gruesome matter of the balance of payments would not have been correctly managed.  That was the whole theory of the Budget.</P>
    <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis this year the Tánaiste could say that, of course, they were not against a readjustment of wages to meet the new condition.  The Budget was.  The background of the Budget was that people were spending too much because they had too much to spend.  There was that simple phrase of the Minister's in column 1138 that the Government were <Col N="69" /> satisfied that as incomes generally have already advanced more than the cost of living there was no justification then for the policy of subsidies.</P>
    <P>If language means anything, does that mean anything else than this: &ldquo;Over the three years of the inter-Party Government your salaries and wages got a little bit in advance of the cost of living figures.  We are going to meet that by raising the cost of living so as to take away from all of you wage and salary earners the amount that you got extra over and above the cost of living?&rdquo;  If there is any meaning to be read into this phrase other than that, I would like to hear it.  That was a phrase that I said was paraphrased in this House as meaning that people were too well-off and the Minister was going to see that he would reduce them to the old-time situation where at least the cost-of-living index figure would be somewhat in advance of the figure that measured the increase in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>That was a vicious policy.  It was a policy which was accompanied by depression all round.  It was meant to cause depression all round.  It was meant to leave less money in people's hands for their purchasing.  If that was the case, it meant clearly that business must go bad.  In addition to that, bank credit was restricted so that people, where they could not earn, were not going to be permitted to borrow, even where the borrowing was for schemes that had been previously sanctioned and that, apparently, the banks thought were good schemes.  In those circumstances, the restriction of bank credit added to the lessening of purchasing power in the people's hands was inevitably going to bring about recession in business and that everybody knows to be here over the last year and a half.</P>

      <P>There are two grave errors in the White Paper.  Those two grave errors were accepted by the Minister.  As the months went on and the new figures came in, revealing how glaring these errors were, the Minister did not change.  He carried forward <Col N="70" /> the mood of the October White Paper into November in the speech I have quoted and again into April and, in the months that followed, when the Budget and the Financial Resolution and the whole Finance Bill went through this House, again and again the Minister led his followers in the various divisions that were challenged to make them vote against the people, to make them vote against the standard of living of the people, to make them vote for depression in the lives of the people, to make them vote for depression in business, to bring about the condition that was represented here recently to the arbitration board in connection with the Civil Service that, for the first year in about seven years, the return from direct taxation, that is to say, the return from taxes on income, from taxes on trading profits, will be down next year.  It will have to be down. When one works for depression, reduced trade and reduced profits, the conclusion must follow.  The conclusion was there and that is the conclusion that, deliberately, Deputies who are facing me brought about in the attack on the people's standard of living based upon the glaring error that this had to be done in order to rectify the balance of payments and, in any event, whether it was right or not, sure, were not the Government satisfied that salaries had gone higher than the cost of living warranted and, therefore, was it not proper to reduce the standard of living of the people by reducing those wages and salaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told in the Budget speech of 1952 that the Budget I left did not balance.  I made comments upon that conclusion that very day and now that we are still further from it let me go through the figures again.  The deficit was said to be £6.7 million &mdash; that is for the last year.  In that £6.7 million alleged deficit there is £3,100,000 for fuel losses.  The Tánaiste himself had said that if that sum of money was added to the national debt it was well done and that we were as well out of the war situation, better out, than any nation in the world.  Of course, he made the point of putting in as something naturally not to be met out of current revenue, the new prices that were due to be met and which had <Col N="71" /> been fixed for meat and butter, £600,000.</P>
    <P>When the Tánaiste was bringing in two Estimates for Córas Iompair Éireann, he pointed out two items, stockpiling and future replacement of some of the capital goods of Córas Iompair Éireann, £850,000.  Those three items together came to £4.6 million. Take those from the alleged deficit of £6.7 million and we have to answer only for £2,100,000.  The forecast for the next year showed that the revenue was expanding, as it had done in each of the previous four or five years, when there had been an expansion in revenue, mainly in income-tax, which was up £2,750,000.  If those were the only commitments to be carried forward to the next year, and if the Minister had made no new commitments &mdash; the Minister could not include the turf losses again, they had not to be met a second time &mdash; and if he had accepted only my own commitments and taken away only the fuel losses and the stockpiling and the replacement for Córas Iompair Éireann, there was left a sum of money which could have been and would have been equal to the new revenue which was forecasted and which is now in process of being gathered in.  The extra revenue of £2.7 million would have given a balance in the Budget on the commitments carried in and left something in the neighbourhood of £750,000 over. In addition, it is now known that, in an account for which he said there was a deficit of £6.7 million, the Minister carried out £2,860,000.</P>
    <P>I wonder if in the history of trade and commerce or even of governmental finance there is any example of anything similar to that &mdash; a declaration that the Budget is unbalanced to the extent of £6,750,000, while the man who so declares has in hands £2,750,000 in cash.  Yet that is the pretence which was forced on the country.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Budget speech, as reported at column 1130, he told us that the computation for the year 1951-52 showed expenditure amounting to £87.9 million.  Included in that <Col N="72" /> £87.9 million there is expenditure on reserve stocks £1.8 million and there is £2.7 million paid in discharge of arrears on the fuel subsidy.  £1.8 million was a forecast; the actuality was about £0.8 million.  There was stockpiling to the extent of £800,000 and arrears of fuel subsidy paid in the year were £2.7 million.  That is £3,500,000, all told.  There was no stockpiling, I understand, arranged for this year and there was certainly going to be no fuel losses.  Between those two items last year you had expenditure of £3,500,000 and we are told that the total expenditure in fact proved to be £87.9 million.  If you subtract the items not going to recur, £3,500,000, from the £87.9 million, you get £84.4 million.  The revenue, according to the White Paper produced with the Budget, was estimated at £86,581,000, so the revenue for the year we are in, with no extra commitments by the Minister, amounted to £86,500,000, while the expenditure that he had, leaving out fuel losses and stockpiling, was £84,500,000. Therefore, the Minister had £2,000,000 to spare on that calculation.  Yet I am told that was a Budget that was in arrear.  I know the difference between one year and another.</P>
    <P>What I am pointing out is that the Minister has made a pretence before the public that the Civil Service could not get an increase in salaries, neither could teachers, the Army nor the Gardaí, unless the subsidies had been cut.  I pointed out to him that he estimated the yearly expenditure for 1951-52 at something short of £88,000,000 &mdash; £87,900,000.  In that there were fuel losses and some element of stockpiling and I take those off and it comes to £84,500,000.  In that £84,500,000 there were the payments for the Civil Service, not merely for a year but for 15 months and there were payments with retrospection to the other three classes I have named &mdash; the Gardaí, the Army and the teachers; so that there was more than a full year's payment for those classes in that figure of something short of £88,000,000.  Yet the Minister is able to face the House here and say that owing to the expansionist policy we carried out, revenue is still on the <Col N="73" /> upgrade and the revenue forecasted adding in the Minister's taxes, with no subsidy, and the whiskey, tobacco and beer taxes, was of the order of £86,581,000.  So even if the Minister were going to pay this year again 15 months' payments to the Civil Service and others, he had £2,000,000 in hands to play with, arising out of the good condition of things that we left.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan objects now to being at the mercy of the bankers, but Deputy Cowan voted to cut the subsidies, on the first presentation of the case made by the Minister.  Deputy Cowan says that the present Minister and I talk the same language, the jargon, so to speak, of public finance. I suggest that it is not the speech that counts, but the activity.  I was advised to overtax in order to get the money required for those capital purchases we had in the Estimates.  But I thought them to be apt for borrowing. I was asked to get that money by over-taxation and I refused to take it that way.  I expressed the opinion this year that the present Minister was getting the same advice and was taking it.  I believe he is still taking it.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a poor mouth with regard to the present Budget. He has told &mdash; for, of course, the special purpose of prejudicing the arbitration award &mdash; the public, through his representatives, that the subsidies had to be cut in order to allow the Civil Service payments and that next year was going to be far harder than this year.  He has told us that the taxes that he imposed in April of this year are not producing the desired revenue. Certain items were spoken of at that arbitration, the tot of which I made out to be £4,500,000, and if that is a true calculation it means that the revenue forecast in the Budget is going to be down by about £4,000,000.  I know nothing of that.  It may well be that when we were criticising the Minister's policy in April of this year we did not make enough allowance for what inefficiency and blundering and bungling could do.  It may be that we underestimated the effect on the public of the hardships imposed by the Budget.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 23, to delete &ldquo;December&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;July.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is to reduce by six months the period during which the Minister is to bring in a permanent Bill.  It is quite clear that there is grave dissatisfaction amongst both tenants and property owners in regard to the delay.  The case has been made to me that both sides require and are anxious to obtain at the earliest possible moment permanent legislation.  Speaking on the Second Reading, I repeated the criticism of my efforts when I brought in my Bill in 1951, that it would take two years which was too long.  The Minister is now adding another year to what he himself and some of his supporters behind him admitted was too long a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with that and I respectfully submit, Sir, that the Minister had in the six months between now and July ample time to bring in a permanent measure thereby meeting the wishes of both the tenants and the property owners.  There is insecurity for the tenants who are not sure of what the conditions will be at the end of 12 months in regard to the protection which they have at the moment and for the landlords or property owners &mdash; I think it is better to call them property owners than landlords &mdash; inasmuch as they are afraid to make <Col N="75" /> agreements with people for the renting of houses to which the Rent Restrictions Act does not apply.</P>
    <P>With regard to the houses outside the scope of the Act, there was evidence at the time that the property owners in Cork, for instance, were increasing out of all proportion the rent of certain houses.  I think that, as the Act stands, they were at liberty to do so.  I am aware that in certain cases in the city, property owners are making full use of the exemptions that already exist.  On the other hand, I am aware that property owners are suffering very grave hardships. I do not know what the rights or wrongs of that are but the Rent Commission was set up to inquire into all these matters and they have made a report.</P>
    <P>I think we are suffering from a certain disability in not having that report. To-day I asked the Minister if he proposed publishing it and if the Government had decided anything in the matter.  The Minister said that no decision had been taken but that the report was being published.  For the purpose of assisting us on this side of the House, as well as assisting himself, the Minister should have given us an advance copy of that report so that we would be in a position to know what the recommendations were when this measure was brought in.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows what is in the report at the moment and knows whether 12 months is necessary or not. I do not know, but having regard to the evidence which I possess, the conclusion I have come to is that 12 months is too long and six months is ample.  I, therefore, move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse the suggestion to expedite permanent legislation in regard to this matter.  I think there is a very strong feeling that a grave injustice is being done in not having legislation of a fair and reasonable nature put into operation. We know that the report of the commission is in the hands of the Minister for a very considerable time.  I think it is desirable that he should take all <Col N="76" /> possible steps to introduce legislation in the light of that report.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy MacEoin that it is rather unfair to Deputies generally that they had not an opportunity of seeing this report.  I hope it will be made available as soon as possible. As I have said, there are grave injustices to both sides as far as this matter is concerned.  Some people who are tenants may be aggrieved and others may be very much aggrieved as property owners.  I know that at the present time the Secretary of the Property Owners' Association is in prison for protesting against the injustices in the Act.  At least I think he is still there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, he is in prison on a charge of having made a protest against the injustices in the present Rent Restrictions Act.  There are injustices not only to the tenant but also to the owners of property, people with very moderate means who put their entire savings into building in the city or elsewhere in the county and improved their property for the purpose of providing housing accommodation for their fellow citizens. Having done that, they find that the receipts which they obtain from that property are less than the cost of maintaining the property.  They find that they cannot obtain possession of their property and cannot sell it.</P>
      <P>In many cases there are people who own a fairly considerable amount of house property who are actually starving because of the operations of the Act.  We have got to view this Act from both sides, and we have got to see that justice is done.  I hope that when the Minister introduces permanent legislation it will be such as will leave no scope for the widespread complaints which we hear in regard to the present Act.</P>

      <P>Do not mind the 24 hours.  We have set up machinery &mdash; archaic and cumbersome machinery, I admit &mdash; to deal with a number of matters.  Once we pass Christmas, we get into the financial business and the Budget.  There is no other type of legislation dealt with in the period between the beginning of the New Year and the adjournment for the long vacation. I do not know what the commission has reported to the Minister, but I do know that I went before the commission and gave evidence on what I considered to be an important aspect of this problem &mdash; the position of the tenants of property owned by corporations, county councils and other local authorities.  I raised it in the House on a number of occasions.  The position is that the tenant of a county council house, a corporation house, a local authority house, has no security whatever.  He may be served with notice to quit and possession demanded &mdash; I doubt if even that part of it is necessary &mdash; and he can be brought to court, and the county manager, who is in fact the person who operates these provisions, need give no reason whatever to the court, and he must get a decree and eviction.  I consider that such a grave injustice that I went before the commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will require a considerable amount of consideration and discussion, and if the Bill can be brought in within the period mentioned, I think the Minister will have done good work.  What we want now is an Act that will really operate. Deputy Cogan has referred to injustices and there are injustices, as anyone who has any experience of dealing with the matter in a practical way will realise.  The value of money has changed enormously in the period since these Acts were first introduced and what is necessary is that we should make a reasonable attempt, and in that matter we must be guided by the Minister, to solve the difficulties and abolish the abuses and injustices.  I have every faith in the commission set up that they will have brought in a report which will enable a Bill on sound lines to be produced, but that cannot be just done within 24 hours or six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, which I think is a reasonable amendment.  It was suggested on Second Reading and I think a case was made for it then, as a case has been made for it now.  I do not think we can afford to be complacent about this problem, as Deputy Cowan appears to be.  The facts are that a commission was established two years ago to inquire into this entire problem of rent restriction, in its effect on property owners and in the way in which injustices were caused to and suffered by tenants.  That commission was given, in effect, two years to work because the Act we are now asked to continue was a two-years Act. That commission reported to the Government in June last, nearly six months ago, and nothing apparently was done by the Minister or the Government to deal with whatever proposals were made by the commission in <Col N="79" /> that report.  That, I know, is a complaint more proper for Second Reading, and it was made then, but the facts are that, since June, the report has not been published and has not been made available to Deputies or to the country.</P>
      <P>Now, six months later, the Minister seeks to continue the existing legislation for another period of 12 months. In doing so, he has the support of Deputy Cowan who says it is not possible, in view of the time of the year, to prepare the necessary legislation. That is all very well, but our argument is that the Minister should not be in that position.  He should have introduced the necessary legislation long ago.  We are concerned now with ensuring that, in 12 months' time, we will not find the Minister making exactly the same case, that we are approaching Christmas and nothing can be done.  For that reason, we are asking the Dáil to say that six months is time enough, and more than time, to enable the Minister to put in legislative form whatever proposals the Government may have, arising out of the report which they have had before them for the past six months.  I do not think that is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say to any Deputy like Deputy Cowan or others who may feel complacent about this matter, that I am not speaking in relation to property owners?  Their case has been urged.  I wanted to point out the position in which tenants in this city and throughout the country find themselves now. The tenants of new houses built since 1941, and of furnished houses, are paying exorbitant rents.  They are paying these rents now, and the Minister proposes that they shall continue to pay them for at least another 12 months. That is wrong, and something which should not be tolerated by any Deputy. Unfair and exorbitant rents have always been the concern of our people right through the years in relation to land, and many other matters.  It is the purpose of the rent restrictions code to ensure that no landlord can make a profit out of a housing shortage at the expense of the lowly-paid worker or low income group.  We on this side <Col N="80" /> are asking in this amendment that we insist on ministerial expedition in dealing with this serious problem.  I was interested to hear Deputy Cowan refer to the position of tenants of local authority houses.  I underwrite every single word he said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Deputy, on his own volition, will now follow up his evidence by supporting this amendment, because the amendment seeks to cut down the period during which these people will suffer this injustice by putting the closure on any inactivity of which the Minister may be guilty, <Col N="81" /> in saying to the Minister: &ldquo;You have had six months now from the passing of this Bill for the purpose of introducing the necessary legislative proposals which will ensure, in Deputy Cowan's case, that tenants of local authorities will not be evicted without good reason and that tenants of newly-built houses will have a fair rent clause to protect them and ensure that they will not be evicted without good reason.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Evictions from newly-erected houses and from furnished lodgings are far too common in this city at the moment. The problem is a very serious social one.  Newly-married couples requiring houses are compelled to pay rents which ordinarily would not be countenanced under any fair rent code.  We should not, by any default of ours, allow that situation to continue for one minute longer than is necessary.  The Minister and his colleagues in Government have had the report before them for the last six months.  The Minister has had six months to consider the report.  I think the Minister has been dealt with very fairly and will be dealt with very fairly if we give him another six months&mdash;that is a long period&mdash;to prepare the necessary legislative proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading, Deputy O'Higgins made a speech with which I thoroughly agreed.  He said then that there were two outstanding problems to be solved; one was the question of furnished lodgings and the other was rent overcharging on houses constructed since 1941.  On the Second Reading, I said I could not visualise the Government of which I was then a member remaining in office very much longer without bringing in legislation to deal with these problems.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of 1947 I was given a Bill dealing with the matter.  My successor was given the Bill on two or three occasions, but instead of legislating to remedy these urgent problems, which undoubtedly could have been dealt with and which I could deal with now by bringing in a Bill, he preferred to set up a third commission to inquire into these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now when a commission is set up <Col N="82" /> and when that commission makes a report it is only fair to everyone concerned, both property owners and tenants, that he or she should be made aware of what that report contains. On the Second Reading, I read out here a time schedule which, with the permission of the Chair, I now propose to read again.  This schedule shows that, so far as the Government is concerned, there has been no delay. Deputy Davin anticipated me by saying that I would blame the printers' strike.  Deputy Davin is quite right; that was the reason for the delay. Deputy Davin knew that and tried to forestall me.</P>
    <P>The Government was presented with the interim report on 24th June last. The Government approved the printing of that on 15th July.  That is not a long period; it is not quite three weeks.  On 24th July it was sent for printing and for circulation to Deputies.  The Stationery Office had it ready for printing on 2nd August. That is, a week later they sent it to the printers.  We had to wait until 11th October before we got the proofs back.  Nothing could be done between 2nd August and 11th October because of the printers' strike.  We received the proofs on 11th October and on 18th October, a week later, they were sent to the Stationery Office for the printing of the final proof.  That is, one week later.  The final proof was received in the Department on 1st November.  We passed the final proof and sent it to the printers on 10th November.  I am told that it is now almost ready for printing.  We are completely in the hands of the printers so far as that is concerned.  That is the cause for the delay.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, we could have brought in a Bill dealing with the two matters urgently requiring attention.  The second point mentioned by Deputy Cowan will be dealt with in another code, together with some other somewhat complex problems.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading I said that I would be guilty of grave discourtesy to the commission if I were to bring in a Bill before the report of the commission was published.  The Minister in the inter-Party Government who set up the commission said he expected to <Col N="83" /> have the report in two years.  I think he hoped to have a Bill passed at the end of that two years.  At that time I said there were urgent problems.  Today these problems are more urgent still.  There was a Bill in the Department. I could have introduced a Bill before this but I preferred to wait for a comprehensive report from the commission. What Deputy Cowan has said is quite correct.  First of all the report must be published so that interested parties will have an opportunity of making representations to the Government in connection with the report. The Government will then have to come to a decision and it is after that stage has been reached that we will be in a position to bring in a Bill. That Bill will be introduced towards the end of next summer.  There is no doubt about that at any rate.  If we accept Deputy O'Higgins's amendment the effect of it will be that the present Act will expire six months hence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>That is so.  I would remind Deputies that this year the financial business was not finished on 31st July.  We got the Estimates through in consideration of our bringing in Supplementary Estimates now. We are still engaged in the financial business that should have been completed by the 31st July and frankly it is impossible to do what Deputy MacEoin has suggested.  There is no shelving on my part.  The time schedule I have read out demonstrates clearly that we have lost no time in connection with this matter.  It simply cannot be done.  I could bring in a small Bill but, out of courtesy to the commission, I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given us a time-table to show there was no delay.  What the Minister would like the House to believe is that he got the report and said: &ldquo;I will not read that.  Take it away and print it.&rdquo; Surely both the Minister and his colleagues in the Government have read and re-read the report several times during the past six months. <Col N="84" /> Surely they have examined the proofs. They know full well what they ought to do after six months' examination.</P>

      <P>It means that it was pigeon-holed and left there for somebody else to read.  But that is not true.  The Minister did read it and the Minister knows well what it is proposed to do.  The Government has had six months in which to examine it and prepare legislation.  The main argument of the Minister was that it would be discourtesy to the commission. I am glad they think that much about the commission now because they did not think much about it when I set it up.</P>

      <P>Nor that Deputy Cowan would change sides and make <Col N="85" /> it impossible for me to carry out my undertaking.  I admit that that was an unforeseen eventuality.  I realise, however, that some things are uncertain. There are Deputies with uncertain minds&mdash;Deputies who talk one way and vote the other way.  I admit that the Deputy gave evidence on this matter.  Let him now demonstrate that he was not paying mere lip service to the people he talks about.</P>
      <P>I want to impress the point that a promise made by a Minister of State should be fulfilled by his successor unless there are very grave reasons for not doing so.  To my mind, the printers' strike is a futile excuse for the Minister to make.  He says that because of the printers' strike they were not able to read the report and that, consequently, they were not able to decide upon it.  That is sheer nonsense and poppycock.</P>

      <P>I should not speak again except for the attitude adopted by Deputy O'Higgins when he referred to complacency.  There has been no complacency in this connection as far as I am concerned.  I have been pressing for this Bill for a long time. I took such a serious interest in it that I prepared and submitted evidence and subjected myself to cross-examination by the commission.  I hope the commission will have dealt with that aspect of the matter in their report because it is a matter which affects well over 100,000 tenants&mdash;houses occupied by people in corporation dwellings, county council cottages and other dwellings built by local authorities. In my view, it is one of the vital matters of the new Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill does create new hardships; that has been stated. There may be some tenants for whom it creates hardships&mdash;as Deputy O'Higgins stated&mdash;particularly tenants of furnished lettings and tenants of houses built since 1941.  There are, however, other types of hardships that <Col N="86" /> have to be considered.  A case came to my notice in the past day or two of a room in the city that was let to a man and his wife at £2 a week.  The man availed of the machinery under the present Act.  He went to the District Court.  The District Court decided that the proper legal rent for that tenancy was 4/5 a week.  That is a substantial reduction.  That machinery will continue to operate.  It is an unsatisfactory type of machinery, and, being unsatisfactory, it will take some time to have it properly considered and to enact legislation that will work for at least ten, 15 or 20 years.</P>

Not only will the House be under an obligation to pass <Col N="88" /> it, but the Seanad will be under an obligation to pass it within that period.  Obviously, that is not treating the matter seriously.  No one can say that any Bill that would be introduced into this House at the moment would be passed within a period of six months.  Deputy O'Higgins knows that no matter what Bill comes before the House at the moment, it is being held up and no Bill would be held up more than a Rent Restrictions Bill, because on every side of the House we have Deputies who believe that the landlord has certain rights and other Deputies who believe that the tenants have all the rights.  Then there are still more Deputies who try to keep an even balance between the two sides, so that a Bill of this kind would be subjected to long discussion and there would be many amendments on it.  It would be practically impossible to have it out of this House within six months. Then it has to go to the Seanad and would have to be dealt with in its various stages by the Seanad.

      <P>The Deputy could not speak with precision on what the House would be likely to do.  I should not like to be asked to speak on the Second Reading of the new Bill without seeing the report of the commission and I have not seen that report yet as it has not been circulated yet. I should like some time to examine it. Deputy Dillon gave us the history of an average simple Bill in this House not so long ago and, judging by what he said, I think the Minister is very optimistic if he thinks that the new Bill will be law within a period of 12 months.  So far as I am concerned, I shall give every help but I think it is ridiculous to suggest that it can be done within six months because that would mean that you must dragoon the Dáil into doing something within a limited period of time and nobody has authority to do that. Similarly nobody has authority to dragoon the Seanad into doing something within a limited period of time. While we operate our democratic system of government, under which every member has a right to put down amendments and argue them, nobody can say that you will have any particular piece of new legislation passed through the House within a period of six months.  It is not a question of forcing the Minister, a suggestion which might be understandable, but it is trying to force the 147 members of this House and the 60 members of the Seanad to do a certain job within a period of six months.  No Deputy has the right to do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 2, sub-section (1), between lines 19 and 20, to insert a new definition as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;weekday&rdquo; does not mean Sunday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last week when this Bill was in Committee we made the case that there should be specifically stated in the Bill that a week-day does not mean Sunday, as it was conceivable that any employer who wanted to avoid the impact of the Act might possibly argue that Sunday being a week-day he could allow the worker the half-holiday on that day. In reply to our arguments the Minister stated that there was no need for this amendment because the Interpretation Act of 1937 defined Sunday as not being a weekday.</P>
      <P>The point I want to put is that few, if any, agricultural employers will have heard of the Interpretation Act of 1937, that a great many people outside the agricultural community will not have heard of it either, and therefore they will not be aware of the fact that Sunday has been defined as not being a weekday.  Our idea in asking to have this amendment inserted is to simplify the Bill and make it perfectly clear that Sunday must be excluded when consideration of the half-holiday comes up.  We still feel that a reference to the Interpretation Act of 1937 should at least be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It should not be left to argument which might have to take place in a court or in some other quarter.  It should be put beyond aye or nay, and there should be a specific provision in the Bill along the lines of the amendment that a weekday does not mean Sunday, or, alternatively, there should be an explanatory reference to the Interpretation Act of 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is a reflection on the people of this country to suggest, as Deputy Dunne suggests, that there are farmers who would argue that Sunday was a weekday and <Col N="94" /> an ordinary working day.  It never has been heard of and Deputy Dunne might give some consideration to that aspect of the matter before trying to set out in a Bill for the benefit of the farmers that Sunday is not a working day or a weekday.  It is the most far-fetched thing I have ever heard suggested.</P>

      <P>This amendment was before the House last week and I stated that Sunday was already defined in the Interpretation Act of 1937 as not being a weekday.  That should have been sufficient, I think.  Surely we do not propose in every Act put through this House to define what is a weekday and what is not?  It has been already done and why should we have the duplication?  I cannot see why it should be included in this Bill.  There is no necessity for it, because the interpretation has been given already and has been embodied in an Act.  Surely the farmers and their employees will have no difficulty about knowing that. The courts and the legal profession know it, and the farmers and the agricultural workers, if they do not know about it, will know in a very short time that Sunday cannot be included.</P>

      <P>In page 2, Section 4, to add at the end of the section &ldquo;and, if he does not fix it, it shall be deemed to be Wednesday&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on Section 4 last week as to designating the day for the half-holiday where agreement is not reached.  There are two ways in which the day can be fixed.  One is by mutual agreement and the other is by the farmer fixing it himself.  In the event of the farmer not fixing a day, it was suggested by Deputy Dunne and others that we should fix a day, and the day mentioned by them was Saturday.  I do not know why Saturday was selected.  In some parts of the country Saturday might be suitable, but in other parts of the country Monday might be more suitable. Having regard to the number of days worked in the week, I now suggest that Wednesday should be the day fixed.  The worker works for two days of the week, and then, if there is no agreement, he takes his half-holiday on the Wednesday, and works on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 means in effect that, failing <Col N="96" /> agreement or the fixing of a day by the employer, Saturday shall be a half-holiday. I suppose it is a matter of opinion.  The Minister asks why the members of the Labour Party suggest Saturday.  I suppose it would be just as logical to ask why he took out a pin, looked at the seven days of the week and chose Wednesday.  Saturday is the logical day, as practically all manual workers in the country get their half-holiday on Saturday.  County council workers, factory workers, builders' labourers, skilled men such as carpenters and others in the building trade, all get their half-holiday on Saturday and I think it would be only fair and proper that if the farmer fails to fix a day the farm worker should get his half-holiday on Saturday, too.  I cannot see why Wednesday was taken. It may be different in other parts of the country, but a Wednesday half-holiday in my county&mdash;in our county, might I say to Deputy Allen?&mdash;would not mean anything.  The shops' half-day is Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the half-day for shop assistants, but all over Wexford, all over the Twenty-Six Counties and over the 32 Counties manual workers get their half-day on Saturday, and I think there is a tremendous advantage in it. None of us, farmers' representatives or Labour members, thinks that farm labourers are paid sufficiently, but if they wanted to go to Dublin for a match, visit relations or, more important, to shop, it would be an advantage to have Saturday off.  The Minister said that to have Sunday off was an advantage and that the half-holiday should come in the middle of the week, but Wednesday does not mean anything as a half-holiday to the farm labourer or, for that matter, to any other manual worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a whole lot in this amendment.  I do not think it will be of any terrific importance unless the half-day is not fixed by agreement or <Col N="97" /> by the employer.  It will not be a usual occurrence that the half-day must be fixed by a Section in the Act, but I do seriously suggest that if the Minister or Parliament wish to intervene we should fix Saturday so that the agricultural worker will be in the same position as his fellow workers, the majority of manual workers who get their half-holiday on Saturday afternoon.  I do not see any reason in the world why Wednesday should have been taken.  To stipulate that the half-day should be on Saturday would be advantageous to the worker but if Wednesday is designated that will mean practically nothing to the farm labourer.  It is a matter of opinion between the Minister and ourselves but in view of what has been said and in view of the fact that so many people get their half-day on Saturday the Minister should accept this amendment and withdraw his own.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne stated quite a considerable time ago that they were determined&mdash;when he said &ldquo;they&rdquo; he meant the Labour Party&mdash; to make Saturday the general half-holiday for agricultural labourers if it could be done at some time in the future.  He made that statement in this House and he will not deny it.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious from the amendment of the Labour Party that that is their object.  Deputy Corish went so far as to say that if Wednesday were fixed for the half-holiday it would be of no advantage to the agricultural worker.  He would be better without it in other words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a bit far-fetched. This will come into operation only in <Col N="98" /> the third eventuality, if the worker and farmer do not agree, and if the farmer does not fix the day.  The Minister selected the middle of the week, but both interests, the farmer and the worker, will have an opportunity beforehand of fixing a day that will suit both of them, and it will be found that in 90 or 95 per cent. of the cases they will agree on a day.  There is no doubt about that.  There will be 1 per cent. of the cases for which no Parliament can legislate.  They say that hard cases make bad laws.  If hard cases come within the scope of this legislation it will be very hard for the Dáil to legislate for them.  The Minister is wise in sticking to the day he has suggested in mid-week.  If there were no such amendment and the farmer and worker failed to agree the farmer would still be liable in law to pay the worker, and a penalty is provided in the Bill if he does not, so there is no necessity for anything further.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the Minister's attitude to these amendments of ours, because I have a very clear recollection&mdash;and I am sure that he will not deny this&mdash;of the Minister speaking in his own constituency a short time ago when he said that if he had his way&mdash;and I have an idea he could do things as he wants&mdash;the agricultural workers of the country, those employed in his own constituency in particular, would have at least 10/- a week more than industrial workers, and that their conditions generally would be on a higher level than those of industrial workers.  Why did he not face up to it on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister inquired from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or from any other of his colleagues in the Cabinet who is acquainted with the position of industrial workers, he would find that the overwhelming majority get their half-holiday on Saturday by agreement with their employers.  Deputy Allen seems <Col N="99" /> to think that this is a major matter, and that it would be a serious thing for the farmers if Saturday were the day fixed instead of Wednesday.  I hope I am right in assuming that the number of farmers who would refuse to settle this matter by agreement would be about 5 per cent.  If that is so, there is nothing very much between us as to whether it should be Saturday or Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Some of the farmers of Kilkenny&mdash;and nobody knows this better than the Minister&mdash;would not dream of going to a hurling match and naturally because they would not dream of going to a hurling match or even going to a town where one was being played, they would not like their agricultural labourers to go.  This cranky type of farmer who represents about 5 per cent. of the farming community would insist on Wednesday instead of Saturday.  If the Minister really means what he said in his own constituency that he believed in increasing the wages and improving working conditions of agricultural labourers, and in paying agricultural labourers, in his own words, 10/- a week higher than the industrial workers, let him do what has been done in the industrial world in his own constituency and give the agricultural workers their half-day on Saturday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that in connection with the Labour Party amendment on the Committee Stage, the Minister never considered the crux that would arise if there was not mutual agreement.  I believe furthermore that the Minister realises very well that from both the employers' and the employees' point of view, Saturday is the most convenient day for agricultural workers to get the half-holiday. Shop assistants were mentioned a moment ago and it was stated that in one county their half-holiday was on Wednesday and in another county on Thursday.  Could any Deputy here tell me if there is a half-holiday on Saturday for shop assistants? I do not believe they could. That is in towns anyway.  It is only in the cities where wholesale merchants are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural worker is paid on Friday night or on Saturday morning, and if he wants to do any shopping&mdash; you must remember there is a Shops Act under which shops are shut at a certain time&mdash;an agricultural worker will have to travel perhaps three, four or five miles to the shopping centre. How is he going to be in time to do that shopping if he must work the full day on Saturday?  I would treat this as much ado about nothing only for the Minister's attitude on the Committee Stage, and only for his subsequent remarks.  The Minister, out of pure cussedness, decided to pin-point Wednesday.  The Minister for Agriculture, knowing as he does what it is to carry out the chores of an agricultural labourer, must realise how foolish it was to select a day in the middle of the week for a half-holiday for agricultural workers.  I am sure that every Deputy interested in agriculture or who knows anything about employers or employees in the agricultural community, will treat the whole thing as a huge joke.  I have no doubt but that the Minister treated the Act as a huge joke when he was framing it.  Some of us who tried to be helpful to him pointed out the conditions as they stood in the particular part of the country that we came from and represented. In this regard, I do not mind Deputy Allen.  Every circus has a joker.  He turns out to be the best <Col N="101" /> acrobat in the circus when he takes off the clown's clothing.  Some time or other Deputy Allen will take it off.</P>

      <P>I am getting away from acrobatics.  It was a good thing to hear him taking back everything he said about compulsory tillage.  As far as we in County Cork are concerned, I do not believe that, apart from about 1 per cent. of the reactionary farmers, there would be anybody who would cause trouble in regard to the suggested half-holiday.  At one time the Minister made good propaganda. That was when he was democratic in his outlook and before he had become so autocratic as a result of his promotion to the post as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand any man, realising the conditions in rural Ireland, putting down an amendment here today that the half-holiday for agricultural workers would be Wednesday.  I would like if he clarified at some stage when replying, when it is he expects the week to start and how he is going to deal with the qualifying hours.  It looks as if every farmer will have to take account of the number of hours his men are working in order that they may qualify for the half-day.  I do not know how he is going to do it.  But I know this much, that if the Minister relied, as I asked him to do, on his statistical advisers, the agricultural instructors, the various committees of <Col N="102" /> agriculture throughout the country, I have no doubt but that, in unison, they would recommend Saturday.  The only shop assistants who have Saturday as a half-holiday are the wholesale shop assistants in cities, and I think I explained why.  Now at this late stage would the Minister not have the moral courage to admit, along with every one of his backbenchers, including Deputy Allen, that Saturday is more suitable? Even Deputy Cogan, who was brought slowly to Damascus and brought back again, for which I give credit to the Minister for having converted him, will not deny that Saturday is the more suitable day.  However, I am sure that when this Bill is implemented &mdash; and I am going to give credit again to the Minister &mdash; although it took a long time to reach its present stage, it will be the foundation of improved amenities for agricultural workers.  I conclude by asking the Minister to be sensible and agree to Saturday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had spent some time before the break in establishing as far as I could that the White Paper on which the Budget was based was guilty of two very great errors, errors which we tried to point out at the time and failed, of course, to get any credence for our views, but errors which the lapse of the months in between has now established to the satisfaction of anybody who can consider what was said and what the events are.</P>
      <P>These two errors were, first, that there was a large deficit of £70,000,000 in the balance of payments for the calendar year, 1951, and a likely £50,000,000 in the financial year 1952-53, the second error being that that situation, which was bad enough, phrased that way, could only be rectified by cutting imports.  That was the inescapable conclusion of the White Paper, which more or less despaired of any improvement through exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> As against that, we had our own view, on which we based a policy.  It was a view and a policy which we established for ourselves during 1948, more particularly in 1949, and, although we were anxious about the situation in 1950 as divergent to 1951, we still adhered to that programme, because we felt the situation all the time would be coming in our favour and a temporary disequilibrium would soon be rectified.</P>
    <P>I had already pointed out that the Budget was founded upon these two errors&mdash;some people have called them misrepresentations of the facts.  I do not believe that they were deliberately misrepresentative but they were certainly errors, as the events have shown and as, I think, articles that were written about this White Paper have shown, they were errors to the correction of which there were many points of information that could have been adverted to and could have modified at least the views expressed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>From that I had tackled the second point, which was supposed to be a complication of the finance accounts in the year 1952-53, that was, whether the Budget of 1951-52 had balanced or not.  Discarding the transitional, the ephemeral, the unlikely matters &mdash; at least, the matters that were not likely to occur in a future year &mdash; taking these out of the accounts of 1951-52, I felt it was proper and quite easy to show that the Budget of that year had been balanced.  I approach this matter in this way: By taking the revenue produced to the Government for a future year and putting against that expenditure of the previous year and taking from expenditure the previous year such matters as were clearly not going to recur, like the arrears of fuel losses and the stockpiling matters, the figures showed that the Minister, if he had no fresh commitments in his time, could have had £2,000,000 and about £150,000 with which to approach the question of the new social services if he required to do that without any cutting of subsidies.</P>
    <P>The third point I was making was whether the Budget of 1952-53 would <Col N="104" /> balance.  I always felt that it was aimed at over-balancing.  The project was to pretend to accept the items that were declared to be proper to be met out of borrowing, but in reality not to accept them and to tax to the point that the whole of the Estimates, including the £9,250,000 which was established as the figure for the items proper for borrowing, would be covered.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, making a special case by way of special pleading before the arbitration board, said that there was disappointment with regard to the out-turn of the revenue. Items were detailed.  The calculation I made on these was about £4,500,000. Of course, that does not end the matter. We did say that the revenue to be exacted from the people in the current year was to meet the whole of the Estimates, including the £9,250,000. The last Exchequer returns, published in this morning's paper, show that expenditure at almost £60,000,000 &mdash; £59,942,000 &mdash; exceeded revenue, which is £53,648,000, by £6,293,000.  Of course, that would seem to indicate that the Budget of this year is going to be very seriously out of balance.</P>
    <P>But one must pause and inquire how much of the £9,250,000, what was described as proper for borrowing, is contained in the expenditure up to the date of November 22nd.  It is not the most certain way of dealing with the matter but it is the only way that I can deal with it at the moment.  If I take the fact that we have the whole of the early six months and, in addition to that, the whole of the month of October and three weeks of November, I make my calculation on the basis of the weeks that have gone and the weeks still to come.  Supposing there is a proportionate expenditure of this £9,250,000 supposed to be met out of borrowing, in the time that has elapsed there should be about £6,000,000 of the £9,250,000 of those items to be borrowed met out of the expenditure.  If that be the case &mdash; I do not know whether it is or not &mdash; then expenditure and revenue are roughly in balance at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Budget will not show the return that was forecast in April of this year.  We made the case <Col N="105" /> that it was intended, not merely to meet the current expenditure but to meet the £9,250,000 at least, possibly £10,000,000 of what was apt for borrowing. It may be that all that sum will not be covered by current revenue but if £6,000,000 of the £9,000,000 has been met already, it means that there is only £3,000,000 to go and the best quarter of the year, from the point of view of revenue, is still to come.  In the January to March period there will be the fruit of the new taxes by way of income-tax and, although there is a recession in trade, that recession does not go back far enough to have any effect upon the accounts upon which the tax will be assessed in the first quarter of next year.</P>
    <P>I have not enough material to make any forecast but from what I have it would appear to me likely from the recent Exchequer returns that the revenue this year will meet the ordinary expenditure and leave several millions over.</P>
    <P>I do admit that when we were talking about this in April, May and June, we did not pay enough attention, possibly, to the magnitude of the blunder that was committed by the Minister.  We did not just give full effect to the impact of these taxes upon the people or to the possibility that they might refuse to smoke and to drink to the extent that they had consumed these articles before and that, therefore, the returns from the taxes might not yield as much as had been expected.  There is still a calculation as to how much was expected and whether that was just the amount required to meet what is called current expenditure or whether there was in the calculation anything over and above that for these items that were at least pretended in the Budget speech to be accepted as items proper for borrowing.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Minister can face the dilemma on his own.  If he likes, he can show a deficit at the end of the year and, after all the hysteria we have had about the alleged deficit in the previous year, that will not be pleasant.  On the other hand, it is possible that he may be able to show a surplus &mdash; I believe he can &mdash; and, in that event, it will be a matter then <Col N="106" /> for the civil servants, the Guards, the Army and the teachers to consider how far the arbitration award had not been brought about by completely false misrepresentation made through the Minister's representatives before the arbitration board and whether they would not have a case to set aside that award on the ground that it had been procured by outrageously false and fraudulent means.</P>
    <P>That is so much for the past and projecting a little into the future, to the end of this financial year.  With regard to the future proper, the banks have been very much brought into this debate &mdash; not merely the Central Bank but the joint stock banks &mdash; and I think it proper at this time that a certain line of policy should be indicated with regard to these institutions, the banks generally, but more particularly the Central Bank as a State institution.  I have said here over and over again when I have complained about the attitude of the Central Bank, and even of the joint stock banks, that I did not appear to have acted very strongly against these groups when I had certain power over them as a member of Government, and I have explained why I did not run into any sort of hasty action against them or truculen mood with regard to them.</P>
    <P>I can repeat what I said before, hoping that it will get better appreciation now, that it is always possible for a Government in control of a majority in the Dáil like this Government to effect its will.  It can do the most outrageous things &mdash; it can blunder and smash around as the present Government has done; but any group of people who are appreciative of circumstances will move rather cautiously and with a good deal of reluctance against institutions of the banking type.  The banks have in the background the whole matter of credit, and it has for a long time been a platitudinous remark that credit is a tricky sort of bird, very easily frightened and not easily reattracted to the area from which it has been displaced.</P>
    <P>I always took the line that it was better to try to achieve things by way of a change in the banking situation in this country, or to attempt to <Col N="107" /> achieve that by persuasion and lead rather than by Order, Acts of the Dáil or coercion.  I even disapproved of the criticism often levelled at banking institutions, which appears to be accepted by Deputy Cowan, that all the people connected with banking institutions in this country, the Central Bank included, had the wrong motives, and I object still more strongly to the argument based on the fact that it is only to be expected from such people because their background, their history, their antecedents or something about them would make them appreciative more of a policy hostile to this country than of a policy which would be attentive to its needs.</P>
    <P>I should like to clear anybody connected with any of these banking institutions of anything in the way of wrong motive.  But I think the policy has been wrong, consistently wrong, and now established as wrong, over many, many years.  I attempted to sway some of these people by talking to them, by meeting them as often as I could, by argument with them and by putting certain viewpoints before them, and I must say that, at the end, I despaired of getting any fast movement in the way of change from them, and therefore was disposed to take action against them through a process of legislation.  On the other hand, I was faced with this: the Government to which I belonged was engaged in a change, a very big change, with regard to the financing of what are called schemes of development in the country.</P>
    <P>These schemes were being very ferociously assailed, mainly out of the depths of the ignorance of the people who now occupy Government seats, but there was criticism running through the country which could have done great harm to the whole credit institutions and the whole credit fabric of the State.  I had the view, particularly with regard to the Central Bank, that if, when times brought a vacancy in the controllership of the Central Bank, I had taken the opportunity of dropping the present governor, as it was in my power to do, his term of office having expired, I would immediately be subjected to an argument of <Col N="108" /> this type: that I was moving into new and rather treacherous ground, that I was not confident in what I was doing and therefore had to get rid of the person who would show the red light against anything I was attempting in those days.</P>
    <P>After consultation with my colleagues, I came to the conclusion that it was better to reappoint the whole staff of the Central Bank as they came up for reappointment as one group, to let them flash their red lights all around the place, to let them disagree as violently as they could and expose their disagreement with me in public as much as they liked, reserving to myself only the right, if they did disagree with me, to take a platform somewhere in a hall in this city and give my point of view in opposition to anything the Central Bank put up. That, I felt, was meeting argument with argument and a better policy than the policy of dropping people because I did not like their viewpoint.</P>
    <P>So we kept the Central Bank up, and, while we tried to persuade the joint stock banks to certain effort, and did definitely persuade them with regard to the £5,000,000 corporation advance, we did not take any action against them by way of changing the institution or dropping any of the personnel in so far as we had any opportunity of doing that in relation to these institutions.  A new situation has now developed, however, a situation in which more definitely aggressive action can be taken against people who, I think, have given wrong advice and whose advice is now shown to be based on completely wrong information and data.</P>
    <P>The capital programme was very much discussed and we had the scandalous matter of the advertisement through this city and through the country of the pawnbroker's three golden emblems portrayed to show that we were running the country into pawn and destroying the country's credit.  The capital programme was discussed and criticised from two points of view.  First, that the money was being spent on projects which did not deserve the description of capital development, and, secondly, that, <Col N="109" /> whether they did or not, by spending so much money on these schemes and putting, therefore, so much money, through wages and salaries, into the hands of the people, we were creating a very bad type of inflation, a type of inflation which, if it did not mean increased prices, would mean inflated imports from the other side which, of course, showed up in the matter of the balance of payments.  Finally, the point was made that there was not capital enough out of the savings of the people to finance these schemes.</P>
    <P>We have had a certain number of years since these criticisms were first levelled at us and we have had, since the Budget came around, a very definite education of the people to an appreciation of what we meant and of how sound our policy was, in disagreement with the policy of the present Government.  It was not so much that what we said had to be said over and over again in order to convince ourselves that it was true, but we had the difficult task of persuading the people, on a dry, academic and rather esoteric matter like finance, that what we were saying was correct and that what the Government was trying to establish was wrong.  The fact that the Government were recently beaten by a two to one vote in a working class constituency in Dublin indicates that the population have got it into their heads that the austerity of the Budget was unnecessary.  I think that is mainly the mood which provoked that amazing reaction against the Government within the past fortnight.  They can bear austerity, as they showed during the war, if they believe it to be necessary, but they cannot put up with austerity which is the fruit of ignorance and wrong advice.  They cannot put up with it when it is shown to their satisfaction that the whole policy was completely wrong and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The capital development programme has now been accepted, but I do not believe that it has been really accepted.  I do not believe that the Minister's phrase which he used in the Budget, that it was not worth while for a million or two to quarrel about <Col N="110" /> these capital schemes, means that it had really been accepted.  He pretended to take them all in and said that there was £9,250,000 in the present Estimates, the equivalent of the £10,000,000 that we had in the Budget before for the same type of development.</P>
    <P>We no longer have criticism of the schemes themselves.  They are accepted as proper for the development of the country.  We no longer have any criticism of this, that the proper way to finance these schemes is by borrowing and not by taxation.  The latter point has been accepted in the Minister's Budget speech, though I believe it is a mere pretence.  It has not been shown &mdash; I challenge any contradiction &mdash; that the money we spent in the three years we had a chance of spending, had the slightest effect in this country by way of inflation on prices in the country.  It cannot be said that one price was raised; there was in fact no inflation of the price type by reason of what we did but it was said that inflation of imports did occur.  If prices here and there did rise that was because of the impact of the Korean situation affecting the price of outside supplies.  As far as this country is concerned our operations did not cause any price inflation through the years.  It may be said it caused inflation by way of imports, and that only because we had such a tremendous flood of imports providing us with the goods that prices were kept level.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Central Bank, we have shown that the situation painted so darkly in the White Paper can be rectified by an expansion of exports.  In any event if we suffer for a while from the increased cost of imports, that inevitably has its corrective when the increase in prices covers the whole field and when we get a better price for exports, so that the terms of trade do not run completely against us but turn in our favour.</P>
    <P>There is a new situation &mdash; a completely new situation.  It will be quite impossible in the near future for the present Government when it becomes an Opposition again to start their run of criticism against these capital schemes.  They will not be able to say that these schemes in themselves are <Col N="111" /> not apt for the application of borrowed moneys nor will they hereafter be able to say that borrowing and spending on these schemes has brought about or would bring about any inflation of price.  A watchful eye can be kept on the matter to see if any danger arises from that quarter, so that it can be met.  In these circumstances it is only the third question that arises: is there in this country the capital that will be necessary for the development schemes we had in mind and which our successors to some extent have accepted?  I believe there is.  I am not sure that this capital can be provided if the Central Bank is allowed to operate as it has been doing since it was instituted and if the joint stock banks are allowed to function as they have been functioning.  I have made this comment often in the House.  It is only now I get an appreciation outside, an echo indicating that people who hear the phrase for the first time are astonished at the facts revealed by it, and secondly an appreciation that if these facts exist, then there is something completely wrong with the banking situation.</P>
    <P>I have asked, not expecting any answer, whether there is any situation equal to that which we have in the whole world of banking and finance outside this country?  Is there a parallel to the situation we have here in which the joint stock banks have, as they had in 1949, £183,000,000 for investment and had invested only £14,000,000 in Irish securities?  One hundred and sixty-three million pounds went out of this country.  These were the product of the application of labour and brains to certain materials in the country, the fruits of human endeavour here.  The banks had piled up £183,000,000 for investment and of that they found it possible only to invest £14,000,000 here.</P>
    <P>There is no parallel for that outside this country.  Nine million pounds only of the £14,000,000 were in Government issues.  The rest of the £14,000,000 was something else not Government issues but at home.  Between Government issues and other home investments there was £14,000,000 invested.  The rest, <Col N="112" /> £170,000,000, was invested outside the country.</P>
    <P>What is the reason given for that amazing situation?  The situation is a little better in recent years because we forced the pace.  There was persuasion if not coercion put upon them by us.  It is still very bad.  The ratio may not be 170 to 14 at home but it is still very bad.  Even if the amount invested at home is doubled we have not anything beyond £30,000,000 invested at home and £150,000,000 invested abroad. There is no parallel to that in the world and the only excuse I have heard is to be found in this bewildering term, &ldquo;liquidity.&rdquo;  I have not yet met a banker who has advanced any argument based upon home security not being as secure as the outside one. With the recent devaluation and the abandonment of the gold standard in 1941 in mind, it would be hard for a banker to argue that an English security would be more secure than an Irish security.  That argument has never been used &mdash; I give them credit for not arguing that point.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the return on an Irish security, it is accepted that the return on an Irish security is as good as can be got from any outside security. Yield is all right.  Security is all right. But the bankers say we must remember our situation with regard to liquidity. Their attitude is that we must keep our finances completely and entirely liquid. This is because owners of personal savings in this country, shopkeepers and farmers, do not ordinarily invest their money but run off immediately to the bank and lodge the money, not on current account but more often on deposit account.  The banks say: &ldquo;There is the money.  Money on deposit account can be withdrawn at very short notice.  What can we do? We must invest in securities we can immediately realise.&rdquo;  They say as an addition to that argument that one can always realise English securities and no matter how much you throw on the market the market will absorb them without any reduction in price, but if they were lodged on the Irish market there are not enough buyers and the price will drop.</P>
    <P>There is the argument.  The whole of the community, all this mass of conservative <Col N="113" /> people, the farmers, big and small, and the shopkeepers are going suddenly to descend upon the banks and demand payment of the whole £183,000,000.  As against that extremely remote contingency these securities must be kept liquid so that if thrown on the English market there would be no drop in price.</P>
    <P>The root of all this evil is to be found in the Central Bank.  If any of you look at the Central Bank Report just out, you will find that the monetary circulation for the year 1952 is given at Table 6, on page 22.  Incidentally, may I refer to what Deputy MacBride has often said in this House that this report of the Central Bank was not warranted under Section 36b of the Currency Act, 1927?  It was always represented as &ldquo;presented to the House pursuant to Section 36 of the Currency Act, 1927&rdquo;.  I myself questioned the governor on one occasion as to whether it was proper for him to present this economic lecture pursuant to Section 36, but then told him that it did not matter, that he could publish his report in any way he pleased.  It is notable that this year that phrase has been dropped.  Apparently it has been discovered that this report of the Central Bank does not come properly under Section 36 of the Currency Act, and we get it baldly presented without that superscription, and we are told by the Minister that it now comes before us under Sections 6 and 8, I think, of the Central Bank Act, 1942.</P>
    <P>However, to resume: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The legal tender notes for 1952 are stated to be £58,000,000, while for the year 1951 they were £54,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When one looks at the account of the Central Bank one finds they have the £54,000,000 as a liability, and as against that their assets are gold, to the extent of £2,500,000 roughly; money which is legal tender in Great Britain, about £230,000; sterling balances on current or deposit accounts at London agency or in bank in Great Britain, about £600,000; and British Government securities, £50,500,000.  The whole total is £54,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has had this attitude always, that they must have their <Col N="114" /> funds invested in either gold, money which is legal tender in Great Britain, which generally, I understand, means Bank of England notes that the Central Bank has; sterling balances held at the London agency or certain London banks or British banks or Northern Ireland banks; and British Government securities.  The whole of the assets as against the legal tender notes are held in British funds or British money.  In other words, the Central Bank desires to have 100 per cent. backing for the legal tender notes in the form of these easily realised securities.</P>
    <P>Do not forget the history of this matter.  The 1927 Currency Act did say in a particular section that the funds of the bank were to be lodged in certain assets and there were certain investments set out in Section 61.  One of these was British Government securities maturing within 12 months. It was later discovered that the Currency Commission was operating that phrase to the extent that most of the funds were in three months' bills for which the yield was next to nothing. As a result, the 1930 Act was brought in and deleted those words, &ldquo;maturing within twelve months&rdquo;.  That left the Central Bank empowered to invest in British Government securities without their having to be of a maturity inside 12 months.  Eventually in the Central Bank Act, 1942, a further amendment was made.  I need not go through what was done in that Act and I think it would be a perfect summary to say that the Central Bank was empowered to invest in domestic assets.  Under Section 8, it could &ldquo;buy, hold or sell securities of or guaranteed by the State which have been offered for public subscription or tender before being bought by the bank and are officially quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange and the Cork Stock Exchange, or securities of or guaranteed by the Government of any other country&rdquo;.  A second lettered paragraph allowed them to &ldquo;buy, hold or sell securities of any public authority&rdquo;&mdash; that would go for a local authority &mdash;&ldquo;which are authorised by law for the investment of trust funds and have been offered for public subscription or tender before being bought <Col N="115" /> by the bank and are officially quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange and on the Cork Stock Exchange&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There have been three efforts made to liberalise the situation in so far as the old Currency Commission, now the Board of the Central Bank, is concerned &mdash; first of all, they were tied to the investments they could make, and when they went to invest in British Government funds they had to be ones maturing within 12 months. Steps were taken to remove that limitation as to 12 months' maturity. The third step was taken in 1942 when they were enabled to invest in domestic assets.  What has been the return of the bank for that?</P>

      <P>If they were trustee stocks, yes &mdash; that is, the local authority stocks.  They were also entitled to invest in domestic assets guaranteed by the State.  What have they done? There is not a £5 note invested, since the 1942 Act was passed, in domestic assets.  Take the account for this year again.  Gold bullion; Bank of England notes; sterling balances held at the agency in London of the Central Bank or in banks in England or Northern Ireland; and British Government securities &mdash; the return we get on all that is some little fraction over 1 per cent. All that money has gone over to England, lent to them at 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>Five, in fact.  The Minister has had to pay 5 per cent. to get people to lend him money and when the local loans go out the people who take them will be paying 5½, 5¾ or 6 per cent.  Yet we have lent £54,000,000 in 1951 and nearly £59,000,000 in 1952 to England while the Central Bank which is empowered to invest those assets have not yet put a £5 note into any of our securities or local authority securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back to the old phrase, &ldquo;yield, security and liquidity.&rdquo;  The yield here is 1 per cent.  Much more <Col N="116" /> could be got for half of that amount if invested in long term things.  The Minister interrupted Deputy MacBride when he was speaking on a motion and asked him if he wanted this money invested in speculative investments. Of course he does not, but one does not need to take a sudden jump from a speculative investment of the type on which you make 15 per cent. down to a single 1 per cent. on British Government short-dated securities. I have asked over and over again that those who write the Central Bank report would take advantage of the amazingly favourable situation that they are in to educate the public on this matter.  They get the opportunity to write the reports every year.  One of the things which is very definitely questioned in this State at the moment is their habit of investing to the extent they do in these British short-term securities. I asked several times that we should get a paragraph, for the purpose of enlightenment, in the report as to the necessity for this.  I have never been favoured, either by the report or by an argument, with any indication that there was any such necessity.</P>
    <P>An argument was made in a publication about two years ago which runs this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To the first question, about the 100 per cent. backing in legal tender notes, the only answer seems to be&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and then this is put in the quotation as if it were a reply by the Bank &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that we must be 100 per cent. safe lest the Irish State has to go into liquidation.  These notes are certificates of debt&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; so they are &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;promises to pay and a day may come when everyone will want to be paid and will want to leave the State without any legal tender at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be putting the matter too far but still I do not see anything wrong in that argument.  A 100 per cent. backing must mean that the controllers of the Central Bank fear that some of these days the whole note circulation <Col N="117" /> will be withdrawn and we will be left without any currency except whatever token coinage there may be.</P>
    <P>That situation is, of course, completely outside anybody's conception.  If such a situation as that emerged and there was such a run as that on the Central Bank, during which everyone would come in and demand some British Government security instead of money, the State would step in long before that could happen just as the British stepped in in 1914 and declared a moratorium.  Year after year we are keeping our money locked up in bullion, in Bank of England notes, in British securities and sterling balances held in London because we are afraid that some day the whole mass of the population will descend on the Irish legal tender fund and every man-jack will come rolling into the Central Bank and demand a British security, or something, by way of payment instead of just this paper which will have lost its value.</P>
    <P>Our whole legal tender issue is backed by sterling.  That is a situation without parallel in the world, a situation in which the currency of one country is backed 100 per cent. by the security of another country.  The bank was not given enough power to liberalise themselves.  I offered on one occasion &mdash; I do not know whether or not the offer was taken seriously &mdash; to go one step further and amend the Currency Act and the Central Bank Act and say that a certain percentage of the moneys held by the Central Bank would have to be invested by that bank in accordance with the view of the Minister for Finance.  I went to the length of saying that the Minister for Finance would have to bring the matter before the House and get an Order from the House.  I offered to do that in order to take responsibility from the Board of the Central Bank and the burden off the shoulders of some political head of a Department of investing in domestic assets. I certainly think that at least a third of these should be invested in domestic assets.  I think it would be a good idea to put that proposal to the bank again and then if the directors of that institution do not like it, let us take the responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> I could not come in here with legislation at that time because I was engaged in changing the whole investment policy of the State and I knew that propaganda would be used.  I hesitated and tried to bring the bank around by persuasion, but they would not move.  Does anyone believe that any significant part of the notes outstanding will ever be presented for redemption into sterling?  Does anybody believe two-thirds of the notes outstanding will be presented for redemption by sterling assets?  If they do, then, of course, they must approve of the policy of the Central Bank.  Is is conceivable &mdash; can anyone tell me the circumstances in which it would be conceivable?&mdash; that two-thirds of the notes would be presented and the holders of those would require payment for them by way of sterling securities?</P>
    <P>I was not able to be present at a bankers' function held on 18th November, 1950, but a statement of mine was read to the bankers on that occasion.  Part of that statement took the following form: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Statistics of bank deposits in Ireland for many years past will be searched in vain for evidence of a fall in deposits of any disturbing magnitude. The Banking Commission of 1934-38 remarked specifically upon the stability of bank deposits in Ireland. Since 1939 they have been moving steadily upwards, and even the heavy imports of recent years, following wartime shortages, have not resulted in a fall in deposits.  Seasonal fluctuations are on a relatively small scale.  Approximately four-fifths of the deposits are time deposits, only one-fifth being on current account: that is, time deposits not withdrawable by cheque represent in the main the savings of persons of a conservative turn of mind who have not hitherto shown any inclination, and are not likely to develop an urge suddenly to descend <i>en masse</i> to the banks to withdraw money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the next part: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Credit is often created but seldom destroyed.  After the first world war, despite a 50 per cent. fall in prices from their post-war peaks, a policy of <Col N="119" /> deflation, and long years of depression, less than one-third of the credit outstanding of the people was ever withdrawn.  In present circumstances there appears to be little likelihood of any calamitous decline in bank deposits or in the monetary circulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that was a good statement. It was a statement based upon the experience of those in association with the British situation since 1914.  It is an appreciation of the circumstances that exist here, an appreciation of the type of people who make savings in this country and who save money on deposit in the banks.  Yet, we are asked to believe that there are not enough savings. I do not believe anybody can calculate what the savings are.  If we are not to apply the term &ldquo;savings&rdquo; to money because it is put on deposit account in the banks, then we are living in a completely artificial and fictitious world.</P>
    <P>If this were any other country, a lot of the savings on deposit account would be invested if people had the investment habit.  If people had that habit they would be looking for investments, and be very glad to get investments.  It is ingrained in our people over the years, however, to put money on deposit in the banks, and the banks then turn around and say: &ldquo;We have a legal obligation and we must keep this money easily realisable.  Hence we cannot do anything with securities.&rdquo; The pivot of the whole game is the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In Section 8 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, it is specifically stated: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the bank to do all or any of the following things on such occasions and to such extent as the board shall think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Section 7 it is stated: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the bank to do, for the purposes of or through the general fund, all or any of the following things on such occasions and to such extent as the board shall think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section goes on to give authority <Col N="120" /> to invest in gold, and I come now to the two sub-sections I have already read.  The bank may: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... buy, hold, or sell securities of or guaranteed by the State which have been offered for public subscription or tender before being bought by the bank and are officially quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange and on the Cork Stock Exchange or securities of or guaranteed by the Government of any other country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second sub-section that I read gives the same permission with regard to local authority securities if they &ldquo;are authorised by law for the investment of trust funds.&rdquo;  The Central Bank can easily say they will buy and there is no nonsense thereafter.  There is no difficulty about liquidity.  I appreciate the answer of the joint stock banks at the moment that if they were suddenly to throw £150,000 or even £50,000 worth of any security on the market the effect would be to depress prices, because the ordinary market cannot immediately absorb money of that type.</P>
    <P>Supposing the Central Bank said: &ldquo;We will buy,&rdquo; and offer that to the public, and supposing the public did not buy and the bank buys instead, there is immediate liquidity.  I cannot understand why the Central Bank will not do that unless it is because of this horrible fear that besets that institution that there will be an avalanche of people descending on Foster Place, demanding that the whole note issue will be liquidated at once; it is because of that fear, they keep on holding British securities against that danger.</P>
    <P>I believe our main difficulty with regard to capital lies in these two sections. We can create conditions which will make for liquidity here and, if those conditions are not sufficient, there are other financial institutions of a liquefying type that can be created, if necessary, in order to bring about the situation that must be brought about if our capital development scheme is to continue.  If that is not done with the banks, what are we up against?  The Minister borrowed this year at 5 per cent.  The stock is now quoted at somewhere between <Col N="121" /> 2½ and 2¾ points above the issued price.  The Minister pretends to believe that he gauged the market correctly: he gauged it correctly for the banks but not for the citizens.  Notwithstanding all the wails, lamentations and mourning that were spread throughout the country by the Minister and his colleagues from the time they went into Government until Christmas last year, the investments that we asked people to put money in were holding their own up to September, 1951, at a small premium.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had gone for his loan in the summer of 1951 he could have got it at 3½ per cent. without the slightest doubt.  We arranged a situation for him, before he came in, with regard to a conversion loan.  The conversion loan was a success.  People who had their money in old-time investments at 5 per cent., and ranging down to 4 per cent., were induced to put their money into a new issue at 3½ per cent.  The issue was a success. Certain moneys had to be redeemed by cash payments but that was because of the restricted way in which the issue was floated.  Unless people accepted the new terms they were paid in cash.  Even so, from £16,000,000 to £20,000,000 was converted at 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Those conditions continued to prevail up to at least September to October, 1951, when the old stocks were running at a small premium.  To the end of the year they remained at par.  If the Minister had gone at any time, as he might, not for £20,000,000, but for £10,000,000 he would have got it at the prevailing 3½ per cent. rate. We used to borrow on equal terms with the British Government.  The credit of this State was at least equal to theirs.  We are now in the region of Southern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, the Sydney Conversion Loan and so forth.  That is the situation now.  The Minister, in his ignorance, chalks over that and says that he gauged the market correctly.  I believe that if he went for another £15,000,000 in the morning and asked the British insurance companies to take it up at 5 per cent. they would lap it up.</P>

      <P>The Minister says &mdash; and this is the ominous part for the future &mdash; that each succeeding loan must show better terms than the preceding one.  I never heard that put forward as a canon of finance before.  It means that those who invest in a loan in any year must realise that their stock will depreciate the next year when another loan is floated.  I think that that statement will cause terrible harm amongst the community.  Great harm has already been caused by the 5 per cent. issue.  There have been great losses. People have had to sell earlier loans &mdash; 3 per cent. and 3½ per cent.  Their losses, in some cases, will run into hundreds.  If people can hang on, well and good: they will get the guaranteed price of redemption, but if they are forced to sell they will sell at a loss. Those people are citizens of this country who were patriotic and decent. They accepted the Government's conditions and lent their money at 3 per cent. and 3½ per cent.  They now find that their stocks have depreciated very seriously because of the 5 per cent. loan which the Minister had to get.  Why had he to get it?  I have talked a lot about the banks.  I do not believe that the banks really squeezed the Minister into this.  I was able to tolerate what the banks advised me, though sometimes I did not take their advice &mdash; the situation where the Central Bank involves these funds in the way it does &mdash; because I was in Easy Street so far as money was concerned.  Very definitely, I was in Easy Street in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will talk, when he is concluding, about my third loan not being a success.  Does anybody believe that the credit of the Government to which I belonged suffered one particle because the loan that was floated after the Korean war had opened did not fill completely through the public?  It would have been characterised as a failure if I had been short of money, if I had wanted money for certain purposes and could not get it.  But I had as much money as I wanted, and some to spare for the Minister.  I always had the money for my schemes.  I got it either through the small savings of the people, through the departmental funds which <Col N="123" /> were there for investment and through what the public gave me.  In the end, with some small assistance from the banks who, in the main, I had asked to keep out of the ring, the Government to which I belonged were in Easy Street, and in very Easy Street so far as the provision of money for capital development was concerned.  The Minister, of course, could not face a loan not filling.  He was not thinking of the good of the country.  He had got one terrific rebuff in his time.  That was in 1933 when he went for a loan and got only 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Minister is a vain man.  His vanity could not stand up against the thought that a loan might not fill.  In any event, the Minister had dissipated the reserve.  Let me repeat that we were not merely in Easy Street but we had money to spare.  We had the American money. During the period when it was under my control, we had invested only £16,000,000.  We left the Minister £24,000,000.  If he had kept that as a reserve, and it was a policy that was clearly explained to him &mdash; we showed how it could have worked out in practice &mdash; against any small imperfection of the public's not responding to a loan in full, he could have kept it for six, seven or eight years.  But it was dissipated in six months &mdash; what he himself called the feverish period of the spending of the Marshall Aid.  That hit him. In the summer, autumn and winter of 1951 that was gone.  He was in the difficulty that if he did not get his money, the development of schemes that depended on that finance might have to be changed.  There might have been some disimprovement.  He and his Party would be exposed.  His personal vanity would suffer a cruel blow.</P>
    <P>The people are now paying very severely for what the Minister has described as a ha'porth of tar.  The smear on the ha'porth of tar so far has come only from the increased interest to be paid on the loan for housing.  It will go further still.  I wonder at what rate the Electricity Supply Board will get their new finances.  I wonder at what rate the <Col N="124" /> Agricultural Credit Corporation got money from the Minister.  I wonder if the Industrial Credit Corporation will have to reduce the ante for people who go to it for help.  I wonder if, in the case of all those groups which are supported by State credit, the rate of interest will be raised for them.  I presume this has been done in certain instances.</P>
    <P>The Minister was brought fairly hard up against it &mdash; not by the banks but by his own mishandling of the situation and by his inability to restrain his own spending.  We are all paying now for that.  When I first borrowed £12,000,000 from the public &mdash; I want this by way of contrast &mdash; and after that loan had been successfully floated, I felt in my innocence that I had a fairly easy time for some months ahead.  I remember investigating at one time how this big sum of £12,000,000 was to be spent.  The first shock I got was when it was hinted to me that I had not anything like that sum in hands &mdash; because a big amount of debt was left by the previous Government and had to be liquidated.  Fortunately, I did not appreciate how serious the weight of that debt was until I had asked for and got a return.  The return showed me that I had barely £500,000 free. The rest had to be spent on liquidating the debts that Fianna Fáil left in 1948.  One of the big items was what was displayed in this House as a great effort on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947.  They raised what was known as a transition development fund.  As that was presented to this House, it was raised from ordinary taxation.  However, if anybody investigates the finance accounts for that year they will find that whereas the £5,000,000 transition development fund was put in as something to be raised out of the ordinary taxation, the accounts for that year were in a deficit to the extent of almost the whole of the £5,000,000: I think £250,000 was not a deficit.</P>
    <P>The £5,000,000 Transition Development Loan was just a debt which they left for me to pay.  My first £12,000,000 went, except as to £2,500,000, in paying off the debts which the previous Government had left.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> Coming to 1951, the Minister has stated that we left no cash except a carry-over of a certain amount.  In 1951 we left the Minister £24,000,000 sterling in the bank for his spending and he spent it and spent it in six months.</P>

      <P>I do not know what it was spent on, but if it were spent on the schemes already in existence, it follows that the Minister now accepts these schemes as being proper schemes for capital expenditure.  However, the good policy that we had of holding that money as reserve of some millions to skim off, if the measure of the public response to public loans which we floated did not come to 100 per cent., has now been departed from.  That was a good policy, but that reserve is now dissipated and spent. A new policy has to be adopted.  A new financial policy is to be accepted now that these new schemes of capital development are being taken over by the present Government, and people are being encouraged to think that it is now possible to tackle the banks and more particularly the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The Minister said here that it was wrong on my part to speak of the personnel of the Board of the Central Bank.  I did not speak of the personnel of the Board of the Central Bank, but I think it is ridiculous to suggest that the report that we have here was written in the air and atmosphere of 1916, or that the members were thinking of the manacles worn by some of their members when they were carried through the City of Dublin at one particular period in our history.  I do not see much evidence of that in the bank report itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a Central Bank report which is presented to us pursuant to Section 36 of the Currency Act, 1927, and pursuant to the two sections which enabled the bank to take such steps &ldquo;as the board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable&rdquo; towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.  The motto there is: &ldquo;The constant and predominant aim shall be <Col N="126" /> the welfare of the people as a whole.&rdquo; I would like to see if it would bring any change in the contents of the report if there could be an insistence on that being put on the cover of the report as being the motto and the guide to the deliberations of the board.  The Central Bank were also asked to make provision &ldquo;for the collection and study of data relating to monetary and credit problems and to publish informative material in regard thereto&rdquo;. This is presented to us as informative material, as a step deemed appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and having the welfare of the people as a primary aim.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I want to say that while I tried to work a certain change of policy in the Central Bank and its board in recent years by a method of persuasion, which did not get very far, I believe now that that institution has to be modelled anew. I believe legislation has to be framed and that in relation to all our circumstances and the demands that future years, particularly the near future years, will bring, the institution will have to be remodelled.  It certainly will have to be changed to the point that there will be insistence, even if it be at the behest of some political Minister, that they must invest some part, a good part, of their funds in domestic assets, and they must invest in certain securities so as to bring about a situation of liquidity with the joint stock banks.  I believe that if these two things are done, we shall discover that there are quite enough savings to finance all the schemes floated for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us in a speech that lasted three hours about all the things that have been done since 1932 onwards.  I was reading recently an ancient historian's account of the old Roman imperial system.  He tried to explain that the one lesson that could be drawn from his examination was the fatal effect in an age of laborious reconstruction of a body of irreconcilable conservatism among their own governing classes.  I believe the Minister himself is a conservative of an irreconcilable nature, a nature that is not to be reconciled with the demands of the present. <Col N="127" /> I believe that in the main the operations of the Central Bank indicate that they, too, have a conservatism that is completely outdated, and not to be reconciled with what the circumstances demand.  I believe that we are in an age of reconstruction which will be laborious at the beginning.  I believe that the people in our three years faced that programme and were in a mood since that acceptance to welcome its implementation. In that mood we must shape the machinery of the Central Bank so as to provide that the resources of the community will be at the disposal of the community for schemes that will be for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the debates and listened to the speeches of many of those who participated in the debates on the questions that are now being discussed generally on this token Estimate.  I sometimes wonder whether people make statements believing them to be true, whether they make statements deliberately not meaning them to be true, or whether there is a complete lack of appreciation of the facts that face us.  I propose to come gradually to the speech of Deputy McGilligan, but before coming to the points that have been made by other speakers, I should like first of all to say that those who speak in this debate should at least indicate to the Dáil that they have some understanding of the difficulties involved in this question.  I approach this matter from the point of view first of all of the balance of payments of the nation in its trading with other nations, as distinct from the internal circulation of money and internal revenue, which is of course related to taxation.  When we come to separate these things, we find that the balance of payments depends on the amount of imports we have in excess of exports, and further, the power we have, if any, to fix or control the prices at which we buy these commodities which we have to import.  If we did not import them it would be because we could not buy them but, when we do import them, we have to pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in order to remedy the balance of payments in our favour, we have to <Col N="128" /> try and increase productivity at home and, mainly, productivity of a kind that will help additional exports.  Again, we have to try and get the best price possible for the articles we export &mdash; in other words, an appreciation in the price level of the goods we export at least equal to the appreciation in the price level of the goods which we import. I wonder if Deputies ever ponder on that particular aspect of the question. There are certain articles which are essential to our economy which we do not produce and hence have to import. We have to pay the ruling world price for those articles and, relative to the rest of the world, we are not a very big buyer.  Therefore, we cannot control the price of these articles by refusing to buy them, even if we could do without them.  Taking things in the world as they are to-day, our exports are very small in relation to the quantity of consumer goods which we have to import, particularly in relation to the export of the same class of goods from countries the world over.  Consequently, in regard to our exports, we cannot fix prices.  We have to take whatever the ruling prices are wherever we can find customers for our goods.  I would ask Deputies to examine that side of the question and see for themselves whether that is not one of the facts of the situation which confronts us.</P>
    <P>We have had Deputies, like Deputy MacBride, harping for years on one side of the issue &mdash; on what he calls the repatriation of our assets abroad.  He has been doing that without any regard at all to the question &mdash; to whom do these assets belong, or what percentage of them have we the right to take into our hands and disburse here, or what right have we to force them back here by a form of capitation levy?  Those assets belong to people who have been thrifty.  They have been able to invest these moneys abroad.  What right have we to force them against their own will and judgment to bring them home for investment at whatever price we suggest?  I suggest to Deputies that, in this country, we are living in conformity with a certain scheme of things which permits private ownership and does not permit the restriction of <Col N="129" /> private enterprise or the movement of the belongings of people from one to another or from one place to another. We have not yet quite socialised this State to the extent that every pound which a person owns is completely under the control and at the beck and call of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. People talk about the £400,000,000 of the Irish assets which are to be repatriated. We have, first of all, to ascertain what is the amount of assets abroad which can properly be regarded as funds under the direct control of the Government.  It is true that there are Government funds invested abroad, but I suggest that if these are dissected under their various headings it will be found that there are Acts of Parliament which force Departments of State to handle these moneys in different ways.  I see Deputy MacBride nodding his head, but is there not an Act of Parliament controlling the Post Office, for example, as to how it must deal with the funds it has on deposit from its depositors?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an Act of Parliament which binds the Post Office to deal in certain ways with its depositors' moneys.  The Post Office cannot do as it likes.  It is, by Act of Parliament, subject to control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  It is bound by Act of Parliament as to the manner in which it handles depositors' moneys.  There are also moneys under the control of the Department of Justice which belong to minors. These have to be handled in a certain way.  The State is a trustee in many cases in regard to privately owned money which is under its control.  Even though it is only a trustee in respect to those moneys, yet, to a certain extent, these moneys are regarded as Government funds or, at all events, <Col N="130" /> Government controlled funds.  The suggestion is that the Government, in regard to all the moneys which it controls, should have them invested at home in certain things and in certain ways.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputies who were listening to Deputy McGilligan realised that over the years since 1927 when the Currency Commission was first established, and which has since become the Central Bank, the amount of money transferred to it has considerably increased.  There has also been a tendency towards investment. Deputy McGilligan at one time &mdash; I propose to deal with this in detail at a later stage &mdash; made use of certain statements to the House which were completely misleading and unfair.  He pointed out that a change in the Act permitted the Central Bank to take up issues by local authorities, and tried to criticise it for not having done so, notwithstanding the fact that the present Act permits it to do so, but he was very careful to say, provided they were a trustee stock.  Now, that was a legal trick.  It was an attempt to mislead Deputy Hickey.</P>
      <P>Does Deputy Hickey know that, when Dublin Corporation, a local authority, sought to borrow money to build houses during the administration of Deputy McGilligan, the latter insisted on the loan having a maturity of 15 years or under it?  That debarred the loan from becoming a trustee stock, but Deputy McGilligan did not tell the House that. It was he who fixed the period of years in regard to these loans.  At one time, I think it was 15 years.  In another case the period of repayment was fixed at 14 years.  The fact that that was done debarred these loans immediately from becoming a trustee stock.  Therefore, the Dublin Corporation had to advertise for the raising of a loan for the City of Dublin, and by virtue of its short life, the loan was not regarded as a trustee stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about the fact that the Central Bank has not taken up any local authority loan and used that argument to castigate the Central Bank.  He did that at a time when, with full knowledge himself, he made it impossible for the Central Bank to take up a loan because it was not a trustee stock. That is the kind of approach and criticism which we are getting instead of a fair examination of what the problem is so that we may see how we can remedy our money situation, and so that greater advantage will flow to our people.  It must be done with care.  It should not be dealt with by unfair and misleading statements and in a mood of criticism which does not get us nearer to each other so as to have some understanding or appreciation of the problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan read out a lot of figures showing that our deposits in the bank had not declined notwithstanding all the changes and all the problems and that there was not less money in circulation than pre-war.  I am trying to be charitable, and I take it that he does not understand that the purchasing power of money to-day is only one-third of what it was pre-war. Therefore, if we want to have the same standard of living to-day as we had before the war, three times the amount of money has to be in circulation to purchase the same amount of goods.</P>

I heard Deputy Dillon, when speaking to this motion in which he refers to tendentious nonsense, talking the utmost nonsense.  First of all, he talked about timber which I dealt with on the last occasion.  He also spoke about importing raisins and currants from California which had to be paid for in dollars; that this Government had committed the crime of bringing in raisins and currants from California for which we had to pay in dollars.  But he did not tell the House that the currants and raisins on offer at that time from Turkey, from which country these imports had been previously got, were so dear as to become prohibitive; that the American currants and raisins were much cheaper, and although we paid for these currants and raisins in dollars we would have had to pay Turkey in gold under the balance of payments arrangement.</P>

      <P>I have not posed as an expert on anything, not even on transport. I am only expressing my view as an ordinary back bencher having given this matter considerable thought over a great number of years and having listened to wise and unwise people discussing it.  As to this purchase of raisins and currants, when there is no national emergency, ought we to restrict our citizens further in their dealings and their business and are we for all time to perpetuate such a control that there will be no individual liberty left about anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan quite rightly pointed out that one of the problems <Col N="133" /> we have to face &mdash; I hope the Minister for Finance will take some notice of what I am about to say &mdash; when we come to issue loans in this country or to seek money for investment &mdash; is the fact that the stock exchange is limited in its activities and operations so that when there is a comparatively large block of shares, whether in Government loans or anything else, offered in the market, there is immediately a depression in price.  The time has come when the Minister should examine the whole question of the operations of the stock exchange.  He might consider ways by which the shares on our stock exchange can be readily accessible to investors other than the limited few at home so that there will be liquidity, as it was put, and the possibility of much bigger operations than we are having now.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about our bank-notes.  I do not know whether Deputy Hickey reads papers which show the unofficial exchange rates of currency.  If he does not, I should like him to take notice of such papers as the American <i>Time,</i> in which he will see every week a table showing the operations of the official exchange and the unofficial exchange in relation to money.  The strange thing is that Irish bank-notes command abroad a higher price in dollars or other hard currency than the English bank-notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  I heard Deputy McGilligan speak with such horror of raising a loan at 5 per cent. that if I had been the borrower of the Marshall Aid money, with the depreciation of the £ which followed afterwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was spent after all our other assets had been plucked out of the barrel by your people. <Col N="134" /> How much will the Marshall Aid loan cost us by way of percentage?  Does Deputy Hickey know that we borrowed the dollars when the rate of exchange was $4.2 to the £ and that we have to repay the dollars now when the rate of exchange is $2.80 to the £?  That is a very big fall in the value of the £ apart from the interest charges that we have to pay.  I should like somebody to take pencil and paper and find out at what percentage we borrowed the Marshall Aid money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey says that this is because there was devaluation.  I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Government did not borrow that money because we would have had a different song from the other side of the House. The last Government were warned about the possibility of devaluation, but they thought they knew better because the spokesman of the last Government in opposition before 1948 always guaranteed that international convertibility of sterling at par was coming in the following June, and I used to shout across the House, &ldquo;At what rate?&rdquo;  Deputy Hickey will remember that we were promised by these people that sterling would be internationally convertible at par.</P>
      <P>As I said, I should like the Minister to examine the whole situation surrounding our stock exchange.  I believe that a great deal of good would result if it were examined thoroughly and brought up to date so that our stock exchange would not be limited in its operations, as it is more or less to the city and country generally, and to some small extent to the London exchange.</P>

It sets out, apparently, to relieve the ratepayers of a certain liability, but in actual effect, if it were accepted by this House and imposed on the Minister, it would result in a heavier burden being placed on the ratepayers than they are at present bearing.  Deputy Flanagan once claimed to be an expert on finance when he was chairman or leader of the Monetary Reform Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as we know, a fund at the disposal of the Government known as the Road Fund.  Last year, as far as I can ascertain, it amounted to £3,270,000.  This year the Minister hopes to add to that fund £800,000, making a total of over £4,000,000.  That is a substantial sum if it is applied to the reconstruction and improvement of roads generally, county and main roads, but if Deputy Flanagan's motion is put into effect it will, in all probability, be devoted entirely to the maintenance and improvement of our main roads, with the result that the unfortunate rural ratepayers about whom Deputy Flanagan apparently does not care will be left to bear the entire and enormous cost of maintaining the county roads.  There is provision, of course, in the motion for a special grant for turf roads, but those grants might amount only to a few thousand pounds, whereas there is a possibility and a great likelihood that, if the motion were carried, the entire Road Fund would be swallowed up in the maintenance and improvement of main roads.  I think it would be far more sensible to ensure that the entire amount of the Road Fund increasing year by year is devoted to all the public roads, main and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember, as far as future road improvement and maintenance is concerned, that county roads were a bigger liability than main roads, inasmuch as there is a huge mileage of county roads that has never been touched by modern reconstruction. At the present time we are spending about £5,400,000 on road reconstruction and maintenance &mdash; that is, on main and county roads combined. That is a very formidable sum of money.  Of that, about £2,300,000 is spent on main roads and about £3,100,000 on county roads.  Those are the figures for the present year.  It is clear, therefore, that the county roads are the more expensive proposition. It is clear, also, that it is the side of road making that will become more expensive and that should become more expensive, because while <Col N="138" /> some people, particularly people here in the city with high-powered cars, would like to see the main and trunk roads brought into first-class condition, I think that the ordinary people who have to live and work in the country would rather see the main expenditure directed towards the county roads.</P>
    <P>Because of that I think we should view this motion with concern and ask that it be withdrawn.  I would be inclined to ask the Minister not to accept it but instead to provide that the entire Road Fund be devoted to road making generally and to provide that the greater portion of it is spent on county roads.  I make that appeal as a rural ratepayer, as a farmer living in a rural area.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a disastrous thing if we were to implement this motion, that is to say that the State should take over complete responsibility for the main roads and leave the county roads to the ratepayers. The net result of that would be that the State, having put up 100 per cent. of the cost of the main roads would in all probability set up a central authority to direct operations on the main roads to control the administration of their construction and maintenance. In that way we would eventually reach the stage in which a central authority with over £4,000,000 of road money at its disposal would set out to create magnificent main roads and spend the entire amount of the Road Fund for that purpose leaving the unfortunate rural ratepayer to bear the entire cost of maintaining the county roads less a few thousand pounds special grants that Deputy Flanagan asks for in respect of turf roads.  This is an absurd proposition and one which I am glad the House has an opportunity of debating in spite of Deputy Flanagan's absence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This proposal if it were carried into effect would, in all probability, add perhaps 100 per cent. to the cost of road maintenance as it affects the rural ratepayers.  That is the important consideration.  It would divert the Road Fund, which is a very important fund at the present time, to the main roads.  It would leave the cost of building the roads which are at present in need of reconstruction on the shoulders of the ratepayers.  In that way it would impose a burden on the backs of the farmers and the ratepayers of this country that it would be impossible for them to bear.</P>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to discard this motion and to divert as much as possible of the Road Fund to the county roads.  The Minister will be and is subjected, as every Minister is subjected, to a demand from influential people in this country for the making of speedier, more luxurious and more expensive main roads than we have at present.  The Minister should resist that demand and say: &ldquo;Until we get the county roads up to a reasonable standard of construction we will go easy in regard to expenditure on the main roads.&rdquo;  That I think, is a reasonable proposition.  The Minister must know what country people have to endure in the matter of travelling on roads which are classed as water-bound roads.  &ldquo;Waterbound&rdquo; roads is a very good description.  We all know that water is not a very adhesive material except when it is frozen and even then it is not very adhesive.  The result is that we have thousands of miles of roads in this country which are nothing but chains of potholes which wreck the small car which the ordinary farmer has to use, which destroy and wreck the ordinary pushbike which so many in our farming community and working community have as their sole means of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of acting on a silly, ill-considered motion of this kind, let us direct our attention to a programme of complete reconstruction of our county roads.  I would like to see the Minister impressing upon the county councils the need for the adoption of a five-year <Col N="140" /> plan in regard to county road reconstruction.  I would like to see him demanding that each county council should outline a programme of reconstruction designed, in the course of five or six years, to put our county roads into a reasonable state of repair.  That would be far better than squandering the entire Road Fund on the main roads.  Some of the main roads may require improvement but, taking them by and large, they are capable of discharging their function as arteries of traffic, for some years to come at any rate.  Concentration should be upon the other type of roads which has been so sadly neglected.</P>
    <P>I think I was rather misreported in the Official Reports last week.  I said it was rather a good thing that this discussion had occurred at a time when the House had been dealing with ways and means of adding to the Road Fund by legislation which is at present being enacted.  It is hoped to add £800,000 to the Road Fund and I think it is essential now that the Minister should say to the county engineers and to the local authorities generally: &ldquo;I expect you to make the best possible use of this additional money.&rdquo;  Motorists, lorry owners and others have to bear the brunt of this extra burden and it is essential that not one penny of this additional money should be wasted.</P>
    <P>As I said recently in the House, I believe a very considerable amount of the money which is voted for road construction is wasted.  I believe that is due to an antiquated system of organisation and control in most counties.  I believe that the essential operations of road construction are the raising of road material, the transport of that road material to the road and the rolling of that material into the road. These are the three main operations of road making, but instead of the men available and the machinery available being used for that purpose, we have thousands of men whose time is completely devoted to doing what I consider should, under modern conditions of road making, be non-essential, that is, to trimming and dressing the grass margins and sides of the roads, and trimming them with antiquated equipment. In my constituency near Baltinglass, <Col N="141" /> in the Glen of Imaal, there is a house which has been reconstructed and preserved as it was 150 years ago when it was being used as a place of lodging by Michael Dwyer.  In the roof of that house there is a reaping hook.  The reaping hook was in general use 150 years ago on the farms and it went out of use over 100 years ago.  It is still being used on the roads for trimming and dressing the grass margins and trimming the sides of the fences.  I think we ought to aim at more general mechanisation of road operations to ensure that the best value is secured for the money that is expended.  Mechanisation of road making does not imply any reduction in the number of workers employed. If, for example a county council, employs 300, 400 or 500 men as road workers and if they decide to mechanise, they will continue to employ that number of workers but they will get through at least three times that amount of work.</P>
    <P>That is what we want.  I have not the figures &mdash; the Minister may have them &mdash; but I know that there is a huge mileage of county roads water-bound. They are in the condition which obtained 1,000 years ago, having the same type of road surface as was in existence at that time.  The time has come to change to something better.  Modern traffic demands tar-bound or cement-bound roads.  In the main, the tar-bound road has been found to be most efficient and there is no reason why the mileage of tar-bound roads should not be extended.</P>
    <P>The introduction of modern methods would mean that we would get value for the money voted for road maintenance. That value can be got by taking all the roads together as public roads and dealing first with those most urgently in need of reconstruction rather than by segregating particular roads for very special and favoured treatment, as this motion would imply.</P>
    <P>Engineering staffs and county councils should be given greater freedom in utilising the money provided out of the Road Fund.  They should be free to use the entire amount on county roads if the main roads are in fairly good condition.  On the other hand, if the <Col N="142" /> main roads are in bad condition, a certain proportion of the money should be allotted to them.  I suggest that there should be no red-tape or green-tape in regard to the amount of grant allocated for main roads and the amount allocated for county roads. Greater freedom would ensure the introduction of a thoroughly efficient system of road-making, which is what we need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan would be wise to withdraw this motion and to insist upon the full amount of the Road Fund being applied to whatever particular roads in each county are in most urgent need of repair.  To segregate different types of roads does not make for efficiency or for the best utilisation of the money at our disposal.</P>
    <P>If the whole problem is viewed fairly and impartially, it will be acknowledged that there is need for a vast improvement in our system of road making.  I do not think that improvement will be effected by the implementation of the proposals submitted to this House recently for the merger of two or three counties for this purpose.  There is no need for that.  There is no mechanical unit that is suitable for road making which is too large for any county to operate and to keep in operation full-time, to maximum capacity.  There is no need to merge counties.  All that is required is to have a fixed policy of getting the largest possible mileage of county roads reconstructed as quickly as possible and eliminating as quickly as possible the water-bound road.  By that is meant a road which is not really water-bound, but which is frequently swept away and turned up by a shower of rain.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Flanagan is wise, he will withdraw this motion and accept the proposition which I have put before the House, that we should concentrate on the improvement of county roads instead of squandering our money on main roads.  The effect of putting this motion into operation would be to double the road rate in the case of most counties and double the cost of reconstruction and maintenance of county roads, which is something to be avoided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> The increase in the Road Fund will help considerably.  I hope the Minister will insist on the highest possible standard of efficiency in the reconstruction of county roads.  Mechanisation may be criticised in some counties, but only by those who are too stupid to follow matters out to their logical conclusion.</P>

      <P>I have always maintained that the good worker is entitled to the most modern and efficient machinery available.  With wise planning, there is no reason why mechanisation should displace one man.  If there were only a limited mileage of roads to be constructed, if we were near the end of the problem of road improvement, we might begin to fear that mechanisation might have some evil effect but, as matters stand, mechanisation can result only in workers having less arduous and less onerous work to do.  It will result also in at least 200 per cent. increase in output per man employed on the roads.  In that way each county can continue to employ the number of men at present employed and, by the use of modern equipment, ensure that more work will be carried out.  That should be the aim of everyone who has the interest of the workers and the ratepayers at heart, and who is concerned to see that we will have an efficient system of road making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would pay more heed to this motion if it were not for the fact that Deputy Flanagan has been responsible in this House during the past few years for taking some millions of pounds from the roads.  Deputy Flanagan is one of those who supported the policy of reduction in road grants during the three and a half years that the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> That definite programme that was laid down and was being carried out before the inter-Party Government came in, was immediately stopped.  As a matter of fact, in the year they assumed office that programme had already been sent down to the county councils, stating the amount of grants being given to them for the reconstruction of roads.  It had gone too far to be called back.  In common with inter-Party policy, the means by which that money was found was to borrow close on £2,500,000 on the strength of the Road Fund.  The Road Fund, whether we like it or not, will have to pay each year some £250,000 to repay the money that was borrowed to fill the gap in that year. That was the first call on the Road Fund and that amount of money must come out of it each year.</P>
    <P>We know that every successive Government for a long number of years gave grants to county councils &mdash; 40 per cent. on main and trunk roads but nothing for any other road.  Therefore, this fund has resulted in main roads being pampered at the expense of the ordinary rural road.  I admit that the proposition as put up here is a tempting one.  We all like to throw something over on the State and let them carry it, but the manner in which it is going to be carried is another thing. Just the same as the obligation of the State to provide so many million pounds in road grants in the year that the inter-Party Government came into office was met by an immediate borrowing on the strength of the Road Fund, so in this case if this motion is pursued to its logical conclusion, the Road Fund would be completely devoted to main and trunk roads.</P>
    <P>The roads have been neglected &mdash; the roads over which, if we are to carry out the policy which is supported by every Deputy, must be carried the millions of tons of lime that are required. They are not required by the main roads but have to go in by the ordinary rural road and county road, and those roads are not in a condition to bear the present lime-spreading machinery that is going out and relieving the farmers of a lot of burdens. These are the roads which, to my <Col N="145" /> mind, will have to be the first care of the rural ratepayers and the first demand on them.</P>
    <P>I dealt here before with that position. I remember making a statement here about a month ago in another debate, that the road users should be made pay for the deterioration.  The road user pays in various ways.  Had things been normal financially, I am one who would have insisted on the petrol tax, which has increased by millions during the past five or six years, being turned over entirely, or a very large portion of it, to the Road Fund.  We are faced, however, with the position that in Cork County, for instance, our roads were deprived of grants while the inter-Party Government were in office to the extent of some £250,000.</P>

In addition to that, the Road Fund was raided each year, by all Governments in turn, and some £300,000 taken each time.  The ratepayers, therefore, did not even get from the State the motor taxation paid by the road users.  That practice was faithfully carried out during the régime of the inter-Party Government, and that raid was made each year.</P>

To get back to this rather brainy proposal of Deputy Flanagan's, I cannot see any grounds for taking out roads that have been favoured in a very special way by the State for over 20 years, roads that have been picked out and for which grants have been sent down to the county councils with a special proviso &mdash;&ldquo;grants for main and trunk roads, nothing for any other road&rdquo;.

      <P>By that policy, the county roads were starved and got nothing. Now it is proposed to hand over the good roads to the State and let the State take with them the motor taxation grant and then let the ratepayers take the back roads and the rest of the muck and try to build them up.  I suppose that when they are in good order again some other fellow will take a fancy and say he would like that piece.</P>
      <P>If Deputies will go back they will find that there was a motion on the Order Paper, before we went out of office, to the effect that the full motor taxation, petrol tax and the tax on the import of motor vehicles and parts should be handed over for a certain period of time to enable the roads to be brought to a fair standard.  That was only looking for all the money paid by the motorists in taxation each year.  It was no more nor no less.  From questions put and answers I received in this House I know, at any rate, that the revenue from petrol tax increased from about £1,250,000 to over £5,000,000.  Deputy Davin did not bother about those things.  He did not worry about the questions or the answers, but the questions and replies given at that period are there for everybody to see.  If we had not to face the burden of finding the interest on all the millions that were spent by the gentlemen opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we had not to find that money I would support a proposal that the income from petrol tax should now be applied to the roads.  I know the money for the petrol tax is needed to pay interest on what was borrowed. We are faced with that position, and I for one could not support any proposal which would mean taking the money provided by motor taxation and using it for roads that have already been well catered for and looked after to the detriment of the roads that are used by the ratepayers.  If the heavy vehicles used by the Sugar Company traversed these roads the level would immediately sink and the ground <Col N="148" /> would shake for a number of yards. That is because the roads are in such a wretched condition that they are unfit to carry such traffic.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that in so far as possible the grants for the roads that were taken from them for the three and a half years when the inter-Party Government were in office &mdash; amounting to about £1,000,000 per year &mdash; should be restored in so far as they can be restored.

      <P>I am trying to do so but find it difficult because of the interruptions. I suggest that Deputy Flanagan would be wise to withdraw his motion. I do not see how the ratepayers or the roads themselves are going to gain any benefit by a proposal of this description. I cannot see them getting any. I do not believe that my county council or any party in it will be prepared to see the total Road Fund money and the total Road Fund grants completely thrown into main and trunk roads again and the ratepayers held responsible for the full upkeep and improvement of the ordinary farmers' roads in this country.  I do not believe they would.</P>
      <P>I think the proposal is foolish and I think that the little trimmings that go with the proposal are suggestions that Deputy Flanagan knows would not, and could not, be carried out.  Deputy Flanagan is very well aware of his business.  As a member of a local authority, he is aware of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit it is nice to see a fine, smooth road so many feet wide, with workers taking away a dangerous corner to enable a person travelling at 50 miles an hour to go at 60 miles an hour.  You will find that along all our main roads at the present time, but the moment you leave those roads you get into roads upon which an ordinary donkey could hardly travel.  That is <Col N="150" /> the condition of the ordinary rural road at the present day.</P>
    <P>I, at any rate, could not for one moment support any proposal which would mean that the Road Fund would go into one specific class of road which, in my opinion, should be the last road to be catered for in this country to-day.</P>

I do not know what kind of make-up there is in a man of that character. This motion was moved by Deputy O'Higgins during my absence, and Deputy Cogan, bursting with zeal and enthusiasm, rose and seconded it with great pleasure.  Deputy Cogan, being the wise old hen he is, had a reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All his speeches in his constituency were in favour of all main roads being made a national charge, and he knew quite well that some publicity would be given in the papers the following day and that his constituents would get the impression that he seconded this motion that all main roads be made a national charge in accordance with the many speeches he has made at meetings of the county council of which he is a member.  Time and again, Deputy Cogan has said at meetings of that body that he completely disagreed with the ratepayers of a particular county having to foot the bill for the mileage <Col N="151" /> of main roads and trunk roads within that county.  He said it was the duty of the State and the serious obligation of any Government in power to provide fully for the maintenance of main and trunk roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan and Deputy Corry have spoken about the Road Fund and road grants, and Deputy Corry said that the Minister was to be congratulated on his present stand against the robbing of the Road Fund.  He did not tell us, however, that the Minister and his Party were the first people to raid the Road Fund before the inter-Party Government ever took office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this motion are: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all main and trunk roads should be maintained from State funds....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one portion of the motion.  A second portion reads: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and that, as turf-producing counties have increased road traffic they should have increased road grants for county roads.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan and Deputy Corry never for one moment referred to the turf-producing counties.  The reason which prompted me to put down this motion is the fact that I have the honour to represent the principal turf-producing constituency in this country. I know quite well that the grants which were made available in the ordinary way to the Offaly and Laois County Councils for the maintenance of roads during the emergency could not be spent and were not spent for the reason that there were not men, time or materials to do the roads.  The County Councils of Laois and Offaly were too busy cutting turf so that people like Deputy Cogan and Deputy Corry would have a fire.  Then we are told to-night that Deputy Cogan and Deputy Corry cannot see their way to urge that special consideration should be given to the turf-producing counties.</P>
      <P>On more than one occasion the Taoiseach, his Ministers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party made serious appeals on the platform, on the radio and in this House to people to cut more turf and to the local authorities to cut turf in order that the large towns and cities might not be without firing.  This city, together with Cork City, Galway, Sligo and the other large towns throughout the country would have had many fireless and cold homes if it were not for the fact that, in Laois, Offaly and other turf-producing counties, the call of the Government was generously responded to, and turf production maintained at its very highest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the emergency lasted, we had lorries ploughing up the roads of Offaly and Laois, bringing thousands <Col N="153" /> of tons of turf to this and other cities. There were heavy lorries drawing thousands of tons of turf to railway stations and we had hospitals, mills and factories all depending on what came from the bog.  There was this heavy traffic ploughing up the bog roads, the country roads and the county roads, as well as the main roads, and we are told now that, because we could not put men on road repair work and because we did not spend the grants we got, during the emergency &mdash; we could not do so because we were complying with the wishes and request of the Government to produce turf &mdash; no consideration should be given to the turf-producing counties.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that, during the years of the emergency, when counties like Laois and Offaly could not put men on the roads, in addition to the heavy turf traffic, there were Army lorries running from the Curragh to the South and from Athlone through Offaly to the South, and to Dublin.  That volume of Army lorry and other traffic during the emergency helped in no small way to plough up the roads of Laois and Offaly.  I say without fear of contradiction that the roads, both main and county, are far worse in Laois and Offaly and in parts of Kildare than in any other county in Ireland, because every other county during the emergency could keep their full-time staffs engaged on road work, road widening and road repairs.</P>
    <P>That could not be done in Laois and Offaly.  All we had was a skeleton staff on the repair of roads during the emergency years.  It is only right that the Government, in recognition of the services generously rendered by the county councils of Laois and Offaly, should give special consideration to increasing the road grants in the case of these counties and only in the case of these counties which participated in a very big way in turf production.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has at his disposal information on the counties which contributed generously to the fuel pool during the emergency he will find that counties Mayo, Leix-Offaly, part of <Col N="154" /> Kildare, parts of Galway, and parts of North Tipperary were the principal county councils engaged in turf production. Surely some consideration should be given to these.  Surely they should be put in the position of bringing the roads at least up to the standard of those in other counties where the county councils were fortunate enough to be able to carry out road repair and maintenance during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I believe the case I am making deserves the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan criticised bitterly the inter-Party Government.  Deputy Corry referred to the cutting of the road grant.  He told us that road grants were reduced by £2,000,000, but he failed to tell us that £4,500,000 was spent simultaneously under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I think that Act is one of the most valuable that has ever passed through this House.</P>

      <P>I think it is only reasonable that the Minister should give special consideration now to the turf-producing counties.  If the prophecy made by the Minister for Finance in North-West Dublin is borne out by fact we will be engaged in another world war at a very early date.  In that eventuality turf production will again be of paramount importance, but I can assure the Minister that if some further assistance is not forthcoming to the counties for which I have made a special claim, they will not again engage in turf production as generously and as enthusiastically as they did in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion must be divided into two parts.  First of all we have to consider the county roads in those counties in which turf production is in operation.  Secondly, we have to consider the main roads.  The whole <Col N="155" /> problem has to be considered in all its aspects.  We are anxious that our roads should be put into proper repair. We are also anxious to get as much assistance as possible from central funds in order to carry out the essential work.  If the Central Fund is asked to contribute more there is danger of local authorities losing a little of the meagre authority they have at the present time.  There is also the danger that members of local authorities may clamour continuously for extra money from the State, including that member who, like the flight of the eagle, left the House very quickly to-night after making his contribution. That particular member of the Cork County Council has continuously adopted the attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it should be the &ldquo;Skibbereen Eagle&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that local authorities should not be asked to contribute such a large sum either for main or county roads.  It would be well if some of the erroneous statements made here by Deputy Corry had never been made.  Every local authority is continuously faced with the problem of what will happen in relation to the maintenance, improvement and repair of our roads.  I agree with Deputy Corry that the roads are at present in very bad condition.  I do not agree with his co-partner, Deputy Cogan, who stated that everything in the garden would be lovely provided we adopted a better system and more up-to-date methods.  He left me under the impression that we were getting enough money at the present time if we utilised it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would undoubtedly be advantageous if more modern equipment were at our disposal and if more modern methods were in operation.  It would probably be to the advantage of the ratepayers who ultimately pay the piper.  I take strong exception to the view that we are not spending the money at the present time in a proper manner.  Possibly, we are not all ultramodern in our ideas.  Some of us appreciate the enormous sum of money involved in procuring machinery. Some of us know the high bill that <Col N="156" /> had to be met in the past from that point of view.  Deputy Cogan's attitude is not one that will help us in finding a solution to our present problem.  Irrespective of whatever Minister is in office, he is always faced with the problem of the money to be provided.  We need the money.  The problem is whether it can be provided in a sensible manner and in a way in which we will hope it will be provided. That is the point that I should like to try and express.  If money is given from central funds to a much larger degree than at present &mdash; and we would be anxious for it &mdash; where, in the first place, will it come from?  If the local authorities have to provide a certain amount of money at present, that money comes through the collection of rates.  If the money is to come in a much larger degree from central funds, it will not come from rates, but it will come from direct or indirect taxation.  On the other hand, coming from the rates, we are asking people to pay according to their valuations at the present time.  It may be, as it is in many instances, a large burden to be placed on people.  Yet, I consider that that method is somewhat more justifiable &mdash; to a certain degree, at any rate &mdash; than to place the burden on the backs of the people through indirect and direct taxation which, ultimately, means that the working people of this country will have to pay more through indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>We all know that if we are to get money from central funds through taxation, the commodities that we have any hope of getting money from in the way of taxation are foodstuffs and commodities which are used by the working people of this country.  I think, therefore, it would be well for us to approach the matter in the realisation of the immense problem which it can be for the people and for the country.</P>
    <P>I understand the difficulties that had to be met in the counties where turf production was in operation during the emergency years.  I know that turf production meant the haulage of turf by very heavy lorries, mainly over county roads and bad county roads, which meant that when the emergency was over and when turf had ceased to <Col N="157" /> be produced to the great extent that it was produced during the early years of the emergency, the roads were in an even worse condition than before. There is one aspect of this problem that we cannot forget.  I am trying to discuss this problem with a view to finding the best solution possible.  We cannot forget that by the production of turf and by the increased sales of turf &mdash; I am speaking, at any rate, of parts of County Cork and adjacent counties &mdash; a very large income went into the homes of the people in those turf-producing areas which, undoubtedly, was a benefit to a certain section of the community at that particular time.  I should be most anxious to hear the Minister's views on this important problem: is there the danger that we are asking the State, not just to increase the amount for the main roads but also, as the motion states, to maintain them?  We cannot lose sight of the fact that people have prospered, thanks be to God, to an immense degree from the sale of turf in particular areas.  If these grants are forthcoming, we want to see the burden divided equally, and divided, particularly, in such a way that those who can bear that burden will be those who will be expected to bear it.</P>
    <P>That is why I consider that it would be very important not to come to a hasty conclusion over a matter such as this, without weighing the full consequences attached to it.  I fully agree that many of our county roads, through turf production, have deteriorated to a great degree.  Not for one moment could I agree, however, with the statements made by Deputy Corry in this House.  I do not like to have to refer to any Deputy's speech when he is not present in the House to hear what I have to say but, with Deputy Corry, it continually happens that, having made his contribution to the debate, he disappears from the House and is not seen here again until he comes in to make another speech.  If I attack his speech now it is not for the purpose of speaking behind his back but just because he has not stood his ground.  I wish to contradict the statements made here by him this evening.  He has drawn particular attention to the reduction in the road grants.  He mentioned County <Col N="158" /> Cork.  I consider that it would be well for us if, in discussing this motion, we realised that there are 26 counties under the jurisdiction of this Parliament, and that we should not confine our remarks to one particular county or one part of one particular county. Deputy Corry was not ashamed to go so far as to say that each year the inter-Party Government raided the Road Fund up to the tune of &mdash; he said at one stage &mdash; £2,000,000.  Surely, in all fairness, Deputy Corry must know that that statement was not correct.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, and with great respect.  Deputy Desmond did not use those words.  It is a fact &mdash; as those who listened to Deputy Corry know &mdash; that, after being warned, Deputy Corry repeated the statement and repeated the assertion.</P>

      <P>It will be seen from the Official Report that Deputy Corry gave us facts and figures and, even if the Chair rebuked him, he still gave them.  Surely, as he has given them, another Deputy would be entitled to give figures to refute the false statements made by Deputy Corry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support both sections of the motion.  Regardless of what other Deputies may think, I am <Col N="160" /> particularly attracted by the first section of the motion in connection with the maintenance of main and trunk roads.  I have yet to hear any logical argument against that proposal. Like other Deputies, I should like to get the Minister's view on this matter before expressing my own. However, over a long period of years I have advocated this system of maintenance. I know that it has been suggested by some members of local authorities, as it was suggested by Deputy Desmond here this evening, that this would mean a lessening of the authority of local bodies but I think the correct way to approach that would be to elicit the views of the ratepayers who elect these local authorities.  I have no hesitation in saying that if the ratepayers were asked what their wishes were on the question whether main or trunk roads should be maintained entirely from central funds rather than by local funds, there would be a very clear verdict in favour of maintaining these roads from central funds.</P>
      <P>When you consider the type of traffic which travels over main and trunk roads and the fact that the ordinary ratepayers make comparatively little use of these roads, I think it is a great injustice to ask these ordinary ratepayers, few of whom have motor-cars or lorries which are the vehicles that do most damage to these roads, to pay for the maintenance of such roads.  They very rarely use them except when going to markets or fairs and to ask them to bear the burden of the maintenance of trunk and main roads is a great injustice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are asked to bear a very heavy part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another way of putting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are bearing a burden which they ought not to be asked to bear in justice and equity. When we consider that our whole transport system has been nationalised and that there is a trend in the minds of transport directors with regard to <Col N="161" /> more road traffic rather than rail traffic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And in the minds of others, I am afraid, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  That is my point that the roads are not being used for the purposes for which they were originally intended and it is not reasonable to ask that the ratepayers should maintain them in the condition in which they should be, if they are to bear the class of traffic that now travels over them.  Córas Iompair Éireann, Bord na Móna and the sugar company, three State bodies, are the heaviest users of the roads to-day and are responsible for much of the damage done to them.  When you compare the use made of the roads by these bodies with the use made of them by the ordinary people, I think you will see the injustice of having them maintained by the rates.  It does not make sense to me and I do not think there is any point whatsoever in suggesting that it would be a lessening of the authority of local bodies if the liability were transferred from the rates.  At any rate whether it would or not, the burden is becoming so intolerable to the ratepayers that they will not be able to maintain the roads in the condition in which it is necessary to maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which should be discussed without reference to any particular Government or Party.  It is not a question of Party politics at all; it is a question of national importance. There have been different Governments in this country and none of them has nationalised the roads in the way suggested.  There is no reason why any Government should think it is being singled out for attack in this matter. All Governments have been equally culpable.  Is it not time now in view of the fact that we have nationalised transport, and that we have State companies as the heaviest users of the road, to shift the burden to where it properly belongs?  Deputy Desmond complains that it would be unfair and inequitable to finance this burden by direct taxation. That is a question that could be argued, but there is a far greater argument against putting the burden on <Col N="162" /> the shoulders of those who now bear it.  If it is suggested that the income derived from turf production benefited the people of a particular county, as admittedly it did in Laois and Offaly, and in Roscommon, too, it must be remembered that turf production was a scheme carried out in the national interest.  It was embarked upon because it was in the national interest rather than with any object of enriching the people of those areas.  I feel that the nation as a whole owes a debt of gratitude to the people in these counties, who produced fuel when it was not obtainable from outside sources, and it would be a very unfair approach to this problem to suggest that the people in these areas should now be made responsible for the maintenance of roads damaged by turf lorries.</P>
    <P>The county roads have deteriorated to an alarming degree as a result of the heavy traffic imposed on them by Bord na Móna.  In my own county some roads have been made impassable as a result of this traffic, and brought to a condition in which the local authority is inclined to disregard them for the future.  I know that we asked Bord na Móna to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in order to put the county roads into condition in which they could be used with safety by all the users of these roads. I think it is a horrible thing that State bodies leave roads in such condition that people cannot go to Mass, and that the local authority should be called upon to restore the roads to their former condition.</P>
    <P>There is an important question of justice and equity involved and I would impress on the Minister to give the most serious consideration to this motion and not to think that I speak upon this matter for myself alone.  At any rate, I am not speaking from any political or Party motive.  I have advocated this principle for many years and I think it is something the Government will have to recognise ultimately in justice to the people.</P>

      <P>I take the risk of repeating &mdash; although there is really no risk in it &mdash; what Deputy Flanagan has said because I think I can speak with a longer experience of this House than <Col N="163" /> Deputy Flanagan.  I have never before in my experience in this House listened to a Deputy seconding a motion and then using his position as seconder to say everything he possibly could against the motion and against the person who put down the motion.</P>

      <P>I refrained from intervening because I was anxious to hear what the Minister had to say.  There are two important sections in the motion dealing with different principles. It is a good many years ago, nearly 30 years ago, since I supported the principle contained in the first portion of the motion, and in quite different circumstances.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
