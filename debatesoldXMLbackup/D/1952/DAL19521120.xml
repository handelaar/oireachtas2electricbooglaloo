    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> In line 14, to delete all words after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;be deemed to have come into operation on the 1st April, 1952.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands it is provided that it shall not come into operation after it becomes an Act, until a day which the Minister shall appoint by Order. The reason we are moving this amendment is because this Bill is a somewhat unusual measure.  It is in substitution for a previous measure which was alleged to have been defective in so far as securing for agricultural workers the right to a half-holiday was concerned. It has been admitted in debate here that the principle of the half-holiday for agricultural workers was accepted by the Oireachtas, and was written into the Statute Book by the previous measure.  In our view, the amending Bill or repeal Bill now before the House should have in it some degree of retrospection in so far as the entitlement of the agricultural worker to a half-holiday is concerned, otherwise the intent of the Bill of 1950 will have been completely vitiated, and agricultural employers who are not providing an agricultural half-holiday for their workers, will have been, in fact, evading the law, and no step will have been taken by us in this measure to make them comply with what the law was.</P>
    <P>We are further reinforced in that view by statements made last year and early in the present year to the effect that it was proposed to bring in this legislation at an early date.  I need only refer as one instance of that to the Debates of the 29th April of this year as reported in Volume 131, No. 4, in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister, acting for the Minister, assured Deputy Mac Fheórais that the undertaking which the Minister had given some two months previously to the effect that this legislation would be introduced in one month's time would be carried out.  It seems to us, therefore, no more than reasonable that the 1st April, 1952, should be the date on which this Bill should take effect and become operative.  That is the purpose of the amendment and I think the House will agree, or should agree, that agricultural workers who have been deprived of this right by their <Col N="1827" /> employers, in flagrant violation of the law of the State, should be at least enabled by this Bill to claim retrospectively from those who employed them, the right to payment for the half-holidays which they were not allowed and which they should have been allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose the amendment, first of all, because it is unconstitutional to introduce penalties retrospectively in legislation.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's attitude is not helpful.  I should like to know where we stand in regard to this, in view of the statement made by the Minister last February when he stated that it was his intention to introduce this Bill within a month.  If the Minister had done that, then, of course, the agricultural workers would have been able to enjoy their half-day at a much earlier period.  Even at the present time, we have not the faintest idea as to when the Minister will by Order, make it clear that these workers are entitled to their half-day.  I think the attitude of the Minister is unjust and unfair, especially in view of the fact that when a committee was set up to consider this matter it was found by a majority, which came from the Minister's own Party, that there were weaknesses in the old measure which required to be remedied.  The Minister himself found it suitable to attack faults that were in the old Act. These are facts that we must face up to.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment in view of the fact that the people concerned do not know at the moment when they are likely to get the half-day to which they are justly entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great wonder to me why the Labour Party, when they had the power, did not put this machinery into motion themselves.  Of course, there was a lot of bluff, and now it is being left to the present Minister to introduce a Bill to do for the agricultural workers what the Labour Party failed to do when they had the power.  It surprises me that they did not make a good job of it. <Col N="1828" /> They seem to me to have failed completely to do so.  I am very grateful to the Minister for taking steps to see that justice will be done to the agricultural workers.  They surely are entitled to holidays the same as other sections of the community.  I have no doubt that the Minister, supported by the Fianna Fáil Party, will see that justice is done to the agricultural workers.  I am delighted at the honourable stand which the Minister is taking on this.  He is not running away from it as his predecessor did, notwithstanding the fact that the Labour Party kept his predecessor in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  I desire to draw attention to the fact that we are discussing an amendment to the Bill and not the entire Bill which the Deputy seems to be doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that he should not get himself put out so early as the <i>Herald</i> reporter is not here yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the advice which I have got from my honourable colleague and hope to keep to the path of righteousness and rectitude. As I have said, I am sure the present Minister will see that justice is done to the agricultural workers, that they will get their holidays in due course, and that there will not be any bluff as there was by the previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that it would be very unjust to seek to impose penalties on ordinary struggling farmers who did not provide a holiday for their workers during the past year.  That was because their legal advisers informed them that under the Act passed last year there was no obligation on them to do so.  Many of those employers are men in a very small way, and may have provided their workers with far more valuable concessions than those which were provided in the Act passed last year.  I think it would be a gross injustice to impose penalties on them for failing to carry out an Act which was <Col N="1829" /> not legally binding on them.  A far more serious aspect of the question is that, as the Minister has pointed out, it would be unconstitutional to impose penalties retrospectively.  When this Act comes into force, it ought to apply to some time in the future and not to the past.  I do not think that some of the leaders of the Labour Party, who live in or near the city, realise what a hard and keen struggle it is for the working farmer employing one or two men to make ends meet, not to speak at all of accumulating a sufficient bank balance to meet such a demand as that implied in the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, and it may be an indictment of the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keane must allow Deputy Cogan to proceed without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may also be an indictment of our whole political, economic and agricultural set-up in this country, but whatever it is it is a fact that has to be faced.  The fact is that the vast majority of our 300,000 or 400,000 farmers find it extremely difficult to make ends meet.  I think that, when this Bill is passed into law, they will endeavour to comply with its provisions. At least they ought to be given due notice and ought not to be compelled to comply with the provisions of an Act which was not enforceable and ought not to be compelled to comply with retrospective provisions in this Bill.  The Minister is endeavouring to be fair both to the farmers and the workers and if the Bill is accepted in that spirit it will be carried out with the co-operation of the farmers and implemented without any trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have a different opinion with regard to this retrospective provision from my colleagues who moved it.  Quite recently I paid a visit to an area in East Cork where the <Col N="1830" /> farmers, without exactly living in opulence, are very nice and comfortable and I discovered that the maximum wage paid there to farm workers was £3 12s. per week.  As a result, last week I asked the Minister in a question whether he would recommend that the 12/6 increase which was agreed to between a certain Trade Union Congress and the Federation of Employers should be given to farm workers and he stated that he had no function in the matter, which I take it is correct.</P>
      <P>But the position is that while £3 12s. is the minimum, these innocent farmers referred to by Deputy Cogan availed themselves of the opportunity to say that they could pay no more within the framework of the law; that that was the only sum they could pay; that if they paid under that sum they could be prosecuted and if they paid over it they could be prosecuted.  Some of the workers have been deprived of the amenities of a half-holiday for the past two years.  I cannot understand Deputy Cogan criticising anything that happened as far as the previous Act was concerned because he was very strongly against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a thing as restitution.  I believe that my colleagues, who probably have a wider knowledge of the conditions throughout <Col N="1831" /> the country than I have, as I may be a little bit parochial, put this amendment down in order to get justice administered to the poor people for whom Deputy Corry is looking for £6 per week.  I am sure the Minister will give consideration to that when Deputy Corry suggests it.  I am aware of the solicitude of a lot of the Fianna Fáil back benchers for the agricultural workers.  The only thing is that regimentation, or should I say rigid discipline, prevents them from saying what they would like to say in this House.  I know that the Minister himself, when he was a back bencher, had a certain solicitude for the agricultural worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he would give the agricultural worker every amenity he could give him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy please come to the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>He is now in the position, in connection with this amendment, of practising what he used to preach at one time.  If I have travelled outside the scope of the amendment, I had better keep rigidly to it now as I have been warned twice.  I maintain that where the farmers did not comply with the existing Act justice is now being meted out to the agricultural worker by making the payment to him retrospective from April last.  We have heard from Deputy Cogan that making this retrospective is unprecedented in this House.  We all know that certain legislation has been passed here from time to time that was retrospective and retroactive.  Deputy Cogan does not give two hoots about the farm labourers or even about the farmers. There is only one person he cares about and that is Deputy Cogan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister in dealing with this will be very fair.  I appreciate his difficulties.  It is not the same as if he were dealing with civil servants or officials of local authorities or people who are more or less in continual employment with the employment register being kept for them, but I am sure <Col N="1832" /> there is some way of dealing with the matter.  Such a gesture would be appreciated by the people who would benefit by it, namely the agricultural workers. If he cannot go the whole hog, perhaps he may be able to do something.  As I said, I may not see eye to eye with my colleagues in this, but we are allowed free discussion under the democratic rights of our Party and we can say things which perhaps other back benchers cannot say because there would be penalties enforced and admonitions given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go so far as that.</P>
      <P>The Minister could give this very careful consideration and he need not be too worried about the financial position of the people concerned. He probably had the information before I had that good stores went £6 per cwt. in the Dublin market yesterday.  That is not bad.  It is a credit to the Minister and a credit to his predecessor, too. Whatever any Deputy may say, let him be independent, conservative or reactionary, agriculture has stepped up and the farmers have stepped up to an amazing degree in the past few years. I give a certain amount of credit for that to the Fianna Fáil Government which was in office prior to 1948 also.</P>

I do not want to make this an issue between the Minister and the farmers and the workers.  I would like the Minister to be there as a cushion to take the rebuffs from both sides and at the same time to give something to please both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said at a previous stage of this Bill that I hoped for agreement on this measure as far as is possible in a House made up as this House is made up.  I still hope for it and so do all of us who now subscribe to the principle of the Bill&mdash;some of us are doing penance for having to do so.  If we can secure agreement there will be less trouble in administering the Bill.  The Minister at a previous stage of this discussion indicated that he wanted very considerable time&mdash;he did not indicate the period&mdash;after the measure has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas to reorganise, I suppose, the Agricultural Wages Board in order to bring the measure into operation as smoothly as possible.  I want to point out to the Minister&mdash;and I am sure that it is pertinent for me to do so on this amendment&mdash;that he has already had the matter under consideration since the 22nd February, 1951, now nearly two years ago.  If he meant what he said on the previous stage surely he was anticipating the passage of this Bill even in its present form and if so he should have made some preliminary arrangements for bringing it into operation in the same way as every other measure which is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister made statements and very positive statements in this House on the 22nd February, 1951.  He made a statement the other day, but of course he could not prove it and he knew that he was in a tight corner when I challenged him to name the date on which he voted for the Second Reading of the Bill which decides the principle of the Bill.  He <Col N="1834" /> led his men out of the House because they could not make up their minds. They were playing with politics.  I remember very distinctly a Deputy of this House on that particular occasion being overheard in this corner asking permission to abstain from voting and he was told to get out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking&mdash;and I hope I am doing so properly&mdash;whether the Minister meant what he said in February and March, 1951.  Section 1 of the Bill says very definitely that the Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Agriculture appoints by Order and we are merely suggesting that it should be made retrospective to the nearest suitable date to the date of the Minister's undertaking to this House or the date on which he indicated his viewpoint to this House.  I agree with the Minister, as does everybody who has knowledge and experience of the Agricultural Wages Board so-called, that it requires drastic reorganisation.  It is not a wages board at all.  It is a dictatorship.</P>

      <P>I cannot for the life of me understand the Labour members' attitude to this amendment.  Coming from the country I know the hardships of farmers and the hardships of agricultural workers too and I have as much regard for the workers as any Labour member in this House.  It seems very unjust and unfair to try to make this provision retrospective when the Bill was never enacted.  I wonder do they realise the hardships of a tillage farmer with a young family who employs three or four workers.  It is not all sunshine at the present time.  They are not rolling in riches as some of us are led to believe.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputies Davin and Keane.  I did not think that we were going to travel over the Second Stage again but apparently that is what we have been trying to do.  The amendment, as I have already stated, is unconstitutional. I thought that it might be <Col N="1836" /> left at that and that we would not have a further debate.  Going back for a moment, we know quite well that the Bill was unworkable.  I am sure that Deputy Dunne knows that.  No provision was made to have it carried out.

      <P>We did not know whether it was workable or not until such time as it was discovered in this House that no provision was made by way of a money resolution to carry it into effect. That was the reason why the Bill was unworkable.  There was nobody to carry it into effect.  The Agricultural Wages Board would, in the normal way, be made responsible for it as they had to fix a wage for the half-day where an agricultural worker elected to work. There was no provision for them to do so, because as the Bill stood at the time, if my recollection is right, there was a difference between the wage fixed per hour and the wage recommended for the half-day.</P>
      <P>The reason why this Bill cannot be made retrospective is this.  When the Bill goes through here, as I hope it will without very much further debate, it will be necessary to get the Agricultural Wages Board to prescribe a wage for the half-day in the case where the worker elects to work.  In addition to that, there is a statutory regulation there of a two months' period in order to give an opportunity to the area boards to meet and discuss this matter before it comes finally before the Agricultural Wages Board.  Once they have made their decision, there is no reason why it should not come into operation immediately, but it is necessary to give them an opportunity of having this discussed and making the arrangements to carry it out.</P>

      <P>First, as I said, it is unconstitutional and I have given the reason why.  It will be necessary for me to give a certain period of time before the measure will come into operation.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that a responsible Minister should stand up here and say, in another effort to mislead some of his own Party here, apart from the thousands of agricultural workers throughout the country, that the Bill of 1950 which was enacted by the Oireachtas, was unworkable.  The position in regard to the previous Half-Holiday Bill, which was the first of its kind in this country and which secured the acceptance of the House against the will of Fianna Fáil, was that an aggrieved party had a remedy in law by taking action in the courts.  The Minister knows that is the position but, of course, because of the circumstances that prevail through the country it is not always easy for an aggrieved party, an agricultural worker, to take such a <Col N="1838" /> step.  If he does take such a step, as has been proven recently, he will probably find himself on the road having been dismissed by his employer.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's contention that it is unconstitutional it seems to me that it is difficult for him to prove that point.  It may very well be true that a new piece of legislation, if introduced in the House with retrospective penal clauses of a kind which are embraced in this Bill, would indeed be unconstitutional, and rightly so.  But in this case we are dealing with a piece of legislation which is replacing another piece.  This section as it stands is an escape hatch for the employers of this country who have not abided by the law of this country for the past year and a half.  It enables them to get away with the robbery of the agricultural workers' right to a half-holiday since the Act of 1950 was signed by the President.  No matter what may be said by the Minister or by his colleagues in their effort to mislead the people in regard to previous and present legislation, in regard to this amendment and to this section, the fact of the matter is that a Select Committee of this House, upon which the Minister sat, upon which Deputy Cogan sat and upon which there sat the majority of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, had a considerable hand in the framing of the previous Bill.  If there was sabotage of any kind it is not hard to discern from what quarter it came, because there was at all times prejudice on the part of the present Government Party against enacting such legislation.</P>
      <P>Let us be frank about it, the reason why this amendment is being opposed by the Minister is quite obvious.  The reason is that the agricultural workers are in a minority in this country.  They represent only one-quarter of the agricultural population and those who own land, whether they be farmers or the families of farmers, are in the majority. Therefore, they have a greater voting strength, and play is being made by the Government for votes, not on considerations of justice, but simply on considerations of political expediency That is the brutal, frank truth of the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> It is a sad commentary on our democracy to say that our standards of justice are to be guided by weight of numbers rather than by the fair considerations that should persuade us in one direction or another.  However, I do not propose to delay the House unduly on this amendment.  If it is contended that the amendment as it stands is unconstitutional, the Minister at least could make the present Bill operative from the moment of its final enactment.  I propose to withdraw this amendment and introduce on the Report Stage an amendment to the effect that the Bill shall become operative on the date of its signature by the President.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple matter although it has been the subject of comment again in uninformed quarters.  Deputy Davin, in the course of his speech on the Second Reading, referred to the need for an amendment of this kind. Peculiar though it may seem to some political pundits, as the law stands and as this section stands, Sunday can be regarded as a week-day.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the agricultural worker who is employed seven days per week will not be simply given a half-day on Sunday as his half-day under the Act.</P>
      <P>It is also intended to ensure that agricultural employers will not find it possible to evade the Act.  It is simply an amendment to define exactly what is meant by a week-day.  A week-day should mean any of the days from Monday to Saturday, inclusive.  The Minister should realise the necessity for this amendment and should accept it.  It is a very simple matter.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading I gave good reasons for the insertion of this amendment in the Bill.  No matter how much we may agree to differ on other matters, I am sure the Minister will agree that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, should be understood, without the necessity for legal interpretation, by farmers and agricultural labourers and that as few loopholes as possible should be left in a measure of this kind that might be the cause of litigation or, which would be far worse, the cause of misunderstanding between employer and worker.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would oppose fixing any day in particular.  If the employer and the employee do not agree, a more suitable day might be found.  There are many arguments as to why it should not be on Saturday.  Monday may be as suitable for both parties.  In this case, the employer, apparently, has the right of saying that the half-day shall be on such and such a day.  That has been laid down in the Bill.  But, if the employer and employee are unable to agree, it may be more suitable for the farmer to say: &ldquo;Let the half-day be Monday or Wednesday.&rdquo;  Why state in the Bill that it must be Saturday if there is not agreement?  There is no reason for it.  On Second Reading, Deputy Dunne put forward the argument that Saturday is generally accepted as the half-day all over the country.  There is no reason why it should be.  It might be far more suitable to have it on Friday.  Deputy Dunne cited the case of an agricultural worker being paid and perhaps wishing to accompany his wife to the town to get the groceries, and so forth.  That does not happen to any great extent. Deputy Dunne knows that as well as I do.  Possibly, the worker might prefer to have it on some other day.  I would not say that Saturday is the most suitable day for either the farmer or the agricultural worker.  I would not like to make it a fixed day.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows better than any of us on these benches that the principle of the Bill will be swallowed by certain farmers in the same way as they would swallow a dose of castor oil.  The Minister knows that, unfortunately, there have been many disagreements which have led to dismissals of agricultural labourers who were under the impression that they were entitled to a half-holiday and to <Col N="1842" /> other rights conferred upon them by decisions of the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Minister is as anxious as we here are to avoid misunderstandings. Misunderstandings are bound to arise with the type of farmer who does not believe in giving agricultural labourers any rights except those that he, in his wisdom, decides to confer upon them.  Such farmers are in a very small minority, certainly in my constituency and in the constituency represented by the Minister.  This amendment is put forward, not for any political vote-catching purpose, but for the purpose of avoiding trouble arising out of disagreements.</P>
      <P>Apart from dismissals that might take place as a result of misunderstandings and disagreements, does the Minister want to provide lawyers with grounds for going into court at the expense of agricultural labourers or farmers? I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  If he does, he may be certain that the overwhelming majority of decent, working farmers will accept the Bill.  The insertion of the amendment will save considerable trouble and annoyance to the Agricultural Wages Board and to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The intention of this section of the Bill is to make the half-holiday as acceptable as possible by making it as flexible as possible.  There are two types of farmers.  There is the very small farmer who employs only one man.  The majority of farmers are in that class.  If he has to give a half-holiday to his employee on Saturday, it means that for one and a half days the farmer has to do two men's work on a farm where there are cows to be milked, cattle to be fed or live stock to be catered for during the wintertime. It is possible for such a farmer to give a half-day mid-week.  In that case, he would have to do two men's work on that particular half-day.  He would not have a day and a half, in which he would be without assistance, coming all together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Just for the sake of clarity and in order that we may not be wasting our time, may I point out that the section reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The week-day on which the half-holiday is allowed under this Act shall be fixed by agreement between the employer and the worker in respect of each period of three months, or in respect of the period of employment (where that period is less than three months), but in the absence of such agreement, the employer may himself fix in respect of a period of three months, or in <Col N="1844" /> respect of the period of employment (where that period is less than three months), the week-day on which the half-holiday is to be taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to secure that, if there is no agreement between the employer and the worker and if the employer does not fix the day as provided by this section, Saturday shall be the day.  Otherwise there is no day at all, no half-holiday at all will be specified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care if you vary it to suit the different areas in the country, where Wednesday or Monday may be the suitable day.  I can assure the Minister that so far as the best part of Leinster is concerned and a good part of Munster, Saturday would be the most suitable half-day for the workers.  There are certain areas&mdash; possibly Waterford and South Kilkenny &mdash;where Wednesday or Thursday would suit.  In Wexford, Thursday may be most suitable, as that day is the half-day normally for various business purposes.  Saturday has come to be accepted generally, however, though not 100 per cent, as the most suitable half-day and that is why we specify Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that what Deputy Dunne has introduced now is anything in the nature of a point of order.  It may be a point of explanation of this amendment.  Before he intervened, I was dealing with the idea of fixing Saturday, even in the absence of agreement.  It is not always easy to secure agreement on a matter of this kind.  I think it is wrong to fix rigidly in the Bill a definite day.  The section is broad enough and wide enough at present.  It provides that there shall be agreement, if possible, and in the absence of agreement that the employer shall fix the day.  That is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two types of farmer&mdash;the large farmer and the small farmer.  The smaller man would be in difficulty if there were a complete closing down of work, as it would throw the entire <Col N="1845" /> burden on him for a day and a half. For him it would be better to have the half-day standing out on its own somewhere in the middle of the week.  The bigger farmer is quite a different proposition, as he has to stagger the half-day over the week, so as to provide that all the workers will not take it on the same day.  That is more difficult, as it is not easy to get agreement not only between the employer and the worker but amongst the workers themselves, as to what particular day should be chosen.  In that case you have to leave it to the employer, if he is to have any say in the management of his farm, to allocate the half-day as between his workers in such a manner as will cause the least inconvenience to the working of the farm.  As everyone realises, the farm work must go on. The employer must be given discretion to see that, for instance, if he has four men they will not walk off on the same day but a special day will be given to each.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to debate this for hours, I do not think we could improve on the section.  Even Deputy Sweetman, who claims to have a very clear brain on this matter, could not claim to make any improvement which would make this a more workable section. Certainly fixing rigidly Saturday as the half-day would not do it.  If anything is to be fixed rigidly, the first half holiday of the week would probably be more acceptable to the single agricultural worker.  We all know that dancing has become very popular and young agricultural workers find it very hard to start on Monday morning.  If we are to meet the convenience of all parties, I think the first half holiday of the week rather than the last would be the more acceptable.</P>

The section provides that the farmer and his worker&mdash;<Col N="1846" /> taking his worker individually, not all the workers on the farm&mdash;may by agreement decide what will be the half-day. If they fail to agree, then the employer has the option to fix the day. I think the Minister will agree with me that that is the interpretation of the section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to make up his mind which case he is going to make.  If he says it does not improve it he is entitled to his view, but let him not say it is altering it when it is not.  The amendment says that if the employer and the worker do not agree and if the employer does not take the trouble to fix the day, then the day shall be Saturday.  That is all.  It is quite simple.  The employer at all times has the complete right, even if the amendment is passed, to fix the day and it is only where he does not take the trouble that the amendment becomes operative.</P>

      <P>In my contribution on the Second Reading, I said the Bill made an honest endeavour to introduce harmony between employer and employee, that there should be agreement if possible.  If we were to interpret it with a mind like Deputy Cogan's there is no doubt but that time would be wasted for years before anything like a solution could be arrived at.  It reminds me of Oscar Wilde trying to kill the things he loved, killing them against his will. Deputy Cogan is now trying to put something on record to justify his solicitude for the agricultural worker. He never will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to inform the Minister that the practice in isolated cases in my area is to give the half-day on Saturday.  That is for the Minister's own information and he can check up <Col N="1847" /> on it any time he likes.  He has statistical agents down the country who will be able to confirm that information. Saturday is the half-day for the agricultural creamery farmer.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to fix a half-day for workers in towns and cities because when one shop closes every business closes.  You cannot have one shop open and another shop closed.  It is different in regard to farming.  I can appreciate that what might be suitable for one farmer might not be suitable for another, but as Deputy Davin said, we should try to counteract the mentality of the farmers who do not recognise the institutions of this State at all, and who for years past were very sorry that they had to carry on under the institutions and legislation of the State.  We have such farmers in the country and we have such farmers in my area.  I am sure you have many such farmers in Carlow and Wicklow. You have them in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this much in Deputy Cogan's favour.  He is subject to a lot of interruptions himself when <Col N="1848" /> he speaks.  Let us assume that there are four men working for a farmer. Again, there must be agreement, first of all, among the men who are working. I certainly would strongly advocate that the whole four would not take the one half-day.  I do not believe they would.  I believe the agricultural worker is more alive to his responsibilities than most Deputies who are supposed to be advocating his case in this House.  Those half-holidays could be staggered after agreement between the employer and employee.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, the power should be given to the Minister when there is no agreement.  The Minister is shirking that power in my opinion in the section.  He is switching the responsibility to the farmer that when there is no agreement the farmer will be the arbitrator and have the last word.  I think that is a new departure in this House for Deputy Thomas Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture. Everybody gave him credit up to this for having great courage. I hope we will not be disillusioned all of a sudden and find out that he is funking an issue where he should undoubtedly have the last word.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Cogan's idea is with regard to some of the statements he made regarding flexibility. Flexibility might be stretched too far.  You would have, as a result, strife, disorder and discontent.  What I want to say is what I said on the Second Reading.  Let us have the same spirit existing between the farmer and his employees as always existed.  When this Act is put into force, the farmer will realise that the hardships referred to by Deputy Cogan are purely and simply mythical. I hope that the Act will not interfere with the good relationship that has existed and will continue to exist between the farmer and his worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farm work is in a class of its own. At times the supervision is practically nil.  Reliance is the operative word as far as the farm worker is concerned. I hope that reliance will continue and that if the farmer wants to go to town to fulfil some requirements he can be assured, when this Bill is in operation, that the men who work for him will <Col N="1849" /> continue to do the work just as if the farmer was watching them in the fields.  Flexibility can be abused.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by asking the Minister to do the big thing in this regard.  He is doing his best as it is, but why should one section be given the authority to define what should be the right of the two?  There must be a third party when it comes to a question of that nature.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to define, failing agreement between the employer and worker, Saturday as the half-holiday.</P>

All that is asked in this amendment is to provide the half-holiday on a Saturday if the farmer and his employee fail to agree to fix a day in the week.  This amendment does not state that we should rigidly stand for a particular day but if a group of farmers come together and fail to agree to give a half-day to the agricultural worker we say it should be Saturday.

      <P>There is no ambiguity in the section at all.  It says that if there is not agreement between the worker and the farmer, the farmer fixes the day.  In the event of the farmer not fixing the day, it is suggested that we name Saturday.  It is very dangerous, in my opinion, to name a day because it gives the impression that it has been fixed by law that Saturday is to be the day and there is nothing one can say outside that will correct that impression. That is what I am afraid of&mdash;that some people may say that Saturday is the recognised half-holiday in this country.  We do not want that, particularly where there may be two, three or four men employed.  It would mean that all the men would disappear instead of the holiday being staggered, when it would be possible for one man to go on Wednesday, another on Thursday and a third on Saturday, so that the operations on the farm will not be disrupted.  That is why I do not want to name any particular day.  As I have already mentioned, why not Monday or Wednesday?  Why Saturday?  Is it not obligatory on the farmer to give a half-holiday? If he does not, he has to pay the penalty.  Why, then, name the particular day on which it should be given?</P>

The majority of the people, although we are only a young State, have accepted the legislation passed by the House on almost every matter without any organised agitation against it, but there is always a minority of cranks in this and every other country who will not agree, who will disagree for the purpose of creating trouble, and this amendment is brought in for the purpose of dealing with the 5 per cent. minority who will not accept legislation of this kind, whether in the interests of agricultural or industrial workers.  Legislation of this nature is in operation for industrial workers.</P>

      <P>If he fails to secure agreement, but if, in the absence of agreement, he fails to exercise the right conferred on him to fix the day in advance, the amendment comes into operation.  The Minister has pointed out that there is no necessity for this <Col N="1852" /> amendment and that it might possibly do harm.  The position now is that if the farmer and worker fail to agree on what is to be the half-holiday for a period of three months, the farmer can fix the day.  Only if he fails to do that can this amendment take effect, but under the section as it stands without the amendment, if the farmer fails to perform that function of fixing the day, he will be liable to prosecution. That is the position, and I think it better to leave it as it is.</P>
      <P>I do not think any farmer will fail to fix the day.  No farmer will prefer prosecution to fixing a day and it is a more business-like arrangement.  He will meet his worker at the beginning of the period and say: &ldquo;We have to arrange what is to be the weekly half-holiday for the next three months, or whether there is to be a weekly half-holiday or whether you will accept payment in lieu.&rdquo;  If they fail to reach agreement after discussion, the farmer will fix the half-holiday for each week of the coming three months.  That is a perfectly business-like arrangement and one which every farmer will try to implement.  There is no necessity for introducing this idea of a Saturday, which might be completely wrong and, I think, would be completely wrong from an agricultural point of view.</P>
      <P>I want strongly to repudiate the suggestion that I in any way speak for or represent the large farmers only. I am a small farmer myself, a very small farmer and the majority of my supporters, of the people who vote for me and work for me in elections, are small farmers, small working farmers on the Wicklow mountains.  These are the people I rely on.  The larger ones are a very small minority, and while I understand their position and appreciate those of them who are good employers and carry on, as many of them do, intensive farming on their larger farms, I am much more familiar with the needs and interests of the smaller farmers.</P>

      <P>I feel that we should not spend too much time in discussing this amendment and I believe that were it not for the contribution of one or two Deputies, including Deputy <Col N="1853" /> Cogan, the Minister and ourselves might have come to an understanding of what is behind the amendment.  I do not wish to see any loopholes left in this Bill.  We know the problems with which inspectors in the Agricultural Wages Board have been faced in another respect for many years.  I think it is only right that we should make sure when legislating here that loopholes will not be left under which more work might be placed on the shoulders of these inspectors in order to ensure compliance with regulations. I give Deputy Cogan credit for sufficient intelligence to know that he is dealing with this for the purpose of suiting a different object rather than the object expressed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>We want a certain day to be fixed. We want co-operation between the farmer and the worker, first of all, and if that co-operation is not forthcoming within a period of three months we hold that the farmer should then be entitled to select one particular day of the week and give his workers a half-day on that day.  That shows quite clearly that we are not demanding a specific day upon which every agricultural worker will get a half-day.  This amendment is to meet the case where agreement cannot be reached and the case where the employer sits back and does not give a half-day.  We want to provide protection for the worker.  We want to save the inspectors of the Agricultural Wages Board investigating numerous complaints where workers have not got a half-day.  If this amendment is accepted it will be an incentive to the farmer either by agreement with his worker or on his own initiative to give the worker a half-day every week. If that is agreed upon we need waste no more time, for it is a waste of time to have to sit here listening to arguments like those advanced by Deputy Cogan for the purpose of damning not only the amendment but the Bill itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my views on this.  The less interference there is between the agricultural worker and his employer the better it will be from the point of view of implementing the Bill.  I do not think <Col N="1854" /> this amendment will help to make the Bill workable.  Provision is made for agreement.  In the event of agreement not being reached the employer has the right to fix a day.  If he does not fix a day the machinery of the law can be invoked and a penalty is provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the employer does not give a half-day the penalty is there. As the section stands the employee is safeguarded.  If this amendment is accepted and Saturday is fixed as the half-day it might easily be thought that Saturday was arbitrarily fixed for the entire country.  That would cause a good deal of discontent and disruption. An employer with two or three men might find himself in the position of having all his men wanting a half-day on Saturday even though he himself might be quite agreeable to giving each of them a half-day on different days of the week.  I think it is better not to fix a specific day.  The intention is to give a half-day and it should be left at that.</P>

      <P>It is conceivable that the implementation of this Bill will bring about a certain amount of discontent. <Col N="1855" /> Every piece of legislation which regulates the relationships between employers and employees does invariably cause some discontent even for a short period.  If the legislation is progressive both sides chafe at the restrictions and qualifications imposed upon them.</P>
      <P>We are suggesting something very simple here.  It is obvious that there will be cases where the farmer will not be willing to implement the Act.  It is equally obvious that there will be cases where farmers will be ignorant of the existence of the Act.  We have all had experience of that in our own constituencies where one finds on occasion an alarming ignorance as to what has been legislated upon and what the law is in relation to various matters.</P>
      <P>Where agreement cannot be reached and where the farmer fixes no day for the purpose of defeating the Act a day should be fixed by law.  If that is not done a considerable period may elapse during which no half-day will be granted.  The longer that period lasts the longer the worker will be without the benefit of his half-day, the more difficult it will be to secure retrospective payment, the more costly it will be on the State and the more reluctant the worker will be to take any steps because of the relatively large sum that might be involved in a period of perhaps two years' retrospection. It is these considerations that have prompted us to put down this amendment.  I think it is necessary.  I do not believe it is contentious.</P>
      <P>The farmer will have full liberty to suit his own convenience.  Where the farmer refuses to suit even his own convenience we want to compel him to give a half-day on Saturday.  In that way we are protecting the worker from having to do without his legal rights over an extended period.  If the Minister will consider the amendment favourably between this and the Report Stage, we will not press it to a division now.  I assure him that if the amendment is not accepted we will press it to a division on the Report Stage.  I think it should be accepted.</P>

      <P>In line 8 to delete &ldquo;forty-five&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;forty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are not going so far in this amendment as to suggest that the conditions which apply in industrial and commercial life should apply in this case.  According to Section 6, an agricultural worker will be entitled to his half-day if&mdash;but only if&mdash;he works 45 hours preceding that half-day.  That represents nine hours per day for the preceding five days.  Our difficulty is that it could easily happen that, within the five-day period before the half-day, a farm worker might, of necessity, have to attend a funeral or take a half-day at his own expense for some important reason or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not suggesting that, within the five days, a worker should get a half-day at his employer's expense, but anybody can envisage the possibility of a worker having to take a half-day off at his own expense.  In commercial life and in industry in Cork City, for instance, the half-day is Wednesday.  If a worker is out ill on the Monday or Tuesday he still gets his half-day on the Wednesday.  I feel that we should consider the worker to the degree of obtaining some flexibility in regard to the half-day in the week in respect of illness, attendance at a funeral or attending to business of his own at his own expense.  That is the whole purpose behind the amendment which seeks to reduce the number of hours from 45 to 40.  I believe that the matter could easily be arranged between the employer and the employee. Over a 12-months period, I am sure that such a thing would seldom <Col N="1857" /> occur.  It could easily happen that, by law&mdash;not just by the wishes of his employer&mdash;the worker would be denied the right of the half-day within that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and other members of the House who have belonged to county councils over a number of years will recall that for a considerable period there was an impression amongst local authorities who employed workers that if they did not make a provision similar to the provision in this Bill in respect of the Saturday half-holiday&mdash;if they did not provide that no worker will be entitled to a half-holiday unless he has worked on the five previous days&mdash;a great number of abuses would arise. That impression has been dispelled by experience over the years.  Generally throughout the country local authorities now provide the half-day without regard to such a long qualifying period as that visualised, namely, five days. That should help us to come to an acceptance of the fact that agricultural labourers are not a class of workers who take advantage of legislation which this House enacts for them at any time to cause any hardship to their employers.  Quite the contrary is, in fact, the case.  Agricultural workers are the most faithful set of employees in this country and nobody will deny it.  In particular, farmers will not deny it.  You will get an odd farmer who may say it, but the bulk of the farmers will agree that the agricultural worker is most obliging in his general attitude to his employer and that that situation arises from the close relationship which has traditionally existed between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this section can only be construed as anticipating an abuse of the right to a half-holiday. In other words, it is provided in the section that we must insist that a worker shall work five full days in the week before he becomes entitled to a half-holiday.  That is unreal and I do not think it can work in that way.  I think that in the vast majority of cases the workers will have the five days worked before they avail of the half-day. Take, for instance, occasions <Col N="1858" /> such as funerals, social functions and various domestic matters which might require the agricultural worker to stay at home say on a Monday morning until lunch-time or perhaps to go home on Monday afternoon or on Tuesday afternoon.  Is it right that, in such instances, we should legislate that the worker must thereby be deprived of his half-day?  Our purpose is to reduce the period from five to four and a half days.</P>

The Minister need not talk, coming as he does from the soft lands of South Kilkenny, about farm labourers.  I have met more farm labourers in an hour than he ever saw in his lifetime.  I have discussed their problems with them and fought for them, when it was not popular to do so, and when I was slandered for fighting for them, and I shall continue to do so.  We shall press this amendment and press every further amendment. We shall answer the Minister's slanders in the only way which he apparently understands.  He talks about insincerity.  Where is there more insincerity than in his own heart and soul, and in the heart of his own Party?  We saw the performance of Deputy Burke this morning when he came in here and did not even know what the Bill was about.  He simply got up to indulge in slavish praise of his own Minister.  That is all he was doing, but he does not talk like that when he is speaking at the chapel gates in North County Dublin.  You did not talk like that when you were talking down in South Kilkenny.  You have a different approach when you are trying to delude the agricultural workers into voting for you.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question.  If a farm labourer is out ill for two days on a particular week, why should he not be allowed to enjoy his half-holiday in that week?  Is that not what is behind the amendment?  If a poor agricultural worker is out ill for two days or a day and a half, he is not paid for it and he will not get national health benefit until he is three days ill.  Supposing he is out for a day and a half and has not worked 45 hours in that week, he will still not get the half-day in that week.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk to the effect that we do not understand the agricultural community.  I claim to have some knowledge of the agricultural community. I have some knowledge of decent farmers who treat their workers in a manner in which everybody should treat them, but I know, too, there are quite a number of farmers who treat them merely as hands.  I am surprised that the Minister should lose his temper by saying that this is all hypocrisy and that we do not understand agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should approach this amendment in a reasonable fashion.  Take the case of a man who is out from work on a Tuesday and Wednesday of any week because of illness or again he may have to absent himself from work because some member of his family has died and he wishes to attend the funeral. The Minister said that he will be allowed to go to the funeral but there is another question to be considered. Is he paid for that day off?  I should like to know how many farmers pay <Col N="1862" /> their workers for the days they are sick or for days on which they have to attend funerals.  If they do not pay them, they should not be deprived of the half-holiday in that week.  I should like the Minister to consider this matter calmly rather than indulge in these outbursts of indignation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for any heat nor is there any need to be unreasonable in regard to this measure.  Surely it will be admitted that there must be some specific number of hours fixed as the hours to be worked, if the half-holiday is to be granted.  In this amendment introduced by the Labour Party there is provision for a 40-hour week instead of the 45 hours which it is proposed to fix by the Bill.  If a man is out for two days, he would not be entitled to a half-holiday even under the Labour amendment so that it is no use in putting up that type of case.  I think that the provisions of the Bill mark a very substantial step forward so far as the rights of the workers are concerned and a very substantial concession on the part of the employers.  I think in view of the concession that has been granted, the Bill should be accepted in a fair and reasonable spirit.  I do not think the Labour Party will secure any support from any section of the House for their violent attacks on the farming community.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing Section 7, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, as respects any particular week, the day on which the half-holiday is to be allowed under this Act to an agricultural worker falls on a holiday allowed to him under the Act of 1950, on a Church holiday or public holiday allowed to him by arrangement with his employer or on a day on which the worker is otherwise absent from work, he shall not <Col N="1865" /> be entitled to a half-holiday in that week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We felt that this section can be used by individuals to evade the effect of the entire Bill.  The second half of this section alludes to the possibility of a Church holiday or public holiday being allowed to an agricultural worker by arrangement with his employer.  There is no reference whatsoever there to the question of whether or not the worker is paid for such Church or public holiday. There are certain districts in this country, notably the diocese of Ferns, for instance, where Church holidays are also regarded as being in the nature of public holidays and where work ceases on the land on such days.  There are probably other examples of that.  It will be found in individual cases at least that for such days as workers are required to take a holiday&mdash;and they do so I may say of their own free will because of their respect for the tradition and customs of the districts in which they reside&mdash;they receive no payment. This section provides that in such cases the workers shall be deprived of the right to the half-holiday.</P>
    <P>In many districts farmers themselves avail of public holidays to go about their own recreations and require that workers should also take a holiday on public holidays and instances will be found where workers are not paid for such public or Church holidays.</P>
    <P>This section lays down that in a week where such a holiday occurs, a half-holiday will not be made available to the workers.  We think that that is bad. It also specifies that if in any week a holiday falls due to a worker under the Act of 1950, the worker will not be entitled to a half-holiday in that week. I take it that that refers to the Holidays Act of 1950 and that it is a necessary legislative arrangement.  I should like some clarification of it, but I take it that, in so far as it does not refer to the staggering of annual holidays, it is simply a necessary legislative reference. What I am principally concerned about is the possibility that workers who are required to take a Church or public holiday, and who are not paid for such a holiday, will be deprived of their right to a half-holiday with pay. <Col N="1866" /> It is on that ground that I oppose this section.  I do not see any advantage in the section.  It restricts still further the operation of the Bill and makes it still more difficult for agricultural workers to enjoy a half-holiday, and it is on these general premises that we object to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the merits or demerits of holidays with pay.  I am not concerned with whether a man is paid or not.  What I am concerned with is that when the half-holiday that has been arranged falls on a day which is a Church holiday or a public holiday or a holiday that is due to the worker, no half-holiday will be available.  That is all that is in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If such is the case, will the Minister explain to the House the meaning of the end of the section where it says: &ldquo;or on a day on which the worker is otherwise absent from work, he shall not be entitled to a half-holiday in that week&rdquo;?  Allowing for the fact that we are not supposed to know the circumstances and the conditions prevailing in rural Ireland, may I inform the Minister that there are areas where large landowners do not pay their workers for a Church holiday and give them no recompense, and if a worker is out sick on a day during the week there is no allowance for him from the employer and no national health benefit?  There is quite a number of landowners of that type in this country and they have been coming into this country recently in large numbers.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to say that the farm worker is to be denied a half-day in these circumstances?  There are localities in this country where even if a man is not paid for a Church holiday he still does not work.  That means that in such localities, where there is a complete cessation of work on a Church holiday, because the employers find it convenient to make no allowance for the workers the workers have to suffer the loss of a half-day in that particular week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>All the section sets out is that where a day has been designated <Col N="1867" /> as one on which the half-holiday must be taken, suppose a Church holiday or a public holiday falls on Saturday, in that case the half-holiday would not be granted because that was the day on which the half-holiday was to be taken.  That is all this section deals with.  It has no regard whatever to whether the man is paid or is not paid. That does not enter into it.  The only thing that does enter into it is that if the day designated for the half-holiday is a Church or a public holiday there will be no half-holiday in that week.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister not to dodge the issue.  That is all right when he is talking down the corridor but it does not cut any ice here.  He will not put it over on us that way.  The Bill provides for a half-holiday with pay.  The Minister says that if the day designated for the half-holiday falls on a Church or public holiday he is not concerned whether the worker is paid or not.  I believe that the Minister is not concerned.  I accept it entirely.  He does not give <Col N="1868" /> two hoots if the worker is never paid so long as he gets the vote on the ballot paper in the election.  That is his only concern, but we are concerned with making something of this instrument which he has brought in.  As it stands it means that the worker may not be paid for his half-holiday if that half-holiday coincides with a public or Church holiday.  In the event, and not alone in the event, but as facts have proved, there are instances where workers must take public or bank holidays for one reason or another and are not paid for them.  The force of the section is that if the half-holiday coincides with such a public or bank holiday, the worker will not be paid. The Minister must concern himself whether he likes it or not with whether the worker is paid because that is what this document is supposed to do. There is no point whatever in bringing in a Bill to provide a half-holiday if it does not mean a half-holiday with pay. There have been too many half-days, days, weeks, months and years for the workers of this country particularly during the reign of the gentlemen who occupy the opposite side of the House.</P>

      <P>I know that when workers in my area get Church holidays they are always paid for them but in view of the statements which have been made I suggest that the Minister should put down an amendment to ensure a half-day's pay where such a thing occurs.  The whole object of the Bill is to see that the men get the benefit of the half-holiday.  If, as alleged, there are instances where they do not get paid for Church holidays, why not bring in an amendment that will ensure a half-day's pay for that particular day?  I think that is <Col N="1869" /> only fair and in keeping with the meaning of the Bill as I see it.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the county council workers.  They are industrial workers within the meaning of the Act and if they work the half-day they receive extra payment. County council workers work 48 hours a week and they are paid overtime for Saturday and their cards are stamped. That puts them in a position as industrial <Col N="1872" /> workers and you are mixing them up with the agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You told the House before the summer recess that you would introduce a Bill to make the previous Act workable, whereby the agricultural worker, if he worked the half-day, would be paid for it.  You are getting away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see this matter cleared up in justice to those concerned.  If a man works 45 hours in any week he is entitled to a half-holiday, or if he wants to work the half-day he is entitled to be paid for it.  I am glad that a happier position exists now than existed under the previous Bill where the worker had to work 50 hours a week.  I would like to give credit to the Minister for improving the position in that respect.  Apparently Deputy Dunne and Deputy Desmond seem to find a different class of farmers from what we have been accustomed to in my part of the country, because there has always been what you might call a give-and-take policy.  I have never seen a man's pay stopped for a Holiday of Obligation.  I have always seen him getting his week's pay as when he worked for the full week.  He is entitled to his half-day's pay even though he is absent for the full day, and I think that that principle should be included in the Bill.  I am relying on the Minister to safeguard the workers in this connection. They are the worst paid section of our community.  All Governments here from time to time seem to think that an employee is a man who should produce something for half nothing.  I would urge on the Minister to rectify this situation.</P>
      <P>There is another case where a man is out sick for a day.  If he works the 45 hours of the week he is entitled under this Act to a half-day's pay.  I believe that the two principles to which I have referred should be safeguarded in the Bill so that fair play will be given to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has <Col N="1873" /> indicated that he will look into this matter before the Report Stage.  As I understand it, a man who works 45 hours in the five days prior to the half-holiday agreed upon is entitled to the half-holiday.  A problem arises in the case of an agreed half-holiday which falls on a day upon which the man is not working and is not paid.  It would seem that he would be at least entitled to be paid for the half-day, that is to his half-holiday.  In any case, that is the spirit of the Act.</P>
      <P>The only difficulty that I see is that a man should work 45 hours on the five days prior to the agreed half-holiday. Even though he may not work for the first half of the day upon which the half-holiday falls, he would seem to be entitled to the half-holiday, and in a matter of this kind we ought to interpret the principle of the Bill as fairly as we can.  I do not see any objection to the proposition that Deputy Corry has put up.  Farmers in general try to be as fair and as reasonable as they can to the workers.  This is a contingency which must have been overlooked inasmuch as the half-holiday might happen to fall on a day on which the worker is not working and for which he is not paid.  I feel he is entitled to the half-holiday and that we should not keep it from him.</P>

This House has nothing to do with it.  It is not concerned with any wage.  The question has been raised whether in the case of a Church holiday or bank holiday falling on the half-holiday that was granted and that was already arranged between the employer and the employee there should be a half-holiday allowed in that week or not.  The section says that he shall not be entitled to a half-holiday in that week. That is all that is in the section.  There is an amendment to that that it would be granted.  I must oppose that.  As I have already pointed out, this has no bearing whatever on payment for any day.  That is a matter for the wages <Col N="1876" /> board.

The Minister attributes his change of heart&mdash;I do not know if he has changed back again&mdash;to Deputy Corry's influence&mdash;a usual Fianna Fáil manoeuvre, for the records.  We all know very well that the reason why he is back sliding now is that he has been forced into that position by the speeches that have been made here. Deputy Corry has joined in that effort to try to get him to come back to a sensible realisation of his duty.  Will the Minister reconsider the matter? Even the apostle of progress, Deputy Cogan, has helped in the effort to get the Minister to change his mind.  Will the Minister reconsider his decision before Report Stage?

If the Minister is prepared to bring it back to his officials, I am sure the officials, at least, will be able to grasp what apparently he is not able to grasp and will probably bring in what we desire to have brought in. Deputy Corry can see it quite clearly. Deputy Cogan can see it quite clearly, or professes to do so.  He cut across the Minister.  He must have spoken before the Minister.  The Minister does not appear to see it.  Deputy Hughes expressed the same view, that this is necessary.  If we get the assurance we will not press it to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, the contingency suggested by Deputy Dunne can arise only on a very few occasions in the year when the agreed half-holiday will fall upon a public holiday for which the worker is not receiving remuneration.  I thought it was the general intention of the Bill that the worker who works 45 hours in the five days prior to the day fixed for the half-holiday must get the half-holiday and the only question that arises is whether he should get it on the day on which he does not work for the first half of the day.  I feel that he should get it on that day.  Say the half-holiday agreed on is Wednesday in each week.  Suppose a man is sick and the arrangement with the employer is that he is not paid when he is sick&mdash; his half-day falls on Wednesday and having worked 45 hours in the previous days he should be entitled to that half-day, even though he would not have worked on the first half of that day.  If the Minister is satisfied that under the Bill as it stands he will get the half-day on that particular day, even though he may not have worked on the first part of it&mdash;or, as a matter of fact, on any part of the day&mdash;then <Col N="1880" /> there is nothing for amendment. Perhaps the Minister would look into the matter and if he has any doubt in his mind about it, it might be the subject of amendment on the Report Stage.  It is only a small matter, but it is important for the farmer and the worker.  There is not much money involved, and there is only a limited number of days on which it may happen in the year.  The farmer does not want to have any dispute with the worker as to the farmer's or the worker's rights.  It should be fairly clear and definite.  Where the law is not clearly defined it leads to disputes. Even where the farmer and the worker may be on the best of terms generally, it may happen that they would be in bad humour on a particular day and have a quarrel over a thing like this. This aspect of the Bill should be cleared up completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the section meant to convey was that on a Church or a public holiday, where the worker by arrangement with his employer was absent from work&mdash;got a holiday in other words, and was paid for that particular day in that particular week &mdash;he could not claim to be paid for another half-day.  That is what the section means to convey, but whether it conveys it clearly or not I do not know.  It will be generally agreed by all sections of the House that if a Church holiday or a public holiday occurs on which the worker is paid for his absence from work he would not have a right to claim another half-day in that particular week.  Everyone will be agreed on that.  That is the object of the section, as I read it.  I do not understand why the 1950 Act was mentioned&mdash;it deals with the week's holidays with pay, which is a different thing altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It means both those things and it means other things as well.  First of all, if his annual holiday falls in that week, he is not entitled to the half-day; if a Church or bank holiday for which he is paid occurs in that week, he is not entitled to the half-day; and if a Church or bank holiday for which he is not paid falls in that week, he is not paid for the half-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the employer and himself agree on a particular half-day and he cannot resume work because of illness, he is entitled to get a half-day's wages for that day.  What is understood by a half-holiday or a weeks' holiday means that he is to be paid for it.  The Minister says the Bill does not indicate that he is to be paid. Surely that is meaningless.  Deputies Corry and Allen have the same view as we have.  There are not many Church holidays in the year so this point of sickness would not occur often in that way; but he could be sick a good many week-days in the year and if there is an agreement on, say, Thursday as half-day and he cannot resume because of illness he is entitled to get that half-day's wages and we want the Minister to see that he is entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a lot of confusion about this section.  It has <Col N="1882" /> been confused with wages and payments&mdash;which have nothing whatever to do with the section.  This is a question of the day on which the half-holiday is given, if there is a Church holiday in the week that is being allowed to the worker&mdash;I take it that &ldquo;being allowed&rdquo; would mean that he would be paid for it.  The same applies in the case of a public holiday.  In the case of holidays to which he is entitled under the 1950 Act he is not entitled to the half-day in that week he is away.  Is it suggested by Deputy Dunne and others that if there is a Church holiday in that week, on Thursday, and that the ordinary day for the half-holiday is on Friday, he is going to get another day on the Friday, that he is entitled to take his half-day as well.  Instead of taking a half-day in that week he gets a day in the week; that is what is meant in the section and it can be readily agreed to.  Otherwise, if there are three men working and a Church holiday comes along and they have different designated half-days, you might possibly find nothing done on the farm at all in that particular week.  All I am asking in this section is that it be agreed that where there is a Church or public holiday on the day for the half-day there be no half-day as well.</P>

      <P>In the earlier part of this discussion, the Minister indicated that he was beginning to grasp what was wrong with the section and when Deputy Corry rose he agreed as a gesture to Deputy Corry and fearful that Deputy Corry might walk into the opposite Lobby against him, he said: &ldquo;I will take it back and bring something else in on the Report Stage.&rdquo; Now he has apparently managed to convince himself there is nothing wrong with the section.  Everything is wrong with it.  The Minister has tried to sidetrack the issue by saying that by preventing this section being passed we are endeavouring to ensure that the worker will get a public or Church holiday with pay and the following day, if it is Saturday or Friday, he will get his half-day as well.  I say the day will come when that will happen, when agriculture will reach the stage when that will be possible.  That time has not arrived just yet.  We never suggested that it would under this Bill or this Government.</P>
      <P>We suggest that there will be cases of individuals who will be allowed, if you like, a public holiday or a Church holiday without pay.  If the half-holiday coincides with such holiday they will be deprived of their half-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes under this section in so far as the employer can argue out of the section that the agricultural workers are not entitled to a half-day on that particular week-day. The Deputy should cling to one line of thought and try to help the Minister. Deputy Burke has arrived back in the House now and I am sure he will clear up the whole business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House very long.  We endeavoured to explain the whole matter but, perhaps, the Minister did not understand. Deputy Corry's explanation was the same as ours.  It is provided in another section of this Bill that the farmer has a right to arrange for a <Col N="1884" /> certain half-holiday in the week over a three-month period.  Take the case where that is done on the 1st January, for January, February and March and it has been arranged that the workers' half-day is to be on Wednesday.  If a worker is unable to go to work, perhaps, through illness during the whole of one particular week, according to Section 7 of this Bill he shall not be entitled to a half-holiday in that week.</P>
      <P>If, during the same week, there happens to be a Church holiday and the worker is one of those who is not paid for that Church holiday and under the custom prevailing in a locality no work is carried out on the Church holiday, that means the worker loses a full day.  If he is not able to go to work on the Wednesday morning according to this particular section he does not work the requisite number of hours and, therefore, will not be allowed the half-day that week even though it was not his fault, in so far as that on the Church holiday he was not paid any money for that day.  If he had been paid for a Church holiday we do not say for one moment that he should get the half-day on that week. Where the man works for wages in respect of the Church holiday and if he cannot, through illness or otherwise, work on the morning of the day appointed for his half-holiday. Section 7 clearly states that he is not entitled to a half-holiday that week. Deputy Corry mentioned that point and no matter how the Minister tries to get out of it he cannot change the meaning of the section.</P>

A board has already been set up, the Agricultural Wages Board, which arranges for wages to be paid to agricultural workers.  It is their duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If, by agreement between himself and his employer, Wednesday is the half-day&mdash;let us cut out the question of Church holidays altogether for the moment&mdash;and because of some domestic trouble he cannot resume work, he might be ill, I am suggesting that this man is entitled to get his £3 12s. for that week.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be an offence under this Act for an employer to dismiss a worker for having asserted his legal right to the weekly half-holiday and the employer shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a very necessary provision. Under the operation of existing Acts which govern the rates of wages payable to agricultural workers, <Col N="1889" /> it has been found on occasion that when an agricultural worker has recourse to his legal right of reference to the wages board and where that action on his part brings about a court case, that worker has subsequently been dismissed by his employer.  That practice is not widespread but it is fairly general.  We have come across quite a substantial number of cases of that type and there is no protection for the worker under the Acts to which I have referred.  One cannot do anything about it.  It just happens that way and that is all.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that unless the present Bill contains such a proviso as this the operation of the Bill may be in danger of being completely frustrated. The presence of such a section as this will have a very sobering effect, to say the least of it, upon any employer who may have the intention of dismissing a worker compelled by circumstances to take the necessary legal steps to enforce his right to a weekly half-holiday. I do not want to refer to the recent history of the previous Bill except to say that it is within the knowledge of Deputies that there have been cases of the kind I have described. There was one very glaring case where three workers representing some 15 or 16 employees took action in the courts to establish their right to a weekly half-holiday.  That action was not successful but that is not the issue to which I am referring.  The result of that action was that the employer summarily dismissed these men.  One gets that type of employer and it is where that employer exists that the worker must be safeguarded to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the general body of agricultural employers would react in that way.  Looking at the operations of the inspectors of the Agricultural Wages Board one often finds that where a worker is aggrieved and where he feels he is not getting even the minimum rate set out and where he makes representations to the board or to someone who, in his view, might represent the board such as a Deputy, or a trade union official, the employee is invariably afraid that his employer will learn that he has <Col N="1890" /> reported the matter and he usually requests the person to whom he makes representations to ask the inspector visiting the farm to give the impression that his inspection is carried out independently.  That is quite a common thing and it is a very natural reaction on the part of the worker because no employer relishes the idea of having to pay two years' arrears and the worker could quite naturally expect some retribution on the part of his employer, although such a reaction would be both unjust and unfair. Nevertheless, it does occur.</P>
    <P>Looking at our experience of the recent past, looking forward to the future, seeing the difficulties which may arise, hoping that the Bill will be implemented to its fullest extent, and taking such steps as we can to secure its implementation, we feel that the insertion of this clause will have a very beneficial effect upon any employer who endeavours to get out of the responsibility imposed upon him under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept this new section because it is impracticable. There are many reasons why it is impracticable.  We are all anxious to see this Bill enacted and implemented fairly between all Parties.  What this new section asks for could not be carried out.  A man might bring his employer into court and might have him penalised there because he did not grant his worker a half-day but that will not prevent the employer subsequently dismissing him a week or a fortnight later on some pretence or other.  There is no way in which the Agricultural Wages Board or their inspectors, who will be charged with responsibility for the implementation of this Bill, or anyone else, can say what the specific reason may be for the dismissal of the particular employee.  Any reason may be given; neglect in milking cows, neglect of a horse, neglect of many things. One can always find an excuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any similar provision in the conditions of employment of industrial workers or any legislation of that kind dealing with other workers and their employment?  The Minister may not have that information now.  I think that it would be very difficult to operate that particular clause fairly. If there is a dispute between a worker and an employer in regard to the half-holiday, the employer might dismiss the worker afterwards for another reason.  On the other hand, it might arise that an employer might dismiss a worker for some very valid reason and yet might find himself prosecuted under this particular clause although he dismissed the worker for an entirely different reason.  In a matter of this kind, I think you have to allow for a certain amount of freedom on the part of employers.</P>
      <P>What would be definitely wrong on the part of employers would be that a number of them would conspire not to employ a worker who had instituted proceedings against his employer.  I do not, however, think that there is any likelihood of that happening. There is not that tendency amongst farmers, generally, to combine. Fortunately, it has never existed and I hope it never will.  Every farmer likes to act independently&mdash;just as I like to act independently in this House.  It is a natural trait in farmers. If a worker has a dispute with his employer and is dismissed it will generally be found that the worker will get employment the following week with some other farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The more I listen to the discussion on these amendments the more I am satisfied, personally, that the Minister has not given any serious consideration to the amendments and that, in effect, he does not understand certain sections of the Bill which he is defending here in this House.  Every one of these amendments was put down in the names of Labour Deputies after careful consideration by the Party group.  I assure the House and Deputy Corry in particular&mdash;because I sympathise with some of the statements he made&mdash;that they were put down for the sincere purpose of avoiding trouble in the administration of the measure. They were put down, further, to prevent dismissals and to prevent unnecessary court cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that it is <Col N="1893" /> very desirable that we, as legislators, should ensure that every measure passed by this House, and particularly measures of this kind, should be made sufficiently clear to all those concerned &mdash;in this case the farmer, the employer, on the one hand, and the agricultural labourer on the other hand?  Will the Minister agree that it is eminently desirable that dismissals should be avoided and that unnecessary court proceedings should be avoided?  No matter what the result of a case may be, court proceedings eventually lead to dismissal for some justifiable or other reason.</P>
    <P>This is a penalty clause.  It is inserted for the purpose of acting as a deterrent against the small minority of farmers of the big farmer type who do not want to recognise legislation of this kind and who will recognise it only when they know that it will be costly for them to refuse to do so.  If the Minister makes inquiries he will find that this kind of penalty clause is in other legislation of this kind.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry says &ldquo;No&rdquo; in that infallible tone of voice.  The tone of his voice would nearly compel me to accept his assertion.  I am not doing so, however.  If he looks up the Conditions of Employment Acts and other Acts passed by other Parliaments he will see that there is always a penalty of a deterrent character to act as an inducement to the person concerned to accept the law passed by the majority of this House and by other democratic Assemblies that have passed legislation of this kind.  This amendment has been put forward for the purpose I have already indicated. I am surprised that the Minister is declining to accept it in that off-hand way.  The insertion of a penalty clause of this kind would make it much easier for the departmental officials to administer an Act of this kind.  It would save the Minister innumerable complaints and certainly it would save dismissals and court proceedings&mdash;<Col N="1894" /> proceedings that would be so costly to agricultural labourers if they had to go to court to assert their rights under this or any other section of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole position.</P>

I had to find employment for them and I may say that I did find them employment. We are not living away back in the past.  This is 1952.

      <P>Deputy Dunne knows just as well as I do that the lot of the agricultural labourer in this country to-day is not a happy one.  He knows that if that labourer goes even to dig the <Col N="1896" /> foundations of a labourer's cottage, he will get one and a half times the wages that he would get as an agricultural labourer.  He knows that it is practically impossible to get an agricultural labourer in the country to-day.  There is no occasion, therefore, for all this regulating and all these extra penalties for this, that and the other thing.  It is only wasting the time of the House bringing in an amendment of this kind. I should like to have seen something of this kind in Deputy Dunne's previous Bill.  Why was it not put there?  This is just what you would call a &ldquo;snap-in.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It should be possible even for Deputy Corry to discuss a matter like this rationally.  The proposal in the amendment is that it should be made an offence to dismiss a man, not who has asserted his rights but for having asserted his rights.  The Minister said that this would prevent a farmer dismissing a man and that it would be a hindrance to the right to dismiss.  Of course that is not so. Deputy Corry says that it is a useless amendment.  Deputy Corry asked us to consider whether he would be idiot enough in dismissing a man to tell him that he was dismissing him for asserting his rights.  What Deputy Corry might do, judging by his standard of idiocy, it is hard to understand, but judging it by the standard of idiocy of other people, there might be a good deal of confusion if we had to deliberate on these two grounds.  The position is that it is not made an offence for a person to dismiss a man who has asserted his rights.  It is made an offence to dismiss him for having asserted his rights.  Therefore, the onus of proof is on the man.  There is nothing to limit in that way the right to dismiss.  Deputy Dunne gave an example and says that he knows of cases in which people were dismissed for that very reason.  If that is so, these people should have the right to go to court.  It is futile to pass legislation which is intended to have beneficial results for certain sections of the community and then stand back <Col N="1897" /> and say: &ldquo;Where a man seeks to have these benefits applied to him, he will have to suffer any results that may follow.  We have done our duty by conferring these benefits on him.&rdquo; There should be a clear right to bring people to court should a man be victimised for having asserted his rights.  It is going to happen very rarely but should a farmer be brought to court and charged with this offence, the onus will be on the man to prove it.  The Minister says that the employer may say: &ldquo;Of course, the man was negligent about certain types of work.&rdquo;  It will be for an unprejudiced and impartial judge to hear and to determine the case as between the employer and the worker.</P>

      <P>There may not be a case brought in six months under it but the fact that it is so hard to prevent that type of dismissal&mdash;and Deputy Dunne tells us out of his experience that certain cases have happened&mdash; should not prevent us from attempting to deal with cases that may occur. Some Deputies suggest that it will be a useless amendment but it is not going to be so useless that it is not worth utilising the four or five lines in an Act required to deal with it.  It seems to me from the way that the amendment has been phrased that it will impose a very heavy onus of proof on the man who wants to bring his employer to court. The onus of proof that his employer has committed the offence will lie upon the worker, and I think he should be allowed to take his chance at that.  He will suffer if he fails inasmuch as he will be landed in heavy expenses.</P>

      <P>When I read this amendment, I said to myself that it was a great thing that the Bill had escaped such a provision, because I have no doubt that no Minister for Agriculture would ever bring in legislation containing such an empty clause as this.  I think that Deputy Dunne, having ventilated the problem, should now withdraw the amendment.  Deputy <Col N="1898" /> McGilligan has pointed out that the onus of proof is on the dismissed man but I want to ask Deputy McGilligan is it not the Wages Board which would assert the rights of the worker?  Therefore the worker would not be asserting his own rights at all.  It would be the Wages Board who would be asserting them on his behalf.  Deputy Dunne put down the section because of an unfortunate incident that happened in a certain part of the country which I and some of my colleagues know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  It is an accident of life more than anything else.  It may happen very often that there is a strike by accident because the workers get vexed about a certain matter and they walk out unjustifiably. Men may be laid off unjustifiably once in a wonder, but that is all.  If the Act is sought to be operated in the spirit of this amendment, it would be bad for the whole agricultural community.  I am saying that very seriously.  I would ask Deputy Dunne in all earnestness to withdraw the amendment because I think it is unjustifiable.  It is a slur on the agricultural community and on the farmers.  I do not believe that one farmer in 10,000 would dismiss an employee deliberately because he looked for his legal rights.  There is nothing on record to prove that, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>I am worried about any piece of new legislation which affects farmers and farm workers.  Many Deputies understand that you can do an immense amount of damage to agriculture, apart from this altogether.  Many men can lose their employment because a number of farmers go out of business or reduce their production.  They could hang on for a long time, and at the same time could reduce their production considerably.  That would be bad for the workers.  All these problems should be kept in mind when putting through a new piece of legislation that is going seriously to affect the interests of very many farmers as well as their economy and their convenience.</P>

      <P>May I ask the <Col N="1899" /> Deputy this question?  How are the bulk of farmers who, as you say, are not likely to be guilty of any malpractices, likely to be offended by pointing out to them that the bad one amongst them can be brought to court?</P>

      <P>You can have organisations looking after the interests of agricultural workers which may not take as responsible a view of things as, shall we say, Deputy Dunne, but Deputy Dunne will have his satellites down the country and they will be all the time pointing out that there is this penalty against farmers.  We all know quite well what happens.  I think that this amendment would do great damage, and I hope the Minister will oppose it for that reason.  If it were in the Bill it would not matter but the fact that it was put into the Bill would do considerable damage to agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that we are going to have the terrific repercussions which have been forecast by the three Deputies on my right hand side if the amendment is accepted.  It is intended to be a safeguard. It is not directed against the bulk of the farmers or even against a large minority of farmers.  It is directed against some unscrupulous farmer who would, and I know who could, victimise workers for asserting their rights.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry thinks that we should not bind ourselves too much in this Bill by a provision such as that suggested in the amendment.  I remember well that, when the Local Authorities (Works) Act was being debated in this House, we had sheaves of amendments from Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, Deputy Smith and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party in an effort, as they alleged, to try to make the Bill watertight.  My opinion at the time, and the opinion of the then Government, was that they were simply trying to make the Bill inoperative.  Unfortunately, there are farmers who will dismiss their men if they attempt to look for their rightful wages or, as has happened, seek to secure their legal rights in respect of annual holidays or the half-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> It is significant, and this I am sure must be known to the Minister and his officials, and especially to the officials of the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;I think Deputy Dunne gave an example of it&mdash;that, no matter how plucky workers may be down in Wexford, Carlow, Cork or Waterford, there is hardly a single agricultural labourer who will dare write to the Agricultural Wages Board and say: &ldquo;Farmer Murphy is not paying me the right wages.&rdquo;  I speak on this from experience.  I am not trying to make any clever point.  If I go into a district in my constituency and I meet two, three or four fellows, and suppose one has a complaint to make about the inadequacy of his wages, he will not ask me to report his specific complaint. Because he has no other protection, invariably his request will be: &ldquo;Would you ask the inspector of the wages board to be sent down into my district.&rdquo;  Now, these fellows have been victimised.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Allen's knowledge of the agricultural community, but I would not say that he was fully informed on what he was talking about. He spoke of the relationship between the farmer and the worker.  He may have general knowledge of that, but what we are seeking to do here is to legislate for the outlandish cases.  We have had examples of these recently where three workers, out of a bunch, had to make guinea-pigs of themselves by seeking a determination in the courts as to whether or not the half-day provision in the 1950 Act was operative or not.  In the court proceedings both sides agreed that that particular case was to be a test case, and that there would be no ill will, but immediately the court case was over three of the lads got their notice to quit.  It was significant that the three men, in whose names the court proceedings were taken, were dismissed. The Minister and everyone knows, that if an employer wants to sack a man, he can put up a million excuses for doing so.  We want to put in a safeguard against that type of thing happening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan may not have had any experience of bad relations existing between farmers and workers in the <Col N="1901" /> County Wicklow, and the same may be true of Deputy Corry and Deputy Kenneally of Waterford.  The practices that I have referred to may not be widespread.  This amendment is merely a safeguard against such practices.  I know that is a difficult thing to prove even in the courts.  As Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, and as Deputy Dunne said when moving the amendment, the onus is on the worker to prove it.</P>
    <P>I do not like to talk about any particular employer in my locality, but in the case I have referred to where three men were dismissed, it is unfortunate that two of them are making arrangements to go across to work in England, merely because they were good citizens and went into the court for the benefit of farm workers and farmers all over the country in an effort to get a determination as to whether or not the Deputy Dunne Bill was operative or not.  It was proved that it was not.  These three fellows had to take the rap and, as I say, two of them are making arrangements to go over to Great Britain.  It is to safeguard a situation of that kind arising that we are putting forward this amendment. Deputy Allen said that the acceptance of the amendment would do damage.  It would do no harm.  I do not think that the farmers would take any offence at its acceptance.  It is not an attempt to hound the farmers.  We merely want this simple provision to safeguard the worker who, in one case out of a thousand, may be victimised because he asserts his rights.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McGilligan on one point when he says that this is a useful amendment.  I think it would prove very useful for solicitors in the provinces.  It would, I imagine, bring a lot of grist to his mill and perhaps would also bring a certain amount of work to junior and senior counsel.  This amendment, if accepted, would, I think, entail a good deal of litigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would entail a good deal of litigation because that usually <Col N="1902" /> happens with much of the legislation drafted by the Labour Party.  It sets out that a farmer may be penalised for dismissing a worker for asserting his legal rights.  When it comes to the question of defining &ldquo;what is asserting a legal right,&rdquo; you are bound to have prolonged litigation in the courts. If a worker is dismissed in the ordinary course, as workers are from time to time, he will go into the office of some enterprising local solicitor who will ask him if, over a period of months or years, he has had any discussions with his employer about the half-holiday. If the worker said he has, that would be taken as asserting his right to the half-holiday and the solicitor could advise and would probably advise the worker, if he was anxious to earn a little money, to go into court.  The worker might win the case or he might lose the case, as happened under Deputy Dunne's Bill. But, whether he wins or loses, there would be litigation involved and there would be a certain amount of money for the legal profession.  Apparently, that is the only useful purpose this amendment would serve.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne seems to be worried about the legal profession as he wants to put a contentious clause into the Bill which would lead to a great amount of litigation in the District Court and perhaps in the higher courts.  All Parties would be in agreement that it would be a bad thing if the employers were to combine for concentrated action.  As I have said, however, in the ordinary course if a worker is dismissed by one farmer he will get employment the following week from another farmer.  No matter how bitter his quarrel with his employer may be, he will have no difficulty in finding employment with another employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out already, this is a nonsensical amendment.  It is unworkable and impracticable.  It could never be carried out, because if an employer wants to dismiss a worker there is no difficulty in finding a reason <Col N="1903" /> for it.  There are hundreds of ways and reasons which he can find if he wants to do it.  But, if the half-day is not granted, the employer is penalised for not giving it.  First of all, the half-day is introduced to be given on a particular day.  There is a mutual agreement if the agricultural worker and the employer agree that the employee should work.  Then, in the event of its not being granted, there is a penal clause.  The employer is penalised if he does not give it.  What more can you bring in?  Are we to introduce legislation to direct an employer what he should or should not do or that he should not get rid of an employee? That is what it means, because any excuse can be brought forward, not merely at the time that the action was taken regarding the half-day, if it were ever taken, but six months afterwards. The employee could say: &ldquo;As a result of my asserting my rights by claiming a half-day I am being dismissed&rdquo;. That will not work for harmonious relations between the worker and the employer.  I ask Deputy Dunne, if he wants to have the Bill made a practical and good Bill as far as both parties are concerned, to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Of course he has not the experience that we have had in regard to these matters.  I should like to add to what Deputy Corish said in regard to the case referred to that the district justice who was hearing the case publicly commented on the fact that the workers concerned had no redress and that he regretted it.  That is a situation which needs correction.  It has been amply proved here that this amendment could not be used in abuse of the Act.  The onus is placed on the worker to prove that he was dismissed. Unlike Deputy Corry, you will get people prepared to go to their workers, following a report to the Agricultural Wages Board that they were not getting a half-day: &ldquo;You can get out of here.  If you want a half-day go somewhere else and get it.&rdquo;  There is nothing unusual in a worker being told, if he complains to the Agricultural Wages Board that he is not getting his proper wages, to go somewhere else and be put out on the road.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the relationship between farmers and farm labourers but in many parts of the country that is wishful thinking. It is not all a bed of roses for the agricultural worker as some Deputies would like us to believe.  Many Deputies know that it is not.  We are concerned in this amendment to try to protect the agricultural worker.  It has been discussed very fully and we propose to put the matter to a division.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this Bill will be <Col N="1907" /> found in Section 3, which is designed to remove doubts in regard to the application of Part IV of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act of 1938 and to extend the scope of that Act so as to bring within it persons whom, beyond any doubt, the Oireachtas would have desired that the terms of the Act would have covered when it was first before us.  That is to say, the main purpose of the Act is to ensure that certain former Ministers of the First Dáil Éireann or their widows may be eligible to receive pensions.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that the Act of 1938 was enacted following the report dated 24th November, 1937, of a committee of inquiry into ministerial and other salaries which had been appointed in June of that year.  This committee recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that Ministers of State should be eligible to receive pensions and that service as a minister prior to the 6th December, 1922, whether under Dáil Éireann, which, as the House will recall, was the Parliament of the Republic, or under the Provisional Government, should be reckonable for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Act had been passed and cases came to be considered under it with a view to determining the issue of eligibility for pensions, doubt arose as to whether the phraseology of the statute covered the office of director under the First Dáil.  According to the definition of &ldquo;ministerial office&rdquo; in the Principal Act, an office in the First Dáil could be held to be a ministerial office only if it was an office of a member of the Cabinet or the office of Cheann Comhairle or Chairman of Dáil Éireann.  The House will, of course, appreciate that in the circumstances under which the Government of the Republic functioned from 1919 until the Truce in July of 1921, the exact office held by certain persons might become a somewhat difficult matter and therefore provision was made in the Principal Act&mdash;by Section 18, in fact, of that Act&mdash;for the reference of any questions arising as to the holding of a ministerial office before the 6th December, 1922, to a committee which was to consist of the <Col N="1908" /> Taoiseach, or some person nominated by him, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann or some person nominated by him, and the Leader of the principal Opposition Party in Dáil Éireann or some person to be nominated by him.</P>
    <P>One question of eligibility under the Bill in respect of service as a director of a Department was referred to this committee.  Unfortunately, however, no record exists of the report by the committee and I am presuming that no report was made for the obvious reason that, in accordance with the general spirit of the Act, services rendered to the nascent State in the most critical period of its existence ought in justice to be regarded as pensionable and to be reckoned accordingly; while, on the other hand, a strict reading of the Act would appear to exclude it.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied&mdash;and I am sure that those members of the House who can recollect the circumstances of the time will agree with me&mdash;that a person who held the rank of director of one of our State Departments could be held beyond doubt to be eligible to come within the terms of the Act of 1938. The term &ldquo;director&rdquo; is not one with which we who have lived through the 30 years of the development of native parliamentary institutions are accustomed or are familiar with, but it was used to designate the ministerial head of a Department in the First Dáil which, as you know, existed from the 2nd April, 1919, to the 26th August, 1921.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Constitution of the First Dáil is relevant in this connection and it may be of value to place some of its terms on the records of the House.  The Constitution of the First Dáil Éireann was adopted on the 21st January, 1919.  It was, shall we say, expressed in Irish only but it was subsequently amended in English.  The passages which I am going to read are a translation in English of the original terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that since the end of the production season, which includes the harvesting period, the number of workers in employment was reduced by 571.  Of these 350 were resident in hostels and 221 were living locally. The end of the production season this year has been taken as the first week in October.  I understand that the season ended earlier this year owing to the favourable weather conditions during the harvesting period.  Bord na Móna states that this reduction in the number of workers at the close of the production season is a normal phase in turf production.  The reduction in employment this year is, however, somewhat greater than usual by reason of the fact that capital development work which has been in progress side by side with production operations at many of the bogs is now approaching completion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, it is not the practice of the Government to intervene in the management arrangements of Bord na Móna.  I understand from the board that the recruitment of workers for the 1953 season will commence early in January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, the excess of the expenditure of each health authority on recognised health services over the standard expenditure, which is the corresponding expenditure out of local funds in respect of the year 1947-48, is recouped out of the Vote for Health up to the point where such excess is equal to the standard expenditure; beyond that point recoupment is at the rate of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>An examination of the expenditure on health services in the current financial year shows that the expenditure of the Cork County Council on all health services as at present calculated, is, in common with the expenditure of the majority of health authorities, in excess of the equivalent of twice the standard expenditure.  The percentage increase of the current expenditure over the standard expenditure is, however, lower than the percentage increase shown in the aggregate expenditure of all other health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total grant payable from the Vote for Health to the Cork County Council in respect of the current year is calculated at £386,000.  When this sum is apportioned to meet the cost of the various services in respect of the current year the amount appropriate <Col N="1915" /> to tuberculosis services is £108,000 and as the total expenditure on these services is £132,000 there is a balance of £24,000 to be met from local funds, as compared with £15,000 in the year 1947-48. The added impost on local funds in respect of the tuberculosis services is, therefore, approximately £9,000.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to measure the extent to which the operation of the mobile X-ray unit in County Cork has resulted in more effective case-finding and consequently greater expenditure on treatment, than would have obtained in its absence.  The direct cost of operating the mobile X-ray service in the county is approximately £4,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a clash between the insured persons and the funds the insured persons lose, according to the Minister.  I suggest that he has a higher responsibility than that, namely, to look after the interests of insured persons.  I see nothing derogatory in the Minister taking the initiative and saying to the dentists: &ldquo;Look here, you and I are quarrelling about this matter.  The insured persons are losing because they are not getting dental treatment or have to pay for what they get out of their own pocket.&rdquo;  He could ask the dentists to meet the Minister with a view to getting this matter settled.  It will have to be settled in the long run.  I see nothing wrong in the Minister taking the initiative, being actuated by the proper motive, that his job is to look after the interests of insured persons.  There is no question of saying that the Minister should surrender. The row is between the Minister and the dentists but, unfortunately, the casualties are not the dentists or the Minister, but the people who expect the Minister to look after them.</P>

As a matter of fact, one of the first tasks I had to do was to settle a strike in the National Health Insurance Society which was left by my predecessor, <Col N="1917" /> the present Minister.  I am asking the Minister now to do what he ought to do, namely, to meet the dentists and get this thing settled, in the interests of the insured persons. The Minister ought to do that and I believe the dentists ought to recognise their responsibility in the matter, too.</P>

In the Oireachtas competitions for céilí bands the number of entries is usually small and Dublin bands almost invariably get first and second prizes.  I believe, therefore, that a Radio Éireann contest for céilí bands would not achieve the object which the Deputy has in mind.  The mobile recording unit has recently made recordings for audition purposes of céilí bands in different parts of the country and more are planned.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came to the end of the discussion on this Bill last evening, I was endeavouring to show Deputies that it was impossible to divorce these proposals from what was aimed at in the matter of the reconditioning and the repair and maintenance of our road system.  I was explaining to the House that the roads of the country are maintained from two sources, the rates that are struck by the different local authorities and the contributions made to local bodies from the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>The members of the Opposition were critical of these proposals and invited us to examine what they called the cruel impositions and burdens which this measure imposes upon the classes affected by them.  We ought, I think, to look at the other side of the picture. I would, therefore, invite the members of the House, especially those members who are members of county councils, who every year are called upon to face the objectionable and difficult task of striking a county rate, to examine the problem.  That is one of the difficult tasks of county councils.  As Deputies in this House are aware, rates have been soaring everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear those Deputies who have been pleading with me to face up to a problem on which they have as much information as I have, <Col N="1928" /> and possibly more experience.  These two sources I have mentioned are the only ones from which our roads can be improved and maintained.  Indeed, it is most unlikely, no matter what happens, that matters will ever change in that regard.  I believe it will be generally accepted that in the future it is to those two sources we must look in that regard.</P>
    <P>Is it fair or reasonable that while the rates which have been struck for road improvement and maintenance have increased by over 100 per cent. in recent years motor taxation should remain as it was in 1926 except for the additional taxation that was imposed on owners of private cars from 1947 on? I have already admitted, and I admit now, that any new tax or duty imposed upon any section is naturally resisted and resented.  Is it reasonable to contend, as Deputies appear to have been able to contend, that while the rates that have been struck for the maintenance of our roads continue to increase, the contributions of those who use the roads to make a living&mdash; the lorry owner, the motor owner, the hackneymen and the taximen&mdash;should be left as they were in 1926?  As I said before, that is not a reasonable contention. It is a contention which, I am satisfied, Deputies, when they go before their local bodies to strike a rate, whether city, urban or county, will not put forward.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have gone part of the way with me in this regard.  Others have suggested that these proposals of mine were ill-considered and the argument they advanced in proof of the claim was that our method of road-making, maintenance and so on was inadequate.  Some Deputies suggested that the road problems of the country should be tackled on a regional basis, contending that such a departure would give us a great deal more efficiency and better value for the money.  Other Deputies went further and claimed that different councils and many county engineers were just clinging on to the old method of roadmaking, but none of them seemed to make any allowance for the wonderful improvement that has taken place everywhere in road-making methods or for the progressive <Col N="1929" /> outlook of councils and county engineers in recent years.</P>
    <P>None of the Deputies who made these contentions that further improvements could be effected gave any consideration at all to the problems of employment with which local bodies have to contend.  It is all very well to make speeches along certain lines here, to give the impression that you want things approached in a business-like fashion, to display your knowledge of business and suggest how these public works should be supervised and organised, but those who take advantage of occasions such as this to give these displays do not apparently have regard to the issues which arise in a local council&mdash;issues of employment the attitude of the workers, whether councillors will approve of the establishment of a central quarry in which most of the quarry work and employment in the county will be given, and all the agitation that goes on to have old quaries used here, there and everywhere in order to spread out employment over the area.  Are we then to say that these considerations should not weigh with the local bodies and county engineers?  Are we to say that county engineers and local bodies should ride roughshod over these views, if and when they are expressed.</P>
    <P>We are encouraging local bodies and assisting them in every way we can to adopt the most modern methods practicable in the making and maintenance of our roads, but I would certainly hesitate to attempt to influence a local body in its judgment as to what should be done in this regard.  You cannot disregard the employment factor that arises in all these questions.  I claim then, that so far as it is practicable, county engineers and councils are fully aware of the importance, in these days of rising costs and other difficulties, of the need to improve their methods so as to bring these costs down.  But they must always have regard to that other problem that has to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It was suggested here, too, that the fact that the Road Fund has been growing, on account of the additional number of vehicles coming on to our roads, every week, every month and <Col N="1930" /> every year, in itself should be adequate to meet the requirements of the roads, but a moment's examination will at once show the fallacy of that line of thought.  The more vehicles, the more damage, and if the vehicles as a whole are not contributing to the same extent, or to the extent to which they are doing damage, the problem becomes greater.  I do not think there is a member of this House who would not admit wholeheartedly that our roads everywhere, in every part of the country&mdash;some places are worse than others &mdash;are in a very bad and backward state.</P>
    <P>I remember a time, and it is not so many years ago, when expenditure of public money on roads was regarded as a sort of luxury, a sort of unnecessary work, but all that has now changed.  Even the farmers, who at one time were the most outspoken in regard to extravagance so far as road construction was concerned, are now fully conscious of the need, even from the point of view of their own business, for tackling this problem.  Deputies will remember how farmers used to protest at county council meetings because of the danger to the live stock which resulted from the modern type of tar-sealed road, and, indeed, only some months ago, the report of a commission set up some years ago to examine that question reached me.  The problem is no longer there now, and one never hears that problem spoken of at a county council meeting, although 15 or 17 years ago deputation after deputation waited on county councils to urge them to provide sidetracks along main roads for the safety of animals and so on.  There is, therefore, a complete change of outlook so far as the condition of our roads is concerned.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly I see no hope of our being able to tackle that problem as it should be tackled unless we make up our minds to approach it in the manner proposed here.  I am not suggesting that the sum of money likely to be secured as a result of these proposals will be adequate, or nearly adequate, for the task that lies before us; but, assuming that conditions remain in or about the same for the next ten years <Col N="1931" /> or so, I think everybody will admit that the expenditure of £1,000,000 per annum on our roads will play a considerable part in bringing to an end the state of affairs about which everybody is continually complaining at the present time.</P>
    <P>Last night, and I think on some other occasions too, Deputy Corish suggested there should be no Road Fund and that contributions for the construction and maintenance of our roads should be made from time to time from the Exchequer.  I would not be prepared to take that risk.  Although it must be conceded that the Road Fund was not always regarded as available only for roads, it would be a very dangerous step to merge the Road Exchequer.  There is a much better opportunity of taking a stand, a stand that I have stated I took this year, in order to secure that the total revenue from motor taxation will be made available for roads so long as the Road Fund retains its seperate identity.  It is always easy to make a fight on that issue because it is always possible to point the finger to the amount that is there and it is always possible to know who tampered with it and for what purpose it was used.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I say to Deputy Corish that as long as Governments and Ministers for Finance have their problems in connection with the Budget, it would be a very dangerous course, and one that I personally would resist very strenuously, to take the step he recommends in so far as the Road Fund is concerned.  I think there is need for really enlightened public opinion, especially on local bodies, of the need for strengthening this fund and devoting it to the purpose for which it was set up.</P>
    <P>It is pleaded on behalf of certain interests affected by these proposals that there should be some mitigation of the burden.  It is only natural that Deputies, when approached by organised interests, should stand up here and put their views and the views of those with whom they have discussed the matter publicly before the House. I think Deputies have enough common <Col N="1932" /> sense to know that when a Minister comes in here with proposals of this nature he has a wider and a greater responsibility and, if I may say so in all humility, a greater knowledge of the need for what he is seeking to collect by the impositions he proposes before the House.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me to resist the urgent pleas that have been advanced. Sometimes I feel that stress is laid upon these pleas, firstly, in order to secure the concession for the people concerned, and, secondly, to get the Minister to break the line.  I want to assure the House again that I have considered these proposals even though I have been accused of the contrary. The whole matter was reviewed by an inter-Departmental committee.  The report of that committee and its suggestions were examined by me.  In turn, my proposals were examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the officials of my Department, it is only natural that I should have a fair idea of the amount of money required.  It would not be right to say we want so much money and, irrespective of the hardship the collection of that money might impose, insist on getting it.  I have not done that.  We arrived at a sum of money that we believed was urgently required and we are endeavouring now to present proposals here with a view to finding that money, proposals that will inflict the least possible hurt upon those who have to bear them.</P>
    <P>While I understand the reason for these pleas and while I understand that it is only natural that when individuals are organised in the way in which the taximen and hackneymen are organised that they should come to their representatives and make their case and put all the pressure they can upon those representatives in order to secure a certain concession, at the same time my responsibility is bigger and wider than all that.  As Minister, I must have regard, however much I would like to have my proposals acceptable to all, to the proper discharge of my responsibilities in conjunction with what I think is necessary in the interests of all.  I know it will prove to be a very good day's work on our part when <Col N="1933" /> these proposals are given effect to and when we secure the additional sums necessary without imposing any undue hardship upon any particular section of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked a question, the answer to which I would like to put on the records now.  His question dealt with the method to be followed in determining the horse-power of an engine.  It is a technical question and as I am not myself mechanically minded, I will read for him now the reply to the question he posed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regulations made by the Minister for Local Government will prescribe how the horse-power of a vehicle is to be calculated.  This has always been the case.  In the past there have been no less than four sets of regulations, three of which (including that at present in force) use a formula in which the horse-power is based on the width of the cylinder of the engine.  Similar regulations applied in Britain and they encouraged the manufacture in that country of engines with narrow cylinders.  American and continental engines were not so restricted and so we find engines from these areas a good deal &ldquo;wider&rdquo; than engines of corresponding capacity manufactured in Britain.  Many British-manufactured engines are now appearing with wider cylinders.</P>
    <P>The new regulations which will come into effect on 1st January next will deal fairly with the wide cylinder as well as the narrow one.  The width of the cylinder will no longer be the determining factor, but its whole volume will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The horse-power of an engine will be calculated as follows under the new formula.  The total volume of the cylinders will be taken in cubic centimetres and divided by 125.  In the result a fraction of less than 0.1 will be ignored.  Thus, if the result is 12.06, the engine will be rated at 12 horse-power.  (This is the existing practice.)  It is inevitable that some engines will lie on one side or other of any line which has to be drawn, but it is submitted that the <Col N="1934" /> line decided on is the fairest possible.</P>
    <P>It has not been determined in order to benefit or trap any particular model of car.  The formula used is based on that used by the British when they for a short time in recent years adopted a similar system of calculating horse-power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was asked, too, if I could make some concession in regard to the method of paying a tax&mdash;that is, on a quarterly basis.  The position is that in the Bill before us the minimum is 25 per cent. of the yearly tax and the maximum &mdash;which has been the case for years past&mdash;is 30 per cent. per quarter.  I do not see how one could justify encouraging the payment of the tax on a monthly or on a quarterly basis. It is of tremendous advantage to have the tax paid yearly, if at all possible. I agree that it is not possible in all cases.  It is the same in every other business.  You pay a surcharge in the case of insurance, you pay a surcharge in the case of the purchase of goods and, indeed, in any other method of trading there is that surcharge if you do not pay down the full sum.  The extra 5 per cent. on a quarterly payment is not, I think, excessive.  To make it any less would appear to me to be ridiculous.  I do not see why, at the expense of the Road Fund, we should give a concession in this matter which is not given in any other line of commercial life.</P>
    <P>I indicated yesterday that local bodies will encounter difficulties in getting the new rates of duty into operation by the first day of the new year.  While I do not want to curtail discussion in any way when we come to the remaining stages, I appeal to the Opposition Parties to co-operate with me in getting this Bill through by the time specified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the surcharge that is necessary where the period is a quarter.  I have in mind now the taxation of lorries. Some people have occasion to use their lorries for only a month or so into the second quarter and I wonder if it would be possible to break down <Col N="1935" /> the minimum period of taxation from a quarter to a month?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that matter.  I would point out to the Deputy that those who were pleading for a reduction were pleading for a limited class, namely, the taximen and the hackney owners.  Deputy S. Collins's line of thought suggests that there are other types of cases that might be met.  That would involve the opening up of something that is not very formidable but which, at the same time, is a practice I am bound to resist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was approached by people who, say, might have to use their lorry up to the end of April and then would not require to use it again until the last quarter of the year.  Can the Minister do anything for those people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who use private cars, too, for the summer and who put them up for the winter. The State and local bodies have to make roads to take traffic at its maximum.  However desirable it might be to eliminate the pin-pricks that this sort of regulation will impose on people, I think&mdash;as a result of some experience&mdash;that it is always dangerous to have these exemptions and small concessions that mean very little and that cause a great deal of confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment, I was referring to the terms of Article 2 of the Constitution of the First Dáil Éireann.  That Constitution, among other things, provided that &ldquo;those who are in the office in the Ministry from time to time shall have complete executive power&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The Ministry,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;shall consist of a President of the Ministry elected by Dáil Éireann, and not more than nine executive officers, each of whom the President shall nominate and have power to dismiss.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It then went on to provide that every Minister &ldquo;shall be responsible always to the Dáil&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;the names of Ministers shall be submitted to the Dáil for confirmation during the meeting at which the President shall himself have been elected to his office, or at the first meeting after their nominations by the President.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In short, Article 2 of the Constitution of the First Dáil which, as I have already indicated to the House, was amended in April, 1919, provided for a Ministry which was, in the terms of the Constitution itself, to have complete executive power, and, as the Article which I have quoted makes clear, was to consist of a President and not more than nine Executive Members who were to be nominated by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the nominations by the President were to be subject to ratification by Dáil Éireann and were to be effective, as the text of the Article proves, only on such ratification.  On the 2nd April, 1919, the then President, Mr. de Valera, nominated, and the Dáil approved, seven Secretaries or Ministers together with two other members who were described as Directors in charge of Departments, one being in charge of the Department of Propaganda and one for Agriculture.  A Director of Trade and Commerce was further nominated by the President and approved of by the Dáil, and he, I think, subsequently became styled as Minister.  A Minister for Irish and a Director of Fisheries were nominated <Col N="1940" /> in November, 1919, but these nominations were not approved by the Dáil until the 29th June, 1920, which was the date of its next meeting.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the lapse of time between the date of actual nomination on the part of the President, which was the date upon which these Ministers took up duty, and the date upon which their nominations were ratified by the Dáil.  On a strict interpretation of the Principal Act and of the Constitution this service between November, 1919, and June 1920 could not be reckonable for pensionable purposes.  This is the position which we deal with in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, these persons were functioning as members of the Executive of Dáil Éireann.  They were running all the risks and were carrying all the responsibilities which attached to that membership during this period from November, 1919, until June, 1920, when their nomination was eventually ratified by Dáil Éireann.  I want to emphasise again that that was the first occasion on which the Dáil met after they had been nominated by the President and had taken up duty and was, therefore, the first occasion upon which their appointments could have been formally ratified.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, was that on the 2nd April, 1919, we had a Ministry consisting of a President and seven Ministers, together with two Directors; that is to say, we had the full Executive which was provided for under Article 2 (b) of the Constitution of the Republic, which, as I have already informed the Dáil, was to consist of the President of the Ministry and not more than nine executive officers.  It is true that that Constitution was subsequently departed from to this extent, that as the organisation of the Republic began to develop and the Executive was able to undertake increased and expanding responsibilities the need for other Departments began to be apparent and had to be met, and eventually the real executive Government of the country consisted of the President, eight Ministers and four Directors, and this was again increased, I should say, to nine Ministers and four Directors in January, 1920.  In addition, as members <Col N="1941" /> of the Executive were apprehended and imprisoned, substitutes were appointed from time to time for those Ministers, Directors or Secretaries, as they were variously called, and, I think, somewhat indiscriminately called, who were imprisoned or who were abroad on national business.</P>
    <P>When the principal Act was introduced in 1938, it was not the intention of the Government in the year of its introduction, namely, 1938, to make any differentiation between these various officers, no matter by what style they might be referred to, in regard to eligibility for pension.  In fact, when I was speaking in the Seanad on the Second Reading of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Officers Bill, I said that the Bill covered all those who have already held Cabinet office or office in the Government under the First, Second or Third Dáil.  The reference is to Volume 22, column 400. It is quite clear from the records in my Department that service as a Director was thought to be covered by the 1938 Act.  The Government feel now, as they felt then, that it would be invidious to exclude such services and, accordingly, provision for the removal of the doubt to which I refer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that there was a doubt because, if there had not been a doubt, we should have a report from the Committee of Reference which was set up under Section 18 of the Bill.  We have no such report and the clear conclusion to be drawn is that the committee did not find themselves in a position to make a report on this question of eligibility, having regard to the statements which were made in the House and also, as I have said, the somewhat indiscriminate way in which the titles &ldquo;Cabinet Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Director&rdquo; had been used during the proceedings of the First Dáil.  However, I again want to repeat that the Government feel that it would be invidous to exclude services such as I have described and accordingly provision for the removal of the doubt is included in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that if the Cabinet of the First Dáil had been constituted on the basis which now exists, whereby all the Ministers are Cabinet Ministers, the difficulty would not have arisen. It would be anomalous, however, that, while provision has been made for existing Parliamentary Secretaries who have never been members of the Cabinet, Ministers of the First Dáil who held office at great personal risk should be excluded from benefit merely because they were not members of what you might describe as the inner or essential Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated, I am sure, that in the circumstances of the period, when in fact this was a Cabinet operating and conducting a war in a territory which was occupied by the enemy, it was essential that there should be a small group who would operate as a war Cabinet, as an inner Cabinet, and that is clearly what was envisaged by the use of the term &ldquo;member of the Cabinet&rdquo; in the Constitution of the First Dáil.  As I have said, that was an instrument which was born of the circumstances in which the Government of Dáil Éireann functioned; it was an indispensable instrument for <Col N="1943" /> the Government of the day.  But the mere fact that circumstances imposed it upon our Constitution in the first instance should not operate to the disadvantage of Ministers who were appointed as such by Dáil Éireann and who, under the Constitution at that time, as is quite clear from the Article which I have recited, formed the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Such a differentiation would, in my view, be invidious inasmuch as the members of the Executive, although they were described as Directors, Secretaries or Ministers, bore full ministerial responsibility for their Departments equally with the members or what I have described as the inner Cabinet.  They ran equal risks and endured equal hardships.  Indeed, the position might be fully exemplified if I point out that of the four Directors only one succeeded in carrying on continuous administration without the necessity of appointing a substitute during imprisonment.  Perhaps in that connection it might be relevant to refer to a statement which was made by one of these Directors, the late Countess Markievicz, who, as her contemporaries in this House will recall, was the Secretary for Labour in the First Dáil Cabinet.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 17th August, 1921, she said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Each Deputy has a copy of the report of the Ministry of Labour in which you will find full information about the activities of the Ministry from the time I first assumed office in 1919 until the 1st February this year when Joseph MacDonagh was appointed as Substitute Minister.</P>
    <P>I was not long in office until I was arrested and Thomas Kelly took over the work.  I came out again after four months and returned to work until I was rearrested in the autumn of last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Joseph MacDonagh, described as Substitute-Minister for Labour, then spoke as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to render account of the activities of the Dáil Éireann Ministry of Labour from the 1st February, 1921, which was the day <Col N="1944" /> on which the Ministry came under my control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the reports from the Labour Department circulated to the members of An Dáil on the same day the following appears:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGrath, T.D., was appointed Substitute-Minister for Labour at the end of October (1920) and he was arrested on 2nd December.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus we have the position that not only had we members of the Executive who ran all the risks and carried, as I have said, all the responsibilities during this period of the Black and Tan war, but we also had persons who were appointed as substitutes for them and who, when the original appointees were arrested, took over responsibility for the conduct of the departments of the absentees.  This Bill accordingly takes power to provide that substitutes for Ministers, Secretaries and Directors shall rank equally with the original appointees for pensionable purposes.</P>
    <P>The next section in the Bill to which I refer is Section 4.  The original Act of 1938 provides that a minimum of three years' service would be required to qualify for a pension in respect of ministerial service, but that service prior to the Truce should be counted as double for pension purposes.  The amending Act, however, of 1949 provided that, if a Minister died in office, his widow might be awarded a pension, even though he had not completed three years' service.  Section 4 of this Bill is intended to put the widows of persons who served from 1919 to the Truce, during the Black and Tan period, so to speak, in an equivalent position.  Accordingly, Section 4 will enable a pension to be awarded to widows of persons who held ministerial office before the Truce, but who did not die in office even though such persons' service may not have amounted to the full three years.  The total cost of the Bill to the public funds will not exceed £1,150 per year so far as we can calculate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be six or seven, but some may not apply.  We are covering, as far as we can see, all <Col N="1945" /> the cases that remained uncovered by the 1938 Act.  The figure I have given assumes that every person entitled to benefit under the Bill will apply, and the total cost to the State will be in the order of £1,150.  Pensions, of course, will not be payable, except upon application.  That is provided for in Section 5, and it is quite clear, I think.  In the case of application which is made within six months of the date of the passing of the Act, the pension will begin to run from the date of the passing of the Act, but in the case of any application made later than six months after the passing of the Act the pension will begin to run from the date of application.</P>
      <P>This Bill will, I think, fulfil so far as possible the obligations we owe to the few remaining persons who participated in the establishment of this State and who have so far been excluded from the benefit of such provisions as we have been able to make for their contemporaries.</P>

      <P>There will be, of course, no opposition to this Bill and there is only one matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. He hopes that it will complete all these cases and cover the people to whom, it is felt, pensions or gratuities should be given.  I will ask the Minister's sympathetic consideration for one case, however, which I think has been the subject of an oversight.  Under the provisions of the Acts of 1938 and 1949 the position arises that if a particular man who has been a Minister ceases to be a Minister he is debarred from pension if he is in receipt of a pension from other sources such as for local government service.  If he dies, his widow does not come within the provisions of the Act of 1938 because he had not been entitled to a pension.  I think that there is an oversight in this.  It affected only one person, one of my colleagues.  I could not put down the amendment because I would be out of order.</P>

      <P>As has been announced from our front bench, the Bill is not being opposed.  I am very glad that the Government and the Minister have taken this step.  If I might say so at this stage, however, the Minister in his speech made a gallant effort to have it opposed.  I do not know whether that was intentional or not, but it was quite obvious that the Bill was not being opposed and then he proceeded to repeat what he considered to be the history of the period.  I do not cavil at his descriptions of the Ministers and directors of the various Departments of State.  I think he was quite correct in all that. I am also perfectly satisfied with a Bill &mdash;and will support it fully&mdash;giving recognition to that service and to the widows of these officers.  I do not know, however, what the Minister's intention was when he made two statements. He spoke of the President of the Republic and then he had to correct that later and say that it was the President of the Executive,&mdash;the President of the Cabinet were the words he used&mdash;the Ministry.  I do not want the Minister's statement to go unchallenged in that respect.  The head of the Government then was the same as to-day, the Taoiseach or Prime Minister of the Government.  I just want to stress that.  The term &ldquo;President of the Republic&rdquo; was not established until August, 1921.  I do not want to get into a controversy about it but I want to make sure at this stage that the Minister's remarks will not go unchallenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that these people would be provided for even though some of them may be wealthy enough not to want it. Nevertheless, recognition should be given to them for their services.  If they feel like applying for this particular pension they should get it and be free to do with it what they think fit. <Col N="1947" /> I am glad to say there are some of them who do not require it but I know that there are others now about to be covered who do require it.  I want to congratulate the Government and the Minister for their part in the work of giving this recognition now.</P>
    <P>When I saw this Bill I thought I might be able, under it, to cover one outstanding case of that particular time.  Having consulted the Ceann Comhairle's office, I do not think I would be in order in making an amendment or in suggesting an amendment to it, because to include the case that I have in mind would change the name and title of the Bill and of the previous Act.  As this is only an amendment to a previous Act, it appears I would not be in order in doing so.  However, with the Minister's permission, I will make a submission to him during the week upon a certain case in which I think justice should be done.  This person has suffered a very grave injustice arising out of his services to the State at the time.  I hope it will not be necessary to introduce legislation to cover the matter but, if it is, I hope the Government and the Minister will be as generous in that case as they are in these, because the person I have in mind equally rendered service of a very important nature to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy MacEoin, I welcome the introduction of this Bill. I have a few non-controversial queries to put to the Minister, and I hope that this Bill will cover all the difficulties that have arisen.  Like the Leader of the Opposition, I would press the Minister on one case that could arise as referred to by him.  It is purely a question of the deletion of a date in the Act which would rectify that problem.  I wanted to ask the Minister, not in a state of acrimony, was it not possible&mdash;where this Bill, as I know it does, covers one specific case in which a good deal of hardship has ensured&mdash; if the recognition was given, that apart from the pension, some <i>ex gratia</i> payment in respect of the long period of non-recognition, could have been recommended.  I am making that plea <Col N="1948" /> and that suggestion to the Minister in a completely non-political way, and I want the Minister to appreciate that. While we all object to retrospection in legislation where a retrospective payment of pension over a long period might involve a big sum, I feel the Minister could, with the complete acquiescence of the House, apart from giving a grant of pension to which the passage of this Bill will entitle the person, make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in an endeavour to meet the exigencies of the person's situation.</P>
      <P>I want to express my view as a young person and not as a contemporary of the people who are to benefit.  I feel this is an instalment of justice that is long overdue.  How the original difficulties arose or how the original mistakes were allowed to occur, I do not know, but it does seem a bit harsh that we now admit in a non-contentious way that these directors have a certain standing.  I do not know why any difficulty should ever have arisen.  My own feeling is that irrespective of what side anybody may have taken afterwards, irrespective of what may have arisen as a result of the split, there was a very clear-cut pattern of government there in which the title, whether it was &ldquo;Director&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, did not mean any difference other than Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  The responsibilities were vested in the same way and it was a question of a use of words that may have been the effective barrier to somebody getting a benefit that we now feel in an unanimous spirit in the House was in justice due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I rose to my feet at all, to say to the Minister in a non-controversial way that where the omission to cover these specific cases can in the main be laid at the door of this Legislative Assembly&mdash;I would not say it was at any particular stage of the country's history or development&mdash; where some of the causes of this difficulty must lie on our own shoulders, I feel that better might have been done. I am glad to know that some of the people who would benefit if circumstances were different under this Bill have prospered in the new State.  It is &mdash;and I am sure we all feel proud of the fact&mdash;a tribute to their own personal <Col N="1949" /> capacity, their own ingenuity and industry in the new State.  Giving my own personal viewpoint, I would say that where a Bill has unconsciously operated hardship for a number of years against people, where the responsibility, even through inadvertence, was indirectly ours, we should go as far as we can, particularly in the unanimous mood the House is in on the measure, to give what assistance we can.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope this legislation will achieve the closing of the gap in connection with this whole problem and will cover completely everybody who deserves to be considered, irrespective of what his politics may be and irrespective of what his allegiance may subsequently have been.  I hope it will cover everybody, irrespective of status or creed, who contributed, as all those people did, in the spirit of unity prior to the Truce in 1921, to the establishment of the foundations of the Parliament in which we can exercise the right to-day to give them recognition. As a young man in this House, appreciative of the sacrifices that made this Dáil possible.  I would, in my day, plead with the Minister that that particular class of person, and especially the widow of that class of person, would now be compensated to whatever generous extent this House will find possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I have been able to ensure it, this Bill will cover all outstanding cases and it will cover them irrespective of their present political views.  The original Act provided not merely for those who had served in the Executive of Dáil Éireann but also for those who had served in the Provisional Government of Saorstát Éireann and it was intended that, irrespective of the division which had developed between former comrades, they would all receive what was the barest modicum of justice and recognition which this State could give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been these flaws in the Act and, no doubt, we must all take responsibility for them, but when Deputy Collins is speaking of them I would ask him at least to concede it to those who were responsible for the <Col N="1950" /> original Act that it was passed, debated and discussed here in an atmosphere of acute controversy and was subjected to a great deal of misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>That was one of the reasons why we were unable to remedy the defects in the Act at an earlier stage.  Thank goodness, we have come to take a more normal and a more humane view of the matter, and it has therefore been possible for me to bring in this Bill knowing, without having taken any soundings in advance from the members of the Opposition, that it would receive their sympathetic consideration. It was possible for me to proceed on the basis of that assumption well knowing that my hopes would not be disappointed.</P>
    <P>I cannot, however, undertake to give any section of this Bill retrospective effect because, as the Deputy will see a person may take advantage of it at any time that he or she may think fit to do so.  That would mean, accordingly, that if a person deferred taking advantage of its provisions until some years hence, that a retrospective award might impose what would be regarded as a comparatively heavy burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is something, however, to be said for the plea which the Deputy has made to provide an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant for those who have suffered by reason of the earlier faulty draftsmanship of the Act.  On the other hand, as against that, an attempt was made&mdash; not a very adequate one&mdash;to provide employment for at least one person and, I think, for another, who had suffered by reason, as I have said, of the defects in the drafting of the original Act.  I have to take that into consideration also.</P>
    <P>However, as I say I will consider this question of making some lump sum payment which though it will not compensate any of the people affected to the same extent as giving full retrospective effect to the measure will be helpful and will have regard to the circumstance that most of them have reached an advanced age and their enjoyment of this pension in the ordinary natural course may not be very prolonged.  I think there is something <Col N="1951" /> to be said for the point of view which the Deputy has put before me.</P>
    <P>I would again like formally to repeat the assurance which I have given to Deputy John Costello that if he gives me particulars of the case he has in mind I will endeavour to see if I can bring in an amendment to cover it.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, 1952 &mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I suggested to the House that I was against the principle of setting up a commission such as is envisaged in this Bill.  I further suggested that if the Bill did set up a commission the type of commission proposed to be set up by this Bill was bad and would not fulfil its functions in a proper fashion. I suggest to the Minister now that the proper method, the most effective <Col N="1953" /> method, to deal with the restrictive trade practices, which we all know must be dealt with, is one of the methods which he himself suggested in his opening remarks and which he turned down.  The Minister said at column 820, Volume 134, No. 6 of the Dáil Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am asking the House to agree that where a trade association takes power to exclude any citizen from any trade, or imposes restrictions which have the effect of excluding any citizen from any trade, then no matter what justification there may be for that course, and no matter what arguments can be advanced by the association in defence of these restrictions, that association is taking to itself functions which properly belong to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am asking the Dáil also to accept the contention that agreements or combinations or conspiracies between producers and traders to monopolise a particular form of commerce, or to fix or maintain prices for any class of goods, because they involve the power to control a market, is clearly inimical to the public good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, I would say that he is doing no such thing by this Bill.  What he is asking the House to do is not to declare agreement against these things, but to set up a commission to inquire into that type of practice, which may or may not make the declarations which the Minister is making in his speech.  I would suggest that it would have been better for the Minister to have put these types of practices in a Bill and to declare these practices illegal, rather than set up a commission which may find in particular circumstances that these practices are against the common good.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with that suggestion in a rather cursory fashion and said, as reported at column 824:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would have real difficulty in getting a code of law that could safely be applied to all trades in all circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister would <Col N="1954" /> have difficulty in laying down certain principles, but I do not think it is beyond the scope of the Minister's advisers to draft general principles such as he enunciated himself at column 820, on which he could get the general agreement of the House.</P>
    <P>Again&mdash;and this is a suggestion which the Minister's advisers would have to go into very thoroughly&mdash;I think it would have been possible to set up some type of commission which would review applications from various trade associations who would claim that such a general omnibus clause mitigates against the interests of the public and the commission would be charged with the task of finding out if the particular forms of price maintenance or restrictive practice indulged in by a given association were against the public interest or not.</P>
    <P>The proper course to apply would have been to declare these restrictive trade practices and retail price maintenance illegal and put the onus on the associations to come to the commission and let the commission decide whether the practices which any given association carried on were or were not against the public interest.  The report of that commission could then be put before the House and discussed here.</P>
    <P>It would have been a good practice, for example, to have followed Section 14 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, which was passed by the British Legislature.  In that section the Legislature endeavoured to define what they regarded as &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;.  Some of the matters which were to be taken into account when deciding what was in the public interest and what was not were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the production, treatment and distribution by the most efficient and economical means of goods of such types and qualities, in such volume and at such prices as will best meet the requirements of home and overseas markets;</P>
    <P>(b)  the organisation of industry and trade in such a way that their efficiency is progressively increased and new enterprise in encouraged; <Col N="1955" /> (c)  the fullest use and best distribution of men, materials and industrial capacity in the United Kingdom; and</P>
    <P>(d)  the development of technical improvements and the expansion of existing markets and the opening up of new markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that it would have been possible for the Minister to give some sort of direction to the commission and let the trade associations who claim to have been injured by a general prohibition on the type of practices which we all know to exist in the country come to such a commission and show that the type of restriction or retail price management they may be carrying on is in the public interest as defined in the Act.</P>
    <P>It would then be a matter for the Attorney-General, or, if necessary, this commission, to institute proceedings in the courts if they find on investigation that any trade association or body of traders is guilty of a breach of the general principles laid down in the Act.  While agreeing with the Minister that it would be difficult to draw up terms, I suggest that the Minister himself, at column 820, stated the general principles which we probably could agree on regarding practices which this House is against and which we would declare illegal and then we could have thrown the onus on the trade associations concerned to come to the commission, which could be set up in the Bill, to prove that their activities are in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I put forward these suggestions because I believe it is a much more practical and expeditious manner of dealing with the restrictive trade practices which are rampant in this country at the present day.  While it is quite clear we in the Opposition are not going to oppose this Bill, I think it will have to be radically amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to repeat that those associations which exist in this State, which fix prices and can refuse membership and which apply sanctions to their members and non-members in the form of refusing to supply goods to non-members, are <Col N="1956" /> detrimental to the public interest, when the only criterion which these associations apply is the interest of their own particular trade.  I believe it is the duty of the State to inspect, direct and control this type of association and, if necessary, punish by law the persons engaged in this type of practice.</P>
    <P>Certainly, some of the provisions that are enshrined in this Bill&mdash;and I refer in particular to Clause 8 of the Schedule&mdash;carry too far the exercise of that duty by the State, and can in certain circumstances work a very real tyranny on traders and individual persons who will be subject to the prying eye of individual authorised persons which this clause will allow to investigate businesses and trades.  I would like to say also that the Government has not shouldered its responsibility in dealing with trade restrictive practices by setting up this commission.  I regard it as a delegation of its responsibility, and in fact a shirking of its responsibility, to a commission which will work in a very slow and cumbersome fashion. This Bill at best can only be regarded as a fumbling attempt to deal with these real problems.  It will need to be radically amended in Committee, and I would not be surprised at all if, in the next couple of years, it will have to be repealed completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my view right away that I am in favour of legislation to control&mdash;infact, more than control, to wipe out as far as possible&mdash;restrictive practices that have been described by the Minister as inimical to the public interest, but I want to express a view like that of the last speaker.  While I take this Bill for what it is worth&mdash;it is not worth very much&mdash;I will build amendments on it to make it in some way effective towards the purpose at which it is aimed, but as I have no hope that those amendments will be accepted, it will not make much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is clearly a pretence.  There can be no doubts about that when you consider its origin and the particular type of support it has got, in the main, both inside and outside the House.  When I speak of its origin, I refer to its coming from the <Col N="1957" /> Minister himself, who is the architect of most of the restrictions that operate in the country.  The Minister has himself confessed that under a tariff policy there is a great scope for restrictive practices to grow.  Apparently he has accepted the complaints that he says have poured into his Department as to certain restrictions becoming such an abuse that they have become widespread.  He also agrees that once a trade association gets any strength, it is apt to depart from certain correct lines of procedure that these associations may have with regard to research, eventually getting selfish and proceeding to operate in its own interest.  He said he had concurred in helping these trade associations in the country, and in so far as there was this widespread and uncontrolled tariff policy operating in the country, it was likely to be productive of these practices.</P>
    <P>He gave great vigour and force to the bad aspects of restrictive practices but he is the architect of most of the evils from which we suffer.  In addition, one cannot fail to be cynical on this matter.  The aim of this Bill is said to be to reduce the cost of living.  How it can be accepted in this House that the present Government has any delicacy with regard to the cost of living beats me.  The Government and its satellites made a direct attack upon the community.  They announced, through their Minister for Finance, on the budgetary policy, that the policy was deliberately to allow the cost of living to catch up on the wage and salary increases granted since 1947.</P>
    <P>The budgetary phrase was that the Government had carefully considered the situation, that personal earnings had advanced more than the increase in the cost of living and that there was no economic justification for the continuance of a policy of food subsidies and hence they were cut to a great extent in the Budget.</P>
    <P>That was a direct attack on the standards of the people.  The effect of this particular piece of legislation is likely to be very small in comparison with the increase in the cost of living which has been occasioned directly by the Government through its direct and deliberate policy.  I find myself in <Col N="1958" /> somewhat of a difficulty in coming to a decision on this point.  I am told that restrictive practices are many&mdash; I will comment on that in more detail &mdash;and at the same time, the Minister saw that he had to play that down because he did not like it to be understood that he was attacking trade in general in this country.  The gist of his speech was that these restrictive practices were there and if they were not now checked early, they might grow and become a great evil in the State and might eventually have a very profound effect in regard to prices.  If the practices or malpractices in the end led to an increased cost of living, by increasing the prices which build up the cost of living, that might be correct.  If those practices were small, then if the measure was effective the benefit to the public must not be very big.  If they are widespread, as some of the complaints in speeches made by the Minister outside the House seem to indicate&mdash;he believed these malpractices were strong and extensive&mdash;then, of course, if an effective attack were made on them and some procedure adopted to bring relief, it might be of some value.</P>
    <P>Taking even the strongest view, that the practices are widespread and affect costs, and even accepting that the measure in one or two years will be effective, the full effect of an efficient measure would be very small as against the increase in the cost of living produced by the Government's own efforts.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is the attitude of the Bill's supporters, which, to me, clearly cast doubts on the <i>bona fides</i> of this measure and was expressed in the <i>Irish Times</i> which welcomed the Bill.  I cannot imagine the horny hands of the clientele of the <i>Irish Times</i> being really bothered about the effect of the Minister's efforts to get the cost of living down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, of course, is a very real authority in approving of this measure, but he also has been prominent in the fostering and pushing forward of the attack on the people's standard of life.  This is only a little piece of face-saving that he should be behind.</P>
    <P>Certain federations of employers and <Col N="1959" /> chambers of commerce have indulged in what Deputy Larkin called faint protests about this, but they have made certain complaints of a type which are to be approved in regard to the machinery to be applied. Leaving out the matter of the machinery, they have made a few bleats, but, in the main, they are complacent.  They do not worry much about this, and I think they are right there.  There is no need for them to be anxious.  The jingle of the election subscriptions, they feel, will surely mean more in the end with the Minister than any vigour and drive that could be put into this measure.</P>
    <P>What happened this year with regard to the ballroom proprietors was a definite sign to these people who have the money-bags wide open that these are favoured people, when it is a question of something in the public interest as against something that cuts across the interests of these selfish people.</P>
    <P>The steps by which this measure was brought before the House are of some interest.  The campaign was opened with speeches made, in the main, by the Minister at Party meetings that were held under the cover of certain banquets held in this town.  I feel that this method of using social occasions as the occasion upon which to make Party statements is being rather overdone. It seems to me to be slightly unfriendly to the hosts on these occasions for the Minister to take their hospitality and then lecture them on the mode of life which enables them to provide that hospitality.</P>

      <P>I could not advert to these things without referring to a speech by the Minister at a chamber of commerce where he was the guest and where the practices I am talking about were given as the worst example. The emphasis at the particular meeting was upon restrictive practices and was based upon two disclosures that were made by certain United States and other foreign experts. When I read some of the <Col N="1960" /> phrases, it is not to remind the Minister of what he might be anxious to forget or to rub things in.  I want to understand at the start whether the Minister believes in these things.  If he has this volume of comment with regard to restrictive practices I think it should be published.  I saw a copy of one of these documents this morning and glancing through it rather hurriedly, I failed to find reference to the amazing restrictions which the Minister said in the chamber of commerce speech had been disclosed by the reports.  Speaking at the annual dinner of the chamber of commerce at the Gresham Hotel on the 16th October this year, the Minister is paraded in the <i>Chamber of Commerce Journal</i> for October, 1952, as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Groups of foreign experts who had surveyed various aspects of our economy in recent months had reported that we were wasting our time organising an export trade unless all policies and programmes were adjusted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was then stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The experts had warned that there would be no progress such as we desire unless the policies and practices of all sections were deliberately adjusted so as to assist it, with no section or interest standing out of the general effort.  That adjustment would have to be achieved by agreement, which pre-supposed understanding; and that was the most important question affecting the country's future.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, the phrases came fast and furious:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;All of those outside experts had commented on the prevalence of restrictive practices which were hampering expansion of economic activity. They pointed out the folly of talking about expansion and practising restriction, and said they found a disposition favouring restrictive practices in every sector of our national life&mdash;in business management, in agriculture, and in trade union policy.  They said that too high a proportion of time and effort of every section appeared to be directed to consolidating existing positions, and <Col N="1961" /> protecting existing advantages and privileges; that they found insufficient evidence of any disposition to face the hazards upon which expansion depended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, in a further phrase, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They discovered no inclination amongst the majority of Irish producers to take any sort of risk, no evidence of capacity to produce the drive necessary to make an impact on external markets.  Our first need, they said, was a clarification of aims and a confident and wholehearted commitment to their fulfilment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same context, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The action urged on us was an objective re-examination in detail, to sweep away those impeding practices, even if it meant abandoning also the advantages they conferred on special interests and accepting the risks inherent in all changes.  `What we have been told is that we cannot have it both ways at the same time'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he said this, as not all the facts supported that view and I presume we are getting away from the experts here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We had built up industries based on the home market behind protective barriers, measuring their development more by the volume of their production than by their efficiency, more by the number of workers they employed than by their labour costs of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He wanted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...a bold development policy voluntarily accepted by all sections directed towards new production targets, involving the elimination of all impediments to expanding economic activity, which cannot fail to pay off in more jobs, higher wages, better profits, lower prices and lower taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer given by the president was in brief phrase, that he hoped they would be given details of these reports. That is a hope which I share and it is a hope which has not been gratified yet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> That was the introduction.  There were other meetings, but that was the last great barrage just before this measure was introduced.  It was then introduced.  The <i>Irish Times</i> as usual welcomed it and having patted the Minister on the back, as is their habit, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;His speech might not have provided a convincing justification of the Bill as it stands, but as an exposition of the need of legislation of some sort on restrictive trade practices, and of the difficulties that were in the way of any other type of legislative approach, it was masterly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition to that &ldquo;masterly effort which was not convincing justification,&rdquo; a leader in the <i>Irish Times</i> showed the view that journal properly took in an article more or less welcoming the whole thing, and saying that it was a pity that the position should be left that manufacturers and traders should be allowed to argue that the Government had discriminated against them.  That is because trade union activity had not been brought within the scope of the Bill.  The leader went on, and the sting is in the tail of the editorial:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless, as the adage puts it, the best must not be the enemy of the good.  A start must be made somewhere, and the trades unions, when their turn comes, are likely to be more amenable as a result of their knowledge that they have not been singled out as the first victims.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think a few phrases were used by addled supporters of the Minister that this was a perfect instrument, but for what purpose they did not go on to say.  The corresponding measure of this type in the House of Commons in 1948 was described by the President of the Board of Trade in introducing it as a piece of legislation by which they gave to the State two ears, two eyes, a pretty lengthy nose and what he called an effective set of teeth to grapple with the particular practices.  The criticism of that particular legislation was that it was promoted as a cure for organic disorder but was merely a salve for incidental blemishes.  The salve for incidental blemishes has so <Col N="1963" /> worked that, in the four years that commission has been at work, it has produced four reports&mdash;one on dental goods, one on rainwater goods, one on electric lamps and one on insulated cables&mdash;and the previous Attorney-General who became President of the Board of Trade said that he had, in fact, despaired to some degree of the commission because his estimate was that it would take them 12 years to produce an effective report on any one of the 55 articles which by that time had been referred to them for their consideration.</P>
    <P>So far as this measure is concerned, we are lagging four years behind the British in the introduction of this type of measure.  I want to say of this Bill that it is not even a salve for incidental blemishes.  It promises that hereafter, if certain things happen, we may have an incidental salve produced for certain blemishes that may be disclosed, and that after an address by the Minister in which he said he was convinced that these restrictive practices&mdash;I take this to be his meaning&mdash;were quite extensive and very hostile to the public welfare. As for the teeth this measure has, they do not exist, but I hope, in Committee Stage, to be able to stick one or two into the gums.  I suppose the Minister's idea, however, is that the fitting of the dentures would have to wait two years until the new proposals in regard to health, of which we have been told, make their appearance.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to accept that there are restrictive practices.  Deputy Declan Costello has talked about the principles the Minister accepted in what I am afraid is the usual type of rather ambiguous and non-committal speech.  There is a good deal in the speech of complaints made to the Department, and these are presented to the Dáil as being indicative, as even evidence and proof, of certain practices being widespread; but, on the other hand, the Minister tailed off at the end and talked about the vast body of the traders being free from any criticism under this head.  I do not know what he means except it is a case of: &ldquo;Well, there is this volume of complaints and it needs inquiry.  Hence, <Col N="1964" /> we are going to inquire.&rdquo;  He did use one or two phrases, however, that seem to indicate an acceptance of the complaints. I believe we should accept them, because we have all in our experience in life come across very definite practices which could be described as restrictive of the old-time competitive effort that is supposed to be at the root and a virtue of capitalism.</P>
    <P>At column 813 of the Dáil Debates of 31st October last, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the purpose of this Bill is to provide administrative machinery for the investigation of these trade practices and to do something about them where they are found to be inimical to the public welfare.  When I use the term `public welfare' in that connection I mean practices which are designed to eliminate or restrict competition in the supply or distribution of any class of goods or which operate to deprive an individual citizen of the opportunity of engaging in legitimate trade in a particular class of goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest that we should declare these practices just in that phrase, as being inimical to the public welfare, as being illegal and make the practices and the continued use of them an offence.  Let us cut down deep into these malpractices phrased in that way because the Minister has said that practices which are designed to eliminate or restrict competition in the supply or distribution of any class of goods are practices inimical to the public welfare.  Continuing at column 814 the Minister gave details of the practices.  One is&mdash;and this he said drew the largest volume of complaint&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that of refusing supplies of goods on trade terms to persons who are not members of an association, who were denied membership of an association or who could not get the approval of an association to engage in business in these goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what he called the refusal of goods except in association.  Apparently the Minister has complaints of and accepts these complaints as <Col N="1965" /> evidence that there are certain people who are refused goods unless they are in an association and he finds, with regard to these people, that they were denied membership of an association, membership which was required of them if the goods were to be supplied to them.  He further finds that they could not get the approval of the association to engage in business in these goods.  This practice he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;is said to operate in respect of most building materials, motor-cars and bicycles, newspapers and periodicals, paper bags and wrapping paper, electrical goods and many other goods of perhaps lesser importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course this is all hearsay: it is said to operate.  I do not know what the purpose was of putting these things to us except to establish that in the Minister's view, these practices were current and were inimical to the public interest and widespread over these particular trades.</P>
    <P>The second practice was what is called exclusive dealing arrangements; that is to say, the supply of goods to a trader on condition that he does not stock similar goods supplied by a competitor.  That is inimical, in the Minister's view, to the public welfare.</P>
    <P>The third practice in relation to which there is a volume of complaint is the &ldquo;unreasonable limitation of wholesale channels so as to give a virtual monopoly in the supply of some goods to a limited number of firms.&rdquo; At column 816 he refers to the fact that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...there is the practice of excluding new entrants from a trade either by over action, point-blank refusal of supplies, or by imposing onerous conditions either as to dimensions or trader's premises, the technical qualifications which he should possess or the staffs that he should employ.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are all practices which, in the Minister's phrase, are inimical to the public welfare.  These are all practices that could easily be put into a formula attached to this Bill and declared to be illegal straightaway with certain necessary reservations and conditions.</P>
    <P>The last of these practices to which the Minister referred is the practice <Col N="1966" /> that is known as &ldquo;resale price maintenance arrangements.&rdquo;  That is a practice that has been very definitely considered elsewhere.  In fact it came to the point where the Labour Government in Britain in 1951 decided to make resale price maintenance arrangements illegal.  They produced a White Paper in which they set out the phrases by means of which they proposed to describe the offences.  I do not know whether the present Government in England has accepted that proposal but the Labour Government in 1951 issued a White Paper in which they announced their intention of making resale prices maintenance arrangements illegal and they added the phrases in which the offence was to be described.</P>
    <P>At column 818 the Minister says that he wants to smash trade rings&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;and I use that term in the sense in which the average man understands it&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the sense, according to the Minister, in which the average man understands it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...a combination of traders designed to confine trade to themselves, to eliminate competition between themselves and to exploit that position to their own benefit and the public detriment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, and I think the phrase can be tied up with what has gone before, at column 820 another type of phrase is used:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a trade association takes power to exclude any citizen from any trade, or imposes restrictions which have the effect of excluding any citizen from any trade, then no matter what justification there may be for that course, and no matter what arguments can be advanced by the association in defence of these restrictions, that association is taking to itself functions which properly belong to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I add in conclusion of that that if the Minister had completed that properly he would have gone on to say: &ldquo;and should be declared illegal and an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At the same column, 820, the Minister said that he was asking:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1967" />&ldquo;... the Dáil to accept the contention that agreements or combinations or conspiracies between producers and traders to monopolise a particular form of commerce, or to fix or maintain prices for any class of goods, because they involve the power to control a market, is clearly inimical to the public good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that being said, if these malpractices are widespread they must have a considerable effect in increasing the cost of living and therefore considerable benefit would be done if a direct attack were made upon them, a benefit likely to produce immediate or almost immediate results.</P>
    <P>What is proposed?  There are points in this legislation with which I disagree, particularly in the main part of it, in so far as machinery is concerned. The Minister proposes to establish a commission.  That commission will make its report to the Minister.  The Minister may make an Order.  He may bring that Order before the House. That Order must be debated here as a new piece of legislation and eventually &mdash;how long will the &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; last? Perhaps a couple of years&mdash;we may get some of these practices declared illegal, and some good may result from that declaration.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister now of his third thought in connection with this matter.  This is the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, 1952.  In 1947 we had the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill.  That was never introduced actually, but it did get to the length of a White Paper, as we discovered when we were in office.  There was a piece of proposed legislation called the Emergency Powers (Unlawful Profits) Bill, 1945.  I quoted from the memorandum that accompanied that in the Seanad in 1950, and the point I quoted there was that the Minister, when presenting this piece of legislation to his Cabinet, said that the necessity for the Bill arose from the trouble in enforcing proper price control.  An attempt was being made to establish a reasonable level of price and prevent excessive profit-taking.  The Minister at the time said there were defaulters, <Col N="1968" /> and he demanded, as Minister for Supplies in those days, the fullest discretion to deal with these people.  He said he was aiming only at cases of gross profiteering where the sums involved were substantial.  He said that, apart altogether from the fact that there was gross profiteering, in which the sums involved were substantial, bad example was given by these people who, so to speak, got away with their unlawful profits, and who were thereby a danger to the community because, if they were successful in their operations, that might induce others to follow along the same lines.</P>
    <P>In connection with that Bill, the Minister indicated that he did not want any recourse to court proceedings.  He said delays were inevitable in connection with such proceedings and the deterrent effect of the measure he proposed would, in consequence, be very much lessened.  The idea of that legislation in 1947 was to set up a tribunal.  That tribunal would examine and the Minister would make a finding with regard to the particular rate of profit, either gross or other profit, as to whether it was or was not unreasonable. Certain operations then followed. When the report was made the Minister made up his mind.  There was to be a complete keeping away from the courts.  The Minister himself would get after these people in connection with their unreasonable profits.</P>
    <P>As far as I remember, he could appoint a receiver in the business and run the business in which he thought there was an unreasonable profit taken out of the community until such time as he could hand back the profits made.  There was to be a tribunal, and it is interesting to compare the body envisaged in 1947 with what is envisaged in 1952.  The chief point distinguishing the 1947 Act from the present Bill is that, in 1947, before the British moved in the matter and before there was any evidence as to what the British conditions were, and before there was an accumulation of facts through the investigations of the Monopolies Commission over there, and before ever this volume of complaint had come to the Minister as to the restrictive practices that were <Col N="1969" /> growing up and becoming rather prevalent here, there was no nonsense about a commission to inquire into these practices.  The proposed Section 39 in that piece of legislation was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No body or person shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  regulate or attempt to regulate the minimum price for a commodity or service, or</P>
    <P>(b)  restrict or attempt to restrict trade in a commodity or service to particular persons unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall come to the &ldquo;unless&rdquo; in a moment.  At that time there was nothing like the evidence that has apparently been collected since and nothing like the same abuses had developed as we are now led to believe have developed since.  At that time a regulation or an attempt to regulate the minimum price or an attempt to restrict trade in a commodity or service to a particular person was to be made an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 41 of the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Act, 1947, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any body of persons contravenes, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Part, the members of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the body and such of its officers as consent to or facilitate such contravention shall each be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was an offence that was going to be prosecuted by the Attorney-General. There was no question of a private investigation.  There were reservations.  Section 39 dealt with the restriction on regulation of minimum prices and charges and restriction of trade.  Section 40 (1) which dealt with authorised arrangements, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A recognised trade association may submit to the commission a draft of a proposed arrangement (in this section referred to as the arrangement) for the regulation by the association of a minimum price or for the restriction by the association of trading in a commodity or service to particular persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> Section 39 stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No body of persons shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  regulate or attempt to regulate the minimum price for a commodity or a service, or</P>
    <P>(b)  restrict or attempt to restrict trade in a commodity or service to particular persons,</P>
    <P>unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it is a recognised trade association, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  it acts in accordance with an arrangement approved by the Minister by Order under Section 40 for the time being in force and in accordance with such conditions as may be specified in any such Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have quoted from Section 40.  I thought it was a good proposal but I felt it was weak and I proposed to modify it.  I wanted equal law for everybody.  I wanted to have it that it was an offence to do these things unless it were for &ldquo;the regulation by the association of a minimum price or for the restriction by the association of trading in a commodity or service to particular persons&rdquo; and was in accordance with an arrangement approved by the Minister.  If the Minister had any such arrangement he had to give public notice of it, the reasons for it and indicate the people to whom the arrangement applied.  That was the 1947 idea&mdash;to declare these things offences, to let them be prosecuted and to have fines for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister puts himself forward as a person who has learned a great deal more since.  He puts himself forward as a person who has got much more information as to the prevalence of these practices, their greater effect upon the community and their greater evil.  Having got the greater evidence, we have retreated from the idea that the practices will be made illegal.  We say that we will give them to a commission to examine and to report to the Minister on them.</P>
    <P>To be contrasted, also, are the details as to the establishment of a commission. The commission is dealt with in Part II of the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, 1947, which starts at Section 13.  Section 13 provides: &ldquo;There shall be a body to be known <Col N="1971" /> as the Prices Commission.&rdquo; Section 14 (1) provides: &ldquo;The permanent members of the commission shall consist of a chairman and two other members and they shall be appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;  Sub-section (3) of the same section provides: &ldquo;The Minister may also appoint temporary members for the purpose of a particular inquiry.&rdquo; Then you come to the matter of the tenure of office.  Section 15 (1) provided: &ldquo;The term of office of a permanent member shall be fixed by the Minister when appointing him and shall not exceed five years.&rdquo;  Sub-section (4) of the same section provides: &ldquo;The Minister may remove a temporary member from office.&rdquo;  Then there followed the usual provisions about bankruptcy, and so forth.  The situation under this was that three permanent members would be appointed for some fixed term at the time of appointment and that they would not be removable from office until the term had lapsed.  Temporary people could be removed but permanent people could not.  I am referring to that now because I want to come back to it again later.</P>
    <P>The situation, in any event, is that at a time when there were not as many complaints we had a direct attack upon the malpractice.  We now have the idea of what may be a long and continued investigation by a commission whose duty it will be to report to the Minister, who may make Orders which will make certain practices allegal.  The growth of these trade associations since the war has been enormous.  The war made trade associations into rather compact bodies.  The whole idea in England during the war was to get supplies&mdash; to get them more or less by any means. The price was not so much the trouble. The trade associations got together and realised their powers.  They put up the case of the great benefit they were giving to the community, that they had provided funds for such things as research, commercial intelligence and so forth.  These thing were examined by certain people.  I have an article here which was printed in <i>The Times</i> of 16th June, 1944.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The consumer interest is most <Col N="1972" /> closely affected by the exercise of the third function of associations&mdash; namely, commercial regulation. Probably no one knows, and none but a much-needed official inquiry could elicit, the extent to which associations do temper the competitive process.  Yet there is no doubt that many of them do in various degress formally regulate prices; that once the habit of co-operation has been induced informal price agreements sometimes follow; that certain retail associations do combine with manufacturers to maintain retail prices and fix distributors' margins; and that the allocation of quotas of output among members of associations is by no means unknown. Associations may in fact promote not only constructive co-operation, but also high prices and restricted output.  Price regulation is not without its advocates who profess that joint price regulation serves to stabilise prices and employment, and to provide the funds necessary for industrial research and high wages. It is, however, clear that these claims cannot be accepted without question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, the trade association, which has to satisfy all its members, tends to fix a price which will provide an umbrella to protect the inefficient units in the trade, leaving a differential profit to the low cost units.  It is true that, in this situation, the more efficient firms will often be eager to expand and so may break the bonds which limit their output.  It is also true that there are such checks as foreign competition, the availability of substitute products and, if profits are high, a queue of potential new producers.  But the tendency remains for prices to be fixed above competitive levels, and, as a result, for the teeth to be taken out of the sanctions against inefficiency.  The trust or combine is in an even stronger position to charge excessive prices than the association.  But at least it is able and usually willing to close down its least efficient units.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article then goes on to deal with <Col N="1973" /> the control of distributors' trading margins.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The control of distributors' trading margins by retail trade associations, acting in concert with manufacturers, raises yet another problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the article deals with price rings. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The chief difficulty is how to deal with price rings, retail price maintenance, and output quotas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the mischiefs seen in England in 1944.  We were not, apparently, aware of them here. Nevertheless, when the volume of complaint grew and when it has, apparently, been accepted that it is evidence that these practices exist and that, clearly, they are inimical to the public welfare, all we can do is to say that we will have a commission which will inquire into the matter and report to the Minister, who may make Orders which may be incorporated in legislation.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the machinery in this Bill which, to my mind, is objectionable. I come first to the formation of the commission itself, which is set out in the Schedule.  I should like Deputies to contrast its formation with what I have quoted from the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, 1947, in regard to the members.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Schedule states that the term of office of a permanent member shall be fixed by the Minister when appointing him and shall not exceed five years.  Sub-section (1) of Section 4 states that the Minister may remove a member from office.  That is to say, that this is completely a creature of the Minister: at every point it is to be under his control. There is no permanency for any time established in regard to the commission. There is not time to operate. A member is not strengthened by the knowledge that he is free from such control as a removal for a certain number of years.  He may be removed within six months of his appointment. In other words, if he happens to find one way and does not find another, the Minister may come down upon him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> That makes the whole of this commission completely suspect.  It will be nothing in the nature of a judicial inquiry. It will possess none of the attributes of an independent judge.  I do not know what the personnel of this commission is going to be, but any member of the commission has all the time hanging over him the fear that unless he knows what the departmental mind is and acts accordingly, he can be faced with dismissal immediately. There is no question of any reason being assigned for it.  He can be dismissed without cause shown, even if he has a stated term of office.</P>
    <P>Why that very substantial change should be made from the proposal in the 1947 legislation where the members were safeguarded against dismissal of that kind I do not know.  To my mind, all that makes this commission suspect and it deprives it completely of any good.</P>
    <P>Even if a proper commission were to be appointed, then I still have an objection to the machinery to be established. The commission has got to keep under review the operation of the fair trading rules which they make. That may or may not be any great harm but it may not be any great advantage.  The commission, under Section 5, are to keep under review the operation of fair trading rules and if the rules are not being observed they are to report accordingly to the Minister. What will happen upon that report, the Bill does not go on to say. That report need not necessarily see the light of day.  It has not to be laid before the House.  The commission under Section 6 are entitled to cause inquiries to be held on their own initiative or they may have to do so at the request of the Minister, into the conditions which obtain in regard to supply and distribution of any kind of goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello raised the point whether &ldquo;supply&rdquo; covers manufacturers. I hope it does.  I hope that the operative word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; covers all transactions from the manufacturer to the wholesaler and from the wholesaler to the retailer and that &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; covers the retail end of it. I do not see why the progress of a commodity from the manufacturers <Col N="1975" /> direct to the retailer or from a manufacturer through a wholesaler to the retailer should not be brought under the term &ldquo;supply&rdquo; and I assume that it will be so brought.</P>
    <P>Eventually after the commission report, and make certain recommendations, if they are of opinion that the Minister should make an Order under Section 8, they shall in their report recommend accordingly and indicate the form of the Order that they recommend. That will come before the House or the Minister may lay a copy of the report before the House.  But the Minister need not bring the whole of the report or the whole of the recommendation before the House.  I suppose that can be amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister having considered the report of the commission may, under Section 8, by Order amongst other things, prohibit specified arrangements or agreements.  That I think again is a matter that we should directly approach ourselves and deal with by legislation.  Then there are additions to what the Minister can do by Order whether the commission reports for or against them, and without further reference to the commission.  There is a confused trail as between what the commission may do and what the Minister may appropriate to himself or what the Minister cares to tell them to do but the additions which the Minister may make are purely a matter for himself.  That I think is entirely wrong.  Whenever there is a recommendation from the commission, followed by an Order from the Minister, then we should get the full reports so that we can know what are the additions the Minister is making of his own and what it is the commission is recommending.</P>
    <P>Let me compare this scheme with that of the British Monopolies Commission. It is more or less the same line of country.  That commission was set up in 1948 and they have produced four reports since then.  They produced a report on dental goods, they produced a report on the electrical lamp industry, they reported on insulated wire cables and reported on rainwater goods which, I think, is the technical <Col N="1976" /> term.  In addition there was a report made about resale price maintenance. That did not come from this particular commission but from a committee known as the Resale Price Maintenance Committee.  It was in the course of a discussion on that that the then President of the Board of Trade, Sir Hartley Shawcross, later Attorney-General, said that the commission's machinery had proved much too slow and that with the present rate of progress, it might take 15 years to get a report on any of the 55 subjects that had been suggested for reference to it.</P>
    <P>We have that example before us&mdash;the fact that in four years only four reports were received from the British commission and the fact that the President of the Board of Trade stated that it would take 15 years to get another report on any of the articles referred to it.  We are, neverthless, going to follow along the same lines.  I want to know why we should not tackle these abuses along the lines proposed in the 1947 Bill.  There certain practices were declared to be offences with regard to price regulation and trade restriction. It was laid down that &ldquo;no body of persons shall regulate or attempt to regulate a minimum price for a commodity of service.&rdquo;  What is the objection to declaring here and now that price-fixing by a combination of persons is illegal?</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this in his speech, and Deputy Declan Costello referred to part of his speech which sounds hollow, that is the part of it that occurs in columns 822-23 of the Official Report of the Debates.  At the bottom of column 822, the Minister is reported as saying that &ldquo;the Associated Chambers of Commerce, in the course of their discussion with me, indicated that they would prefer a Bill which schedules and makes illegal clearly defined practices, leaving the enforcement of that legislation to the courts.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's statement of what the Associated Chambers of Commerce represented to him.  His own statement, starting at the bottom of column 822 and continuing into 823, is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All the possible alternative methods of tackling this problem were considered before the present Bill was approved.  No doubt it <Col N="1977" /> would be possible to legislate a general prohibition of unfair competition, of restrictive practices, of resale price agreements and leave it to the courts to decide whether a particular action was contrary to law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the course recommended by the Chamber of Commerce would not provide a much more satisfactory means of redress than existed at the moment because somebody had apparently told the Minister that certain contracts which are restrictive of trade are held to be contrary to the public interest and the only thing that happens is that the courts will not enforce them.  Was there not the same provision in the 1947 legislation?  The 1947 Bill proposed to make these practices an offence, and if a person were brought before the courts charged with this offence the courts would not stop to inquire whether it was contrary to the public interest, but they would say: &ldquo;It is an offence,&rdquo; and they would look for the penalty clauses.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction under that Bill was £500 and £5,000 in the case of an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister passed very lightly from this aspect of the matter to deal with other points.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The lawfulness of any practice could only be determined by litigation, and only when some aggrieved citizen decided to put himself to the hazard of litigation in order to assert his rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he said that such proceedings would be long and costly, and the knowledge that it would be long and costly might easily deter many traders from asserting their rights.  &ldquo;The more powerful the interest involved,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in maintaining restrictive trade practices and the more profitable those restrictions were, the more certain it would be that the person who initiated litigation under such a law to secure his rights would be harassed by every legal device.  A verdict in his favour would be appealed from court to court, and even if, when all legal processes had been exhausted, the individual secures a verdict, the <Col N="1978" /> law would be settled only in his particular case.&rdquo;  That is entirely wrong, as the Minister must realise.  It is the Attorney-General who prosecutes if a certain practice is declared to be an offence in general terms, and the individual who lays the information hazards nothing.  The Attorney-General prosecutes, and the private litigant has nothing to lose by it.  The private litigant lays the information against the individual who seems to be guilty of an illegal practice.  That would be investigated.  Once the evidence is collected, and the matter declared to be an offence as was intended in 1947, then there is a prosecution, and there is none of this going from court to court.  It would be a question of declaring what the law was in a particular case.  A prosecution would be taken against certain individuals.  They would be fined and the law clarified by that decision. That would apply to every other person who offended against the law.</P>
    <P>There was more talk in columns 823 and 824 about the great ingenuity that would be displayed by traders in trying to get around certain practices. Suppose the commission reports, say, against a resale price maintenance. Is the Minister going to throw up his hands because people will be ingenious enough to find a way out?  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility to get a formula to cover that?  If it is thought desirable to move from the area of the civil law to that of the criminal law, the only thing is that the criminal law ought to be declared under pretty definite general rules. Then let the Attorney-General prosecute all and sundry who have committed an offence.  I shall endeavour, by amendment, to reinstate the 1947 proposal in this legislation and to say that, within that reservation, there might be an arrangement made, even a price-fixing arrangement, that might be regarded as something to be tolerated in certain special circumstances, but that the public ought to be warned about these special circumstances.  That reservation ought to be approved by the Minister, who would then have to bear responsibility for having given approval to the arrangement.  The reasons for doing so ought to be made public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> In England, they have come to the conclusion that resale price maintenance is bad.  It was so bad that in June, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade said the Government had decided to give effect to the recommendation of the Committee on Resale Price Maintenance, which was that the collective enforcement of the practice of resale price maintenance should be made illegal.  The Government promised a White Paper on the matter.  It was published on June 19th.</P>
    <P>In case it might be thought that there would be any difficulty in getting a formula here, we have the formula explained in that White Paper, and the legislation which the Government proposed.  The White Paper explains that the legislation which the Government proposed to introduce would (1) make it unlawful to &ldquo;operate or take part in the operation of collective measures designed to ensure that goods shall be sold at or above specified retail prices&rdquo; and (2) forbid manufacturers to &ldquo;indicate, recommend or prescribe&rdquo; any prices except maximum prices for the resale of their goods; and, finally, make it unlawful to &ldquo;give any indication of the resale price unless it is clearly stated that the price indicated is a maximum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes resale price as one of the things which he regards as inimical to the public welfare.  Why hesitate to declare it illegal and make it an offence?  The 1947 Act wanted to make it an offence to regulate, or attempt to regulate, a minimum price for commodities or services, or to restrict or attempt to restrict trade in a particular commodity or service except there was an arrangement of a particular type.  If the Minister were to declare that illegal, he would, I suggest, be giving the public some confidence in the measure.  At the moment all they can see is great delay, a good deal of vexatious supervision and a good deal of costly administration with no great result.  I suggest that he would be giving an earnest of his <i>bona fides</i> by letting the public believe that something was intended in regard to restrictive practices.  There have been <Col N="1980" /> certain restrictive practices.  If it is found that we ought to declare these illegal, I do not see why we should not do it.  If they operate in a harmful way, why not declare them illegal before this legislation leaves the House, and leave it afterwards to the Attorney-General to prosecute in the public courts of the country?</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  The courts have found themselves hampered in their dealing, in the way in which I think the public would like, with restrictive practices by the law as laid down in certain decided cases. There was a particular case which excited a good deal of attention in the early part of this year.  It was the case of Connolly against Loughney and McCarthy, and was tried before Mr. Justice Dixon.  Judgment was delivered on June 13, 1952.  The points which came before the judge drew certain observations from him.  He said the law could be stated in two propositions. The first was &ldquo;a combination of two or more persons wilfully to injure a man in his trade is unlawful and, if it results in damage to him, is actionable&rdquo;.  The second proposition was that &ldquo;if the real purpose of the combination is, not to injure another, but to forward or defend the trade of those who enter into it, then no wrong is committed and no action will lie, although damage to another ensues&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the fortification for certain types of restrictive practices which are known to be in operation in the country. A trade combination which to-day deals with people in that way knows that if it goes to court it can rely on these propositions.  There is some argument about the phrase &ldquo;the real purpose of the combination&rdquo;.  Traders tell me they would not object to the courts being given freedom to decide cases if they were protected by that phrase.  Others have suggested that a formula might be found to prevent the court considering itself bound by those cases so that it would be free to decide whether such a practice was a practice that did damage and injury to a man in his trade.  Of course, there would be other difficulties where the public interest would come in.  I imagine traders would rather have that than this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> It should not be beyond the powers of draftsmanship to get a formula which would mean that in deciding cases of actionable wrong, say, wilful injury caused to a man in his trade, that it should not be a defence to be relied upon that the predominant, the real, motive of the combination was to forward or defend the trade of those who entered into the combination.  If that were so, then people like Mr. Connolly would face litigation almost with the certainty that they were going to be beaten.  He must have been well advised, on the trilogy of cases against him, that he could not succeed in this action.  Nevertheless, he decided to disclose what were the methods by which this organisation was acting.  Incidentally, I do not think that that organisation would object to the proposal which I am making, because I believe they have the view that even if that defence were not in their favour, the judge nevertheless on the merits of the case would be forced to decide in their favour. That is a matter which could then be litigated in the courts.  I suggest that we should remove that difficulty.</P>
    <P>Let us in this legislation say that in cases of a type where injury is done to a man in his trade resulting in damage that that shall be no defence. Then you will give two avenues of approach.  You make certain restrictions illegal and the Attorney-General can prosecute if the thing goes far enough.  It is definitely inside the terms of the offences to be created by the Bill.  If it is not so bad, a private person would have his rights, although, of course, he would face a pretty expensive course of litigation. But you do make this piece of legislation real.  On the one hand, you get the criminal side of the courts going and the Attorney-General prosecuting for offences.  On the other hand, you make it easier for a person to attack trade combinations which injure his business.  They will have to justify their activity and they will not be allowed to justify it on this old matter, that the real purpose of the combination was the futherance or defence of the trade of those combining.  We should try to get a formula and put it in so that we will have this piece of <Col N="1982" /> legislation with something in it to deal with these practices in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I am at a loss if I take the things that were objected to in England before the Monopolies Commission was set up.  There is a good deal of repetition about the phrases used.  There was one speech made referring to a variety of malpractices. This speaker said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A substantial fraction of British industry in the period between the two wars was in a calamitous&mdash;a fatal &mdash;state.  It was comfortably dying on its feet and carrying with it into unemployment and decay a growing part of the creative energies of the nation as a whole.  For with the decline of industry there went a decline of real enterprise, of thinking, planning, invention&mdash;a decline in boldness and the spirit of adventure&mdash;a decline in the level of politics, home and foreign, that nearly brought us to destruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The legislation was first thought of by the Conservative group.  It was then taken up by the Labour people and was eventually introduced by a Labour Government and then carried on by the Conservative Government.  One of the Conservatives said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The greatest danger of monopoly lies in the direction of inertia and inefficiency rather than profiteering; but restrictions to protect inefficiency are not by their nature more virtuous or less destructive to social well-being than those designed to exact high prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amongst the matters thought to be destructive of well-being were those that made for high prices or were put forward merely to protect inertia or inefficiency.  They speak of practices of an obviously anti-social character like boycotts, deferred rebates, and stop lists.  Later, another group was given by another speaker such as exclusive dealing arrangements, restricted entry into industry or trade Finally, there were other things which more directly pertained to monopolies and are not the subject of consideration here.</P>
    <P>I would not profess to be able to find a formula immediately, but surely it is possible to find one.  The Minister refers to things of the boycott type, stop lists, exclusive dealing arrangements <Col N="1983" /> and restricted entry into business. These are clearly anti-social, and the Minister said he did not believe there was any justification for them. Why should they not be declared illegal?  I personally could prepare amendments which would make this Bill meet the price resale maintenance and the matter that I dealt with with regard to the civil courts taking away this line of defence, that the predominant aim was the good of society and not to do harm, and even if harm occurred it was incidental.</P>
    <P>Journal after journal, such as the <i>Economist,</i> the London <i>Times</i> and the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and speakers from both sides, Conservative and Labour, dealt with this.  I pick out these things which have been characterised as being alien to the idea of industrial efficiency and enterprise. They spoke of things leading to decay. Some of them are described, such as boycott, stop lists, exclusive dealing, restricted entry into trade.  Finding a formula for these things would not cost a draftsman very much time.  What is the objection in principle to making these illegal in the sense of being made an offence, always reserving the possibility of an arrangement sanctioned by the Minister who will then take the responsibility for that arrangement? Why not make them illegal practices, and let the Attorney-General prosecute, and let us get something in the nature of reality brought into what is only a bit of shadow boxing and pretence?</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I should like such a body as the Industrial Development Authority to examine certain evil practices.  I do not know that you can declare them illegal at the moment, but there is room for examination.  I want to avoid any costly administration by a new authority.  The Vocational Organisation Commission in their report called attention to certain things which they described as evils.  They spoke of the capitalisation of licences and tariffs.  They spoke of occasions when Government assistance had been described as goodwill and capitalised at a very high figure.  They drew particular attention to the prospectus sent out by Ranks (Ireland) Limited, <Col N="1984" /> in which they made a special feature of the fact that they had milling licences, and that these were transferable. They drew attention to the fact that Government aid in different ways was being capitalised by certain people, who came into industry here, and the capitalisation was very heavy.</P>
    <P>There is the case referred to of a building which was on the market for sale at a very low price and which was bought by one firm which would benefit very largely under the legislation with regard to packing certain goods here.  That building probably changed hands at quite a low figure.  Having done that, a new value was set up because a protected business was to be carried on in this ancient building. That building was then put at a very high value and written up as if it had changed hands at a very high figure and the goodwill arising from Government assistance in regard to the packing business was written up at a very high figure.  The dividends had to be declared on that capital, a wholly fictitious capital, and the prices that were charged had to be such as would give a dividend of a reasonable type&mdash;on capital that did not exist.  Those are restrictive practices that certainly affect the cost of living as much as a great many of the other things referred to by the Minister.  Those things should be examined.  If they could be examined by the authority we have in existence at the moment instead of by a new authority set up for the purpose we would save money and get as good results as would be got by the other authority, the members of which we do not know but who will be subject to immediate dismissal even as far as the chairman and the permanent members are concerned.</P>
    <P>When we were the Government the question arose of the milling millers and their malpractices in the country. We found that certain things were being allowed to them, that they got a certain allowance for depreciation of capital and that they were allowed to throw in at the last moment certain sums of money as if it were capital. We got the report which the body of which Mr. Justice Lavery was chairman <Col N="1985" /> produced for us and we investigated the matter so as to get those malpractices stopped.  I do not think that that is being examined any longer even though that report was in existence which exposed a good deal of malpractice leading definitely to an unauthorised charge for foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I come back to a point I made incidentally. I am against temporary commissions.  That is why I would prefer to declare that certain things were illegal, make them matters of defence in civil actions and let the courts work.  On principle, as I have always stated and state again, I stand always for the reign of law, for the system of free and open courts with public inquiries for each case, for the system of the independent judiciary with equal justice openly administered to every person.  That is a thing which has come down to us in these years as the fruit of many, many centuries of agitation, controversy and even revolution.  The system of free and open courts was a great system and I doubt if it is possible to better it.  It may be said, with regard to this particular matter, that you need not merely independence and impartiality but an understanding of a particular problem, but balance, impartiality, independence and the understanding which our judges cannot be said to lack in commercial matters against the type of commission which is contemplated here with every member at the disposal of the Minister, appointed by him, with emoluments changeable at any time, up or down, the power to dismiss any one of the members lying in the Minister's hands.  I wonder would such a commission be better than judges who are declared independent, who are put in a position which renders them independent through the emoluments they get and the tenure they get, who are asked by the Constitution to decide matters openly except on the very rare occasions when the Constitution allows them to hear cases <i>in camera.</i>  Is that system not better than an <i>ad hoc</i> commission with every member subject to dismissal and under control in every inquiry that commission are asked to make?  Those are the reasons why I have such a favourable view of the <Col N="1986" /> court system, certainly a view that must be favourable to the court in opposition to what is presented to us here as the alternative.  I am all the time alert to this.  Certain things should be made offences and let the courts work.  Let the individual take action in a civil matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne is in favour of the measure.  He spoke of it as the third and possibly the last chance which private enterprise is going to get in this country.  He is the man who stood&mdash;even though he tried to get away from it&mdash;for socialised medicine in this country.  We had correspondence over the summer about certain views he expressed when he questioned whether farmers' land was their private property or was held by them as tenants of the State.  Notwithstanding, he recommends this as the third and possibly the last chance which private enterprise will get in this country.  Of course, it is nothing like that.  Private enterprise will go on when Deputy Dr. Browne's Bill has been forgotten in the country.  The best way to reinstate private enterprise and to back private enterprise up is not by backstairs methods, by secret inquiries, or by reports which will come to this House which are not the full results of inquiries by the commission. We do not know what may be hidden from us or what may be revealed in those reports.  Surely the freedom of the courts is the best atmosphere to blow on this matter.  We should declare certain things illegal and make them offences.  If we have not enough information to do that for every malpractice we should declare that x, y and z are illegal and deal with the rest later.  That would give the private litigant a better chance, and if we have obstructions at the moment we should clear them away. If you do that you will have a means of action which is not present at the moment, and you will have a chance of doing something effective and immediate to stop practices which we have got to accept are prevalent and very objectionable at the moment.</P>

      <P>The speech made by Deputy McGilligan is one which was not only constructive and able but which put forward concrete proposals and criticisms which should commend themselves to the Minister.  I should also like to pay a tribute to the speech made by Deputy Norton the other day on this Bill, which was a valuable contribution from the Labour point of view with regard to restrictive practices.  I feel that so many things have been said by Deputies Norton and McGilligan with which I agreed that there is very little left for me to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of restrictive practices with which I would like to deal, that is, those restrictive practices which have grown up largely as a result of Government control in one form or another.  In referring to Government control I am not doing so in any critical sense.  Probably Government control, when it was originally set up, was necessary, but as a result of these controls a number of pernicious practices have arisen which are now a blister on the ordinary public, a blister on the consuming public principally.  Deputy McGilligan referred, for instance, to the millers.  Milling and the manufacture of bread have been strictly Government controlled and supervised over a number of years.  Probably it was necessary at the outset, but the position has been reached where anybody familiar with the working of the milling trade must be appalled at the way in which the consuming public is being exploited by a monopoly and a very close ring.  There are, I think, no less than five different associations of millers to which, I think, all millers belong, each with a separate and distinct function in the milling trade.  I think that it would not be an exaggeration to say that each of these bodies has been created for the purpose of imposing restrictive practices.  There is the Irish Flour Millers' Association; there is the Irish Flour Millers' Union; there is the Flour Millers' Irish Wheat <Col N="1988" /> Association; there is the Millers' Control Committee, and there is, finally, the Flour Millers' Quota Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few more, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be but it seems that five should be enough to ensure that the millers would be able to maintain their completely closed ring for themselves in which they exercise an absolute monopoly. It may surprise Deputies in the House to know that one of the functions of the Millers' Quota Association is to ensure that certain millers do not produce to capacity.  Production costs in different mills vary very considerably. In some mills local production costs amount to 5/- per sack of flour produced, whereas in other mills they amount to over 19/- per sack.  The costings are partially based on the higher cost of production.  It may surprise Deputies to learn also that the millers collect 6d. per sack of flour towards the payment of the directors' fees and that that levy amounts to something like £75,000 a year.</P>
      <P>I should mention, too, that it is not the smallest mills that are the most inefficient.  It is not always the smallest mills that have the highest production costs; nor is it indeed the country mills.  Some of the higher production costs are often in the larger mills.  While there are, I think, something like over 30 mills in the country, it may be said that the whole milling industry is controlled by two main firms.  Two-thirds of the milling industry is run by two main companies, either through shareholders or directors. One of these, which controls one-third of the milling output of the country, is a company which was registered before the enactment of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, and is practically in the ownership of an English milling company through shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Millers' Quota Association impose fines, I think, at the rate of 8/- per sack on millers who produce more than a certain output of flour and pay a subsidy to other millers who produce less than a certain amount of flour.  It is very hard to conceive of <Col N="1989" /> any more restrictive or monopolistic trade than the milling trade.  They have achieved a complete monopoly. They have achieved, by conspiracy amongst themselves, an absolute monopoly under the wing of Government control.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister envisages referring this particular industry to the proposed commission set up under the Bill.  I mention the matter because there has been no reference to it so far.  It is probably the outstanding example of the type of practice that should be made illegal and made illegal in the sense in which Deputy McGilligan referred to the question of illegality.  I think, too, that a case can be made for investigation of the relationship that exists between some of the milling firms and some of the larger bakery firms.  There are practices there that need careful investigation.</P>
    <P>The other day Deputy Norton drew the attention of the Minister to the position in the timber trade.  I have heard a great many rumours recently as to the high rates of profit that are being obtained as a result of the ring established in the timber trade in Dublin.  This is a matter which should be examined even before this Bill becomes law and I hope the Minister will have the matter investigated rapidly, because the high prices that are being obtained for timber at the moment are unjustified and definitely add to the cost of public housing.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider now referring the fuel rings that exist in the country, and particularly in Dublin, for investigation to the commission. The Minister probably saw some time ago a statement made by the City Manager or Assistant City Manager in the City of Dublin in regard to the supply of coal to Grangegorman Mental Hospital, that tenders had been invited, and that each one of the firms tendering had submitted exactly the same price which, in the view of the Assistant City Manager, was the price dictated by the ring of fuel merchants in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is also a case for investigating the restrictive practices in force by the banks.  The banks also exercise a virtual <Col N="1990" /> monopoly in the country, a monopoly in regard to the issue of credit and in regard to the banking business. They enjoy this under the protection of the laws of the State.  They exercise complete control over the issue of credit.  They do not encourage competition of any kind.  Apparently among themselves they determine the terms on which they will do business, and in that way succeed in having things more or less their own way.  A strong case can be made for an investigation of the circumstances in which banking operates here, particularly in regard to the issue of credit.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister will not accept that suggestion lightly, but I would urge upon him the importance of ensuring that the position of the millers, the position of timber merchants, and the position of fuel merchants, will all be among the first matters to be examined by this commission.  I hope the Minister, in replying, will give some indication of his willingness to refer these particular matters to the proposed commission.</P>
    <P>I agree with practically everything Deputy McGilligan said in regard to the proposed commission.  I would appeal to the Minister to examine the criticism made by Deputy McGilligan in an objective way.  It would be much better if the commission was a permanent body completely independent of Government control.  I am sure that the Minister must appreciate that from time to time every political Party and every member of this House is subject to pressure by one commercial group or another, who either want a concession or want to have some protection.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that it would be much better if the appointment of a commission of this nature was not made subject to political considerations.  There is always a danger when a body of this kind is set up, where the members of it are not permanently established or depend on the goodwill of the Minister or the Executive, that political considerations may affect their views. It would be much better from a long term point of view if this commission were quite independent of any Government control and were composed of <Col N="1991" /> members of the judiciary or, if the Minister does not think that members of the judiciary are capable of undertaking this work, composed of other persons who should be placed in a position of complete independence in the same way as members of the judiciary are placed in a position of independence as regards the Executive.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been levelled at the Bill in regard to the utilisation of the police for investigation of complaints in connection with the subject matter of the Bill.  I do not think there is very much substance in those objections. Somebody has to carry out the investigation.  I would prefer to see the police carrying out the investigation than to see a new body of investigators set up to carry out the investigation. But, if the police are to carry out the investigation, it will be necessary to strengthen the headquarters staff of the police for that purpose.  In any event, in present circumstances, the Garda headquarters staff require the assistance of people trained in accountancy and administrative methods.  I am not saying this as in any way criticism of the headquarters staff; they discharge their duties very well; but, undoubtedly, their work has become much more complex in recent years and if these additional responsibilities are to be thrown on them, if the investigation of highly complex business matters of this kind is to be passed on to the police, it is essential that there should be police officers specially trained for this kind of work and who, in addition to dealing with this kind of work, could deal with analogous work in the criminal field where cases of fraud of one kind or another may necessitate investigation by an accountant or some qualified person.</P>
    <P>The Minister can congratulate himself on the reception given to this Bill by all sides of the House.  The general feeling is that he could go further.  I hope the Minister will consider the various suggestions that have been made in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue. If 50 per cent. of our people realised how they are being exploited <Col N="1992" /> by semi-State organisations, rings and combines, this Bill would have been introduced long ago.  The aim of the Government&mdash;and I am not finding fault with it&mdash;was to establish new industries and to develop industries already operating and, to that end, they imposed quotas and tariffs.  We never objected to protection for Irish industry and will never object as long as it is serving the community.  The method was to assure a market and to induce foreigners and foreign companies to provide a certain amount of capital and plant and expert direction, leaving this country to find the greater part of the capital, the labour and the customers.  That has been the policy of both Governments since 1922. The greatest change took place in 1932, by the imposition of quota restrictions. In the absence of any control whatever, all kinds of people were brought in from different countries to Ireland to establish so-called Irish industries. Capitalism has dug itself in so securely because of the action of the Government over a long number of years in giving freedom to foreign exploiters that it will take the best elements in the community and the most sociallyminded people to dislodge it.</P>
      <P>I could follow what Deputy MacBride states about subsidiary companies.  I know a group of individuals who are recognised by the Minister and who have been appointed to some of his semi-State organisations.  I know five subsidiary companies that are owned by the same gentlemen, producing almost the same articles, that the people cannot do without.  It is about time for a very serious review of all these semi-State organisations&mdash;Tea Importers, Fuel Importers, Grain Importers, et cetera.</P>
      <P>The Minister told me on one occasion that these gentlemen are not paid any salary for their work.  Is it not true that they have been doing all their work for the last six or seven years at the expense of the nation?  Some of these semi-State organisations have an overdraft of over £5,000,000 in the bank.  Last year we paid £87,000 interest on one of their overdrafts. Does the Minister seriously suggest that that is a thing that should be allowed to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> Then people talk about the sacredness of private enterprise.  I was rather shocked when Deputy Browne said that this was the last chance for private enterprise.  Let us not deceive ourselves.  This country for some time has been ruled by a group of people whose interests are outside this country and we have no more power over them than we would have if we were dealing with somebody in America.</P>
    <P>In connection with quotas, if to-morrow morning I asked for the names of the gentlemen who are given a quota to import goods, will they be given to me with the names of the concerns?  How is a quota decided? Is all that a secret or is the information available to any member of the House?</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a number of directors of firms in this country who are also directors of firms in England engaged in similar trade.  Are they allowed to purchase their raw materials or semi-manufactured materials from those concerns in England? As a matter of fact, they are probably compelled to do so because of the linkup with the combines in England.</P>
    <P>What inducement is there for them to make the price of the manufactured article here less than the price in England? Every kind of subterfuge is employed.  In some cases directors are appointed that are not required. A large commission payment made and very small profit is shown in the balance sheet.  That is in the interest of the combine in England.</P>
    <P>I await the setting up of this commission. I would like to see an independent body set up, not a body selected by any Party or Government, but an independent body that would search out the truth.  I want to see those inquiries exposed to the glare of publicity as the time has come when we should be the masters in Ireland and not the foreign people.  I know a certain article which is not manufactured here, for which a gentleman in Cork has the sole agency to import it.  If anyone wants to purchase it from England he has to go to the man himself to get a quota.  That is not only a restrictive practice but an illegal practice in my opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin have given our views in this matter and I do not wish to delay the House.  I can assure the Minister that the Bill is welcomed by everyone who counts in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion is that the main interest of the people in restrictive practices is their effect on prices of commodities.  This commission will need to be far more efficient and capable than any commission or board previously established.  We have the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Prices Advisory Body.  I do not think either of them has achieved anything in the way of keeping down prices and we have no guarantee that this new commission will achieve anything either. If the Prices Section of the Department and the Prices Advisory Body have failed I doubt if anything this commission can do will make commodities cheaper to the consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>My opinion of a body will be given when they can point directly to what they have achieved. There is no evidence that either of these bodies has succeeded in pulling down prices for the ordinary people. Many of the restrictive practices which operate to cause increased prices are controlled outside the country.  What power will this commission have over the headquarters of those who organise these restrictive practices?  I agree with Deputy Briscoe, who is perfectly right, that the manufacturers here are in many instances the victims of these practices.  I cannot say that I share the surprise of some speakers who declare that the manufacturers were not at all worried by the introduction of this measure.  I think they should welcome it just as much as the <Col N="1995" /> ordinary consumer in so far as these practices affect the price of raw materials they import.  In our homely way, particularly in regard to the milling industry referred to by Deputy MacBride, they will have a definite power which I sincerely hope they will exercise, but there will be many instances where they can do nothing.</P>
      <P>At any rate, there is no one in the House who is not glad to see an attempt being made in this direction. What will be important, more important than anything else, is the constitution and personnel of that commission. The Minister will need to pray for guidance in regard to the men he is going to put into these positions. There is no use in blinking the fact that they will be men who will be submitted to the greatest possible temptation. There will be big money involved &mdash;big money at the disposal of those who would like a continuance of these restrictive practices.  I would feel sorry if any of these men should fall in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a terrible responsibility for them.  The personnel will need to be something like super men.  When we consider the thousands of pounds which may be affected by their decision, I want to say as emphatically as I can that it is a terrible mistake to have those men what can only be described as political appointees.  They should be permanently placed there, that they will continue in office and operate with independence no matter what Minister or Government comes or goes.  If they are to be there at the whim of a Minister or any Government they will not serve the people or the purpose for which they are put there.  They should be permanent officials, who will always be in a position to act with independence, according to their conscience, and act in justice according to the facts presented before them without fear of repercussions from any Minister.  At least it should not be possible to remove them from office without a vote of this House.  I would not give that power even to the Government, I would leave it to a decision of this House to remove them.  I am sure there is nothing I can say that has not been said already.  I think this <Col N="1996" /> Bill is nonsense.  The most important thing is the personnel of the commission, and I hope that the measure will achieve all the things the Deputies on all sides seem to think it will.  I hope, however, I will be forgiven for my scepticism, and I will rejoice if I am wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of this rather long debate I think that most matters have been mentioned at least a number of times.  The debate has been useful because it has resulted in a very detailed examination of this proposal.  It should be clear now to all Deputies that this is a very ineffective Bill introduced by a very ineffective Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is intended to achieve anything.  I think its purpose is merely to translate the Minister in charge of it from a particular reputation that he enjoyed in the country.  It was brought in for no other purpose. There is no one, on the opposite side of the House, at any rate&mdash;I cannot speak for the Government&mdash;who does not doubt the existence of restrictions in trade.  They do exist.  They have existed for a number of years.  They were first referred to in this House in 1947 by Deputy John Costello.  After he became leader of a Government a very real and detailed examination of the effect and extent of restrictive trade practices was entered upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was inevitable that the results of that investigation would culminate in certain proposals for legislation in this House, but it is regrettable that in the interval the Government should have changed and the sponsors of the Bill should have been the Fianna Fáil Government, and particularly the present Minister, because the present Minister from time to time in the past is the person who criticised Deputy Norton as Tánaiste, Deputy MacBride as Minister and other members of the former Government for suggesting that there was anything wrong at all with our Irish industry or those engaged in Irish industry. I well remember him using the phrase: &ldquo;Wolf, wolf.&rdquo;  This Bill is introduced to put the Minister for Industry and Commerce amongst the pack of wolves. <Col N="1997" /> Nothing else.  Very great care is taken to make sure that the quarry is well away from the pack.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill is an effective measure.  I agree with the purpose behind the Bill and if the Bill had a preamble I am sure that the pious aspirations contained in the preamble would not be objected to by anybody in this House.  We are concerned with legislation not merely for the sake of passing an Act but for the sake of achieving something.  I do not think this Bill will achieve anything.  It certainly is not the Bill that the Fine Gael Party and I am certain the Labour Party or any other Party, if they were a Government, would have introduced.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the wit, capacity and ability of the Minister and his advisers to state in black and white the particular unfair trading practices that should be condemned.  I think that any Bill dealing with restrictive trade practices, should, first of all, declare what it objected to.  I think that should be done not merely in the interests of clarity and law but also in fairness to those against whom the Bill is directed whether they be guilty or innocent.  They have a right to know what practice is wrong.  They have a right to conform to correct practice and a right to see in black and white what the law of this land is. They certainly have a right to object to a group of backroom boys appointed by the Minister laying down their particular regulations with regard to fair trading.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good legislation. I do not think it is just legislation nor do I think that it should be approved of by this House.  I think further that it is giving a justifiable grievance to those who need have no grievance by proper legislation passed here.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill do?  It is clear at the end of this long debate that this is nothing more than passing the buck. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is establishing a commission. That commission may be a good commission or it may be a bad one.  We do not know.  It is not announced at the moment.  When it will be <Col N="1998" /> appointed, it may operate or it may not but fact number one which emerges from the Bill is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not prepared to do his job.</P>
    <P>It is the job of the Minister in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce to supervise the trade and commerce of this country.  That is what he is put there for by the Deputies of this House.  That was his duty.  That is what he is paid for, himself to supervise and to examine the particular principles of trade and commerce in this country.  He is not doing his job if he establishes a commission and says: &ldquo;Now there is a commission to do that I can sit back and take it easy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not his job.  The very first Deputy in this House who would point that out if he were on this side of the House is the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I remember well when the Industrial Development Authority Bill was introduced in the year 1949.  I well remember Deputy Lemass, as he then was, saying: &ldquo;Oh, here is a Bill to establish a commission. Here is a Bill that will satisfy the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  They both love a commission, and it is the Minister passing the buck.&rdquo;  I think it is well the House should remember how zealous Deputy Lemass, as he then was, was at that time in relation to the discharge by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of his duties because he said, when the Industrial Development Authority Bill was before the Dáil, Volume 119, column 1603 of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce was established to do this job.  It is the primary function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His primary function was to do this job.  It continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think that this House should be satisfied to have one of its officers&mdash;that is what the Minister is&mdash;delegate this important function to a body nominated by him with which the Dáil can have no direct relationship.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> I adopt every single word used by the Minister for Industry and Commerce while in opposition.  I think they express succinctly the main objection and opposition to this Bill because here is a clear example of one of the Dáil's servants, a Minister, delegating his responsibility, his obligations and his duties to a commission established by him over whose functions this Dáil will have no control.</P>
    <P>That is the type of practice that the Minister in opposition found so wrong. I think it is a pity to see this very important and very serious matter treated in so cavalier a fashion as it is being treated by the Minister.  Mind you, what he said when the Industrial Development Authority Bill was before the Dáil was not the only occasion on which he objected to the creation and establishment of commissions.</P>
    <P>I remember on the Supplies and Services Bill of 1950, when it was sought to establish the Prices Advisory Council, that once again the Minister described the establishment of that council as passing the buck by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He said that the Minister was delegating to the Advisory Council the job he was given to do, to control and restrict any increase in price.  I now say to the Minister that he has got a job to do himself as a servant of this Dáil, to supervise and control conditions of trade in this country.  He is not doing the job by legislating for some commission to be appointed by himself at a later stage.  That is passing the buck with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>I think it is well that Deputies and people outside should compare the conduct of the present Minister as a Minister and while he was in opposition because you cannot blow hot and cold all the time and expect people to regard you as some sort of idealist.</P>
    <P>The Bill which I should like to have seen introduced, and the Bill which, please God, may be introduced in the future, is a Bill which, first, would declare the type of practice that this House, as a Legislature, objects to.  That is not difficult.  I heard <Col N="2000" /> Deputy Sweetman give instances of certain practices which we would regard as illegal and wrong.  Secondly, the House should regard the administration of any Bill as being the primary function of the Minister and no one else.  For these reasons, I fear that this Bill will be ineffective, and I fear that it is intended to be ineffective because, frankly, I can see this Bill only operating in a manner which most Deputies would regard as deplorable. I can see a political body being established which may, under some irresponsible Government, extort protection money from those engaged in industry.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent that happening under this type of commission, a commission appointed by the Minister, with the Dáil having no say in its appointment, removable by the Minister, meeting in a back room and laying down their ideas of fair trading and able to legislate <i>ad hoc</i> in relation to any particular industry or individual engaged in industry.  Is the door not wide open for the gravest kind of abuse?  That is what we are asked to accept as a responsible effort by the Minister to deal with practices which both sides of the House condemn. Whatever the House may decide, I do not think the country will regard this Bill as being a substantial contribution towards the redressing of a grievance of long years' standing.</P>
    <P>With regard to what is actually proposed, the type of machinery envisaged by the Bill, I should like to know from the Minister what reason can be advanced for the incorporation of a section like Section 3.  Do Deputies realise that, under that section, power of legislation is being given to this anonymous body to be appointed by the Minister?  We are sent here because this Dáil has been established by our Constitution to legislate for the people and, by one of our own Bills, we propose to pass over to this body some of the powers the Constitution gives to this Parliament. I think that is wrong.  I do not know whether, at some stage, the constitutionality of that paragraph may be questioned but, on ordinary grounds of policy, I think it is a deplorable departure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> Reference has been made to certain noxious provisions of paragraph 8 of the Schedule.  I do not want to repeat the objections expressed to that paragraph, but it is a paragraph which does appear to be quite objectionable in the framework of this Bill, a Bill by which fair trading rules are decided not by a measure passed by this House but by a group of what I call backroom boys.  It does seem regrettable that Garda officers can be dispatched by that body to pry into the affairs of an ordinary businessman endeavouring to carry on his business and not merely that, but to spy on his employees and servants.  That seems to me to be a most deplorable departure from the standards which the Minister, as a Deputy on this side, so often talked about in relation to industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>I could understand a provision like paragraph 8 being incorporated in a Bill which, clearly and without doubt, declared what the law was.  If this Bill declared a particular practice to be illegal, I could understand the forces of the State charged with the enforcement of the law, the Garda, being utilised in an ordinary legitimate manner to enforce the law, but that provision in this kind of Bill is quite wrong and should not be tolerated. There are many other grounds of objection to the Bill as framed and proposed which have been referred to, and it is not necessary for me to deal with them again.</P>
    <P>I noticed when the Minister was introducing the Bill that he referred to certain practices restrictive of trade, but carefully refrained from expressing any view on whether they were good or bad.  That is quite understandable, in view of the type of Bill the Minister was proposing, a Bill deliberately designed to pass responsibility on to someone else.  The Minister, in referring to these practices, gave certain examples.  He mentioned one firm of brewers who, for some years past, have followed the practice of supplying their product only to houses which sell none but their product.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether that kind of practice will be aimed at under this Bill, and whether we may take it <Col N="2002" /> that some other large industries here such as those engaged in the manufacture of motor-cars and accessories, which also enforce restrictions which the Minister apparently thinks are bad, will be dealt with under the powers contained in the Bill.  We know very well they will not, and from that point of view this Bill is so much window-dressing.  It is designed for a political purpose, to enable Fianna Fáil back-benchers to talk about the great men they are and the great Party the Fianna Fáil Party is, at the polls.  It is like Sancho Panza tilting at windmills.</P>
    <P>I can only say, as I said at the outset, that we agree with the necessity for this Bill.  We know there are practices in restraint and in restriction of trade which cause harm and damage to the people.  A more effective and a more permanent way of dealing with such practices would be by the introduction of a Bill expressing clearly what is wrong and what is right.  This measure is ineffective.  It is intended to be ineffective, and it will not provide a solution to the very serious problem with which we are confronted.</P>

      <P>My intervention in the debate will be short. Practically every Deputy has welcomed the Bill.  I, too, would like to welcome it.  I do not describe it as a political stunt.  I do not object to the Minister or the House deputing to some other body functions such as are provided in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's speech on the Second Reading.  I appreciated that he was more or less holding a live bomb in his hands because when one comes to speak of restrictive trade practices, irrespective of whether one attributes them to individuals, to industry, or to the trade union movement, we have to admit that in effect we are dealing with a live bomb.  The Minister did not attempt to describe what restrictive trade practices are.  He did not say whether it was right or wrong for a particular firm of brewers to insist on certain regulations with regard to the sale of their particular commodity.  He did not attempt to define or say whether or not there was a timber ring.  He did not <Col N="2003" /> attempt to say whether or not the motor traders' association were right or wrong in the restrictions they impose.</P>
    <P>I think he was perfectly right in that attitude, from the point of view that many of the practices that have grown up over the last ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years are not regarded as bad practices in themselves and I do not think they should be condemned until it is proved conclusively that they are practices which militate against the public good.  For that reason I think the fair trading commission is the type of body that will quite properly engage in determining whether or not the practices that have been described here over the last few weeks are in themselves restrictive trade practices and whether or not they work against the common good.  For that reason I commend the Bill.  I appreciate the situation in which the Minister finds himself in introducing a Bill of this kind.  I appreciate the fact that it would be impossible for him&mdash;indeed, it would be undersirable&mdash;to prejudge the issue until such time as a body such as the fair trading commission adjudicates on the question as to whether or not the particular practices which have been the subject of complaint are bad practices.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that this Bill is necessary.  It is difficult to say however whether it will bring the desired results.  To me it looks like locking the stable door when the horse has gone because we are about 25 years too late.  The root cause for the Bill is greed.  Some people want too much of this world's goods for themselves.</P>
      <P>This nation is held in the vice of many abuses.  I think the industrial development of the State in the beginning was initiated in the wrong way. We allowed too many internationals to get control of industry here.  If they have not complete control they have semi-control.  It is they who have started trade rings and breaking those rings will need more than the efforts of the Minister and this House.  It will take the united will of the people to clean the nation up and put it on its feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> There is not only one ring.  There are eight, ten or 12 rings.  Agriculture is throttled with rings.  There is the manure ring, the oil combines, the milling combines and the international chain stores, all playing up to each other.  The Minister means well but his efforts alone will never be sufficient to cope with these people.  It is all very fine to set up a commission. Indeed, I would like to see a people's commission and not just a commission of this House.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Belfast Boycott was started.  The people were united and the boycott was working effectively.  If that boycott had lasted two months more there would be no talk to day of abolishing the Border and uniting the nation for we would have a united nation.  This Bill does not go far enough.  Breaking these rings will take the united effort of the people.  The people will have to be organised.  There is no community drive to-day.  We talk here morning, noon and night but nothing effective is done.</P>
    <P>If we want to break the rings we will have to do more than just set up a commission.  We will have to organise the people to break the rings themselves. To-day they are without direction. The farmers are being fleeced by these rings.  An organised nation which would rigorously boycott these rings, which charge as much and half again as they should charge, would very soon bring prices down by 25, 30, or 40 per cent.  No effort has ever been made to get the people to do that.  If that effort were made, public life would be cleaned up in no time.</P>
    <P>These practices are met with in every walk of life.  One meets them in the case of lawyers, doctors and dentists. The ordinary man who has to go into court must employ a solicitor.  That solicitor insists on his client employing counsel.  As a rule the counsel recommended is a friend, a relation or some connection of the solicitor.  Litigation that should cost £5 costs £50 with the result that people who have just cause for action will often refrain from going to court because of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>The same is true in connection with doctors.  A doctor will charge a patient a normal fee.  He will give a prescription. <Col N="2005" /> The patient will be advised that that prescription must be taken to a particular chemist.  As a rule one chemist in a town will have a monopoly of prescriptions.  They work into each other's hands, with the result that decent, honest men are squeezed out. Those types of practices are mean, dirty and low, and the country is full of them.  I could cite dozens of them. I am not one of those who tie themselves to narrow politics.  I believe in facing a question openly and in a manly way.  There are about 100 different types of mean practices in this country that must be broken down. When that is done the ordinary people will get a fair crack of the whip and will be satisfied that they are getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>I heard members on the Labour Benches talk of the rings which are in existence.  What about the trade union ring?  Trade unionism, carried on in an effective way, is good and does good work for its members, whom it protects. However, if I have a son who wants to go into the butcher trade he cannot get in.  Only four or five years ago a decent man came to me and said that he wanted to get his son into the butcher trade, but that he was unable to do so.  I asked him what was the reason for that, and he said that it is a ring.</P>

      <P>The Deputy could become a farmer in the morning if he had the cash.  There is nothing to stop him.  I asked the man in question what he wanted me to do and he said that he wanted me to approach the strongest man in Dublin.  When I asked him who that was he said that it was Mr. James Larkin, who has since died.  The man said that unless I could approach Mr. Larkin and get him to do a certain thing, his son could not get into the butcher trade.  The late James Larkin and I were not on the best of terms at the time but, to give him his due, he treated me well when I approached him.  It was the first and the last time I ever approached him.  I explained my friend's position and asked him to help.  He <Col N="2006" /> did so and the boy was allowed into the trade within seven days.  If I had not been able to approach Mr. Larkin on the boy's behalf he could not have got into that trade.  Surely that is a restrictive practice.  It is mean, dirty and low.  It should not be allowed in this country.  Is it the same all over: too many men play into one another's hands?  They are getting too much out of it.  The ordinary man is the gombeen boy and he is paying through the nose for it.  The ordinary people are trying to solve these mysteries.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the oil combines. There is hardly a garage in this country which has not been taken over by an oil combine.  The ordinary garage proprietor who was doing well a few years ago is shoved aside.  The garage is painted and decorated and we see a new name on it.  The garage proprietor has to work in his own garage for the oil combine.  He is squeezed dry like a lemon.  Those combines will squeeze the life-blood of the people.  I should like to see the people of this country living decent honest lives and every man getting a fair crack of the whip.  Some effort is being made in this Bill to achieve that position.  I am satisfied, however, that the Bill will have very little effect unless it is operated on a non-political basis.  Some people say that the Bill was brought in because pressure was brought to bear on the Minister. Other people say that it was brought in because the Minister says that he stands for Irish nationalism and that he will burst all the rings.  I believe the Minister will not succeed in bursting the rings.  Those people are too big and strong and wealthy for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combines in this country control nearly all the money in the country. They can sit tight or loosen up as it suits them.  Irish industry was doing reasonably well and is doing reasonably well.  I appeal to the Minister to comb it out, so that any of those international chain stores or combines which come in here will be squeezed out, with the result that Irish industry will be able to progress with Irish money and that Irish people will be in control.  The international boys get in, and so long as they are able to use <Col N="2007" /> their big money, they will leave Irish industry nothing more than the toy of the English combines.  At all times the aim of the British was to keep this country in a poor state.  The aim of the British-Irish industries, as I will call them, is to allow Irish industry to reach a certain stage and then to burst it.  If they cannot do business with us from across the water they come over here and start a branch of their combine in Ireland.  That has been their practice over a number of years.  They are getting control and influence in Irish trade, with the result that it is the toy of such industrialists. I do not care whether it is an oil ring or anything else.  They have a controlling influence in this country. It will take a gigantic effort to break that influence.  It is a pity that we squabbled among ourselves 30 years ago, because we could have done much better if we had worked together to build up a sound and happy nation. The boys outside saw their chance and came in.  They have a great deal of influence in this country at present. That influence must be broken, and can be broken by the people&mdash;not by sections of the people or by politicians, but by the united effort of the people. Nothing would gladden my heart more than to see every parish in every county fully organised in an effort to eradicate every mean and low practice from the life of the Irish people.  There are big and manly men in this country who could do it.  This evil is like a monster gripping our throat.  I hope the Minister will do everything he can to wipe out these low practices once and for all.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea that the Minister will choose the members of the commission.  He may pick good men and, in fact, I believe he will pick good men but the people outside will say that the Minister is picking his boys.  I urge the Minister to allow Irish industry to choose the members of the commission.  If outside people are allowed to pick their own men, and give them the credentials which they require, I believe that far more will be done for this country.  I am glad that the Minister has introduced this Bill.  It will make the Irish <Col N="2008" /> people realise that the sacrifices which were made will be in vain unless we put Irish brains and Irish money in full control of Irish industry.  There is no use in talking about republics, flags and so forth.  We are merely floundering unless we right this matter once and for all.  Therefore I say to the Minister that he should be open about this whole matter and say exactly what he wants done.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Corish intervened briefly in the debate because he expressed very concisely my attitude to the problem with which this Bill is concerned.  There are restrictive trade practices which appear to be undesirable and detrimental to the public interest.  We are anxious to eradicate them.  We do not believe that it is possible to find an easy and a quick method of doing so. We are concerned to ensure that, in operating whatever method we select, we shall not do more damage than we repair.  The wide variety of views expressed in this debate indicates in a striking way the complexity of the problem and the various alternative approaches to it that might be considered.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the members of the Fine Gael Party, for example, are quite conscious of the divergence of opinion that was expressed by their spokesmen.  No doubt many of those who spoke gave conscientiously their opinions upon this problem but they cannot be accused of having endeavoured in advance to relate these opinions to a common line.  Deputy Morrissey who opened the debate for the Fine Gael Party, expressed his agreement with the view that legislation is necessary, and he said that, having considered the matter, he had come to the opinion that the method proposed in the Bill was the best for tackling the problem.  He was followed by Deputy Dockrell who may have certain privileges within his Party but who was strong in the view that legislation was not necessary, and that the Bill should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>No.  I am not trying to <Col N="2009" /> make a debating point.  I am emphasising that a variety of viewpoints is possible and that I myself, before preparing the Bill, moved between one view and the other before deciding which appeared to be the most reasonable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello, Senior, who followed, urged, as Deputy McGilligan urged later, that we should proceed on a different basis, that we should endeavour to list in the Bill a series of practices which would be accepted as undesirable, and leave it to the courts to penalise the operation of these practices in all cases.  Deputy Cosgrave, who followed, expressed a view as reported at column 1519, with which I am in agreement, when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The great example of leaving this problem to the courts is the United States of America and anyone seeing the working of the antitrust laws in the United States of America as operated by the courts would not wish to emulate that example here.

      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that he thought the Bill would be completely ineffective, that it merely provided for a commission of inquiry whereas other Deputies of his Party had expressed the view that it was too far-reaching and gave too drastic powers to the Minister&mdash;a view which has been expressed in the last half hour by Deputy O'Higgins.  I have said that each of the suggestions made here regarding alternative methods for tackling this problem was considered by me and I became convinced eventually <Col N="2010" /> that the method outlined in the Bill is the best.  I think I can convince the Dáil that I had very good reasons for coming to that conclusion. May I say that many of the objections to the Bill which were voiced here were based on a misunderstanding of its provisions?  I do not know what Bill Deputy O'Higgins was talking about; it was certainly not the Bill I introduced and which I understood the Dáil to be discussing.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding to deal with the provisions of the Bill and with the objections to it, there are a few matters which arose in the debate which I want to dispose of.  I think I can give one single reply to three different points that were made&mdash;one by Deputy Larkin that the Bill is long overdue, another by Deputy Dillon that it represents a reformation of the Fianna Fáil Party, and a third, a suggestion by Deputy Norton that the fair trading commission which this Bill proposed to establish should be combined with the Prices Advisory Body. The reply is that I introduced in this House in 1947 proposals for legislation, known as the Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill, to which Deputy McGilligan has referred in this debate and which was intended to provide a means for tackling this problem in the circumstances of that year.  The argument, therefore, that the Bill is overdue is not a criticism of me because I had proposed legislation for dealing with the problem five years ago.</P>
      <P>Neither is the contention that the introduction of this Bill represents the reformation of the Fianna Fáil Party valid, because when the Bill was introduced I advocated its acceptance to the House and Deputy Dillon voted against it.  That Bill did, in fact, provide for one body to administer price control as well as to discharge the functions which it is proposed to give to the fair trade commission.</P>
      <P>One of the criticisms of the Bill which I thought effective at the time was that we were giving far too much work to the commission to be established by it and that the members would require to be supermen to discharge all their proposed functions effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has been quoting <Col N="2011" /> that 1947 Bill against me in this debate.  He said it represented a better attempt to deal with the problem than the Bill now before the House.  I do not know if Deputy McGilligan has forgotten the fact that he also voted against that Bill.  He certainly has forgotten the fact that when the 1948 election campaign was in progress his Party pledged themselves that, if they were returned to office after the election, they would kill that Bill.  As it happened, the Bill was not enacted before the Dáil was dissolved.  It was, in fact, one of the main items of controversy in the election.  The Labour Party, which had voted for the Bill at that time, accused me of intending to drop it after the election, an accusation which was not well founded, but the Bill was dropped, because, although it had received a Second Reading and had reached the Committee Stage before the dissolution of the Dáil, it was not revived in the new Dáil.  It is, therefore, somewhat amusing to me to hear Deputy McGilligan using that Bill as a stick to beat me on this Bill and urging me to revert to the provisions of that Bill in substitution for the provisions of the Bill now before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I admit that much of the criticism of that Bill was directed against the establishment of joint industrial councils, but that is a matter which will also come again before the Dáil at some time.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Norton's point, I think it would be better to entrust the work to be done under the Bill to a commission that will have no other functions.  I am satisfied, in view of what was said here and from my own knowledge of the extent to which trade practices that require to be investigated are in operation, that this fair trade commission will have full-time work to do for some years.  I admit it is desirable that whatever form of price control is to operate, when a position of price stability has been realised, should be provided by permanent rather than temporary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I mentioned, in the course of the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill last year, my view that, in the present position of price instability, it would be unwise to legislate for a permanent system of price control.  I hope that by next year a situation of reasonable stability in prices will have been achieved, in which case I think the time will be opportune for taking price control off its present basis of temporary legislation and of enacting a measure to give it a permanent status.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to think that I am.  There is one other point that I want to dispose of.  Deputy Dillon urged that this Bill should be extended to cover the practices of trade unions. I have already given the House, in brief outline, the reasons which led me to decide otherwise.  The desirability of imposing restrictions on the employment of workers by means of trade union action has already been recognised in legislation.  A trade union is defined, for the purposes of the Trade Union Acts, as a combination of people engaged in a trade for the purpose of maintaining certain restrictions upon employment in that trade.</P>
      <P>If it is contended, as Deputy Dillon was disposed to contend, that the powers of the trade unions under existing legislation have been occasionally used in an anti-social way, then that is a problem to be dealt with.  I do not think that many of us doubt that these powers have, occasionally, been used in that way.  Deputy Norton himself said at column 1564:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be that, in other fields, the need in 1952 for a modification of practices which grew out of an entirely different set of circumstances arises.  If that is so, the worst possible way to attempt a solution of these problems is to do so by legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not quarrel violently with that point of view.  I think that if these practices, to which Deputy Norton referred, extend to the point that they are having a detrimental effect upon employment, upon output or on productive efficiency, and if we could not get <Col N="2013" /> them rectified in the way that he proposes, we should not exclude the possibility of legislation.  But that is, obviously, a matter for separate consideration, and if we decide that the problem is one which could best be dealt with by the establishment of a commission, it would, obviously, be a very different type of commission from that which we would set up to fulfil the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The next argument was that this Bill does not go far enough. In that connection, I noticed that Deputy Morrissey, on a few occasions during the course of his speech, hinted at the existence of various practices which he did not specify, practices which he described as the worst practices and to which the Bill does not refer.  I am not quite sure what he had in mind.  If he was thinking of trade practices, that is practices relating to the supply and distribution of goods, then this Bill deals with them all.  If he was thinking of practices of another kind then they are not covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, Deputy Cosgrave was critical of the fact that the Bill did not apply to services.  I explained that I did not frame it so as to bring the services within its scope, because I had received no complaints of the existence of restrictive practices in relation to services, that is personal services of one kind or another not involving the supply of goods.  Since the Bill was introduced, I have got a very large volume of correspondence.  People have written to me from all over the country directing my attention to restrictive practices in operation in the localities or trades with which they are associated.  I have received evidence of a restrictive practice, as I would define the term, in respect of one type of service, and, while I think it would be dangerous to attempt to extend the <Col N="2014" /> Bill generally to cover services of all kinds because of definition problems, it may be desirable, and I am considering putting in a section in the Bill which would enable it to be extended to specified named services by ministerial Order, subject to approval by the Dáil.  In that way, we can provide for the investigation of allegations of restrictive practices in particular services, if such allegations are made, and avoid the risk of getting into definition difficulties which might bring us into the sphere of trade union legislation or into other quarters into which we do not wish to go at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said that the Bill does not apply to the Córas Iompair Éireann monopoly or to bodies like Tea Importers and other organisations of that kind.  Incidentally, I may say that Deputy Hickey seemed to me somewhat confused about the position of his Party in that connection.  He denounced all these bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that some time ago I met a deputation from the Irish Trade Union Congress, led by Deputy Larkin, who urged an extension of these bulk import agencies? However, my answer to Deputy Collins in that regard is that these bodies, such as Córas Iompair Éireann, were set up by legislation.  They are exercising the powers which the Dáil decided they should have, and it would be ridiculous for us now to set up a commission to examine the question as to whether they should have these powers or not.  It was because of a recognition of the special work which these organisations had to do, and that to do it they required certain defined powers, that legislation was passed here.  If the circumstances ever arise in which we think that the powers they have under statute should be taken back from them, that is a matter for us and I do not think that we would need the advice of a commission before taking that step, and <Col N="2015" /> certainly not a commission such as I contemplate will operate under this Bill.</P>
      <P>That argument of Deputy Collins suggested to me that he had missed the whole point of this measure.  It is not contended by me that there should be no rules for the regulation of trade or that there should be no trade associations for the protection of trade interests.  What I am contending is, that these rules, whatever they are, should be capable of being subjected to review by some statutory body set up by this House, and should be open to annulment or amendment if that review shows them to be contrary to the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to argue a case for legislation.  That is conceded, but it is necessary to argue a case for this particular type of legislation against the alternative which was suggested by various Deputies, that is a Bill which would attempt to define restrictive practices and declare those practices to be illegal for all trades in all circumstances, subject, possibly, to an appeal to a commission such as this Bill proposes to establish, as Deputy Costello, Junior, suggested, or subject to the procedure contemplated in the 1947 Bill to which Deputy McGilligan referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered that course very carefully. It would have advantages if it could be made to work.  It would mean that, simultaneously with the enactment of legislation, certain practices would be outlawed, provided we could make the legislation effective and the definition of these practices sufficiently watertight.  It did hold out a promise of speedier action, and I rejected it only when I was satisfied that it was completely unworkable.  Deputy O'Higgins stated a few minutes ago that it would be easy to do it, but I could not agree with that view at all. I find that most of those who spoke on this Bill from the other side of the House, including Deputy Costello, said that it would not be easy to define in legislation the type of practices which we wish to outlaw with all the exemptions that would be necessary to enable <Col N="2016" /> business to be carried on in many trades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit it is not an answer.  I am prepared to agree that full consideration of this matter has convinced me that the dangers of hasty action are so great that we should avoid them.  I am not satisfied that any system of general prohibition such as we contemplated in 1947 could be made effective.  The main objection I had is this.  If we were to work along these lines and have definitions of the practices we wish to condemn, they would probably have to be framed in such general terms as to be of very little value, in such general terms that nobody would really know what specific trade practices were outlawed, until a whole series of decided cases had been built up in the courts.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if in the effort to avoid that danger we tried to define these condemned practices in a narrow specific way we would be opening the way for evasion of the law.  A very small change in existing practices would in many cases achieve the same results as far as the trade associations are concerned and they would get around the letter of the law in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to define them at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true and that is precisely the point I am going to make.  If they have to be defined, it is better that they should be defined in relation to the specific circumstances of particular trades.  In that way the risk of evasion would be minimised and everybody would be able to understand clearly the things which are prohibited by law.  Any attempt to frame <Col N="2017" /> such legislation as was suggested here would almost certainly end in failure. We can attempt to define practices which we are prepared to condemn for all trades in all circumstances in a most general way, but ultimately somebody will have to decide whether the particular practice by a particular trade contravenes the general prohibition. If that function is left to the commission they will have to carry out precisely the type of inquiry which the Bill contemplates and there will be no saving of time.  On the other hand, if it is left to the courts to decide whether a particular practice in any particular trade contravenes the general prohibition, then it means that somebody in the Attorney-General's office will have to examine it, will have to decide whether it is a practice in contravention of the law and will have to initiate the action in the courts which would result in stopping it.</P>
      <P>In my view, there would be a still narrower bottleneck than is alleged to exist under this Bill and the results would be slower.  If that procedure were followed and cases taken to the courts, when the Attorney-General and his staff decided that a particular practice was contrary to the general prohibition, it would be only over a long number of years that a body of case law would be built up which would enable traders to know precisely where they stand.  That is the experience in the United States of America.  We should at least learn from their experience and also from the advice we get from those who have knowledge of the operation of the American law not to proceed along that line if we can find a better line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Will not the commission be faced with the same difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that they can act with greater speed, act on their own initiative and go after the detailed and specific arrangements of particular trades which are apparently contrary to the public interest and recommend the making of Orders of a precise kind which cannot be easily evaded and which everybody will easily understand.  There is almost no general form of general prohibition <Col N="2018" /> that I can think of that would be effective. We have been talking about the possibility of people being refused entry into trades.  One of the commonest methods of doing that is by making the discount rate applicable only to an unreasonably large quantity of goods.  A person who wants to get into the wholesale trade in some goods is told that he can do so provided he is prepared to buy an enormous quantity of goods, and that he must be in a very large way of business before he can attempt it. Take that form of restrictive practice and try to make a general prohibition which will define the quantity of goods which a person must buy to become reasonably entitled to the discount rate.  It would be only by a whole series of court proceedings extending over years that reasonable arrangements for particular trades could be fixed.</P>
      <P>The commission, on the other hand, can get down to the circumstances of a particular business straightaway and recommend clear and definite Orders relating to it.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that we should proceed the other way and prohibit all these practices and allow the commission to grant exceptions from the general prohibition.  In my view, that would not be any more expenditious than the procedure in the Bill and would be a highly dangerous course to take, because there are many practices which appear to be generally undesirable, but which might be justifiable and useful in the circumstances of particular trades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman did attempt to define the form in which the prohibition suggested should be expressed in the Bill.  He said that he would make it illegal to fix minimum prices, to restrict production, to limit competition or to restrict entry into a trade. In case Deputies may think it is easy, I want to give a few examples.  That is the best way of bringing home the complexity of the problems arising in this connection and with which this fair trade commission will have to deal.  Most of us will say straightaway that arrangements to fix minimum prices are undesirable.  Yet we are doing it ourselves in respect of <Col N="2019" /> many commodities.  Europe was celebrating recently the inauguration of the Coal and Steel Community, which is a price maintenance arrangement on an international scale.  The International Wheat Agreement is another arrangement of the same kind.  We here have authorised the Minister for Agriculture to fix prices for wheat and to operate machinery to ensure that that fixed price is secured by the growers.  We have similar arrangements in relation to butter, and Deputies for the last week or so have been urging that the Minister for Agriculture should take steps to fix minimum prices for oats and barley.</P>
    <P>These illustrations show that there are circumstances in which the fixing of minimum prices is regarded as desirable.  The difference, of course, between these arrangements and arrangements operated by private trade associations is that they are statutory arrangements of which we have approved, the public interest has been assessed by the Dáil, and a Minister of State is empowered to do these things because it has been recognised after discussion that the public welfare will be protected by the fixation of minimum prices in these cases.</P>
    <P>There may be examples in trade where similar arrangements operated by private trade associations would be justified.  My argument is that these arrangements operated by private trade associations are open to the suspicion of being operated for the benefit of those engaged in that trade, and that they should be approached with suspicion.  The idea is to have them investigated in that mood by this proposed commission, and sanctioned only if the case that they are operating to the public benefit is overwhelmingly established.  Probably, however, that case for minimum price maintenance arrangements is the weakest I could make.  Certainly my own disposition is so strongly against arrangements of that kind that I would require very conclusive evidence before I would sanction any such arrangement. Even some of the arrangements the Government have operated under statutory authority might at some stage be terminated also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2020" /> Take the other example given by Deputy Sweetman.  He said that we should declare illegal any arrangement to restrict production.  I am not quite clear as to what he meant, but I can see circumstances under which arrangements or agreements to restrict production might be justifiable.  We have done it in certain circumstances ourselves. Deputy MacBride talked about the flour millers.  When we were bringing in the Cereals Act of 1936 and making the effort which began the extension of the flour milling industry so that the importation of flour would become unnecessary, we were very much concerned to promote the development of inland mills.</P>
    <P>We realised that unrestricted competition in the flour milling industry would concentrate trade in the great port mills.  It was desired to foster and protect inland mills and in order to do that we introduced a quota arrangement which was designed to limit competition and restrict production so as to afford that measure of protection to inland mills against the larger port mills.  We also had the aim of permitting competition and to some extent we fell between two stools, to the extent that while the total of the quotas fixed was 10 per cent. above the estimated requirements for the country and that margin was supposed to allow for competition, I can say that the flour millers did effectively prevent competition by their own internal arrangements.</P>

      <P>The quota association antedated the legislation.  I can see circumstances in some trades where arrangements designed to limit production and operated by trade associations might not be regarded as prejudicial to the public interests. Again the aim must be to have all these arrangements subjected to impartial investigation, stopped if they are found to be contrary to the public interests, and modified if modification is regarded as desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> The next proposal of Deputy Sweetman's was that we should make it illegal to limit competition.  Again I want to deal with that particular matter by way of illustration.  I do not know if every Deputy in this House is convinced that it is desirable, for example, that petrol should be available for retail sale through pumps at public houses, hotels and places other than motor garages.  I would not be convinced yet on the information available to me that it would be desirable.  I would like to know the effect on distribution costs, on the employment of mechanics at motor garages, and on the service which motorists might reasonably expect to be able to secure at places where they purchase their motor fuel if we completely wiped out the arrangements of the petrol trade limiting competition.</P>
    <P>We should have an examination on all the likely consequences first and only when we were satisfied that the consequences would be such as not to be detrimental to the public interest and to the country generally should we agree to that course.  The same applies in many other trades.  There may be an argument in favour of limiting supplies of goods to firms of a particular kind, firms with particular equipment, firms with a particular trained personnel in their service. These are matters which have to be investigated and should be investigated before we attempt to prohibit such arrangements.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for that investigation plus prohibition when investigation shows it to be desirable.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the fourth suggestion of Deputy Sweetman's that we should prohibit straightaway all regulations designed to restrict entry to any trade.  Again, there are questions there in my mind.  Some of these restrictions which operate to limit entry into a trade are expressly designed to maintain a standard of quality of the goods sold or the services given to the public.  I am quite certain that there is no trade association which says: &ldquo;We operate trade restrictions merely for the purpose of confining the business to ourselves.&rdquo;<Col N="2022" /> They give at least the excuse that they are aiming at achieving some public benefit.  If, however, a motor-car manufacturer contracts with the purchaser of one of his motor-cars that in addition to getting the motor-car he will get after-sale service free of charge for 12 months then he must reasonably be allowed to limit the supply of his motor-cars to firms which are equipped to give that service which he has contracted to give and equipped to do it efficiently.  At least so it would seem to me.  In other trades there is no doubt that it is in the public interest that the people engaged in them should have had some preliminary training and have some minimum standard of efficiency before being allowed to deal with the public.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of all the argument is that it would be dangerous to make sweeping provision in the Bill condemning all these practices for all trades or businesses without preliminary inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is far better to set up the machinery for inquiry and act upon its results, and that is what the Bill proposes.  These are briefly the reasons why I decided in favour of a Bill of this kind rather than of the type which Deputies opposite suggested and which I had in mind myself in 1947.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies have condemned and others certainly appear to have misunderstood, the proposals in this Bill relating to the drafting of fair trading rules.  That idea, may I say, has been borrowed from United States practice.  In the operation of similar legislation in the United States of America this idea was established and appeared to have been quite beneficial in its effect.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill are necessarily based upon the assumption that in many trades some rules are necessary and may even be desirable from the point of view of the public.  I have mentioned rules and regulations designed to maintain the quality of the goods supplied, the quality of service given to the public, and, one might even say, the possibility of regulations designed to prevent unnecessary duplication of the channels of distribution and to reduce distribution costs.</P>
    <P>There is an old problem of branded <Col N="2023" /> goods and it seems to me that, on the whole, the public prefer to buy branded goods.  That, I think, is the view of most traders.  They regard the manufacturers' brand upon the goods as some guarantee of uniformity of quality.  If the branding of goods by manufacturers in that way is to be permitted, then manufacturers must also be allowed to impose certain restrictions designed to prevent their goods being adulterated or inferior products sold under their brand.</P>
    <P>If we recognise that in many trades some rules may be even desirable from the point of view of the public then there is an advantage in providing in this Bill for the drafting of those rules by the fair trade commission even though they will have no statutory effect.  What I am hoping for is that on the introduction and enactment of this Bill there will be a voluntary abandonment of undesirable restrictive trade practices by all trade associations. I think that is our best chance of getting speedy results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can at least hope for it.  With the enactment of legislation which holds out the prospect of coercive steps following upon its operation, there is a reasonable prospect that many of those trade associations will voluntarily abandon rules and regulations which are likely to be condemned and do so by the process of going to the fair trade commission and asking them to indicate the types of rules that they think would meet the requirements of their trade, and would not be open to objection from the viewpoint of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that these fair trading rules are designed to permit of the operation of undesirable restrictive practices with Government approval is, of course, groundless.  Furthermore, Deputy O'Higgins's assertion that Section 3 of the Bill is setting up a commission to pass laws that the Dáil should pass would merely indicate that he had not studied the section very carefully.  These fair trading rules under Section 3 will be voluntary rules.  Trades which want to abandon <Col N="2024" /> undesirable practices, which want to get themselves into the position in which they can assure the public that there are no rings operating or other practices which are detrimental to the public interest, can have the necessary rules prepared and can get a certificate from this fair trading commission that their rules are of a character to which no reasonable objection could be taken.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that the procedure under this Bill will take too long to effect the elimination of all undesirable trade practices.  It is certainly going to take some time to do it.  As I have said already, I do not think there is any quick and easy method that is not fraught with dangers.  I do not agree at all with the suggestion made by Deputy McGilligan and others that reliance should be placed upon the courts to give us quicker results.  That has not been the experience of other countries.  I am told that the average duration of the hearing of cases taken in the courts in the United States of America is about five years, and there have been cases which have gone much longer than that before the vested interests that were benefiting by their restrictive practices had exhausted all the possibilities of the law before getting a judgment given against them.  I agree that the fair trade commission will not be able in a year or two to dispose of all the cases that we would like to see them examining, but I am quite certain they will be able to get results far more quickly than resort to the courts would achieve.  There is no means, in my view, by which we can wipe out all the objectionable features in commerce at one swoop.  We must take this matter systematically and deal with it in a rational way.  I should hope it would be found possible to get the commission working on the most important and urgent cases first and deal with other cases later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping that as a result of its labours there will be proposals for legislation at some time. Objection was taken to the procedure laid down in the Bill under which Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the recommendation of the commission, must be confirmed by Act of Dáil before becoming effective, on the ground that that would involve unnecessary delay.  I think it would be dangerous to allow matters of the possible magnitude that may arise under this Bill to be dealt with solely by ministerial Order.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;covering important trade interests and it is far better that the Orders made should have the authority of the Oireachtas behind them rather than merely the authority of the Minister.  I do not think that will necessarily involve delay.  As I mentioned already, the Bill which will be introduced will be similar to that which comes along occasionally here to confirm a harbour works Order.  That is the nearest example I can offer. Under the legislation for the extension of harbour boundaries or the other matters affecting harbours, the Minister can make an Order which does not become effective until confirming legislation is passed by the Oireachtas by means of a one-clause Bill.  These harbour works confirming Orders usually pass through the Dáil without discussion.  Although that will hardly be the position in respect of some of these Orders the delay will, in my view, not be considerable and will certainly be well worth it in order to give the necessary authority to these Orders and to avoid the possibility of the constitutional question being raised that the legislative power being exercised by the Minister was too extensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I was somewhat surprised by the objections raised by <Col N="2026" /> some Deputies relating to the appointment of the commission.  This is not altogether a joke, but if Deputies opposite want to create a situation in which the members of the commission appointed by me cannot be changed by them if there is a change of Government I do not object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see at all the force of this objection.  The members of the commission, being appointed by the Minister, will have regard to the Minister's policy.  What is the Minister's policy in this connection? His policy will be to effect such an improvement in relation to these restrictive trade practices that he can come before the Dáil and justify the work of the commission, and the conflict of interest or the possibility of abuse to which some Deputies referred just does not exist.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins was talking about back-room boys meeting in secret and carrying out the behests of the Minister in condoning some restrictive trade practice.  I do not think he can have read the Bill.  This commission will meet in public.  The Bill provides that it will hold its meetings in public. It will only go into private session if the evidence being produced is of such a character that the commission itself considers that it would be unfair to certain people that it should be publicised.  Its report will be submitted to the Minister and published to the Dáil and the Minister's action on that report will be the subject of debate here.  Personally, I do not see that there is any basis for the criticism that was expressed by some Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it could be.  I have not very strong views on the point.  I do not think the provision in some Acts, that if the Minister removes a member of some board or commission he must give the reasons for doing so to the Dáil, is a safeguard at all.  I remember when, early in my political life, people were being removed from <Col N="2027" /> some position and questions were asked in the Dáil, that the Minister gave the sort of answer: &ldquo;Because his services were no longer required.&rdquo;  It was a complete answer, but it satisfied nobody.  On the other hand, if appointment is for a definite period of years without any possibility of removal at all, whether he works or not, the House would regard that as unsatisfactory also.  There is no good in bringing in the judiciary as an example in this regard.  Many judges were appointed who did not work, and some went a bit weak in the head, but not weak enough to be removed, and some got a bit odd.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have no strong views about it.  I think the procedure laid down in the Bill is reasonable.  It is copied from a number of other Acts. The Prices Advisory Body is the most recent example of an authority that was set up in precisely the same way as is proposed in this Bill and, in my view, its responsibilities are at least as great as the responsibilities that it is prepared to give to this commission. I am quite certain, despite what Deputy Costello said, that we will get for this commission men who will not be, under any circumstances, influenced in their recommendation by corrupt considerations.  No Government in its sane senses would take the risk of appointing to a body of this kind people who might under any circumstances leave themselves open to a charge of that nature.  I think Deputy Morrissey was much nearer the truth when he said that we would have considerable <Col N="2028" /> difficulty in getting people of the necessary standing and experience to accept work of this character on a whole-time basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Browne referred to private enterprise having its last chance.  I would not go as far as that.  I think it is undoubtedly true that private enterprise has to put its house in order and that it is far better that it should do so voluntarily than that it should be forced to do so by legislation but I would hate to think that the alternative to the present system is further extension of State monopolies.  At one time, I confess, I was disposed to the view that many industries in this country and many economic activities could best be carried on by State boards.  I have weakened in that view very considerably because of my experience of their operation.  A State monopoly has all the same temptation to inefficiency and wastefulness as a private monopoly.</P>

      <P>Before concluding, I want to dispose, if I can, of certain misunderstandings and misconceptions of the Bill expressed in the debate so that Deputies, when considering their amendments, will have regard to the proper interpretation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that it will not be open to members of the public to get an investigation started.  That certainly was not my intention and I do not think the Bill operates to have that result.  Any responsible person or body of persons will be able to approach the commission to have an investigation into some alleged restrictive practice or will be able to approach the Minister to require the commission to have such an investigation. I do not think it would be reasonable to provide that the commission must investigate every practice concerning which it receives a complaint. There must be some screening, either by the commission or by the Minister, so that its energies will not be dissipated upon trivialities, that it will be able to concentrate upon the important things and take these in the order that they think is appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is certainly no intention that only the commission itself or only the Minister could decide what should be investigated.  So far as the Minister will be the channel by which directions will be conveyed to the commission as to investigations that should be undertaken, he is here in the Dáil and it is to the Dáil he will have to explain if he fails to act upon any reasonable request that is made to him.</P>
      <P>I would entirely disagree with Deputy Larkin in his contention that there should be no part of the inquiry private and that nothing in the commission's report should be withheld from the Dáil.  I do not think it is likely that in any of the investigations which I can conceive the commission undertaking there will be any part of the inquiry private or that any information will be withheld from the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I was trying to express my view upon the point that he raised in that connection.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon queried the provisions of Section 10, which says that the court may grant an injunction notwithstanding any rule of law.  So far as I understand the position, there is a rule of law that a court will not grant an injunction where there is an alternative remedy available.  The purpose of the provision is to enable the court to grant an injunction against a firm acting contrary to an Order made under the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that there is an alternative, but slower, remedy available. Once the Dáil has confirmed an Order prohibiting a trade practice, there should be means by which, through the courts, immediate action can be taken to stop any contravention when it appears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as penalties are concerned, many Deputies objected to the magnitude of the penalties.  It is necessary to fix some maximum, but I ask Deputies to remember that these are maximum penalties.  There must be some limit on the penalties which a court can impose, but the actual penalty in any case is decided in relation <Col N="2031" /> to the offence.  The Bill provides, as every Bill must, some maximum or upward limit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello commented on the fact that manufacturers are not mentioned.  I do not think that is necessary.  The word &ldquo;supplier&rdquo; is far wider in scope and certainly includes manufacturer.  The Bill refers to any person who is a supplier of goods and that seems to me to be wide enough to cover every person engaged in trading in goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well if the Minister had that looked into by the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Another question was raised concerning the provision in Section 6 which says that the commission shall comply with the directions of the Minister on the nature and scope of an inquiry made at his request.  There is certainly no intention there that the Minister should have power to limit the nature and scope of inquiries undertaken by the commission, but if the Minister asks the commission to undertake inquiries he must have some power to give them terms of reference.  That is all that is intended there, that if he asks them to investigate the circumstances under which petrol is being sold by retail then he is not dealing with soap; and the whole purpose of the section is to ensure that he can define in a precise way to the commission the inquiry which he wishes them to undertake.</P>
      <P>Objection was also taken to the provision which places upon employees an obligation to give evidence and produce documents.  I cannot find any sympathy with the objections expressed by Deputies to that provision.  I think that employees, as citizens of the State, have a fundamental duty to assist in maintaining the law.  As a practical consideration, I am certain that if it is not possible to get their evidence or require them to produce documents relating to the business of the firm in their possession, successful proceedings against their employers for the contravention of these Orders will be almost impossible.  However, these are matters which can be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> There is one other point, in reference to a query by Deputy Costello as to whether we were satisfied about the constitutionality of the Bill.  I can only say that in its preparation very careful consideration was given to the constitutional position, and every care was taken to ensure that no provisions would be included which would contravene the provisions of the Constitution. I think that those responsible for its drafting have succeeded in that aim.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an endeavour to deflect the Government from the hard task which has been imposed on them of restoring financial and economic stability to the State.  So far as one can sort them out from the pandemonium which the Opposition has been creating over the past three weeks, four issues seem to emerge for which the Opposition think I carry, as Minister for Finance, a particular responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are, first, the White Paper forecasting the outturn of the year 1951 on our balance of payments; second, the report of the Central Bank; third, the terms which made the recent National Loan a success&mdash;a <Col N="2035" /> success which the Opposition apparently found very unpalatable, and fourth, the enforcement of the regulation that civil servants must not identify themselves with particular political candidatures.  Perhaps I might add to all these the steps which have been taken to redress our balance of trade and to secure a balanced Budget.</P>
    <P>There is one of these matters for which I have no direct responsibility. In fact, I may say one in respect of which I have no responsibility whatever, whether it be direct or indirect. I refer to the report of the Central Bank.  That report&mdash;and it is well that we should keep this in mind&mdash;represents the independent, uncoerced and unintimidated view of the governor and directors of the Central Bank on the financial and economic position of the State.</P>
    <P>It is a report which they present to the people on the management of our financial and economic affairs.  It is a report not of politicians like Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacBride, who are concerned to cover up their own financial and economic errors, but a report of experienced, independent men, some of whom are business men, some farmers, some labour representatives, some bankers, some high civil servants and some expert economists&mdash;men who have considered and weighed the facts as they have emerged and as they have impressed themselves upon them and who, on the basis of these facts and in the exercise of their own good judgment, formulate their conclusions for the consideration of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Central Bank Act constitutes the governor and board of directors of the Central Bank as the guardians of our currency, our currency which can be damaged by the things which our Governments may do, our credit which can be damaged by the things which our Governments may do and our credit which has been damaged by the things which our predecessors did.  Section 6 of the Central Bank Act, a statute passed by this Oireachtas, imposes upon the governor and the directors of the Central Bank the primary duty of safeguarding the integrity of our currency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> Section 8 imposes on them the duty to put their views before the people. Common sense recommends to us all that we should study these facts, that we should consider them carefully and, of course, that we should be guided by them to the extent but only to the extent that they appear to us to be well founded.  However, as I have said, I have no responsibility whatever for the report of the Central Bank but since the Dáil has been asked by Deputy MacBride and by Deputy Dillon &mdash;who apparently thinking discretion was the better part of valour withdrew a motion which he had earlier put down&mdash;to condemn the governor and the directors of the Central Bank, I may later in the debate deal with some of the more jejune statements to which Deputy MacBride committed himself when he was discussing this matter on a motion which he put down on the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Before doing that, however, I should like to say something regarding Deputy Dillon's motion asking the Dáil to condemn the White Paper which was issued last October.</P>

      <P>The White Paper was issued at my instance to forewarn the people regarding the adverse <Col N="2037" /> economic development which was taking place in our affairs.  It is entirely a matter of administration and was issued by me during the year which ended on the 31st March, 1952. It is usual, I understand, in debating on the Estimates, to discuss the administration of the previous year. If, Sir, I had not an opportunity of dealing with this matter on the Private Member's motion, I am suggesting to you that I am entitled to deal with it now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think nothing could be more relevant for this reason.  It has been necessary for me to take certain financial measures, and, in co-operation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to take certain other measures to redress the adverse trend in the balance of trade which was forecast by the White Paper. I think, with all due respect to you, Sir, that it is important that the validity of the conclusions reached in that White Paper should be substantiated, that the White Paper and the statistics in it should be shown to have been well-founded and that consequently the action taken on the basis of the White Paper was fully justified &mdash;justified in prospect as it has been justified by results.</P>
      <P>I was saying in relation to this question of our balance of payments that, about this time last year, I issued a White Paper which was presented to the Oireachtas in, I think, October. According to Deputy Collins&mdash;and here I suggest to you, Sir, is where this matter becomes of the first relevance&mdash; this White Paper disqualified me from holding my present office.  I do not particularly hanker after office.  I have held it for so many years that for me it has very little savour and its sweets are indeed in some cases like dead sea fruit; but that I or my colleagues should relinquish office and hand over the concerns of this country to the unholy combination which, in three years, squandered our substance and plunged us into foreign debt is just unthinkable, and I should therefore like to try to recall to the House some of the forecasts which were made in that White Paper, not with any idea of reopening the debate on the motion which was decided last night, but to show that in fact the White Paper represented an objective approach to a very difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> As I have told the House, the title of the White Paper was: &ldquo;The Trend of External Trade and Payments.&rdquo;  I have never for a moment suggested that the conclusions which I arrived at and which were set out in that White Paper were infallible.  They were merely forecasts and, as I have said already, I do not profess to have the gift of infallible prophecy.  All I could do was to take the situation as it appeared to me to be developing at that particular period of the year and tell the people that, because of the end to which that trend would eventually bring us, it was necessary for us to take certain steps.  Of course, in the discussion of my general policy and the general administration of my Department, the very title of this White Paper has been misrepresented or has never been adverted to. It has been assumed that it represented a firm prophecy, when in fact it merely tried to bring home to the people the direction in which we were going and the fact that, if we were to continue on this road for two or three years, we were heading for national bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>That was the purpose of the White Paper.  It was necessary to bring home to the people the seriousness of the situation and what I wish now to put before the House is a review of the facts as they have emerged.  It is true that the White Paper forecast that unless things were to change radically in the last quarter of the year, we should have a deficit on our balance of payments of the order of £70,000,000. In fact, however, things were not so bad as that.  They turned out not to be so bad as that, because&mdash;and let the Dáil realise why&mdash;we had already taken steps to try to mitigate the adverse factors which were operating against us.  We had already taken steps to try to reduce the prospective adverse trade balance to more reasonable dimensions.</P>

      <P>I am going to remind the House of what I did say in regard to this adverse balance of payments in July of 1951 and I am quoting from the Dáil Debates, Volume 126, column 1896. I said then that the evidence available at that time suggested that the 1951 deficit in the balance of payments would be of the order of £60,000,000.  That was quite a good long-term shot, as most Deputies will agree.  If you were taking long odds on the night of the first call-over on the Manchester. November Handicap and were able to get as close to the mark, as I was in regard to the balance of payments deficit six months hence when I spoke in the Dáil in July, 1951, I think you would be clapping yourself on the back and saying that you had made a damned good bet.</P>

I was saying that in July of last year I warned the House and the country that if things continued to go on in the way in which they were then developing we would be faced at the end of the year with an adverse trade balance of £60,000,000.  That would be an adverse trade balance of just twice <Col N="2041" /> the dimensions we had experienced in the year before.  In 1950, as Deputies know, the adverse trade balance was £30,000,000.  In the year 1951, following on the panic importation of a lot of manufactured goods, some of which we could have made here at home, it looked as if our adverse trade balance would be in the order of £60,000,000.</P>

That was the actual experience, the actual realised figure in so far as the Central Statistics Office could calculate it.  I know, of course, that the Deputy will say that I had suggested in this White Paper, which has been the subject of so much controversy, or forecast or estimated that the figure would be £70,000,000.

      <P>Am I to be condemned because instead of having an adverse trade balance of £70,000,000, as at one time looked likely, we succeeded by reason of the measures which we had taken in reducing it to something less than £62,000,000?  I think that so far from being condemned the Government is rather to be commended for that fact.  It does represent at least that we have £8,000,000 of external assets which are producing an income that is helping us to pay our way in the world.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another, we are not able at the present moment to make ends meet on the basis of our visible and invisible trade.  We are still in deficit.  The problem is a very serious one for us because it represents an encroachment upon our income-producing capital resources which we can ill-afford. Therefore, as I have said at the beginning, the fact that we did not find it necessary to eat so deeply into our reserves, as I at one time apprehended, is something for which I should be commended rather than condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see again, if I may be permitted to try to tell it to the Dáil, what I attempted to do in August, 1951.  In August, 1951, the position appeared to be very serious indeed.  I said to myself: &ldquo;These figures have been placed before me and I think it is my duty to set them before the public.  I think it is my duty to put them to the people.&rdquo;  After all, if I were to allow the year to run on and at the end of it we were faced with this enormous deficit, comparatively speaking, of almost £62,000,000, people might quite easily ask: &ldquo;Why did not the Government let us know what the facts of the situation were?&rdquo; Therefore, I published <Col N="2043" /> a White Paper which was drafted in most objective terms and on the most conservative basis.  Now, when forecasting, we can only proceed on the basis of past experience.  We were not gifted with far sight in regard to the future.</P>

      <P>We had no prescience whatsoever.  We were not like Deputy Dillon who, when after the Coalition under the leadership, I presume, of Deputy MacBride had decided not to break the link with sterling but to follow the £ down the course, came out and said that prices would not be affected in the foreseeable future.  He had very long vision.  Unfortunately that vision was not in fact very long because facts very quickly belied him. However, I have not the same gift of far sight as Deputy Dillon manifested when he came out in the latter end of 1949 and said that the devaluation of the £ would have no effect on prices in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the White Paper was to inform our people of the developing trend in our external trade and payments in the year 1951.  That was its title.  That was its purpose.  It was to give the facts and the figures a wider circulation so that the public generally would be <Col N="2044" /> aware of the seriousness of the deficit that was being incurred at that time and in that year, and of the dissipation of our external resources which that deficit would largely, though not wholly, involve.  Now, when we were dealing with this problem of a mounting deficit in our balance of payments we had to take into account that some part of the deficit could be attributed and was attributable to increased stocks of essential commodities and perhaps to some extent to increased home investments.  That was stated by me.  I brought that home to the people and I said that, taken all together, increased stockpiling and home investment would offset a fraction of the prospective £70,000,000 of external disinvestment.  I think, in fact, the phrase I used was that, taking all together, increased stockpiling and home investment would offset only a fraction of the prospective £70,000,000 of external disinvestment.  That conclusion. I think, has been substantiated by the national income and expenditure estimates prepared by the Central Statistics Office for the year 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of payments deficit for 1951 was published, as I have already informed the House, in June, 1952, in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> and was fixed and determined by the Central Statistics Office at £61.6 million.  I think we are entitled to consider very seriously not the White Paper itself&mdash; not whether it is tendentious nonsense, as Deputy Dillon has suggested&mdash;but what, in fact, has emerged.  The Central Statistics Office, for instance, has estimated that the gross domestic physical capital formation&mdash;I am sorry if I have to use these somewhat forbidding and formidable technical terms but these are terms of art and I have to worry the House with them&mdash; including the value of the physical change in stocks&mdash;the House will remember that there was a great deal of controversy about this particular aspect&mdash;amounted to £73,000,000 in 1941 as against £56.2 million in 1950&mdash; an increase, bear in mind, of only £17,000,000.  When I was trying to inform the country about this situation in 1951.  I said&mdash;and I have been challenged in regard to it&mdash;that we estimated <Col N="2045" /> that during the year 1951 the physical volume of stockpiling represented about £10,000,000.  What has the Central Statistics Office said?  Having pointed out their estimate, at any rate, for the year on the basis of detailed inquiries which they had been able to carry out and which it was beyond our resources to undertake, they estimated on the basis of these detailed inquiries that the value of the physical increase in stocks amounts to only £12,000,000 so that the difference between the estimate which I put to the people and which was published in October 1951&mdash; which was, in fact, prepared in August of that year&mdash;comes to £2,000,000.  We said in the White Paper that £10,000,000 represented the physical increase in the value of stocks.  The Central Statistics Office put the figure at £12,000,000.</P>

      <P>The figures which have been published make nonsense, I suggest, of the Opposition contention that the 1951 deficit was a deliberate and desired result of a policy of stockpiling and increased home investment. We came to the conclusion and we published it&mdash;and this, Sir, touches very closely upon the question of my responsibility for the administration of the Department of Finance&mdash;that imports of consumer goods would have to be reduced in order to adjust the serious lack of balance in our external payments.  That conclusion, I suggest, <Col N="2046" /> has borne the test of time.  We did not call last August or at any time for a reduction in imports of capital goods.</P>

We did not call in August 1951 for a reduction in imports of capital goods.  We emphasised&mdash;as Deputy Costello was at pains on many occasions to dilate upon &mdash;that the immediate need was for reduced spending on consumer goods and materials&mdash;many consumer goods which we could make for ourselves at home and which, since this Government took office, we are now making at home.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello, speaking in the Dáil on the 7th November, 1951&mdash;I am quoting from Volume 127, column 351, of the Official Report&mdash;criticised us for saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is evident that the dissipation of external resources represented by the incurring of balance of payments deficits merely to boost current consumption is proceeding this year on a much larger scale than 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts?  I had to suffer this sort of criticism all during last year because I had to support me only my own forecast and estimate of the situation.  What has now emerged? In the first place we find that the balance of payments deficit, which was £30,000,000 in the year 1950, rose to £61.6 million in 1951.  The net community saving fell to nothing in 1951 but personal consumption increased from £329,000,000 in 1950 to £360,000,000 in 1951&mdash;that is, by £31,000,000.  I think that we were fully justified in pointing out to our people that we had, one way or another, to try to curtail spending, that we could not go on importing from abroad unless we were prepared to produce more and export more, and tried to bring the <Col N="2047" /> gap between what we were selling and what we were buying into closer accord with our real circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded, perhaps by our exhortations, perhaps by the fiscal measures which we have taken, in closing that gap to some extent.  It is true we have been substantially helped by the increase in the volume of our exports.  That increase to date has been substantial and, I am glad to say and quite candidly admit, has exceeded my expectations, but then I am not one of those people who set my cap too high.  I am not one of those people who indulge in undue optimism.  I am one of those people who, in these matters, speak with reserve and speak only with an assurance that what I say in regard to financial expectations will in due course be realised.</P>

That is why all this attack has been made upon these people who have no purpose except to put before the people their fair and objective judgment of the situation as they see it.</P>

      <P>I was saying that it is quite true that while I did not anticipate, nor indeed did the statisticians who advised me in these matters anticipate, that there would be a considerable increase either in the volume or in the price of exports in the immediate future, our experience during the current year has been a very pleasant surprise indeed.  There has been a substantial increase during this year in our exports.  I think we all have reason to be gratified at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The real point about that is that the increase in the volume of exports, though it has been substantial, would not by itself have completely rectified the 1951 situation.  The increase in exports for the first ten months of 1952 as compared with the same period in 1951 is £18.9 million, a very gratifying increase indeed for <Col N="2050" /> which I think we can all thank the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>When I was making my forecast towards the end of 1951 I was careful to emphasise that the basis of these forecasts was actual realised experience, the experience which we had in the past.  Of course, while my forecast was based on the trade figures which had been published for the first eight months of the year, we had only provisional figures for <Col N="2051" /> September of 1951 to go on.  These became available to us when my forecast was already in proof, and they were dealt with in addenda.  Despite this fact, however, I am again going to be bold enough to suggest that the forecast which I made for the out-turn of the year 1951 was, on the whole, substantially accurate.</P>
      <P>I know, of course, that an attempt is being made by the people in the Opposition to deceive the public as to the nature of these Estimates.  They want to impress them with the idea that an estimate is a firm contract, something which you bind yourself to in the sense that you will be subject to penalties if you do not fulfil it. Everybody knows, of course, at least we do here in this House, what estimates are.  We know that they are subject to margins of error and that, in fact, over very short periods of time, the big factor in these estimates, that of external trade, changes in all sorts of unexpected and unforeseen ways.</P>
      <P>We have only to think of what happened, for instance, in regard to a commodity which was mentioned here in the course of an interruption from Deputy Dillon, that the price of wool soared to unprecedented heights early in 1950 only to collapse in a slump within a few months, of people rushing in to buy wool at the height of the wool market even though they were already overstocked.  You had the same with regard to textiles and boots and a great many manufactured articles in respect of which there was considerable overstocking because people went in to buy on a rising market.  Then, as the culmination of it all, there came, towards the end of 1951, the extraordinary measures which were taken by great trading nations like Great Britain, France and others to curtail and drastically restrict the import of all sorts of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the factors with which we had to contend in August and September, 1951, when we were framing our forecasts of the out-turn of the year.  I want to repeat again that, despite everything that has been said, there has not been a single figure in that <Col N="2052" /> forecast challenged.  Deputy Dillon had a motion down here in which he described the White Paper as &ldquo;tendentious nonsense&rdquo;, but he did not once address himself to the White Paper. Like the babe in the wood, he got lost talking about the timber which was exported across the Border.  His one and three-quarter hours' speech confined itself solely to that.  Not once did he come back to the White Paper except to mention the figure of £31.7 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying, and I want to come back to it again, that our forecast for the year 1951 was, on the whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Haywire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a close and accurate assessment of the position. Deputy Dillon has described it as haywire. Let us see what we did say. We forecast that the imports for the year 1951 were likely to be of the order of £212,000,000.  The actual figure turned out to be £205,000,000. I think that is very close estimating. Deputy Dillon, no doubt, in his business transactions, could go much closer than that, but myself, as an ordinary man not gifted with superhuman foresight, I think the fact that we had an actual realised figure of £205,000,000 of imports for the year 1951 as compared with an estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in August.  What we said in regard to September was this, that the figures for it made no <Col N="2053" /> appreciable difference to what we regarded as being the final figure.  The Deputy is anxious to get away from the fact that our forecast, made in August, was that the value of goods imported into this country would be of the order of £212,000,000.  We were less than 5 per cent. out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>20 per cent. per annum for three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we estimated that our exports over the whole year would be of the order of £83,000,000. There, once again, we erred on the other side.  When estimating our imports we erred in so far as we made an overestimate.  Again, we made an overestimate in regard to our exports because, while we estimated that our exports would be of the order of £83,000,000, in fact they were of the order of £82,000,000.  We estimated that our net invisible receipts would be about £60,000,000 as compared with the final figure of £61,000,000.  I think that one could not get, through ordinary human foresight and prescience, anything closer than those figures.  If one could, then I think human life would be a great deal easier, and we would not be subject to these fluctuations up and down which confound all our expectations when we experience them.</P>
      <P>What have we to say about the people who criticised the forecast which we made in 1951 on the basis of the 1952 results?  I think we should have little patience with these people. What has been the basis of the criticism which we have heard repeated so often from the Opposition Benches? When they blame us what they are trying to say is: &ldquo;Things have been so good in 1952 that you had no right to make that forecast of the position in 1951.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello said when he was challenging that estimate that he did not believe that the balance of payments deficit would be even of the order of £50,000,000.  When I talked about the balance of payments deficit being of the order of £60,000,000 in July, 1951, Deputy Costello, in August, described that figure as ludicrous. They were telling people that our forecast of the balance of payments deficit was completely excessive and that, therefore, there was no need to take any of the measures which we had to take to redress it.  Now that we have taken these measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  The Minister has expressly stated with regard to the remark he alleged he withdrew that it was a well-substantiated remark and, I submit to you, he has repeated in that form the objectionable statement which he already made and which you asked him to withdraw.  On a point of order I ask whether you are going to make him withdraw the remark again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to repeat that this uproar has arisen because of a remark which is well-founded and which has been substantiated by the facts.  I said that we warned the country in 1951 and that the country had responded because the public did appreciate the need to take measures to deal with this grave problem that we had inherited from our predecessors. <Col N="2062" /> The people did appreciate the truth which we were telling them: that if we did not deal with this balance of payments difficulty we were heading for bankruptcy.  That is the remark which produced all this uproar from the Opposition.  We had a response from the public.  We had that response in the shape of increased saving and reduced spending.  The change, of course, in the world situation, particularly with regard to raw material prices, and the action which we took, the fiscal measures which we took and the import restrictions which we imposed have, in fact, made 1952 a much better year from the point of view of both external and internal financial and economic stability than 1951.  We have had a great deal of criticism levelled at us because we did have the courage and the candour to tell the people what the position really was.  Now that the position has been so enormously improved we are criticised because of the improvement we have brought about. These after-event criticisms are of little value and I think that the only reason they are now expressed is in order to cloud the issue, to conceal the fact from the people that the policy of this Government has been in large measure successful in re-establishing financial and economic stability.  It is, I suggest, unfair to attribute to us something which we have never expressed.  We never said that the conclusions in the White Paper would be the sole foundation of Government policy.  That Government policy has been fully explained and was carefully outlined in the Budget speech.</P>
      <P>Again I want to be quite candid with the people.  It would be mere pretence to allege that the budgetary proposals were decided upon primarily in the interests of the country's balance of payments.  The first and most important cause was the unbalanced Budget which we inherited from our predecessors and the lack of balance in our accounts as we had to present them to the nation at the beginning of the present financial year.</P>

      <P>We were in the position that, by reason of the social security measures to which we had already given effect or which we then envisaged, we had not got and we could not get at the existing rates of taxation enough cash to meet our current outgoings.  That was a factor which was entirely independent of the balance of payments situation.  It was a factor which clamoured to be dealt with in its own right.  But in so far as it reduced the heavy deficit which was allowed to emerge on the 1951 Budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it had the secondary effect, and no less welcome because it was secondary, of alleviating pressure on the balance of payments. The main features of the 1951 economic situation were summarised in this year's Budget statement.  The review contained in that statement, however, was foreshadowed not only in the White Paper but also by my predecessor when he was introducing his Budget in 1951.  He, like myself, was very seriously perturbed about the position which was developing in regard to our balance of payments. Deputy McGilligan, who introduced the Budget on the 2nd May, 1951, was no less perturbed than I was when I came to succeed him in June, 1951, and found the position which he had left behind.  Here is what Deputy McGilligan said in his Budget statement in regard to this matter.  At column 1883, Volume 125, of the Official Debates of 2nd May, 1951, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.... It is, however, also desirable that the public should transfer to the State for the purposes of its capital development programme a greater share of the purchasing power now being expended on the less essential consumer goods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputy McGilligan was not as forthright as his successor.</P>

I have pointed out his mild expostulations which were addressed to, I assume, his wilder colleagues in the Government.

They neglected, as I have already emphasised, even to provide the revenue to meet prospective current expenditure.  If we had continued on the lines that our predecessors had mapped out for themselves, if we were to continue financing current and capital outlay largely by some variant or other of the printing press, the dissipation of our external sources would continue, and while we might enjoy false standards of comfort and living, they would have been followed by inevitable and unavoidable collapse.</P>

      <P>I was saying that Deputy McGilligan first warned the people of the seriousness of the situation.  I have already quoted one passage from his Budget speech in which he did that.  He went on to use even stronger language&mdash;certainly very strong language for Deputy McGilligan when he comes to addressing himself to an unpleasant task.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...there still continues to be a substantial use of past savings merely to lever up standards of consumption. Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The quotation is from the Dáil Reports.  Volume 125, column 1884. Let us dwell on that passage&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the manoeuvers made in this country from time to time and when we come face to face with the position where a costings committee or some members of it refuse to allow into costings what has been allowed in every industrial concern. Industrial concerns which go before the Prices Tribunal to get their prices fixed include interest on capital and directors' fees, and they are allowed on those.  But when we agriculturists come to look for the interest on our capital, to have it put on the price of our milk, and to have our farm management expenses taken into account, we are met by this manoeuvre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is time the Minister took a strong hand in this and insisted on taking the same line as the Minister for Industry and Commerce took when he allowed industrial firms to put it into their costings.  We have suffered severely on this point.  The Minister himself, when he was acting on a committee of the Beet Growers' Association, of which I happened to be chairman, <Col N="2072" /> supported the inclusion of both of these items in the beet costings and I am sure he will now agree that if they should have been included there they should be put in here.</P>
    <P>We have very early milk costings that were taken by University College, Cork, and the Cork Milk Producers' Association, under the chairmanship of Professor Murphy, who is also the chairman of this present Milk Costings Committee.  Those charges were not included then&mdash;neither interest on capital nor management expenses&mdash;and with those items excluded those costings were afterwards very maliciously used in this House by bombasts like Deputy Dillon to make a false case here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to do an injustice to the agricultural community.  Take any farm carrying from 15 to 20 cows.  If you were to buy them at present they would cost somewhere around £5,000. That money does not fall from Heaven. If that were the cost of putting stock on that farm, that cost should be counted, along with the cost of any machinery and implements which would cost a couple of thousand pounds more. If I invested that, instead of in land&mdash; that was criticised by Deputy O'Gorman the other day&mdash;in Midleton Worsted, I would be drawing 5 or 6 per cent. for the money; but because I invested the money in land I get nothing.  That is the manner in which this case was put.  Let us take the cause of the insecurity that has existed during the last few years in farm land. It is the decadent result of Deputy Dillon's policy and propaganda.  We have a reduction of 50,000 milch cows in the first year and a total reduction between 1950 and 1952 of 76,600 cows. Gone!&mdash;and those cows at the very modest production of 500 gallons a cow would give 114,881 cwt. of butter.  We imported in 1951 100,199 cwt. and paid £1,860,000 for it, to Brian Boru.</P>

      <P>I am suggesting, Sir, that the Minister should now put the same conditions into farmers' costings as the Minister himself insisted upon putting into the best costings when we were preparing them.  That is not looking for too much.  I am also suggesting that he should insist upon the committee carrying on their work under those conditions.  No committee should be allowed to break up on account of a frivolous refusal to allow honest costings into the make-up of their expense sheet.  Those costings are as honest as the costings upon which we farmers are charged for our artificial manures and everything else.</P>

      <P>Too long have they waved the costings prepared by Professor Murphy in our faces. Seventy-six thousand cows have gone on the strength of it and then they went over for Brian Boru's butter.  Let us get down to business on this.  I want to give the Minister plenty of time to answer me. I know I will not be answered in the same abusive, vicious and dirty manner in which I used to be answered from that very same corner where the present Minister now sits, when I raised the matter of the muck that Deputy Dillon was bringing in here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked me this evening by Deputy Corry was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what progress has been made by the Milk Production Costings Committee, and when he expects to receive their report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry has already quoted the reply I gave him.  I doubt if I have sufficient time to cover the history of the costings committee from the time I set it up over 12 months ago.  I might say that I agree with Deputy Corry that it is necessary that the farmers should have costings carried out not only in regard to milk, but in regard to every other commodity produced, in order to enable the farmers to get an economic price for their produce.  If they produce costings for any particular article produced on the farm they can say: &ldquo;It has cost me this to produce and I am entitled to a margin of profit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the milk costings commission <Col N="2076" /> was the first scheme I introduced when I became Minister.  I had for years, as Deputy Corry pointed out, endeavoured to have costings carried out regarding beet.  Beet was the only crop in respect of which costings could have been carried out because we had a guaranteed acreage, market and price for it.</P>
    <P>When I suggested this costings committee at first I thought that we would be able to have a scheme whereby we could give representation to every person involved in the production and in the consumption of milk.  Consequently I set about the matter by having the milk producers, whether producers who sent milk to the creameries for the manufacture of butter, liquid milk producers or producers of milk who were making farmers' butter on the farm, represented.</P>
    <P>In addition to that I wanted to give representation to the consumers so that when the costings commission made their report there would not be any criticism from anybody that they did not get representation or that they were not getting fair play.  Consequently I suggested a committee of eight giving representation to the consumers, statisticians and my own Department which is responsible for Government policy.  In addition to that I gave representation to the liquid milk producers and to the creamery producers.</P>
    <P>I might say that I did not get the co-operation I needed.  I asked I.A.O.S. to have regional meetings called all over the country for the purpose of giving me nominees to represent the milk producers on that committee.  The I.A.O.S. failed to get these nominees to represent milk producers.  Eventually it was necessary for myself to have the meetings called.  The meetings were called a second time and we got the representatives. After some time the committee was formed and it set to work. It held many meetings and many items were discussed.  Procedure was laid down.  Hand in hand with that the organisation was being built up.  I might say at this stage that, so far as the Government or the Department <Col N="2077" /> were concerned, we had no hand, act or part in arriving at the cost of production.  We set up an independent body&mdash;independent of the Government&mdash;which was to report to us the cost of producing a gallon of milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>In a letter dated 6th November, the chairman of the costings committee said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I very much regret that I have to inform you that the above committee have found it impossible to continue with the investigation into the costs of milk production.  The committee have found it impossible to agree as to whether or not provision for interest on capital and regard for managerial services should be included as an element of cost of production.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All my colleagues on the committee are equally sorry that the investigation cannot be completed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I, too, was sorry that there was a break on this question of managerial reward and interest on capital.  There are countries where these are included in costings and other countries where they are not.  I felt that it was possible to get over this difficulty, which has arisen, that there was a way out, and I forwarded my suggestion in a letter to the chairman on 12th November, in which I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret to learn from your letter of 6th November that the Milk <Col N="2079" /> Production Costings Committee find themselves unable to continue their work because of disagreement about the question of including provision for interest on capital and reward for managerial services as an element of cost of production.  I have been considering whether there is anything I could do to help the committee to overcome their difficulty, as I am anxious that this investigation, which is of such importance to the producers and to the formulation of Government policy, should be completed. I would, therefore, like you to put the following proposal before the committee.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the committee arrange that the report to be transmitted to me should contain two sets of figures, one including an appropriate calculation for interest on capital and managerial reward and the other excluding such calculation. In transmitting the report members of the committee would, of course, be free to make such comments as they may think fit.</P>
    <P>This, I think, would be a prefectly fair way of dealing with the matter and I should be glad to hear whether the committee find themselves able to continue on this basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was my suggestion to them.  In addition I had a conversation with the chairman.  I asked him to recall the meeting, and he did.  The committee met again yesterday and were unable to agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I should like to read the last letter from the chairman of the committee which I received on 19th November as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I wish to inform you that I placed before a meeting of the Milk Production Costings Committee to-day the terms of the proposal conveyed in your letter of the 12th instant, with a view to overcoming the difficulties of the committee on the question of interest on capital and reward for managerial services.  I regret, however, that the producer members of the committee felt unable to accept the proposal to forward to you a report containing two sets of figures as suggested in your letter. It will not, therefore, be possible for the committee to continue with the costings investigation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I very much regret that the producer members of the committee did not see their way to agree with my suggestion because, as I have already said, if they had done so, when the reports came forward to me, I would have one with managerial costs and interest on capital included and another with that calculation left out.  In the determination of the price of milk, it would be my duty and the duty of the Government to take into consideration every factor, whether the calculation was in or out, when that price determination was being made.  For that reason, I regret the attitude of the producers on this occasion, because, as I have said on previous occasions, I believe that costings constitute the Magna Charta of the farmers to-day.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have the support of the House in this matter, because I believe it is one thing which every farmer in the country needs and desires, particularly when he has to negotiate a price, whether with the Government or with consumers.  He must know when negotiating that price what his cost of production is. Once that has been determined, he is as much entitled as any other section of the community to get a fair margin of profit for his labour and his capital investment.  The organisation is ready to work&mdash;it is there.  We shall have to suspend it to-morrow, but I have taken the further liberty of asking the farmers who have already consented to participate in the work to continue to do so.  I am circularising every one of them and if a majority declare that they wish to have the costings carried out, my Department will do it, but I would prefer if that were not the position. I would prefer it if we could retain the independent costings committee&mdash;a committee independent of the Government and of my Department, with one of the most independent men in the country, a most eminent man, as chairman, who is prepared to carry out the costings inquiry&mdash;which I set up last year.</P>
