    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  There were two objects in establishing the Department of Social Welfare, over five years ago: firstly, to secure the co-ordination of the various existing insurance schemes and of the several assistance schemes which had developed more or less independently under several Departments of State; and, secondly, thus to provide effective frameworks for the rational development of those insurance and assistance services from time to time, having regard, of course, to contemporary social needs and the nation's economic resources.  Although in those five years there have been some appreciable improvements, progress towards integration has been negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to give the House an historical account of the growth of the social welfare schemes, as this has been done satisfactorily in the Department's first report, which is still readily available.  That report not alone describes the Department's activities in its first three years (1947-1949), but it also traces the history of each scheme since its origin.  It was designed to be a compendium of all that had gone before, and as such it will remain a useful work of reference for all who are interested in the development of our social services.  It shows that in 1931-32, after a decade of government by the dominant Party opposite, Exchequer expenditure on the social services now administered by my Department totalled about £3,250,000&mdash;the same as, or in fact a little less than it was at the commencement of that régime ten years earlier.  They could be described as ten years of inactivity were it not for the fact that the old age pensioner for part of the time had his pension reduced by 1/- per week. At the close of that administration, there were no widows' and orphans' pensions (contributory or non-contributory), <Col N="617" /> no unemployment assistance and no children's allowances, in fact, nothing more that the three schemes &mdash;old age pensions and schemes of unemployment and health insurance which had been in operation before 1922.</P>
    <P>The following 16 years (from 1932 to 1947, inclusive) present a more satisfying picture, although it is not all that some of us might desire.  Exchequer subventions rose from £3,250,000 to £11,250,000&mdash;an advance which averaged out at more than £500,000 each year&mdash;and we saw the introduction of unemployment assistance in 1933; of widows' and orphans' pensions in 1935; of wet-time insurance in 1942; of children's allowances in 1944; of miscellaneous social welfare schemes, such as those to provide footwear for necessitous school children and cheap fuel for necessitous households; and of many improvements in the scope and standard of the services which were formerly available.  I might mention, too, that during that period time and energy were devoted to the unification of approved societies under the National Health Insurance Acts as a first step towards the co-ordination of the social services.</P>
    <P>I have, on an earlier occasion, complimented my predecessor, Deputy Norton (who became my successor as Minister for Social Welfare in 1948), on his success in maintaining through his three years of office the rate of progress which characterised the 16 years preceding his term.  When I say &ldquo;the rate of progress&rdquo;, I mean progress in so far as it can be measured by Exchequer contributions.  State expenditure increased from the £11,250,000 in the financial years 1947-48 to £12,750,000 in 1950-51&mdash;and so he maintained the Fianna Fáil advance at the rate of £500,000 a year.</P>
    <P>No doubt we shall hear again of all that it was intended to do over and above what was actually done by the Coalition.  We are almost bound to hear about the intentions enshrined in the belated White Paper and of the proposals embodied in the abortive Bill of 1950.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> The first task of the new Department in 1947 was to effect the actual physical transfers of services from the Departments of Local Government, Industry and Commerce and the Revenue Commissioners, and to commence their integration.  The future organisation of the Department was worked out and the plan was progressively implemented as opportunity offered, every possible effort being made, in the process, to effect administrative economies.  It was decided that the main legislative programme would be taken in two stages: the first to embrace all the insurance schemes and to provide for their unification and such extensions as might be feasible; the second to deal with the assistance schemes, which also contained many anomalies and shortcomings which needed remedy.  This was considered to be the logical approach because changes in the insurance services would affect the scope and standards of the assistance schemes, which are designed to provide for the needs of persons not covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>So we set to work at once on the planning of a comprehensive insurance scheme and the preparation of a White Paper which would present to the public a review of the services and an outline of Government proposals for their reform and development.  I shall deal later with the progress made on this task.</P>
    <P>In 1941, the Government decided to do what they could for those sections of the community who were most seriously affected by the increased cost and scarcity of food and other commodities arising out of the emergency. Accordingly, they made additional allowances of milk, butter and bread to recipients, in urbanised areas, of unemployment assistance, old age and blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and disablement benefit. Similarly, they increased the weekly cash allowances payable to recipients of unemployment benefit in respect of adult and child dependents, and they undertook to recoup to local authorities the cost of supplementary food allowances for persons in receipt of home assistance.  The following year <Col N="619" /> (1942) and again in 1944 saw substantial extensions of these measures.</P>
    <P>My first act as Minister was to decide to discontinue these food vouchers and supplementary cash payments, and to substitute cash supplements in all the insurance and assistance schemes affected by them, at a cost to the Exchequer of over £2,000,000.  The broad principle observed was to give by way of cash the equivalent of the former food voucher or supplement, subject to the condition that, with one exception, the addition should not be less than 50 per cent. of the basic benefit.  Many of the increases, particularly in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, exceeded 50 per cent.  The exception I mentioned was that of rural old age pensioners.  There was no increase in the insurance contributions, the Exchequer undertaking full responsibility for the additional expenditure involved. All this was done&mdash;without fuss or trumpet-blowing&mdash;and was brought into operation on April 1st&mdash;during that first year when our main task was to bring the Department into being and to prepare a comprehensive insurance scheme for publication in a White Paper and then for legislation.</P>
    <P>The preparation of a comprehensive scheme was the major undertaking of 1947.  Most people are only too familiar with my predecessor's (Deputy Norton's) oft-repeated allegation that nothing was done until he came along in February, 1948.  In this House&mdash;at the hustings&mdash;in the High Court&mdash;in the newspapers&mdash;somewhere in Kildare &mdash;wherever and whenever opportunity offered&mdash;he made the completely baseless, and unscrupulous charge that practically no progress had been made on this scheme.  He found what he described on one occasion as &ldquo;a scrap of paper&rdquo;.  On another occasion when he was under oath and careful of his words, asked if the scheme had been in course of preparation when he took office, Mr. Norton replied: &ldquo;There were some notes there.&rdquo;  That, it should be remembered, was in June, 1949, almost a year-and-a-half after taking office as Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Lest any Deputy may think that Deputy Norton, as Minister, was left unaware of the progress made before his arrival, may I add this further extract from the same day's newspaper report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Norton said that when he went to the Department he asked what the position was in connection with the matter.  He was told orally, and he asked to have all the relevant data sent to him and he closely examined it.  He got that data, so far as it existed, from the Department within a few weeks of going there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could give much more to remind Deputies of the impressions which Deputy Norton, during three years of office, strove so assiduously to create in the public mind: on the one hand, a dilatory and ineffective predecessor who grossly neglected his work in the Department; on the other hand, a hustling, energetic, productive Coalition successor worthy of the description applied by a colleague&mdash;&ldquo;the strongest man on social security.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I assure the House that nobody knows the real facts better than Deputy Norton.  The real facts will be no surprise to him but they may astonish those who have accepted his account of important events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a search for what Deputy Norton chose to describe as &ldquo;a scrap of paper&rdquo; and &ldquo;a few notes&rdquo;.  I have refreshed my memory by references to the actual files&mdash; which I have here to hand at this <Col N="621" /> moment&mdash;and to a chronological record compiled at Deputy Norton's request for information in May, 1949.  This chronological summary dealt only with the main developments and the more formal conferences regarding the proposed White Paper and comprehensive scheme.  It did not, as was stated in it for the Minister's information, record innumerable general discussions, or talks on particular points, which took place between the Minister of 1947 and secretary and between the secretary and the higher officers concerned.</P>
    <P>The document says that during March, 1947&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;general consideration was being given to the question of a comprehensive scheme at the same time as negotiations were proceeding with the Department of Finance for the loan of an actuary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The actuary was transferred before March was out.  Early in April there were conferences of high officials and, in the light of them, a first memorandum was prepared under the title: &ldquo;Observations to assist discussions on the question as to who should be insured.&rdquo;  This was followed, on the 18th of the same month, by a direction that &ldquo;... the plans should be complete along lines which the Minister should be enabled to disclose in the White Paper which it is proposed to issue at about the end of this year&rdquo;. The direction proceeded to state that the preparation of a scheme on comprehensive lines should proceed apace even though it might be necessary to introduce it &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By the 2nd April another most informative memorandum emerged from the higher officers' activities, namely: &ldquo;Observations to assist discussions on the question of what kinds of benefits should be provided by insurance.&rdquo; This was followed a little later in the same month by: &ldquo;Observations to assist discussions on the question of the amounts of the various insurance benefits.&rdquo;  Next came a series of formal conferences.  Before the end of June a draft scheme was prepared at official level setting out (a) the classes proposed to be insured and (b) the benefits proposed to be provided.  As <Col N="622" /> Minister, I was kept informed of these developments and given copies of all the principal memoranda.  Before June ended a stage was reached where it was decided to hold a conference of all the principal officers of the Department, and to submit to them for their criticism and suggestions an outline of the scheme which had by then taken sufficient shape to make this move worth while.</P>
    <P>In July there was a formal conference with me at which progress was fully reported, and towards its conclusion I gave instructions: &ldquo;... to proceed with the preparation of the White Paper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In September and October the preparation of the White Paper progressed further in the form of four most important memoranda covering: (1) the proposed benefits; (2) the estimated expenditure; (3) the financing of the scheme; and (4) questions concerning the existing non-contributory schemes.  These memoranda constituted the basis of the scheme outlined in the White Paper which Deputy Norton published almost two years later. Deputy Norton knows well that by December, 1947, the preliminary rough draft of a large part of the proposed White Paper had emerged from these activities.</P>
    <P>Throughout January, 1948&mdash;before the Department had reached its first birthday &mdash; conferences devoted their attention to assistance problems, the insurance field having been adequately surveyed.  By the 29th of that month it was possible to set out those problems, and their proposed solution, in a further memorandum.  Early in February &mdash;by the 7th&mdash;the &ldquo;problem of the low wage earner&rdquo; had been similarly considered, and a method of dealing with it outlined in a memorandum for submission to the Minister.  The next conference&mdash;on the 11th February&mdash;applied itself to further discussion of the low wage group, the position of married women, voluntary insurance, marriage grants and transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>A week later this House changed the Government and the Department of Social Welfare was entrusted to Deputy Norton.  Ready to serve any Government, the officers of that <Col N="623" /> Department were plodding along, putting the finishing touches to their &ldquo;Outline of a Draft Scheme of Social Insurance&rdquo;.  The document was, in fact, being stencilled, the Secretary having directed that it be circulated, &ldquo;under urgent covering minute&rdquo;, to all senior officers for their observations prior to submission to the Minister. That was the stage reached when Deputy Norton entered the Department of Social Welfare as its second Minister&mdash;almost exactly a year after I had entered it as its first Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the House that I have recited facts as presented to the Minister in 1949.  It may seem an incredible story to those who have followed Deputy Norton's statements over the past four years.  Even I, knowing the facts, and having known them all along, find it hard to understand what enduring kudos it was hoped to win&mdash;what useful purpose it was hoped to serve&mdash;by the absurd pretensions (to put it mildly) to which we, and the public, have been submitted for so long.  Before I indicate the significance of the &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; and the &ldquo;few notes&rdquo;, may I make one thing clear? The &ldquo;Outline of a Scheme of Social Insurance&rdquo;, produced before Deputy Norton became Minister for Social Welfare, had not received my approval. It had not yet been submitted for the Government's approval.  My instructions to the Department were to prepare a fully comprehensive scheme with benefits which the officers considered equitable.  It would be a comparatively easy matter to eliminate what the Government might consider superfluous, or to alter the level of benefits.</P>
    <P>I had not officially expressed disapproval of any particular item, but I remember saying that I thought it to be unduly weighted in favour of the urban as distinct from the rural population.  I thought, too, that it involved too great a financial burden on workers and employers.  It was, nevertheless, a good starting-point and not, by any means, &ldquo;a scrap of paper.&rdquo;  Given a few more weeks of office, the document would have come before me formally with such additions or subtractions as may have <Col N="624" /> seemed desirable in the light of the criticisms of the senior officers to whom the final draft had gone.  It would then have been up to me to approve the scheme or have it modified, if I so desired, and then to submit it to the Government for approval.  Several times when in opposition I said sufficient data were ready when I left in 1947 to enable any Minister to decide upon a scheme inside a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He knew what each benefit would cost and what any alternative benefit would cost.  When I came back I did decide and this Bill appeared inside nine months.  Any Minister taking over at that stage should have produced a Bill in nine months as I have done now&mdash;not three years as Deputy Norton did.</P>
      <P>Here is the &ldquo;Outline of a Scheme&rdquo;&mdash;an original copy from the supply prepared as I left the Department&mdash; and beside me are the &ldquo;few notes&rdquo; that Deputy Norton referred to in the High Court&mdash;the various memoranda which, suitably amended, constituted the White Paper published a year and a half later.  Deputy Norton is, or should be, familiar with all of them. They represent an immense amount of thorough and painstaking work, done in a short time (less than a year) by officers who put so much into that great effort.  They represent work which should not be disparaged, or misrepresented, in this House or elsewhere, and I, at any rate, feel strongly that it is most unfair of any Minister, or ex-Minister, to attack his predecessor in a manner that carries the interpretation that his principal officers were idlers or obstructionists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am able to please those present, I will be well satisfied. The &ldquo;Outline&rdquo; which I left behind comprises three main sections: details of the benefits; scope of the scheme, contributions required and so on; and transitional arrangements to cover existing insured persons, etc. Summarised, they proposed that the comprehensive insurance scheme would embrace all persons, from school-leaving age to age 65 years, who are working for an employer under contract of service.  The benefits proposed included disability, unemployment, contributory old age pensions from age 65, widows' benefit, orphans' benefit, maternity benefits, marriage grant and death grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of disability and unemployment benefits proposed in this were 24/- weekly with additional 12/-weekly for a dependent adult and additional 6/- weekly for one dependent child or each of two dependent children; the rates for widows' benefit were 24/- weekly and 6/- weekly for each of two dependent children; the contributory old age pension proposed was 20/- at age 65 with 10/- extra in respect of a dependent husband or wife; the orphans' benefit proposed was 10/- weekly; the maternity benefit proposed for an insured woman was 24/- weekly for 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after confinement, and for a non-insured wife of an insured man, 20/- weekly for 4 weeks; a maternity grant of £4 was also included; the marriage grant proposed was £50 on first marriage and £25 on second or later marriages; and the death grants proposed were £6, £10, £15 and £20 according to the age of the deceased. The contributions proposed to carry these benefits were 6/10d. for a man and 5/4d. for a woman, divided equally between the employer and the worker, the State to supplement income to the extent, approximately, of one-third of the total cost.  An important feature of the scheme was that disability benefit was to be paid not <Col N="626" /> only during incapacity due to sickness but also during incapacity due to disease or accident arising out of or in the course of employment, thereby replacing the workmen's compensation code.</P>
    <P>To what extent were the proposals in this &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo;&mdash;these &ldquo;few notes&rdquo;&mdash;altered by Deputy Norton in the one and a half years before the White Paper was published in October, 1949, and the two and a half or three years before his Bill reached this House?  He dropped the proposals regarding incapacity due to accident or industrial disease.  He dropped the proposed marriage grants.  He increased by 1/- weekly the proposed additional 6/- weekly for one dependent child or each of two dependent children.  He increased the retirement allowance from 20/- to 24/- and the allowance for a dependent husband or wife from 10/- to 12/-.  Keeping to the fundamentals of the scheme which awaited him in the Department of Social Welfare, that is the sum total of the alterations which he made.  I am not quarrelling with Deputy Norton because of those changes, but it is hard to believe that any man could spend almost two years in making up his mind on such trivial matters.  Mr. Norton spent his days and, we are told, he often sat late into the night, in a state of indecision and when he removed the wet towel from his head he still wavered between 6/- and 7/- for a child.  I heard Deputy MacBride say at Clonmany in the East Donegal by-election that the scheme left by me had to be scrapped and a new one prepared. We know now that Deputy Norton did not scrap any scheme and that, in fact, he adopted it with a few minor changes.  Where did Deputy MacBride get his information?  Or had he any information on which to base such a statement?</P>
    <P>On the morning when the present Bill was summarised in the newspapers (14th March) there appeared also a Press release from Deputy Norton.  In it he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is clear that the provisions of the Bill in respect of sickness and unemployment benefit were the same as in the Bill I introduced early last <Col N="627" /> year.  Similarly, the provisions for increased contributory pensions for widows and orphans are the same as in my Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be hard to beat that for cheek or deceit or should we call it conceit? They were the same as in the despised &ldquo;scrap of paper,&rdquo;&ldquo;the few notes,&rdquo; which he inherited four years ago, except for the extra 1/- a week allowance for one child or each of two children.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the main provisions of the Bill are designed to achieve the major purpose for which the Department was established&mdash;the long-delayed integration, simplification and improvement of the existing insurance services.  It does all that.  We shall have, at last, as from October next, the single insurance card and the single stamp which will symbolise the administrative merger that will take effect in the Department's headquarters and local offices.  We shall have a situation in which workers and their employers will benefit from a simpler and more rational and economical handling of those services.</P>
    <P>It has been one of my aims, since I first became associated with Social Welfare, to bring about a more economical and efficient administration. Appreciable progress in that direction was made in 1947; no doubt the effort was maintained during my interval on the Opposition Benches; it continues now, and I am reasonably confident that the co-ordination secured by this Bill will keep down administrative costs.  Some of my predecessor's critics, during recent years, forecast an immense increase in the burden of officialdom if the White Paper scheme were to be implemented, one going so far as to say that it would require 2,000 extra officials to administer it.  That was, of course, nonsense.  We should administer this Bill without any increase in the number of officials, and I hope with some saving in that direction&mdash;and I am relying on the co-operation of the Department's staff of all ranks, to keep costs down and to contribute all they can towards a solution of the nation's present problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> It may interest the House, in this connection, to learn that in just over a year of the Department's separate existence there was a net reduction in staff of no less than 164, equivalent to £28,000 per annum in wages.  Each subsequent year since then has added its quota of economies until at the end of 1951 the total net reduction in staff had passed the 200 mark, representing a wages bill, at current rates of pay, in the neighbourhood of £60,000 a year.  In the present year to date the result of an intensive examination of organisation and methods in one large branch alone of the Department has yielded a saving of almost 80 in staff and a total annual reduction of £26,000. In addition, recommendations have been made for reorganisation in other sections which cannot be implemented until schemes are integrated by this Bill and the staff is co-ordinated in the new Store Street premises.</P>
    <P>The Bill also clears a great deal of deadwood, such as out-of-date or obsolete legislation and regulations, and it provides the increased and uniform benefits for sickness, unemployment and widowhood which have been my aim since 1947.</P>
    <P>There is no need to pause for long over the rates of benefit, which are clearly set out in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  They are, in the case of disability and unemployment, 24/- a week for a man or a woman, except a certain class of married woman, 12/- a week extra being payable for a dependent wife (or a woman having the care of dependent children) and 7/- a week for each of two children.  Thus, a man with a dependent wife and two children will receive 50/- weekly as compared with the present 35/- weekly for unemployment and with the present 22/6d. weekly for sickness, which is reduced to 15/- after six months. Similarly, the contributory widow will receive 24/- weekly and 7/- for each of two children.  Orphans' allowance will be 10/- weekly without the existing distinctions for widows' as well as orphans' pensions between employment in urban and rural areas and between agricultural and non-agricultural employment. Those discriminations have gone.  In regard to the new rate of <Col N="629" /> 24/- a week for widows, I should say that under existing legislation there are three different rates of 12/6d., 14/- and 16/- and a week.  Since by far the greatest number of beneficiaries under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts are widows without children, my proposal represents a very considerable improvement as compared with the present position.</P>
    <P>I find that at the 31st December, 1951, of 16,000 recipients of contributory pensions, over 11,300, or over 68 per cent., were widows without children in receipt of 12/6, 14/- or 16/- a week.  Of the balance, composed of widows with children, about 3,800, or 23 per cent., are in receipt of pensions of various amounts from 18/- to 28/- a week.  The increases in these cases will, in some instances, be as much as 16/- a week and in all cases not less than 8/6 a week.  A further 1,200, or 7 per cent., will also receive increases.  Thus, of the total beneficiaries, the proposal means an increase in pension for about 98 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a marriage benefit of £10 for female employed contributors. Maternity benefit comprises the existing lump sum maternity grant of £2, payable on the husband's or the wife's insurance or on both qualifications, and a maternity allowance of 24/- weekly for 12 weeks, payable on the woman's own insurance.</P>
    <P>Treatment benefits&mdash;hospital, dental, ophthalmic, and the rest&mdash;will continue as heretofore, subject to a maximum expenditure of £500,000 per annum which the Exchequer intends to provide without charge to the insurance fund or on the contributions of workers and their employers.  It is hoped that a comprehensive health scheme will replace these treatment benefits in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I shall deal more comprehensively with the costs of these benefits a little later.  For the moment, it is sufficient to say that, apart from administration costs, expenditure on unemployment benefit will, it is estimated, advance from the present (1951-52) £950,000 per annum to £3,000,000 per annum; disability, marriage, maternity and treatment benefits will go up from £1,920,000 to about £3,300,000; and contributory <Col N="630" /> widows' and orphans' pensions will increase from £880,000 to £1,250,000.  Totalling these items (and, again, for the time being, ignoring administration costs) the present 1951-52 expenditure on insurance benefits, amounting to £3,750,000, will be superseded by expenditure estimated to total something over £7,500,000&mdash;in other words, future insurance benefits will be twice the current amount.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware&mdash;and as Deputy Norton was quick enough to remind me in his recent Press release and Kildare speech on the shortcomings of this Bill&mdash;I had hoped to produce an insurance scheme which would not involve any or much increase in the existing workers' and employers' contributions.  Some Deputies will remember that on the Second Reading debate on Mr. Norton's Bill, I advocated that widows' pensions should be financed entirely out of the Exchequer and not by contributions.  I stated my reasons, which for the moment are immaterial, but I also mentioned the reasons that could be advanced against, one of which was that no Minister for Finance will readily agree to impose taxation in lieu of an existing source of revenue, even in deference to a colleague's wishes. The present income from contributions for widows' and orphans' pensions is about £1,000,000.  I was right.  The Minister for Finance did object, and I must add that my own officials were very relieved when I capitulated to that Minister, because they were at their wits' end to deal with the position that would arise for those who had contributed for some time towards a widows' pension.  The result is that contributions for widows' and orphans' pensions remain.  Were it not for that, my hope would have been fully realised.  The position, then, is that the ordinary male employed contributor now pays 1/11 weekly and his employer pays 2/- &mdash; that is 3/11 between them. I shall require 5d. extra from the man and 4d. extra from his employer.  A 20 per cent. increase in contributions for 100 per cent. increase in benefits!</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that the Coalition in 1948 took the same levy off the workers but gave <Col N="631" /> them no increase in benefits.  Mr. Norton proposed in 1950 to increase the 1/11 weekly by 1/7 to 3/6 weekly, or 1/2 in excess of the contributions which I am imposing.</P>
    <P>Certain long-standing disparities in the financial basis of our insurance schemes are ironed out.  No heavy burden is imposed on industry or the worker; and, leaving out of consideration the £500,000 to be provided by the Exchequer for treatment benefits without any charge on other contributors, we have succeeded in placing the insurance schemes, as a whole, on the basis of equal contributions of one-third from the State, the employers and the workers respectively.</P>
    <P>I should say, in passing, that there is one departure from this principle of one-third division to which I shall advert later.  The point I wish to emphasise now is that the contributions proposed are so near to existing standards that there is no danger of the scheme being unwelcome on the score of its impact on weekly wages and weekly pay-rolls.</P>
    <P>I have tried to keep down the number of special categories of workers creating a corresponding range of contribution stamps of various denominations. Unlike Deputy Norton and his Party, I believe that men working in agriculture should receive the same treatment during sickness and unemployment as their brethren in other industries.  This Bill assures that to them, but the decision to create equality of benefits presented me with considerable difficulty because it would be impossible to expect the average farmer and the farm worker to step up their contributions from 10d. and 9d. respectively to 2/4.  Deputy Norton, in his Bill, tried to overcome this difficulty by providing a low-wage group which, with a wage ceiling of £3 10s. weekly, was designed to segregate farm workers and their employers (and juveniles and domestics also) from the ordinary insured class.</P>
    <P>In the case of a male worker so employed, he provided for a contribution of 2/6, 1/- less than the ordinary rate, but the farmer employer would have been required to pay the <Col N="632" /> ordinary 3/6.  The farm hand would have been confronted with liability for 1/9 weekly over and above the 9d. which he pays at present, and the farmer would have had to pay 2/8 weekly over and above his present liability of 10d. weekly.  A much worse feature was, however, that special lower rates of disability and unemployment benefits were to be paid to persons within that special low-wage group.</P>
    <P>These proposals in Deputy Norton's Bill amounted to something which we on this side of the House could not accept.  I abandoned the device of the low-wage group.  I have made provision for full ordinary benefits for men in the agricultural industry.  I have provided for moderate contributions from the farmer and his man&mdash; 1/3 from each, which is only 5d. extra from the farmer and 6d. extra from the man.  This has been done by imposing a heavier charge on the Exchequer, and it is, if you like, a further subsidisation of agriculture.</P>

      <P>Instead of contributing an equal one-third with employers and workers, the State has, in respect of this group, undertaken to contribute four-sixths as against the farmer's one-sixth and the male agricultural workers' one-sixth.  This course, I admit, gives a marked bias in favour of agriculture, but the Party on these benches will face the criticism on that issue.  Agricultural workers, and farmers, are less well organised than their industrial and urban counterparts, and they cannot so readily shed increased charges or win compensation in the way of higher wages.  The Labour Party gave their willing and wholehearted support to the Coalition measure which would only allow 37/- per week to a sick or unemployed agricultural labourer with wife and two children.  I am proposing that he should get 50/-.  The Labour Party are contesting the Second Reading because I have departed from some of Deputy Norton's proposals.  Why not <Col N="633" /> include this departure in the case of agricultural labourers?</P>
      <P>I wish, now, to pass to another important difference between my predecessor's Bill and the measure before you.  The scopes differ.  In a country such as ours, with so many small- holders constituting so large a part of our main industry, it is wrong to apply the term &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; to any social service which does not include the self-employed within its scope.  In Britain and the severed Six Counties the self-employed are in with the employed, and it is accordingly correct to talk of their national insurance scheme as being comprehensive.  Here, we have not yet evolved, in either my Bill or Deputy Norton's proposals, a scheme which would merit that description. Deputy Norton appeared to be fascinated by the word, but the only suggestion of comprehensiveness was that all persons employed under a contract of service were to be insured, regardless of their rate of remuneration, their status in their occupations or the amenities they enjoyed.  The bank director would participate in the scheme on the same basis as the roadworker.</P>
      <P>True, power was taken to exclude classes of workers and to modify the scheme in relation to particular groups. Deputy Norton had reached the stage of agreeing with the Minister for Finance that established civil servants and officers of local authorities, for example, would be excluded.  I, too, agree with exclusions, and for that reason I have provided an insurability ceiling of remuneration at a rate not exceeding £600 yearly.  This is an advance of £100 on the existing ceiling of £500 which I introduced in 1947 to replace the then-existing £250 per annum.  To go farther than that&mdash; merely to give some colour to a claim to comprehensiveness&mdash;could not be justified in present circumstances.  I cannot see either the justice or necessity for the inclusion of classes that can never benefit.  I admit that their contributions would strengthen the fund, but I cannot approve of this hidden method of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his recent criticisms of this Bill, Deputy Norton referred specifically to <Col N="634" />&ldquo;the killing&rdquo; of that &ldquo;valuable feature of the inter-Party Bill&rdquo; which provided for death grants for every member of an insured person's family, varying in amount from £20 at age 18 to £6 at age 3.  I do not claim that I am providing a comprehensive scheme to meet all needs from the cradle to the grave.  Deputy Norton liked to create the impression that he was doing that, but he was not.  Those proposed grants towards burial costs, for example, would only have reached the households of the qualified insured.  I have tried to maintain the principle that any scheme which is needed by the self-employed as much as by the employees should not be included on the insurance side of social welfare.  The struggling small farmer&mdash;or anybody else of the self-employed or non-employed classes&mdash;would have received no such financial help in burying their dead, unless, of course, they were in such penury that recourse to public assistance was necessary.  They would have contributed, through indirect taxation and through the prices paid by them for goods and services, to the cost of this benefit conferred on their insured neighbours&mdash;this benefit which was to have been conferred even on the company director enjoying remuneration running to, perhaps, a few thousand pounds a year.</P>
    <P>That is only one of my objections. I admit Deputy Norton stole the idea, without altering a figure, from my &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo;.  I have been taunted before with having a prejudice against this form of benefit owing to my interest in one of the commercial companies which handle mortality insurance, but even that does not influence me one way or the other.  I shall refer again to the matter when I have dealt with retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>I come now to what I have substituted for Deputy Norton's contributory retirement pension at age 65 in the case of men and age 60 in the case of women.  There are a few facts which, however, I should like Deputies to have in mind when they come to consider this question of retirement from gainful and productive occupation in order to qualify for a contributory old age pension.  It has been stated on more than one occasion recently <Col N="635" /> by the Director of Statistics that the average age of the male farmer in Ireland is as high as 56 years, and 30 per cent.  of them are over 65 years. One-fifth of the farmers in Ireland are women, most of them widows, and their average age is actually more than 60 years.  When Deputy Norton decided to adopt the proposals in my &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; and offered an inducement, such as it was, to men and women to cease employment at ages 65 and 60 respectively, I wonder did he realise that management and production in our main industry is in the hands of so many who, according to his view of things, should be regarded as beyond their toil?</P>
    <P>When he passed for publication paragraph 83 of the White Paper, in which the reductions from 70 years to 65 for men and 60 for women are stated to be in keeping with the modern tendency and to follow a recommendation of the International Labour Office, did he consider the full import, in our country, of what the paragraph went on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main underlying reason for this tendency is the need to facilitate ageing workers who find it difficult to keep their place in industry owing to its quickening tempo and increasing mechanisation&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Surely this is not a sound reason when considered in relation to agricultural Ireland, where even non-agricultural industry is of the lighter kind, and the quickening tempo and increasing mechanisation are inappreciable?  Both he and the I.L.O., I suggest, had in mind a very different type of industrialisation from that which we have here.  Neither he nor the I.L.O. can have been thinking of Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>Even during the 20 years between 1926 and 1946 the expectation of life, at birth, for males in the Twenty-Six Counties increased from 57.4 years to 60.5 years&mdash;i.e., by 3.1 per cent.&mdash;and the comparable figure for England and Wales was (1930-32) 58.7.  This is a general tendency; in the United States of America life expectancy at birth in 1950 reached a new high of over 68 years, having doubled in about two generations and increased by no less <Col N="636" /> than 21½ years in four decades. Deputies should look at the percentage distribution of our population in the various age groups over the years and bear in mind the steady trend over the past century.  I shall refer only to the over-65-years' group.  In 1946 they formed 10.6 per cent. of our population as against 9.7 per cent. in 1936; 9.1 per cent. in 1926; 6.5 per cent. in 1901, and so on down to 3.1 per cent. in 1841. The population, here and elsewhere, is becoming increasingly weighted by old age.</P>
    <P>Our neighbours in Britain, who operate a scheme of contributory retirement pensions, are, largely because of it, facing what is almost a crisis in the financing of their insurance scheme.  I wish, also, to examine more fully the implications, as they affect our particular economy, of inducements to retirements.  In this last connection, it may interest the House to know&mdash;my authority is the Second Report of the British Ministry of National Insurance&mdash;that in Great Britain the monetary incentives of a pension at 65 for men and 60 for women have, in fact, played little part in encouraging retirement.  Nearly two-thirds of the men and half the women in that country go on working after those ages, although the retiring allowance is substantially higher than we can offer here.  Five years later, that is at age 70 years (men) and 65 (women), 30 per cent. of the men and 20 per cent. of the women are still at work.  Conditions generally are not comparable, of course, and there is, in that country's scheme, a monetary incentive to carry on at work in that a higher pension is, in due course, awarded to those who delay their retirement.  The experience in Great Britain goes to prove one thing, that we on this side of the House are nearer to the truth than the Labour Party when we say that most men do not wish to retire at 65 if they are in good health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with that; we have dealt adequately with that. <Col N="637" /> Higher non-contributory old age pensions at age 70, subject to a very liberal means test, are being made available without transferring two-thirds of the cost from the Exchequer to the insurance contributions of workers and employers.</P>
      <P>I hope that the House has grasped the full significance of what I have provided, in sub-section (2) of Section 16, as an alternative to retirement pensions at age 65.  There is, in that section, such a relaxation of the qualifications for unemployment benefit that any normally insured worker who has reached 65 years can draw unemployment benefit continuously until he attains pensionable age provided he satisfies the ordinary conditions that he is available for, and genuinely seeking, employment.  If he is unfit for employment because of ill-health, he is, of course, looked after by disability benefit.  These provisions should satisfy any Deputy who has a genuine fear that the man over 65 is no longer able to work, or if able, will not be offered employment.  I have very little doubt that when Deputies consider fully what is being done by that section they will agree with me that it is an incomparably better approach to the problem of the 65-70 age group than that which Deputy Norton sponsored.  It will surprise me very much if the general body of workers, who are far from enthusiastic about substantially higher insurance contributions, do not wholeheartedly welcome my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 65 to 70, then, any worker under this Bill may continue to work and draw his wage, or, if not able to work, or cannot find work, he can draw benefits equal to those offered by the Coalition as a retirement pension.  So far he is certainly better off.  At 70 he can get 20/- old age pension.  He may think that is too small&mdash;4/- less than that provided in Mr. Norton's Bill.  Is he prepared to pay for this addition?  I do not know, and for that reason I have not completely closed my mind to contributory retirement pensions.  It must be remembered that the State is now paying the full 20/- per week.  If we should at a future date consider a scheme it would fall to <Col N="638" /> be financed entirely by workers and employers and would be in addition to the 20/- per week at age 70 from the State.  If at any time I am satisfied that workers generally want such a scheme, I shall be prepared to produce it and, if they so desire, a scheme of death benefits as well.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the non-contributory pensions schemes for widows, orphans, the aged and the blind.  The provisions relating to widows and orphans follow the pattern of the contributory side of the scheme, and here again substantial improvement is being effected.  The present rate of pension for a widow without children is 14/- a week in an urban area and 10/- a week in a rural area. This will be raised to 20/- a week, irrespective of area of residence, under the Bill.  In this instance, of the 27,000 beneficiaries, about 22,000, or almost 82 per cent., are widows without children.  These, together with a further 4,000, or 15 per cent. (that is, a total of 97 per cent.) will receive increases of 6/- or 10/- a week.  Just under 99 per cent. of all beneficiaries will receive some increase in pension, and no widow will get less than she has now.</P>
    <P>The means test for widows' non-contributory pensions is very considerably relaxed.  Under present legislation, a widow will obtain a maximum pension only if her means are less than 7/- a week, or £18 4s. a year.  If her income is from personal exertions, she receives an additional income exemption of 10/- a week.  If she has children she is entitled to an additional exemption of 4/- for an only child or 8/- for two or more children.  As from the 2nd January, 1953, under this Bill, the £18 4s., together with the other exemptions applicable to the particular cases cited, will be replaced by a means scale under which the maximum pension will be payable if means do not exceed £52 10s. per annum, or just over 20/-.</P>
    <P>The proposals relating to widows' non-contributory pensions contain another feature, namely, the very large measure of co-ordination which has been achieved between that scheme and old age and blind pensions.  The relaxation of the means test has made <Col N="639" /> it possible to apply practically identical rules for calculating means.  These rules are contained in the Seventh Schedule.</P>
    <P>I come next to that important portion of the Bill which relates to old age and blind pensions.  Firstly, I want to remind Deputies that the Social Welfare Act, 1951, brought about an all-round increase in old age and blind pensions&mdash;increasing the maximum weekly rate from 17/6 to 20/- and providing for increases of 5/- and 2/6 down the scale.  Five shilling and 7/6 pensions were increased to 10/-; 10/- and 12/6 pensions were increased to 15/; and 15/- and 17/6 pensions were increased to 20/-.  The raising of the upper means limit from £52 5s. to £65 5s. a year provided for a new class of pensioners at 5/-.  Certain other concessions were given to the small farmer class, and to persons getting disability and similar pensions and charitable grants.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for a very generous further easing of the means test.  The lower limit, which is at present £22 2s. 6d. a year (8/6 a week), for the receipt of full old age or blind pension of 20/- a week, is being raised to £52 10s. (£1 a week). A person who has a pound a week income from other sources (when all deductions to which he may be entitled have been made) will now be able to qualify for the maximum 20/- old age or blind pension, instead of 10/- as heretofore.  The upper limit is being raised from £65 5s. (25/- a week) to £104 15s. (£2 a week), and persons with income over 25/- and up to £2 a week, as duly calculated under the Acts, will qualify, as from the 2nd January, 1953, for a 10/- or a 5/- pension.  All existing old age and blind pensioners at the 15/- and 10/- rates will have their pensions increased to 20/- and those at the 5/- rate will go up to 15/-, as from the appointed day.  Some 14,000 existing pensioners will benefit by these increases.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the pension officer reviewing every existing pension in his area and adjusting it to the appropriate new weekly rate, to take <Col N="640" /> effect as from the appointed day.  It will not then be necessary to follow the usual procedure of submitting questions for adjustment of pensions to local old age pensions committees, and this reviewing procedure will effect the adjusting to the new rates more expeditiously than would be otherwise possible.</P>

      <P>The Bill also amends the residence test by reducing the aggregate period of necessary residence in the State from 30 years to 15 years and by providing for five years' continuous residence up to the date of claim instead of the existing requisite of 16 years' residence after age 50 years in the case of a non-citizen.  The period of residence after age 50 in the case of a citizen is reduced from six years to five years.  The amendment is meant to bring the Acts more into line with modern thought in the matter of discrimination against aliens in countries subscribing to the views of the Council of Europe.  The residence provision in the case of blind persons is being similarly amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 80 is intended to avoid the somewhat anomalous position which has arisen where a widow who had been in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension is, on reaching 70 years, not qualified on residence grounds for, and as a result debarred from getting, an old age pension.  This arises under the Acts as they stand on account of the difference in the residence qualification as between the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts (two years) and the Old Age Pensions Acts (30 years aggregate and six or 16 years after age 50 years).  It is thought that the woman who had been granted the one pension on residence grounds should not in equity be debarred from the other on the same grounds.  This section exempts such <Col N="641" /> widow from the residence test for old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Seventh Schedule provides a codification of the existing provisions of the Old Age Pensions Acts (and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts) as regards the calculation of means, with some adjustments and concessions brought in, to the advantage of the claimants.  For example, the exclusion of home assistance in the reckoning of means is now given legal effect.  Any sums received under any other of the social welfare codes will no longer be reckoned as means.  Under the Old Age Pensions Acts, as at present in force, only grants from defined charitable organisations, up to a yearly maximum of £52 5s., are excluded from a person's means.  The new rules provide that a voluntary grant from any source up to the same maximum will be excluded in the calculation of means.</P>
    <P>The gross additional cost of the benefits of all kinds provided for in this Bill is estimated to be of the order of £4,250,000 in a full year.  Social welfare schemes of this kind run by my Department at present cost about £16,500,000 a year, so that when the cost of administration (estimated at something over £1,500,000, including allied services) is taken into account, the gross bill for social welfare will in future come to £22,250,000.</P>
    <P>Excluding administration, the services are divisible into the broad categories of insurance (including treatment benefits) costing £7,550,000 and assistance costing £13,150,000.  Apart from a receipt of about £250,000 from local authorities, the assistance bill will be met in full by the Exchequer, as will also the treatment benefits, but the insurance bill (as well as part of the administrative costs) will be provided by insured persons, their employers and the State and by the yield on the funds, as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The State will accordingly be called upon to bear £12,900,000 on the assistance side, £2,800,000 on the <Col N="642" /> insurance side (including £500,000 for treatment benefits)&mdash;an outlay of £15,700,000, to which must be added the balance of the administrative charges, making a total of about £16,750,000, as compared with the present figure of about £14,000,000. This increase of £2,750,000 does not, of course, include the cost of increasing the rate of old age pensions by 2/6 a week, which figures already in the present Estimates, and therefore in the figure of £14,000,000 mentioned.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of insurance stamps at present yield about £4,100,000, so that the increase in revenue from insurance stamps will be about £750,000&mdash; divisible between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>The costs which I have quoted are those arising in a full year.  In the coming year, 1952/53, the scheme will come fully into operation only for three months, but the increased benefits will be payable during nine months and the increased contributions receivable during six months.  These various features are estimated to have the effect of throwing a charge of something under £2,000,000 on the Exchequer over and above what is in the Estimates already, as compared with the charge on the Exchequer of £2,750,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt fully with the provisions of the Bill.  If I have not made myself plain to Deputies I shall endeavour to answer any further questions at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to services that are not included or not fully covered.  The proposals for maternity benefits are not as generous as those which first appeared in the basis for a White Paper prepared in 1947 and afterwards in Deputy Norton's Bill. As Minister for Health, I hope to produce a health scheme before long. This scheme will deal, amongst other things, with maternity and child welfare.  I considered it wiser to wait on the health proposals before altering the maternity grant now payable to the wife of an insured man.  It will be noted that the insured woman is well looked after in the Bill, because maternity benefit payable during her <Col N="643" /> absence from work falls properly to be dealt with under social welfare.</P>
    <P>The 1947 &ldquo;Scrap of Paper&rdquo; also recommended a marriage grant of £50.  Mr. Norton rejected the idea <i>in toto.</i>  I, and probably for the reason that prompted Deputy Norton, have reduced the recommendation to £10. It is as much as we can afford but I had a good reason for including it apart from a well-established custom. An undesirable practice has developed under which many insured women, on marriage, try to draw unemployment insurance or sickness benefits until their stamps are exhausted.  It is very often a dishonest transaction because the woman is neither disabled not seeking work.  It is better on the whole to give £10 and close their account.  If they continue to work or re-enter employment they must commence again the same as those entering insurance for the first time.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances and unemployment assistance are not mentioned in the Bill.  As I explained earlier, my first intention was to deal with insurance schemes only.  It is considered unfair, however, to leave non-contributory widows as they are while contributory widows are getting substantial improvements, their needs being equally urgent.  When it was decided to include non-contributory widows the question of means test arose.  Added to this was my promise to deal with the old age pension means test at the first possible opportunity. This explains the departure from a purely Insurance Bill.  It was always my intention, however, to proceed without delay with the preparation of an Assistance Bill which would deal with children's allowances.  The House may be assured that this promise will be honoured.  At the same time I have asked for a memorandum on unemployment assistance, which I propose to review.  The unemployment assistance code is very complicated. I would like to have it simplified somewhat on the pattern of unemployment insurance.  Being an assistance scheme the benefits must necessarily be lower, with a means test.</P>
    <P>The Government is serious about <Col N="644" /> this Bill.  It is intended to have increased benefits in operation by July 1st and the necessary funds for its implementation will form part of the Budget to be introduced next week.</P>
    <P>Once more I must refer to the proposals for a White Paper prepared by the Department in 1947.  Deputy Norton based his scheme on these proposals, departing from them only in a few details.  They followed Beveridge's plan for England closely and were, consequently, acceptable to Deputy Norton.  In any case, he was saved the trouble of thinking out an alternative scheme.  I considered the proposals unsuitable for this country.  I had to do my own thinking on alternatives and had to do it quickly as the Government were of opinion that too much time had already been lost.  I have to face a heavy handicap because opposite are Parties and Deputies who are not likely to believe that an Irish Minister could produce something better now to suit Irish conditions than the British article.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has put down an amendment which enumerates their demands for the inclusion of certain provisions in this Bill.  I have dealt with children's allowances, but I would not be human if I did not appreciate the unconscious compliment they pay me in saying that the Labour Party expects more from me than from Deputy Norton.  I have dealt extensively with retirement allowances and death benefits.  They also demand unemployment benefits for female domestics and female farm workers.  I confess that I could find no satisfactory solution for female farm workers except to leave them to be dealt with under unemployment assistance for which they will be eligible under this Bill.  When new proposals come along for unemployment assistance, they will probably be almost as favourable as the unemployment insurance proposed by Deputy Norton for lowly-paid workers and there will be no contributions required.  This is a question that can be discussed on Committee and I can assure the House that I believe I am doing what is best, but I am open to conviction if new facts are brought to my notice.  As regards <Col N="645" /> domestic workers, we all know there is no unemployment and not likely to be.  I consider it unnecessary and unfair to seek contributions from those women for unemployment insurance when we know that they cannot possibly qualify for benefit.</P>
    <P>I have gone into the scope of the scheme and given what I believe to be sound reasons for confining it to the classes who can qualify for benefits and are likely to need them.  I submit, therefore, that there is no case for the amendment on practical grounds and that it should have no support, except from those who hold doctrinaire views on I.L.O. Beveridge lines, but we are dealing with conditions in Ireland and we should frame our legislation accordingly.</P>
    <P>Those who are inclined to support this amendment will no doubt realise that they are thereby asking me to amend this Bill to the extent of including all that Deputy Norton had in his Bill in 1951.  That would necessitate a revision of the contributions which, the House will recollect, were computed to be 3/6 per week on the worker and 3/6 on the employer. A vote for the amendment, if seriously cast, will mean a vote for these contributions.  As a matter of fact, it means more than that, as I must explain before concluding.</P>
    <P>I have given an estimate of the cost of benefits per year and the cost of administration.  Against that, I have given the income.  The only service under this Bill that is likely to increase in cost with the years is contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  This, however, will not be a substantial increase, and it will be mitigated to some extent by a reduction in the cost of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  In the provision of income, I have allowed for the increase over three years.</P>
    <P>In the Coalition scheme, retirement pensions and death benefits were included. The actuary calculated that payments would go on increasing under that scheme for about 30 years and in the earlier memoranda the costs were given up to the 20th year.  This table appeared in every memorandum, including the final submission to the <Col N="646" /> Minister, but in the draft White Paper as approved by the Government, the portion of the table beyond five years was deleted.  If Deputies were aware of the full facts and if the full table had been left in the White Paper for publication, they would realise that 3/6 each for the worker, the employer and the State would not be nearly sufficient to meet the cost after some seven or eight years.  As a matter of fact, it would show that the State contribution would increase in 20 years from £4,000,000 to £9,000,000.  The Government had its own reasons for suppressing this information&mdash;whether good or bad, I do not know.  I suspect that the Fine Gael members of the Government insisted on the suppression as they were afraid of the reaction on their own members.  It is well that the Fine Gael back bencher should not be left in ignorance any longer, and that he should know what he is asked to vote for by his allies in the Labour Party. I recommend the Bill to the House, and I ask for its approval without amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I say, and I assert it, challenging anybody to prove the contrary, that in the Department there were a number of heads of things that might or might not go into a scheme of social security.  In the main, these features were got from the British scheme of national insurance and the British documentation about this scheme was more obvious in the Department than any documentation about our decided scheme, because there was no decided scheme at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister read a list of things that happened, a list of the progress on the comprehensive scheme, as he called it.  He started off in April, 1947, with a memorandum of observations to assist discussions on the question as to who should be insured.  Then there came a series of formal conferences down to the 21st July, and the Minister appears at the formal conference on the 21st July, when it was stated that he was there.  The minute of the meeting shows that there was a <Col N="650" /> general exchange of views and that costs were to be prepared.  There were no costs up to then.  Then there is a record of certain memoranda being prepared.</P>
    <P>Right through the whole lot there was not a single decision given on any one of the hundreds of issues which had to be decided before any scheme of social security could ever see the light of day.  The Minister knows perfectly well that he gave no decisions on the hundreds of issues which I had to decide subsequently, and the officials of the Department of Social Welfare, with one exception, will, I have no hesitation in saying, submit to the Minister an abundance of memoranda which were submitted to me for decision. They got those decisions.  They could never have got the decisions were it not for the fact that I took them, and thus smoothed the path of the present Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We are told that Fianna Fáil had a ready-made plan in 1948.  That is a falsehood.  There was no ready-made plan there, and I defy anybody in the Department of Social Welfare to produce a ready-made plan.  Is it suggested now that these officials, in 1948, 1949 and 1950, were idling their time, fooling about looking for decisions which had already been taken?  Is it suggested that they were looking for another plan when there was a plan there?  There was no plan there. There were heads there, heads that you could get in any booklet on social security in any country in the world. Not a single decision was taken on any one of these heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us deal with some of the points raised by the Minister before we deal with the Bill proper. When I went to the Department of Social Welfare in February, 1948, one of the first things I wanted to do was to raise old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions and to modify the means test because I felt our people were being treated outrageously in the low rates of benefit which were then being paid to them.  When I went to the Department of Social Welfare, I said to the <Col N="651" /> Department that I wanted to tackle this question, that I wanted to deal with this question as a matter of priority.  The advice I got there from certain people was: &ldquo;Do not touch the assistance schemes.  Leave them over. Leave the old age pension over.  Leave the blind pension over.  Leave the non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions over.  What we want to do is to deal with the comprehensive scheme, to deal with the White Paper.&rdquo;  I took this simple decision: I had to choose between producing a White Paper, which was the advice I then got, or concentrating my efforts at that time and in that year on producing legislation which would raise old age pensions, blind pensions, non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions and which would modify the means test.  I rejected the advice I then got&mdash;I am delighted since that I rejected it&mdash;and, instead, I put through this House the Social Welfare Bill of 1948, a Bill which put £2,500,000 into the pockets of blind persons, old age pensioners, and recipients of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  They got that £2,500,000 in 1948 from us and under my Bill and they have got nothing like it since and they will not get it under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What do we find?  In 1948 the maximum old age pension payable in a rural area was 12/6, with the prospect that if you were untouchable because of your poverty you might squeeze another 2/6 as a maximum out of a home assistance officer&mdash;who had not enough money to give you the 2/6. That was the position then.  We lifted that 12/6 up to 17/6.  We did in one year more than had been done in the previous 30 years for old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  We gave them 17/6 instead of 12/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were going out of office last year we put through a Second Reading in this House a Bill to increase the 17/6 to £1 and we left the money in the Budget to pay the £1 which they are getting to-day.  Read <Col N="652" /> the speech of the Minister for Finance last year and you will see that he specially refers to the fact that portion of the £1.5 millions then provided in the Estimate was in respect of increased old age pensions and blind pensions for six months of this year.  That is there and the Department officials know that authority for the expenditure of that money was given by the Government and provision was made, as you can see by reading the speech made on the Budget last May, for the payment of these increases.  Let us see what was done in 1948.  Old age pensions were increased, blind pensions were increased, widows' and orphans' pensions were increased, the means test was modified.  Old age pensions were lifted from 12/6 to 17/6&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a result we did immeasurably more for the old age pensioners in our short period of office than was ever done for them since the Old Age Pensions Act was introduced in 1908.  £2,500,000 found its way into the pockets of those unfortunate people.  Fianna Fáil never gave them anything like £2,500,000 in a single year.  They are getting that to-day, thanks to my Bill of 1948 and thanks to my colleagues in the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister sought to give the impression that he had taken decisions. There is a Cabinet procedure in relation to Bills and in relation to Government decisions.  Before you introduce a Bill here in the House you have to circulate draft heads of it to Departments and get their views.  You have to get their views on a summary of the Bill and get their views on the complete Bill.  You have to get Finance approval and Government approval. It is a long and painful process, especially to any Minister who wants to push these things through; but it is a long-established procedure and those who defend it say that in the long run it makes for haste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is something I could never see, but the wiseacres say that it is so.  All that long procedure had to be gone through before you could say you had a plan approved by anyone.  Not a single one of those steps was taken <Col N="653" /> towards having a Fianna Fáil plan ready, and if the Minister for Social Welfare alleges to the contrary, let him bring the documents to the House and read them before this debate concludes. I venture to say that he knows as well as he is sitting there that he never took any of those steps and that, whether what was in the Department was heads, or promises of consideration, or probabilities or maybe improbabilities, they never got to the stage in which a single vote or decision was taken on any scheme.  The record of the Minister's discussions on the progress of a comprehensive scheme proves conclusively that there was no scheme in the Department which had the approval of anyone, even of the Minister, when he left office in 1948.</P>
    <P>In fact, of all these conferences over a year, the Minister attended only one of them&mdash;only one of them&mdash;and the only note I could find in the Department under the Minister's head was one sentence, in which he expressed astonishment about the number of people whose income was below £3 10s. and the number above £3 10s.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a marriage grant.  I was anxious to put a marriage grant into my scheme.  I would still like to do it.  I do not want to discuss in public why it did not find its way into the scheme, but the Minister's officials know and can advise him as to why it was finally dropped.  It was not the money; there were other considerations. It was not that I wanted to abandon it.  It was discontinued on certain advice, but it was no desire to save money that resulted in dropping the provision for a marriage gratuity. In any case, I proposed to enable a person to get a marriage gratuity in different circumstances from those in which the Minister is giving it.  I proposed to give to an insured man and an insured woman, any time they decided to marry, a certain gratuity, and the contributions would be loaded accordingly.  The Minister is merely giving a gratuity when the insured woman marries.  I suppose that the number affected by this provision in any one year will not be very large, and, in any case, the Minister is doing very little more than giving to that person in many instances the accumulated <Col N="654" /> credit standing in that person's name in the funds of the society.</P>
    <P>There are some other points mentioned by the Minister.  He said that in our Bill we proposed to give a lesser rate of benefit to farm workers in respect of sickness and unemployment. We had the problem in 1948 and 1949 of dealing with the question of the lowly paid worker.  We had to look at two points of view&mdash;one, could he pay the same rate of contribution as the higher paid worker; and, two, if you gave him the same rates of benefit as the higher paid worker you would probably bring his rates of benefit very, very close to, if indeed not in excess of, the wages which he was actually receiving and it was felt that in the beginning that would be an imprudent course on which to embark. But the problem of the lowly paid worker has gone.  The last Government solved that problem.  No agricultural worker to-day has less than £3 10s. per week, thanks to the inter-Party Government, thanks to the efforts of the trade union concerned to get them higher rates of wages. Under my Bill those people would not now be getting a lower rate of benefit than the ordinary worker because they, being over 70/-, would get the same rate of benefit and pay the same contribution as every ordinary worker for sickness coverage and unemployment benefit.  It is dishonest, therefore, to contend that my Bill would have given the agricultural worker a lower rate of benefit.  He would have got the same rate as a carpenter under my Bill&mdash;for one reason, because he had more than £3 10s. and so had the carpenter. The Minister tries to pretend that in our Bill we were giving him a lesser rate of benefit.  We never referred to the agricultural worker in the Bill at all.  Anyone who prepared the brief ought to have known that.  We referred only to people paid below £3 10s.  We took it not on a vocational basis or on grade or craft basis but on a salary and wage basis and we said: &ldquo;In the case of a young person, an apprentice or an improver or the generality of people who start off at a low wage, they pay a lower rate of contribution and you have to watch the benefit on the other side; but they <Col N="655" /> will grow out of that situation and once they move over £3 10s. they will get the full rate of benefit under our scheme.&rdquo;  The Minister knows that, and if he were honest he ought to admit it.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about civil servants and the possibility of exempting them under the scheme.  Of course it would be an impudence to try to bring established civil servants, teachers, Gardaí or the Army in under a Bill of this kind.  It is a shadow, and only a shadow, of the Bill which I introduced in this House last year.  Under that Bill you could have justified bringing in those people because it was a comprehensive scheme which applied to everybody employed under contract of service.  In justification you could point to the scheme and say: &ldquo;It is a good scheme.  It provides you with retirement pension at 65 with an allowance for your wife as well, with death benefit, increased maternity grant and maternity allowance.&rdquo;  Every one of these things is almost certain. Almost every person will reach the age of 65, and everybody who reaches 65 will get benefit; there is a reasonable prospect of that, and they will get an allowance for their wives.  Certainly they will die or some of their family will die and they will get the benefit, while if children are born they will get increased grants and allowances.  You could say to civil servants, Gardaí or soldiers: &ldquo;If you are included in the scheme there is a very good chance that you will get benefits of this kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should they be asked to pay for this piece of legislation?  They are to be insured only for sickness and unemployment. They will never get the old age pension if they have an ordinary pension because the means test will disqualify them and the only other thing which is covered is the widows' and orphans' pension, and that is already covered if they have less than £500 a year.  To bring them in under a Bill of this kind is a piece of impudence. It is nothing but that to expect them to pay these contributions for risks which can never materialise.  If the Guard, teacher, civil servant or soldier is sick he gets sick pay from <Col N="656" /> the service in which he is employed. He is not likely to be unemployed because he is in regular employment. Why ask them, therefore, to pay for these two risks when you have taken away every other tangible benefit which they could have got under the scheme which I introduced?</P>
    <P>If it is intended to bring them into this piece of legislation it is only for the purpose of buttressing the Exchequer, for the purpose of getting money out of their pockets to help to pay the Exchequer allocation to the scheme, because the Minister knows, and the civil servants, teachers, Gardaí and soldiers know that they can never get a benefit.  The Bill is a tax, as they have no chance of ever getting the limited benefits provided.  To their certain knowledge, they now cannot get the benefits provided in my Bill of 1948.</P>
    <P>Let me go on to the Bill proper.  The Minister is fortunate&mdash;although apparently he does not recognise how fortunate&mdash;in that he had not to spend much time considering the Bill and making decisions upon it.  This was a ready-made Bill as far as the Minister was concerned.  Its principle had been approved by this House on Second Reading.  Decisions had been given on all major matters, not only those contained in the Bill but those which would flow from it, and an administrative machine of substantial dimensions had already been built up in the Department of Social Welfare.  During my time there a number of highly placed and competent officers were withdrawn from their normal duties to perfect an administrative machine which would take the impact of the Social Welfare Bill when it passed into law.  The Minister, therefore, was placed in the position that he had a ready-made Bill, decisions on every matter of importance and an administrative machine.  He could at any time have ascertained from his officials the amount of time and energy that went into these decisions and the building up of the administrative machine.  Let the Minister ask them whether there was any delay in its preparation.  Let him ask them whether they were not pressed, day in <Col N="657" /> and day out, by me to produce the Bill with the utmost expedition.  I know that they worked hard-those with whom I had intimate contact.  They were necessarily cautious in dealing with a Bill of this kind and sometimes I was impatient and irritated.  On reflection, one regrets that, because it was driving willing officers too hard. I would pay this tribute to those with whom I had intimate contact: they worked hard and they worked willingly; each and every one of them was imbued with one idea, to produce the best possible scheme for social welfare to fit the needs of the Irish people, and they were concerned with neither a British scheme, a German scheme nor any other scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister could if he wanted have re-introduced our Bill unaltered, but he did not do that.  The Minister had one simple task: To use the axe for the purpose of cutting down the benefits we provided, and no special skill was needed for that because this Bill is exactly the same as the one we introduced except that many valuable benefits of importance to the workers have been removed, and now the workers will not get the benefits we provided for them in our Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been fortunate in another respect.  When we were working on this matter we brought in a very comprehensive White Paper on social security.  Here again I would like to pay tribute to the officers who were personally responsible for the preparation of that document.  It does them credit; it does the cause of social security credit; it does their intelligence credit because they threw into the public arena for discussion a White Paper on a highly technical subject for the public, who were not too well informed on social security problems, to chew on, so that they could ascertain the basis on which social security could be reared.</P>
    <P>The moment we issued that White Paper a flock of critics and cranks descended vulture-like on the document, and the grossest of misrepresentation was indulged in by many of these worthies.  Some of these people, of course, were just natural or traditional cranks; some were fighting against <Col N="658" /> any improvement in the condition of the workers, which is the special recreation of some cranks in the community; some were fighting to preserve vested interests, so that they would not be disturbed.  I could understand, even if I did not agree with, an individual who wanted to fight for the maintenance of privilege and vested interest; I can make allowances for the traditional cranks, the soreheads, a proportion of which inevitably infiltrate into every community, but I must say that I was impatient and intolerant of the uninformed critics, some of whom should have known better, and their approach to the problems which we presented in the White Paper. Some of these people set themselves up as moralists, to advise the Government and to advise Parliament what should be done.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that so far as many of them were concerned, the difficulty was that they mixed their politics with their morality and we got a hotch-potch from the political moralists whose views on this, or any other matter, are of very little concern to people who want to get down to basic truth.  We had to fight these people. We had to deal with these people.  We had to develop counter-arguments to be used against these people.  It was not a very easy task particularly in view of the fact that our political opponents at the time were gleefully rubbing their hands because the political moralists outside were supporting the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I have before me a Press cutting showing what one of these gentlemen says about our social security scheme. Heaven knows, his degrees ought to have inoculated him against giving utterance to such stupid views.  He said the scheme would cause the collapse of the savings movement because people would not save when the State would look after them in their old age. He said it was a piece of class legislation which discriminated against the poor and the casual worker, who were cut out from benefit, while it catered for such classes as bank managers and High Court judges.  He said employers did not want it.  He said it would <Col N="659" /> encourage idleness amongst a certain class which would not work while they could get paid to be idle, even though there was an abundance of work in the country.</P>
    <P>These views are typical of the lying statements made against the workers here: they will not work.  Every decent, honest, Irish worker is only too anxious to work.  The last place he wants to go is into the employment exchange either to get unemployment benefit or employment assistance.  His sole concern is to get work, and keep that work so that he can provide for himself and his family.  Lying statements of that kind are not only unworthy of those who make them, but they do a gross disservice to and are a serious libel on honest, decent workers here.</P>
    <P>That was the kind of propaganda we had to put up with; that was the kind of propaganda we had to meet.  That was the kind of propaganda that is apparently absent to-day for one of two reasons: one, either because we dealt with it at the time and killed it by counter-argument, or, secondly, the moralists have turned out to be merely the political followers of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and that also is true&mdash;and were more concerned with trying to discredit our scheme from the political angle than they were with examining its moral basis.</P>
    <P>This scheme is exactly the same as our scheme in its basis.  There is no difference whatsoever between the basis of this scheme and the basis of the scheme we introduced.  This scheme requires contributions from the worker, contributions from the State, contributions from the employer.  Our scheme was identical.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy's talents are specially reserved for Strasbourg.  As I said, I would have <Col N="660" /> appreciated these folk had they shown a really sympathetic approach to the problems of the ordinary worker here. I think it is asking human nature to endure too much when one finds smug people, who do not know what it is to lose an income through sickness or idleness, who have not the problem of providing for a wife and young family through the medium of running into debt and whose old age is insulated against the possibility of poverty, climbing on to the band wagon of vested interests and engaging in a campaign against a Bill which was designed solely for the purpose of giving a better deal to the toiling masses of our people.</P>
      <P>I had little use for those people and I think it is a tribute to this House, notwithstanding all the propaganda from the Fianna Fáil Party and from the so-called political moralists, that the Bill was able to get a Second Reading.  It showed at all events that this House, or the free section of it, regarded the vapourings of those who mix their morality with their politics as just so much clotted nonsense.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now in the happy position, apparently, that he has none of these noisy critics around him.  For that he must thank his predecessor in large measure for having borne the brunt of the Victorian views and the deliberate misrepresentations of those who unleashed their fury on the Bill for which we were responsible.  When the Fianna Fáil Party left office in 1948 we were told within a few days of their leaving office that they had a plan.  We were told that the plan was a ready-made plan.  It was one of those Fianna Fáil plans, ahead of everything else, a regular record-breaker, something that would be a world wonder and convulse the intellectual talents of our people the moment they were permitted to gaze on that plan.  So far as that type of propaganda was concerned, I think I have shown that in fact Fianna Fáil had no plan; they had a collection of hasty headings without a single decision having been taken under any one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not until 1951 that we began to get a glimpse of the so-called plan. We got it then at the end of a long speech by Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then <Col N="661" /> was, on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill, 1950.  Deputy Dr. Ryan then unfolded his plan.  He told us it was the plan for which Fianna Fáil stood.  He told it was the plan Fianna Fáil would implement. He was quite satisfied that the plan would be a satifactory one so far as the masses of the people were concerned.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about the speeches on that Bill was the unanimity of the Fianna Fáil view that a comprehensive scheme was necessary.  That was one of the claims made by Fianna Fáil when my Bill was under discussion. Deputy Dr. Ryan said he was in favour of a comprehensive scheme. Some other members of his Party deplored the fact that there were exclusions in my Bill and they believed that everybody should be covered.  Deputy Dr. Ryan returned to say that the scheme they would bring in would be a better scheme so far as those affected by it were concerned.</P>
    <P>Later, on the day after this matter was discussed in the Dáil, the Fianna Fáil Press organ published a statement setting out what the Fianna Fáil proposals were as compared with the proposals made in the Bill introduced by the Government.  Now it is worth while examining the promises then made by the Fianna Fáil Party in respect of social welfare and their performance as revealed in this Bill, and at the same time to observe the similarity between the good points in our Bill and whatever good points are in this Bill.  For example, in our Bill we provided sickness benefit at the rate of 24/- for an insured person, 12/- for the wife and 7/- for each of two children.  That is exactly the same as is in the Fianna Fáil Bill.  Word for word and line for line it has been taken from our Bill.  We proposed to provide unemployment benefit at the same rate as sickness benefit.  In our Bill we provided for a maximum of 50/- per week for a man, his wife and two children.  In this Bill the provision is exactly the same as in our Bill.  Word for word and line for line the whole section is copied.  In our Bill we proposed to raise widows' and orphans' pensions &mdash; contributory pensions &mdash; to 24/- for a widow, with 7/- for each of <Col N="662" /> two children, making a total of 38/- per week.</P>
    <P>That is the same as in this Bill, every word having been lifted from our Bill, so that on these three special points this Bill is exactly the same as the Bill we introduced.  The matter is taken holus bolus from our Bill and put into the Fianna Fáil Bill, but there are some other points which were in our Bill and which are not in this Bill and not in the Fianna Fáil memorandum. In our Bill we proposed to pay a maternity benefit of £5 to a person on childbirth.  The allowance is £2 to-day. We proposed to give £5; Fianna Fáil have cut it back to £2, the same as it is to-day and the same as it was ten years ago.  We proposed to pay a maternity attendance allowance to a woman, following childbirth, so that she could get some domestic attendance, or other assistance, in her household after the child was born. Fianna Fáil are silent about that in their proposals, and there is no provision in this Bill.  We proposed to provide a death benefit varying from £20 in the case of an adult of 18 years of age and over, to £6 in the case of a child under three years of age.  There is no mention of that in the Fianna Fáil counter proposals, and this Bill makes no provision for it either.</P>
    <P>We proposed to provide a retirement pension at 65 for a man if he elected to retire and an allowance for his wife, irrespective of her age, or if the wife were industrially insured, she would be entitled to a pension at 60 and not 65 years of age.  That provision was in our Bill.  It was not in the Fianna Fáil counter proposals, and it is completely omitted from the Bill which is now before the House.  So that at least there is one thing the Minister for Social Welfare can be congratulated on.  It is that he apparently will never reach fame in the production of comprehensive social security schemes, but rather in wielding the axe and in cutting down benefits.  He has already established a good reputation upon the manner in which he has mauled the Bill which we offered to the House early last year.</P>
    <P>But there are some other interesting examples of the difference between precept and practice.  In the counter <Col N="663" /> proposals which were issued by Fianna Fáil on the 3rd March, 1951, we were told that everybody who had not £2 per week would get a full old age pension&mdash;the £1 per week which we provided for.  Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;If you have got £2 that is all right; come along and we will give you another £1 which the inter-Party Government has provided.&rdquo;  What does the Bill do? The Bill says that if you have got £2 0s. 3d. you will not got the £1, you will only get 5/-, and if you have £2 0s. 4d. you will get no pension at all.  Yet this was the Party which was going to give the full pension of £1 per week to everybody who had not more than £2 per week.</P>
    <P>We were told in this scheme that Fianna Fáil would provide an additional children's allowance of 2/6 per week for all children after the third or fourth as may be covered by £500,000 per annum.  There is no provision in this Bill for giving them another farthing.  There is no provision for spending that £500,000.  Fianna Fáil has run away from that part of their promise made in March, 1951, as they have run away from other portions of the promises they made to which I have just adverted.  On top of that, they wanted a comprehensive scheme then with no exclusions.  This scheme has more exclusions than ever before.  We were promised then that there would be no increase in contributions.  The Minister for Social Welfare now admits that he is going to raise another £750,000 in additional contributions, although in the Fianna Fáil proposals, published in the White Paper, he says: &ldquo;No increase in contributions, the increase of £4,500,000 was to be in taxation.&rdquo; In March, 1951, he says: &ldquo;No increase in contributions&rdquo;; in March, 1952, he admits in this House that he is going to raise contributions by another £750,000 per year.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not think anybody will now have any doubt that, whatever good is in this Bill, it has been taken from our Bill.  The most valuable and vital benefits, from the point of view of the workers, have been deliberately axed by the Fianna Fáil Party in this Bill.  Now, what were <Col N="664" /> these valuable contributions?  We proposed to provide a retirement pension at 65 for a man or woman if they wanted to leave their employment.  Is there anything wrong, in the case of a man who has served the nation until he is 65 years of age, a man perhaps working in a highly mechanised factory or of a woman working perhaps in a cotton or woollen mill or in a steam-heated laundry: is there anything wrong in giving to these persons the right to retire at 60 or 65 years of age?  We give it to judges, we give it to civil servants, we give it to the Gardaí, to Army officers, we give it to the employees of local authorities, and we give it to Ministers.  Is there anything wrong in allowing a man at 65 years of age, who has paid contributions for a pension, to make up his mind and say that he is going to retire because he feels the strain too great or that the pace is too hot?  Is there anything wrong in allowing a woman to say: &ldquo;I have worked in a laundry or in a cotton mill for 40 years; I have had enough; I do not feel able for the strain of constant mechanised working for long hours at my age and I want to retire&rdquo;?  Is there anything wrong with permitting that person to get a retirement pension?  In the name of heavens, what sort of standards of human value have we?</P>
    <P>Have we now come to the stage in which we bracket a woman or a man with the cattle or the machines&mdash;that they must go on, that as long as you can get something out of them they are to be milked or used?  Is there to be the one standard for the cattle and the machinery and for the unfortunate agricultural worker or the worker in a city or town factory?  I see nothing wrong with permitting a worker who pays a contribution for a pension to exercise an option to retire when he is 65 or she is 60.  When we pay pensions to persons who make no special contribution, I see no reason why we should refuse to permit them to exercise that option.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about agricultural workers being hardy, healthy fellows at 65.  You can see strange things from a car on a main road.  If we believe that the agricultural worker is a hardy, healthy fellow at 65 with <Col N="665" /> everybody competing for his labour, I suppose we will be told that he will be an international jumper when he is 95 and enter him for the Olympic Games after he reaches maturity a few years later.  It is sheer nonsense.  Everybody knows well that it is an impossible proposition for the man who reaches 65 and is out of employment to get another job.  There may be nothing wrong with him.  He may not be sick and there may be jobs available in which he could be employed.  But in this age, with mechanisation what it is whether in the shop or in the factory or to some extent on the farm, nobody wants a man of 65 once there are younger people in the queue.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is that we have got 73,000 people registered at the employment exchanges who cannot get employment.  Is it not a much better proposition to try to tempt elderly people out of industry by providing them with a retirement pension, if they elect to retire, and let young and vigorous people get into employment instead of sending them, as we are doing in thousands every week, to the emigrant ship to seek elsewhere the work which we decline to provide for them here?</P>
    <P>If the Minister knew anything about the building industry he would know that if you lose your job at 65 you cannot get another job.  The employers do not want you and the insurance companies do not want to insure you if you are coming on the list the first time at 65.  I see nothing basically wrong, nothing morally wrong, nothing economically wrong with permitting workers to retire if they so wish at 65.  They are not compelled to retire.  But if they, for one reason or another, choose to retire, then, having paid contributions for their pensions, they should be entitled to exercise that right in the same way as a judge, a Minister or any other person in the enjoyment of pension rights.</P>
    <P>Then take the death grant.  I put into my Bill a provision whereby on the death of a person of 18 years or over a death grant would be payable of £20, the person's contribution being loaded in order to cover that provision. That rate of benefit scaled down <Col N="666" /> from £20 to £6 in the case of a child under three years of age.  Anybody who has any contact with working-class families knows only too well how necessary it is to make provision for the possibility that death will stalk through the homestead.  Very often what happens is that when a death takes place in a family the family have to go to the moneylender to raise the money to bury the relative who has died, or they have to go to the pawnshop to pawn something that they were only able to purchase after perhaps a long period of service.  Why should we not permit a man who works for a week's wages to insure himself for a retirement pension or against the possibility of death in the same way as the wealthy man can do with the big insurance companies?</P>
    <P>Why should not the State facilitate the small man to do these things? Why should we prevent him from doing these things under a scheme of this kind?  I know, of course, that the insurance companies were strongly opposed to that scheme by which the State would provide retirement pensions for male workers at 65 and for women at 60.  They were bitterly opposed to that provision.  They were bitterly opposed also to the concept of the State's entering into the business of providing death benefits when a member of a family died.  They hated these two provisions in my Bill. It is a melancholy reflection for the workers and a sobering thought for them as well that the Minister has capitulated to the objections launched against my Bill by the insurance companies. The insurance companies have won, and the workers of the country have lost on these two issues.  The Minister took the terms of surrender of the workers to the big insurance companies of this country, and even to the cross-Channel ones as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I proposed in our Bill to provide a maternity grant of £5. The grant proposed under this Bill is £2.  It is ridiculous to offer a grant of £2 to a woman to help to tide her over childbirth, especially bearing in mind that she has to pay, in many cases, a guinea to a midwife and has many additional expenses during that period. We proposed to make the grant £5 in our Bill because we recognised that the period of childbirth was one of additional expense for the household.  We wished to give the wife a grant of £5 in respect of additional expenses.  We had in mind the cost of perambulators and the high price of children's clothes.  The only feeling I had was that £5 was inadequate.  I was willing to start with £5 and I would not have had the slightest objection to an amendment being put down to increase the figure.  I never liked the figure of £5 myself and I would have preferred if it could have been higher.  It was even suggested to me in my Department that it should be raised.  However, under this Bill the £5 is cut down to £2.  Apparently in the year 1952 we cannot afford to give £5 to an insured contributor at childbirth.  I provided in my Bill for the payment of a maternity allowance for a period of <Col N="669" /> four weeks after childbirth so that a woman might be able to arrange to get domestic assistance to help her over her temporary difficulties.  The sum provided was a small one&mdash;£1 per week for four weeks.  Nevertheless it would have proved of some assistance, especially in the homes of poor people. That £4 has been guillotined also.  The maternity attendance allowance has been killed by the Fianna Fáil Minister in his Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>I will say, by way of a summing-up of the situation, that there has been a vicious and an unwarranted attack on the benefits provided under the Bill which we introduced.  This Bill is just a miserable shadow of what we proposed.</P>
      <P>This country is the most backward one in Europe from the point of view of our social services.  That statement cannot be challenged or denied.  Every country in Europe, even those behind the Iron Curtain and those east and west of it, have schemes of social security incalculably better than we have.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every other country in Europe has a better social service scheme to-day <Col N="670" /> than we have.  They have better benefits, and these benefits are not things of recent growth; they have been in existence for many many years.  These democratically-controlled Governments have built up a social service scheme which might well be the envy of everybody in this country. If the war-ravaged countries in Europe can provide these benefits, can maintain them and can even extend them what cause have we, in the year 1952, for lagging so far behind in this matter?  All we have is the miserable scheme enshrined in this Bill.  Even the small countries which were overrun by war felt that they should not cut down expenditure on necessary social services.  To-day we are in the unenviable position of having a standard of social services which do not do justice to our people and which do not provide benefits on anything like a comparable rate with those provided in other more progressive countries. As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, the bubble which conveyed that they stood for a comprehensive scheme of social security has been burst.  All we can expect now from them is the miserable scheme enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Members are prone to talk in this House from time to time about Partition, about the evils of Partition and about the desire to bring our fellow countrymen in the Six Counties into unity with the rest of the motherland. The most devastating propaganda that can be used against this country from the standpoint of those who want to maintain Partition is this.  In the Six Counties those who wish to maintain the evils of Partition can say in all truth that our social services are very substantially below those provided in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Here is a leaflet issued by pro-Partionists in the Six Counties.  They set out here a comparison of social services in &ldquo;Ulster,&rdquo; as they call it, with those payable in Éire.  Under the various heads they show what they pay there and what we pay here or do not pay here.  You cannot read that document without being impressed by the fact that we are substantially behind the Six Counties in respect of our social services.  Under our Bill many of those <Col N="671" /> discriminations against our people and many of those disparities were being removed, but under this Bill we have now a declaration from Fianna Fáil that it does not propose even to try to aim at giving to our people the same standard of social services as they are getting from the much-despised Six County Government on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>In our Bill we levelled up our benefits, generally speaking, until they were close to the Six County rates of benefit.  There is nothing wrong in doing that.  That is what our Bill strove to do.  This Bill has killed many of the useful provisions which we inserted in our Bill.  We inserted them not only to provide better benefits here but also so as to make sure that the odious and unfavourable comparisons which could be made by Partitionists against us could no longer be made because of the provisions in our Bill. Now, thanks to Fianna Fáil, these disparities and discriminations will continue.</P>
    <P>The Six Counties Premier, Sir Basil Brooke, who has been quoting the Minister for Finance recently, will also now be able to add the Minister for Social Welfare.  So far as he is concerned, the Minister for Social Welfare, like the Minister for Finance, recognises that this part of the country is too poor in the eyes of the Fianna Fáil Government to provide its people with the same social services as they are getting from the Six Counties Government.</P>
    <P>I do not say that these are valid arguments against Partition but they are arguments which tell on a young generation that is rising in the Six Counties and that has never lived in a united Ireland.  We are fools if we imagine that propaganda of that kind does not make its own contribution to creating a volume of opinion in the Six Counties in favour of the maintenance of Partition.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people, members of the Labour Party, who have campaigned in elections in the Six Counties.  They will tell you the biggest problem they have in trying to convert the workers to vote for an <Col N="672" /> anti-Partition policy is the propaganda of the Six Counties Unionists that our social services are substantially below the level in operation in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister and the Government, if the Six Counties Government can provide, as they do, maternity attendance allowances, retirement allowances, death grants, why cannot we do the same for our people here?  Are we now accepting the position that we are unable to give our people the standard of social services which the Six Counties give their people?  Is that the admission that we are going to get, that it cannot be done or, if it can be done, Fianna Fáil will not do it.  Failure to do that is to present a first-class propaganda case to the Partitionists in the Six Counties, and Fianna Fáil is doing that by having cut this Bill down until it is now a substantially less effective Bill than that which we introduced in 1951.</P>
      <P>If I were the Minister I would take no pride in being associated with a truncated document of this kind.  Every decent benefit, that the people could almost be certain of enjoying, has been taken out of our Bill, and a few risks have been substituted, risks which may never materialise at all for a substantial section of the people.  I never claimed that anything made by human hands or fashioned by the human mind was perfect, but whatever defects were in my Bill, even if you multiply them, it was a million times better Bill than this.  I would not have stayed in the Government that would state: &ldquo;That is the limit of the Bill we will pass in respect of social services in the Twenty-Six Counties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> I am quite sure that vested interests will be pleased with the Minister, and that those insurance companies will chant &ldquo;Alleluia&rdquo;.  The wealthy employer will do the same because this Bill allows him to ride away from his responsibilities, as my Bill did not do. The Minister promised in a speech last year that there would be no increase in contributions.  A sum of £750,000 is going to be taken under this measure, according to the Minister.  That is what is going to be budgeted for under the Bill, but when we see the Budget and construe it with the increased contributions which are payable, we will probably find that in the long run by higher prices and by taxes on the goods which he consumes, the worker will pay much more than we ever asked him to pay under my Bill, and they will get very much less in benefits under this Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as this Party is concerned, and in this matter I speak for the Party in its approach to this problem, we want a Social Welfare Bill containing no less than the things that were in the 1951 Bill.  If there is ever another Government in this country in which the Labour Party is represented, its representation there will be on the understanding, and only on the understanding, that that Government will put back into our social legislation the benefits which we introduced last year &mdash;provision for retirement pensions, death grants, increased maternity grants and maternity attendance allowances.  These will go back.  These will be provided for the workers under a Government in which the Labour Party has representatives, and the sooner the workers of this country get rid of this Government the sooner they will get these better benefits which the Labour Party will help to provide for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing his Bill to-day, dragged deliberately, and in a very regrettable way, into the atmosphere of this House and into the discussion something of that spite and that determination to stir up the confusion of his feeling that is characteristic of the Party that he is speaking for in this House.  In the long course of the <Col N="674" /> political history that we have experienced the whole atmosphere of spite which has bedevilled us has been brought into both this House and to our people throughout the country by the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to confuse thought, to stir up bitterness and to make it impossible to look at the problem that we are looking at from the broad Irish traditional outlook on the affairs and from the point of view of a serious social problem to be tackled by people with Christian instincts and democratic instincts that have brought them through all their difficulties in the past. If we are in the middle of any serious social or financial difficulty to-day it is because time after time we have had a whole succession of crises created in this country by Fianna Fáil spitefulness and that particular type of totalitarian aggression and insolence which is part of their stock in trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare could not introduce this measure to-day without talking of the Fine Gael Party as a dominant Party.  Dominant for what purpose?  He could not introduce this measure without trying to create a rift between the Labour Party, their measure and the supporters of the Fine Gael Party who unanimously supported the measure that was introduced by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Minister forgets both our tradition and our experience and he forgets the roots from whence comes any dominance that the Fine Gael Party have had either in Irish politics or in Irish economic or social affairs.  The Minister's line of conduct here to-day takes me back to that first day when the Irish Dáil assembled.  The whole spiritual energy and the energies of our people are all affected by the condition of the poor, the unemployed and the distressed sections of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister spoke in reference to what dominates this country, I want to take him back to that morning in January, 1919, when the first Dáil met in the Mansion House.  One of the first things the Dáil did was to make a declaration of its Democratic Programme, and I want to read that in order to recall to the Minister the <Col N="675" /> atmosphere.  I want to recall to him the continuing problem in Irish affairs that Government after Government and Party after Party must direct their energies to if we are going to make our Irish people what our people struggled in the past to make them. The Democratic Programme was read by Tomás Ó Ceallaigh.  It was proposed by myself and seconded by Conchubhar Ó Choileáin.  The Democratic Programme, as read to the Assembly on that morning, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare, in the words of the Irish Republican Proclamation, the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies to be indefeasible, and, in the language of our first President, Pádraig Mac Phiarais, we declare that the nation's sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the nation, but to all its material possessions, the nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the nation, and with him we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.</P>
    <P>We declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of liberty, equality and justice for all, which alone can secure permanence of Government in the willing adhesion of the people.</P>
    <P>We affirm the duty of every man and woman to give allegiance and service to the Commonwealth, and declare it is the duty of the nation to assure that every citizen shall have opportunity to spend his or her strength and faculties in the service of the people.  In return for willing service, we, in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.</P>
    <P>It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, <Col N="676" /> clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Republic fully realises the necessity of abolishing the present odious, degrading and foreign poor law system, substituting therefor a sympathetic native scheme for the care of the nation's aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the nation's gratitude and consideration. Likewise it shall be the duty of the Republic to take such measures as will safeguard the health of the people and ensure the physical as well as the moral well-being of the nation.</P>
    <P>It shall be our duty to promote the development of the nation's resources, to increase the productivity of its soil, to exploit its mineral deposits, peat bogs, and fisheries, its waterways and harbours, in the interests and for the benefit of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Republic to adopt all measures necessary for the recreation and invigoration of our industries, and to ensure their being developed on the most beneficial and progressive co-operative and industrial lines.  With the adoption of an extensive Irish consular service, trade with foreign nations shall be revived on terms of mutual advantage and goodwill, and while undertaking the organisation of the nation's trade, import and export, it shall be the duty of the Republic to prevent the shipment from Ireland of food and other necessaries until the wants of the Irish people are fully satisfied and the future provided for.</P>
    <P>It shall also devolve upon the national Government to seek cooperation of the Governments of other countries in determining a standard of social and industrial legislation with a view to a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the record of the <Col N="677" /> Dáil's first meeting on 21st January, 1919.  I am recalling to the Minister for Social Welfare the spirit in which our people first declared their approach to their economic and social problems on that first day.  As I say, it was my privilege to propose that motion.  If we cannot get respect from the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party for our declaration on such an historic occasion, then I think they might leave the House for a little bit.</P>
    <P>I have been challenged here by the Minister's whole approach both in regard to bringing our minds to bear on the problem and facing matters with a unanimity of mind.  We should endeavour to get for the people all that is possible from the resources which Providence gave us.</P>
    <P>In part of my statement, when moving the Democratic Programme on 21st January, 1919, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá ár dtír agus ár muinntir le fada fé dhaorsmacht agus fé cheangal ár námhad.  Táimidne indiu ag briseadh na gceangal agus ag cur na smachta ar neamhnidh, ach tá rian na gceangal agus na hannsmachta uirthe.  Siad an obair agus an tráchtáil mór-chuislí na tíre.  Insna cuislibh sin a théidheann fuil na tíre, an fhuil sin a thugann beatha agus sláinte dá corp agus spionadh dá hanam.  Táid siad san i leith na brúidhte agus na briste againn de bhárr na hannsmachta.  Níl an rith ceart sa bhfuil agus dá bhárr san tá atanna gránda ann annso agus annsúd ar chorp na tíre, insna catharachaibh, insna bailtibh agus fé'n dtuaith féin.  Comhartha dhúinne na hatanna san ar ghalar a raghaidh i méid agus a dhéanfaidh, b'fhéidir, ár dtír do mharbhú mara leighstear é. Má tá uainn ár dtír a mhaireachtaint agus bheith beo i dteannta í d'fhuasgailt caithimíd í shlanú.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For these reasons, we must take the resources of our country and use them and develop them.  The Minister has thought fit to refer to the various sections into which this country's political life has been divided and he comments on the inactivity of the Government that was established in 1922 and continued until 1932.  I should like the Minister, when he is thinking of social <Col N="678" /> and economic matters, either to forget those times or to remember the activities or inactivities of those with whom he was associated in those times.</P>

      <P>I can never forget. The longer I live the more I will understand that greater exertions must be made by our people to bring the strength of unity into their work in order to make up for the opportunities which were lost at that time.  I am prepared to forget what the Minister did to the agricultural industry when his Government took office in 1932 and when he destroyed the opportunities of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>I say that the Minister does not want this Bill to be examined and looked into in all the detail and with all the careful thought which should be devoted to the problem we are asked to deal with here to-day.  I believe that it is for that reason that he comes here this morning and tries to blacken and darken discussion by the insolence and spite he injects into his statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister wants to know whether the Fine Gael Party support the Labour Party in their approach to this measure.  Again, I am surprised that any man who has had the contact with the political development of this country which the Minister has had would come in here and ask those of us who direct any influence in the councils of the Fine Gael Party such a question.  I have stood at the centre of much of the activity that has gathered from the strength and unity of our people to set up this Dáil in January, 1919, and to defend it ever since.  I want to tell the Minister and everybody in this country that at no time in the history of this country did leadership and the movements for Irish freedom and the betterment of Irish affairs not come from the ranks of the workers of this country, whether they <Col N="679" /> be workers in the modern organised trade union or whether they were the ordinary workers in our fields and factories and in the general business of our country.  The momentum that won our Irish freedom came from the workers of this country and any economic developments that will take place in this country will come from the workers of this country, who will stand over the detailed work that has to be done here.</P>
    <P>If there were many moments in my personal political career from which I derived much satisfaction, and was aware that we were travelling along the right lines, surely some of these moments were during the three years when, in the Party, councils were supporting the Government, and in the council chamber of the Government, leaders of labour, of the farmers, of the Clann na Poblachta Party, and of other organised sections of our people sat down together and offered the benefit of their experience in various walks of life and brought their sense of responsibility and their outlook on general affairs to bear on our deliberations.</P>
    <P>There is a habit developing in the Fianna Fáil Party in an attempt to dominate both the political and economic life of this country&mdash;a habit of sneering at labour both organised and unorganised and of trying to keep it in its place.  There is an endeavour to frighten those who want to stand well with the managerial or professional or investing sections of our people from being too closely connected with labour or with workers' organisations in this country.  There will never be any true confidence in this country unless that sneering and disruptive influence is banished from our public discussions and unless we banish from the minds of people who want to stand on the fringe and in a privileged position the fear of being too closely connected with the Irish worker, organised or unorganised.  I think that it is despicable for men who mouth Christian principles to endeavour to befuddle and darken national thought and to divide the energies of our people by the suggestion that labour, organised or unorganised, is <Col N="680" /> something whose outlook and instincts and interests are a little bit taboo. They were the kernel of the nation's effort when it was achieving its freedom as they are the kernel of the nation's effort in its daily work to-day.</P>
    <P>My answer to the Minister, therefore, is that it gave me the greatest satisfaction and the greatest hope in the future of this country to be able to associate with men, in their capacity as Labour Ministers, in the councils of the nation.  I want to pay a special and particular tribute to Deputy Norton. It is disgusting that a Minister who has had experience in more than one Department should come in here and make statements, such as the present Minister for Social Welfare made in relation to Deputy Norton's criticisms, of the lack of work done by Deputy Norton in preparing a Social Welfare Bill.  The Minister pointed to his bundle of documents and read all the things that he had arranged to have done in his Department.  If such a speech was proper this morning, 27th March, 1952, then the same comments should have been made by the Minister when Deputy Norton was introducing the Second Reading of his Bill in this House on the 2nd March, 1951. Where is the reflection in Deputy Dr. Ryan's speech on the 2nd March, 1951, that enabled him to come here to-day and to make the statements he has made with regard to Deputy Norton's work as a Minister?  The whole thing is a despicable and a huge fraud.</P>
    <P>We are asked here to consider the Bill that the Minister for Social Welfare has put before us.  As Deputy Norton has pointed out, it has got in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> from certain people a pat on the back from the moral point of view, which patting on the back was reserved and withheld from Deputy Norton's Bill.  I would be more convinced and more affected by opinions of that kind if I did not remember the occasion upon which we sat here discussing the Health Bill of 1945.  Again feeling some of the dominant spirit that comes from long connection with the Irish struggle to have Irish life run in an Irish way, I was induced by the feeling of tradition in my blood to bring eight <Col N="681" /> representatives of the Fine Gael Party into the Lobby against the Public Health Bill of 1945.  Why?  Because it took the whole Catholic idea of personality and trampled it underfoot.  It arranged that State machinery could interfere with a man's person to perform operations on him.  It provided that State machinery could intervene to prevent a child going to places of worship because it had nits in its hair and its neck was dirty.</P>

      <P>The element has been drawn into discussion here that there is a greater moral basis for the Bill that we are discussing here than there was for the Bill which Deputy Norton brought before the House last year.  I am just making the passing comment that I would be more impressed&mdash;and I should like to give full consideration to anything said in regard to the question of morality&mdash;by the views of the people whose names are being used in connection with this Bill from the moral aspect, if they opened their mouths when we were dealing with the vital moral matters enshrined in the Bill of 1945, when an opportunity was given them of saying what they had to say, because when the Committee Stage of the Bill came before the House we, on these benches, fought that Bill for 15 days in Committee and only ceased our criticism of that Bill when we had gone through something like 600 amendments out of 850.  The Government of the time insisted on sitting through Holy Week to discuss it.  We never heard anything from these people then.  We know that that Bill broke in the Government's hands.  We know that the Bill was challenged on moral grounds by a definite and authoritative judgment. Let us deal now with the proposals before us on their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the war was on, there was frenzy in finance, a frenzy in the organisation of industry and work, so <Col N="682" /> as to use all possible resources of the various countries involved to meet the threat of war.  Where did the threat of war come from?  How did the seeds of war arise in many countries?  Because there was in various countries a position in which those who were weak, those who could not provide for themselves, those who were denied employment by others, those who fell sick, did not get from the Governments of these countries one-tenth of the effort to enable them to overcome their troubles that the same Governments were prepared to give to the prosecution of the war.  During the war churchmen and statesmen came together to examine that position and to make sure that when the war was over, there would be a social reconstruction that would mean that these things would never be neglected in future and that there would not be, so far as it lay in their power to prevent them, these difficulties and these weaknesses in the social situation that could be remedied by organisation and hard work, that could be remedied by the same kind of unity in politics in a peace administration, as they were able to devote to policies connected with the war administration.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with our present situation, we should ask ourselves why we are suffering from unemployment, why we are suffering from the lack of proper institutions and a proper administrative machinery to deal with the problems of life in a better way than we do deal with them? Because of things in the past that the Minister for Social Welfare will not forget but would like us to forget, because of the breakage of unity that prevented the unified strength of the country dealing with our moral and economic problems from 1922 to 1932, because of the destruction of our economy here by the trampling under heel of agriculture during the economic war.  Why are we faced with our present difficulties?  Because the Fianna Fáil Government, having got back to power, is turning its back on the work done during the three years' administration of the inter-Party Government, to employ the credit, the savings and the capital of our people in a useful way and to concentrate effort where <Col N="683" /> effort is required, particularly in the organisation of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempts to gibe at Deputy Norton that the Bill of 1951 proposed to pay smaller benefits to the agricultural worker than the present Bill.  Is the Minister serious?  The Minister gave us figures showing that the land of this country is in the hands of people whose ages average 55 years, and that, I think, 20 per cent. of these people were widows whose average age was about 60.  At any rate, he indicated that it was the very old section of our people who were the dominating control in agriculture, that there was comparatively little mechanisation of agriculture to-day and comparatively little increase in agricultural production. Why?  Does he remember, I wonder, the last stages of the war when we pressed and pressed here to get rural wages, road workers' wages, raised from 39/- per week?  They became 42/- and we had to sit here and listen to the Government telling us that they would not allow local authorities to increase the wages of their road workers, much as they wanted to do so.  Why?  Because the Government did not want the wages of agricultural labourers raised.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  If there is any cry in the country which can be more readily understood than any other, it is the cry of our farmers that they cannot get, for their agricultural purposes, the workmen they want. There is a part of the country which is nearly the size of a whole constituency where dairying is the keystone of the agricultural economy, and I am told in a most detached way by men of competency and experience there that no paid labour is milking cows in that area.  Why?  Because all during the war the Fianna Fáil Administration persisted in keeping wages down. I remember when they first came into Government reading a letter&mdash;leaving the names out&mdash;which was sent from the revenue offices in Limerick to a lady in Limerick telling her&mdash;she was making claims in relation to income-tax&mdash;that 26/- for Pat so-and-so, 29/- for John so-and-so, and 31/- for James <Col N="684" /> so-and-so were too much, that women could be got for that work, the work of milking cows, for 6/- and 7/- per week.  That was in 1933, and now they are putting agriculture on its feet by failing to discriminate between highly and lowly-paid workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton pointed out very definitely that there were no workers in agriculture who would come under his special rate in the Bill, except perhaps old workers whom the farmer was keeping because he was able to do part-time work with them, or able to do seasonal work, or simply because they had been there for years and he wanted to keep them on his payroll. That is just part of the pure hypocrisy of the Minister in his approach to this measure.  It did not need Deputy Norton's declaration as to his position if ever he was taking part in a Government again that he would insist on retirement pensions, death benefits and maternity arrangements.  The matter which most distinguishes the whole spirit and purpose of this 1951 Bill from the 1950 Bill is the leaving out of the retirement pension.  The Minister would seem to make it a principle that where there is a service wanted by a self-employed person, that is the service that should not be brought into a comprehensive scheme.  If the Minister is going to stand on that ground, he has no business in coming here and talking about a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding things in Deputy Norton's measure to which a very big section of our people looked forward&mdash;and not only the women who would become entitled to it, but the men&mdash;was the retirement pension.  The Minister for Local Government is forking out of the local service rate collectors who reach the age of 65, whether or not they are entitled to any kind of reasonable pension or not. It is not in support of such a policy that I regard as essential in a Social Welfare Bill a provision for a retirement pension.  But there are very many people who, when they reach the age of 60 in the case of women or 65 in the case of men, ought to be able to say that they want to take things easy.</P>
    <P>I cannot make out why the Minister brings this suggestion with regard to <Col N="685" /> the age position of our agricultural community into this discussion.  The retirement pension and the provision for death grants are outstanding things which put the Social Welfare Bill introduced and supported by the inter-Party Government into a completely different category, from the point of view of philosophy and approach. While the Minister says he is open to conviction, open to auction in the matter of putting into the Bill provision for retirement pension and death grants, I take up the attitude that, unless these are in the Bill, the Bill is entirely different from the Bill that is wanted.  We are now in world circumstances in which we have to look clearly at our society, at our resources, at what uses are being made of our resources and how our people, as a whole, benefit from their use, and we have particularly to see what is the problem of our people who are on the fringe of social well-being.</P>
    <P>No one could be satisfied in the case of people who will have to depend on the amount of benefit in this Bill, if there were many people who had to live on these sums or if there were any who had to live on them for a long time, that the State was doing its duty. The Fianna Fáil line all along has been, while keeping down wages, both in agriculture and industry, to throw to the people free beef, sops of milk and bread and an odd coal allowance.  That has been the policy in the past.  Deputy Norton, through his industry and energy and the realism with which he approached the situation, has brought the Minister many leagues forward from the position in which he was when he went into the Social Welfare Department.  The whole position in regard to the creation of the Health Department and the Social Welfare Department has been stamped with the spirit of intolerance and totalitarianism. It is several years since the health proposals were put before us, and we know how far they have gone. We know all the difficulties and disappointments for our people generally which have grown out of the spirit in which the seeds were sown and watered.</P>
    <P>The position in social welfare has progressed more happily in that <Col N="686" /> Deputy Norton took a grip of that Department and developed its administrative organisation and put the proposals of his 1950 Bill before the House and got acceptance of them in free and honest discussion and argument among the various Parties that were supporting the inter-Party Government and in this House.  He got an acceptance, practically, of what was in that Bill by the Fianna Fáil Party at that time except that, just as the Taoiseach called Mr. McGilligan the &ldquo;so-called Minister for Finance&rdquo; yesterday, the Government, of course, that was not the Fianna Fáil Government, was only the &ldquo;so-called Government,&rdquo; I suppose.  Except there is the imprimatur of Fianna Fáil on a piece of social legislation, the idea is that it has to be worked against and struggled against and maligned, and the people who introduce it have to be treated in the way in which Deputy Norton was treated this morning by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a matter that is fundamental.  It is much smaller in the general range of things than the Minister would make it appear to-day.  It is only a small scrap of the problem in this country that can only be dealt with when the various matters that we were dealing with&mdash; the improved development of agriculture and industry and the improved use of our finances&mdash;are properly dealt with.  The contribution of 24/- a week cannot even be paid and will not be paid if we have a condition of affairs in which the incompetence and the blindness and the futility of the Fianna Fáil Government destroys the hope that the inter-Party Government established here of unity and co-operation in facing our economic matters, destroys the proper use of our finances and the proper building up of our people's confidence in themselves and in their resources.  These measures will not be worth the paper they are written on unless there is a proper approach made to the sound development of our finances and the carrying on of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes in here this morning saying that he is not a trumpet blower or he is not patting himself on the back, but he wants to put that <Col N="687" /> Bill before us as the real, vital thing that our people are hungry and thirsty for.  This is only a drop of vinegar to a thirsty people who want work, who want peace, who want unity and who want the opportunity, and the approach of Christian philosophy, of taking the resources of this country and building it up so that, while they may look forward to a retiring allowance in the end of their days, they will not have to look for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit or any of the health grants that are simply there to make up, very often, for not being fully nourished and not being employed at work in which there is enjoyment and which gives confidence and security for the future.</P>
    <P>However the Minister may rant and trumpet about it, that is a Bill for dealing with disease.  It will not deal with disease.  That is something out of the bottle to a people who want the Government to take their resources and to do the work.  If that is done, we need not be discussing whether the contribution is too high or too much or what particular type of benefits we are going to have for our people.  We can improve the benefits and lower the contributions when the State's work is carried on in the proper way.  If the contributions are supposed to be high and if the benefits are supposed to be small, it is because in the ten years that the Minister for Social Welfare particularly desired to refer to this morning, instead of building up, they were destroying; instead of pulling together and building in unity, they were dividing and splitting.  They have been doing it since.</P>

      <P>I deplore the manner in which the Minister for Social Welfare introduced the Second Reading of this Bill to-day.  I find it very hard to believe that the Dr. Jim Ryan I met on Easter Sunday morning, 1916, when he came down to convey the counter-order to the Volunteers, could be the same man who stood up there and gave what I thought was a most obnoxious sarcastic castigation of a former Minister who, in his efforts to overcome his difficulties while Minister, brought in a Bill that could undoubtedly <Col N="690" /> be called a comprehensive one on the 2nd or 3rd March last year.</P>
      <P>Of course, when Fianna Fáil went into Government last June and the Department of Social Welfare went into labour to produce this Bill, they sent in the gynaecologist or obstetrician of the Department.  Very carefully, he nursed it while it was in labour, and it was an amazing thing, just a coincidence maybe, that from June to March is nine months.  With the assistance of a couple of maternity nurses who linked up in the meantime with the Department a mouse was produced instead of a Bill.</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the labour ward of the Department of Social Welfare; I am speaking about a ward, not for physical ills, but for mental ills; I am speaking about certain people who could create an abortion in any Department they might be in.  I had the experience, while a member of a committee of management of the national health, of trying to rectify some of the tangled skeins made by some of those terrible glorified officials who, in their own minds and in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Department, were a panacea for all ills and all evils.</P>
      <P>However, I cannot visualise that it was the present Minister for Social Welfare who produced that document he read this morning.  I sincerely hope I am right, because some of us who, in the past, were intimately associated with the movement with which he was associated cannot credit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, instead of being comprehensive, excludes from benefit certain categories of employees who, in my opinion, deserve the greatest recognition and consideration from any Minister introducing such a Bill.  I refer to female employees in agriculture and in commercial and professional employment. Those people, apparently, are not worth looking after, as they are completely ostracised by the present Minister in this Bill.  I would ask him, perhaps in its future stages, to amend his thoughts and direct his <Col N="691" /> attention to a more charitable line.  It should not be charity, it should be more justice than charity, to give those people the benefit of any social improvement we are to have.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why certain people should be compelled to contribute towards this fund.  I refer to the Army.  It is mandatory on anyone under £600 salary to contribute for benefits to which, by virtue of their status in the service, they are entitled. That also refers to the Guards and to a number of civil servants.  Of course, however, this democratic Government is at the moment buttressed by the opinions of certain people who failed in every position they held in both local and central government up to the time they got into the position they hold in the Department of Social Welfare, and it is on their advice that this thing was done.</P>

      <P>With all respect, I have a very vivid memory of an occasion in the not too distant past when civil servants were discussed on the Adjournment debate here, and what is sauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander.  I am not referring now to any particular civil servants.  Everybody knows to whom I am referring, and if the cap fits him, or her, or them, let him, or her, or them wear it.  I make no apology for what I am saying here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated this morning that he was accepting full responsibility, and I say: God give him absolution for that statement, because I believe it is untrue.  He was definitely stating what is untrue when he said it was he who prepared the famous Document No. 2.  Why should the people I have mentioned be asked to contribute to a fund from which they will never derive any benefit?  I think <Col N="692" /> that is very unjust.  I did think the contributions in the scheme introduced by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare, a bit high, but I realised we could not have a comprehensive scheme by imposing too much on one particular category and not enough on another.  A happy medium had to be arrived at.  I take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare, and his Department, in arriving at that happy medium.</P>
    <P>What have we in this Bill introduced by the present Minister?  We have people contributing under it who will never benefit by the provisions contained in it.  Taking the Minister's own statistics as to the average life, there are many people who will never benefit because they will have passed into Valhalla long before that.  During the last election in Cork City famous posters were displayed dealing with the Fianna Fáil social welfare proposals.  I am sorry Deputy McGrath and the other Cork Deputies are not present, because I would like them to hear what I have to say.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has an honest face, but I do not know what is behind the face.  I am taking him at his face value.  According to those posters, there would be no increase in contributions under the Fianna Fáil comprehensive scheme.  They promised that, plus the identity card in Cork, to give Fianna Fáil more seats.  I wonder how the Cork representatives here can now go back to the workers there and explain away the promise that there would be no increase in contributions and a reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath is one of those who believes that if he tells a lie often enough, the bigger it is the better it will be believed.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Jack Lynch, reminds me of a famous <Col N="693" /> auctioneer here in Dublin&mdash;the House-finder: the Parliamentary Secretary acts as the vote-finder for his Party. At the moment he is not quite so attached to Cork as he used to be. Deputy McCarthy is just odd-man out, or should I say odd-man in?  How will these representatives convince the people in Cork that they did not tell an untruth last May?  There was a full-page advertisement in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> telling the people there would be no increase in contributions. Nine months later they come along here approving of the Minister's Bill under which the contributions are increased.</P>
    <P>It was also stated that persons in receipt of £52 5s. per year would receive the full amount of old age pension under the Fianna Fáil scheme. That was given in a bulletin from Upper Mount Street on 3rd March, 1951.  What do we find now?  As Deputy Norton stated this morning, if an individual is in receipt of £52 5s. 3d. he will only get 5/-.  Under our scheme a person could have twice £52&mdash;that is, £104&mdash;and still be entitled to an old age pension, and we graded the £104 up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to give my interpretation.  There is no doubt an untruth was told and the public were exploited because of the promise that there would be no increase in contributions. I think the Minister should amend the Bill to bring in the small farmer.  The £30 valuation should be increased because, in my constituency, where the Griffith valuation operates, it does not require a very big farm at all to have a valuation of £30,. whereas, in other parts of the country, where the land is not so good, the valuation might be half for a much bigger acreage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would not mean a big imposition on the Exchequer if the Minister were to increase the valuation from £30 to £40 and then give the farmer the privilege of handing over the farm to his son without any requirement that it could only be done under a marriage settlement.  I think the <Col N="694" /> Minister will agree with me when I say that farmers who have worked their farms up to the age of 70 are entitled to some recognition from the State.  They are entitled to that by reason of the fact that they have worked the land not only to the advantage of themselves and their families but to that of the State.  Men working a farm of 40 or 50 acres with a valuation of say £40 all their lives are surely entitled to the recognition I speak of.</P>
    <P>It looked as if the Minister was all out this morning to indict the whole of the inter-Party Government in the sweeping allegations which he made against Deputy Norton.  He treated us very lightly, but I believe that at the time he was close to play-acting.  I think that at times the Minister is pretty good as an actor.</P>

      <P>I am not casting any reflection and I withdraw it.  I think it must be admitted, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, that during the period of the inter-Party Government those who supported it and had a majority on the county councils did everything which they thought was beneficial for the life of the country. That is to be said to our credit.  We carried out religiously every demand that was made on us by the various Departments.  I happen to be a member of the Cork Sanatorium Committee. To show that I appreciate what the Minister did when he was previously in office, I want to say this that it was an Act which he was responsible for that enabled us in 1948 to do all that we did.  I must say this, however, that after the passing of that Act, and during the period when the Minister was in office, there seemed to be some sinister influences at work in all the Departments which left things static as far as we were concerned.  We could feel that, at times, the curb bit was operating to keep us from doing things which we knew were necessary if we were to combat the terrible disease of tuberculosis so prevalent, unfortunately, throughout our county and city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> In 1948 we had only one sanatorium in Cork catering for about 110 persons, male and female.  At the moment we have four: Mallow, Millstreet, Skibbereen and Macroom, and we have increased the bed accommodation from 110 or 120 to about 360.  I want to pay a tribute to Deputy Dr. Browne for cutting the painter in his Department, cutting away the red tape and in giving us a free hand to do what we knew was necessary to be done.  Before his time if we wanted to buy a bed we had to get sanction for it.  Now, as I say, we are able to cater for 360 people who are suffering from this dreadful disease.  Surely the Minister and his back benchers will give us credit for that.  I want to say this: that there are certain elements within and without the Minister's Party which put up the greatest opposition to us when we were carrying out that good work.  Propaganda of the vilest nature was used against us but once we had the imprimatur of the then Minister that propaganda was very quickly changed.  The people who despised us woke up when they discovered that we were getting things going and were providing increased bed accommodation. In the end they were as much responsible for getting the increased bed accommodation as those who had initiated that worthy scheme.</P>
    <P>There was a little scheme in the Fianna Fáil Government's time dealing with old age pensioners.  I feel that when we speak here about an increase in old age pensions under the 1948 Act it should be 7/6 instead of 5/-.  There was no firm legislation dealing with that.  It was just a matter of a stamp in the post office or, if you like, a ministerial or departmental order. The stamp went on and there was an arrangement between the public assistance authorities and the Department whereby if people could show that they were absolutely destitute they got another half-crown.</P>
    <P>I think that was a most humiliating regulation to impose on any Irish man or woman.  Those people had to go with the pension book in their hands to the home assistance office and say: &ldquo;That is all I have in the world, and I am looking for another half-crown <Col N="696" /> from charity to maintain a frugal existence.&rdquo;  I think the mentality which was responsible for implementing that regulation should be got rid of in the Republic of Ireland.  It was reminiscent of the time when poor people had to go hat in hand to certain representatives and certain officials looking for a paltry shilling a week. In fact, I remember a Fianna Fáil back bencher, who is now a Parliamentary Secretary, saying during a debate here on the managerial system last year, that he thought that every home assistance recipient was living within a convenient distance of the local body and could go there to fight his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point now.  Old age pensions should be increased under this Bill, so that there would be no necessity for the recipients to look for public assistance.  They should have enough to keep them. With a soaring cost of living, old age pensioners are entitled to consideration, just as we gave them consideration in 1948 when, owing to the increase in the cost of living, we thought they were entitled to an increase in pension.  When he was on this side of the House, the Minister was more solicitious with regard to the old age pensioners, and he should now do something to alleviate their condition and prevent them from suffering destitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of solicitude shown by the Minister for the agricultural workers is very strange.  Certain Governments can talk in two voices, one voice when in opposition and the other when they get into office.  The Minister tried to make out that Deputy Norton in his Bill would have given the agricultural workers reduced benefits.  Deputy Norton was very well able to nail that statement in his reply to the Minister. He dealt very effectively with it.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party to the fact that, when Deputy Dunne introduced a measure providing agricultural workers with amenities that every other type of worker in this <Col N="697" /> country enjoys, the Fianna Fáil Party refused to have any hand, act or part in it.  But, when they saw it was going to be a success, they came in for the final push.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have as much consideration for the agricultural workers as the Minister or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We proved that by introducing the weekly half-holiday for them.  I believe that the happy medium was reached by Deputy Norton when Minister for Social Welfare.  Under Deputy Norton's scheme the agricultural worker could retire at 65 if he liked.  If he was inclined for more work, as the present Minister said in one of his speeches last year he could carry on until he was 82.  There is nobody compelling him to retire.  But, supposing that after hard years of work he decided that his day was done, he was entitled to retire and receive full retirement benefit for himself and his wife under Deputy Norton's scheme.  Now, he and his wife must carry on until they are 70.  According to the Minister's own figures this morning, only an infinitesimal percentage of these people live until they are 70.  I am sorry that I did not take a note of his exact figures.  They are a category who will be paying a contribution to his scheme for which they will not derive any benefit until they are 70.  National health benefit is available to them, but they are not insurable under the Employment Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>There was another scheme which we were trying to implement for the benefit of the farmers.  Where a co-operative store was operating under a certain understanding and agreement between the co-operative authorities and the farmer, the farmer could pay a weekly sum which would entitle him at the age of 65 to become a beneficiary under our Bill.  The Minister for Social Welfare has not even referred to the hardworking farmers with 20, 30, 40 and even 50 acres of land in some places. The Minister at one time was Minister for Agriculture and he knows their position very well.  The statistics were available to him over a number of years.  Yet not one word was mentioned about these farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> There is another point I should like to make so far as the age limit in the Minister's scheme is concerned.  A comparison between the agricultural and the industrial worker would be all in favour of the agricultural worker, because I am sure, without having statistics at my disposal, that agricultural workers live longer than industrial workers.  The industrial worker has to pay an increased contribution to a scheme from which he will derive no benefit until he is 70.  How does the Minister reconcile his statement in this House on the 2nd March last year when in opposition with the present Bill with regard to that?  The industrial worker, as I say, has to pay an increased contribution.  The gullible people of Cork City who were led up the garden path have to pay more, although not as much as under Deputy Norton's Bill, and they have to wait five years longer before they are entitled to retirement benefit.  What is the average life of an industrial worker?  I say that it is only the chosen few who reach the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>It looks to me as if the Minister's scheme is a cushion for the Minister for Finance.  It is a buttress, if you like, for him, because he will get revenue directly and indirectly which, according to the Minister for Social Welfare himself last year, would have been collected by taxation.  I believe that these insured persons will now be the benefactors and the paymasters indirectly of this scheme.  Some of us cannot forget within 12 months what was stated here.  It was claimed that the scheme would operate on a noncontributory basis.  Now we find that increased contributions are to be paid. The increases in Deputy Norton's Bill were justified, because they provided the working man with two, three, four or five years in comparative comfort and ease.  As a result of his Bill, the working man would have a pension at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Government tell me why, recently, an Order was made making it mandatory on county councils to retire rate collectors at 65. Everybody knows that a rate collector's job is a very easy one.  He has about two months' work in the year.  Still, <Col N="699" /> the Fianna Fáil Government, with a solicitude for their energy and health, and perhaps to give them a longer life than rate collecting would allow them, retired them at 65.  Take the coal miner in Arigna.  He must work until he is 70 years of age.  If you compare the two categories of work, of the rate collector who is compulsorily retired at 65 and of the miner in Arigna who must remain at work until he is 70, the injustice will be apparent.  I thought that the statements made by the Government last year were absolutely dishonest and that there would be no attempt to implement their proposals in this regard.  Now we see that an attempt is being made.  I admit that the Minister was adamant about the retiring age, and I will give him credit for that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maternity benefit, I think that on the Committee and Report Stages the Minister should increase that to the extent proposed in Deputy Norton's Bill.  There is no doubt that the arrival of a child in the family has an upsetting effect on the ordinary routine of the house.  Outside labour must be obtained.  Perhaps the breadwinner may have to lose one or two days from work as a result of it. I think the Minister should very conscientiously improve on that on the Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, the Minister for Social Welfare when he was reading that Document No. 2, was not a bit happy or, if he was, there has been an amazing transformation in him from the time I met him a good while ago in Cork one morning. Since an appeal was made with regard to this social welfare scheme that all Parties should co-operate, I am sure every consideration will be given to amendments that will be put in by the Labour Party and by other Parties composing the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have no hesitation in saying that this is not a social welfare scheme.  It is only a slight attempt to improve certain classes who would be in receipt of sickness or disablement benefits and no further than that does this Bill go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to <Col N="700" /> congratulate the Minister on the comprehensive and convincing statements which he made when introducing this Bill.  The last speaker has referred to the happy medium, and I feel that when we consider the whole question of social welfare in its broadest aspects we will arrive at the conclusion that the Bill before the House presents the happy medium as between excessive contribution on the workers and their employers and a wide variety of benefits, some of which could easily be dispensed with in this community.</P>
      <P>I cannot, however, congratulate Deputy Norton on his approach to the consideration of this Bill.  His speech was a speech of an angry, bitter and disappointed man.  It was distinguished particularly for a rather savage attack on the Civil Service or on certain civil servants and upon certain Catholic priests who were not over-enthusiastic about his particular Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy Norton spent most of his time in this House to-day comparing the Bill before the House with the Bill which he introduced last year, and when the sour atmosphere created by his speech had blown away, as I think it has, and when we got down to the practical matters it will be acknowledged that the essential difference between this Bill and the Bill which Deputy Norton introduced last year is the determination of the present Government that this Bill shall go through and be put into operation.  It was never intended by the last Government that their Bill would ever be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to those who voted against his Bill last year, but those who voted against his Bill last year did not defeat the Bill.  Who was it killed the Norton Bill?  It was killed by the brass hats of the Fine Gael Party who had made up their minds from the very outset that that Bill would never be enacted.  We know the three years the now frustrated Deputy Norton laboured to bring this Bill forward.  I will give him credit by assuming that he was anxious to bring forward a Social Welfare Bill and anxious to have it enacted. However, the Fine Gael Party had other ideas; they were determined the Bill would never see the light of day. <Col N="701" /> For over three years Deputy Norton laboured to produce this Bill.  Why should it have taken over three years? For over three years the mountain groaned and laboured and brought forth a mouse but, unfortunately, the mouse was dead.  Who was it who killed the Norton Bill?  Was it not killed by the dissolution of the 13th Dáil?  Who ordered the dissolution of the 13th Dáil?  Was it not Deputy Costello, the late Taoiseach, on the advice of the Fine Gael Party and against the protests of the Labour Party?  That is what killed Deputy Norton's Bill, and that is why he is so sore to-day.  If the last Government had been anxious that Deputy Norton's scheme should be enacted, they would at least have kept the 13th Dáil in being long enough to ensure the passing of his Act.  They could have done that.</P>
    <P>There was nothing to prevent them from doing it.  They got the Second Reading of the Bill through the House, and they would have got the Third Reading and the other stages through in the course of a few weeks.  Fine Gael were determined that Deputy Norton would not have the opportunity of going to the country with his Social Welfare Bill enacted.  They were determined to drag him to the country more or less in his sins without having anything to show to his supporters. That was exactly what they succeeded in doing.  I feel sympathy for Deputy Norton because he had to come into this House to-day feeling so sick, sore and bitter.  If one ties oneself to the tail of a kicking jennet, one cannot be surprised if one gets fairly well battered.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that we will not have the same position which operated in regard to the Labour Party when they were dragged to the country in their underwear, and not even in their best underwear.  They were forced to go to the people who supported them without having anything to show in the way of a social welfare scheme, and they were forced into that position through the cunning of the Fine Gael Party.  That is why Deputy Norton came into this House to-day and bellowed and roared like a Black Polly bull.  No doubt, he deplored the manner in which he and his Party have been fooled by Fine Gael in regard to his Social Welfare Bill.  These are the facts, and they cannot be controverted. I am sure nobody will even attempt to controvert them.  The essential difference between this Bill and the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton is that this Bill will become law and will operate.  In so far as it confers a benefit on the community, these benefits will be operating in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving out of consideration that I have said it was never the intention of the previous Government to put the Norton Bill through, and acting on the assumption that the Bill introduced last year by Deputy Norton was never seriously intended to operate and comparing the two Bills in a fair and equal way, let us ask ourselves what is the main difference in their provisions. Is not the most outstanding difference between the Norton Bill and the Bill introduced to-day the fact that under the former Bill no less than 7/- per week would have to be paid by the farmer and his worker.  That was the contribution demanded at the time and I considered it was an excessive contribution. The contribution demanded under this Bill is 2/6 per week.  That is a fair contribution from workers and employees who are struggling and hard-working people&mdash;the backbone of <Col N="703" /> the economic life of this country.  There is relief to the extent of 4/6 per week in respect of each worker employed. I feel that that is the fundamental difference between Deputy Norton's Bill and the Bill before the House.  The present Bill is more realistic, because it accepts the fact that the ordinary working farmer and the ordinary agricultural labourer are not millionaires. They cannot afford to pay and could not be expected to pay 7/- per week. The agricultural labourer could not be expected to pay, in addition to his weekly rent of 3/-, 4/- or 5/-, 3/6 per week as was demanded under the Norton Bill.  Neither could the employer be expected to pay that excessive amount.  Under this Bill the worker will only be asked to contribute 1/3 per week, and his employer will be asked to contribute a like amount.  To my mind, that is the most startling and the most outstanding difference between the Norton Bill and the Bill before the House.  I feel that if we dwell on that point we will realise that the drafting of this measure was approached with common sense and with a sense of realities.  Nobody will, I think, seriously contend that the burden which Deputy Norton sought to place upon the agricultural labourer was a moderate one.  In my opinion, it was a crushing one, just as the burden which he sought to place upon the ordinary small employer who engages one or two men was an excessive burden.  I welcome the concession that is being made to agriculture in ensuring that under this Bill the contribution in respect of the agricultural worker and his employer will be less than that demanded in respect of any other type of worker.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>The appointment of a separate Minister for Housing, who would have no duties other than the housing of the people, would not help towards the solution of these difficulties; in fact, it would create new and unnecessary difficulties.  I would remind the Deputy that, since the appointment of a separate Minister for Local Government in January, 1947, housing is the principal service for which that Minister is responsible.  Services ancillary to housing, such as town planning, road construction and sanitary services, are also provided through the Department of Local Government and the local authorities, and the co-ordination of these services with the main service of housing is thus assured.  If a separate Minister for Housing were appointed, the administrative and technical organisation which deals with housing and with the ancillary services would be divided, and the co-ordination which is so essential to the successful solution of the housing problem would be difficult to secure.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the present system, by which the same Minister is responsible for both the housing service and the ancillary services, should remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>The Derry, Lough Swilly Railway Company have applied for an Order under Section 9 of the Railways Act, 1933, authorising the termination of their rail services.  I have referred the matter to the Transport Tribunal for advice.  Public notice will be given and an opportunity afforded to interested parties to make their representations, before any decision is reached.</P>
      <P>In the event of the company's rail services being terminated the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 9 of the Act would apply and employees rendered redundant would be entitled to compensation if they are not transferred to alternative employment.  The conditions of service of the company's employees are settled by agreements between the unions and the company and should there be any grievance in regard to alternative employment the matter would be one for consideration by the negotiating machinery.</P>

      <P>As the reply is somewhat lengthy, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it in the form of a statement with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>There is a special section in my Department charged with the task of assisting Irish producers of industrial goods to find markets in other countries for their products.  Exporters are helped in many ways, e.g.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the advice and guidance of officers experienced in these matters is freely at the disposal of any intending exporter;</P>
      <P>(2)  my Department supplies all available information regarding markets and market conditions in the countries concerned and, where necessary, obtains additional information through the Irish embassies, legations or consulates located in these countries;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  the information service at the disposal of exporters also covers such matters as customs duties, import controls <Col N="711" /> or other Government regulations likely to have a bearing on the possibility of developing an export trade;</P>
    <P>(4)  whenever inquiries for supplies of industrial goods are received from other countries my Department arranges to put the inquirers into direct touch with potential exporters here or, where such exists, with the appropriate trade association;</P>
    <P>(5)  where necessary, representations are made, through the appropriate channels, to foreign Governments for the grant of import facilities for Irish industrial goods;</P>
    <P>(6)  in trade negotiations with foreign countries every effort is made to provide opportunities and secure facilities for the importation into these countries of Irish manufactured goods.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive list of Irish exporting manufacturers and the goods they have available for export is prepared annually, and is given wide circulation through our embassies, legations and consulates abroad.  The value of this list depends, of course, on the extent to which manufacturers co-operate with the Department in providing the necessary material which they are requested each year to supply.</P>
    <P>A special company, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, has been set up to promote exports to the dollar area.  Its function will be to place at the disposal of Irish exporters a comprehensive service which will help them to market their goods successfully in the dollar area.  The company, in the course of its activities, will conduct market surveys, supply information to exporters about outlets for goods, advise on methods of salesmanship, packaging and design, etc.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the exportation of agricultural produce are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The operation of scheduled air services between this country and Britain is governed by an agreement, dated April 5th, 1946, between the Irish Government and the British Government.  The agreement and the annex to it provide that, in the interests of efficiency and of economy of operation, the scheduled air services between the two countries shall, except when otherwise agreed between the two Governments, be operated exclusively by Aer Lingus.  The agreement also provides that any modification of the annex must be the subject of consultation and agreement between the aeronautical authorities of both countries before effect can be given to a modification.</P>
      <P>The annex would have to be modified before Aer Lingus or any other company could be permitted to operate scheduled services between Cork and Britain, and consequently the concurrence of the British Government would have to be secured before such services could be permitted.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to reply to questions 42, 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>(1)  Broadcasting time allotted to performances by the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra during both of the periods mentioned in the question varied between two and a half and four hours weekly according to whether special performances were given in theatres or otherwise.  There were generally two studio concerts with audiences weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The number of recently recruited non-nationals employed in the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra on 30th June, 1951, was 16 and the number on <Col N="729" /> 28th February, 1952, was 18, the full strength being 61.  This is not abnormal when compared with leading foreign symphony orchestras in countries with a longer history of concert development.</P>
    <P>(3)  The total cost of the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra for the half years ended 30th June and 31st December, 1951, was £20,000 and £21,400 respectively.  A much larger sum could have been expended with advantage since the orchestra is this country's only professional symphony orchestra and has become, in fact, the Irish national orchestra, performing regularly in public in Dublin and throughout the country, and combining with other music organisations for the benefit of all classes and particularly of school children on whom the future of music so much depends.</P>
    <P>While the standard of performance has improved partly as a result of the presence of the visiting players, improvement has also taken place in the standard of teaching as a number of the orchestra members are engaged in the teaching establishments and give instruction of high calibre not fully available here before.  A good deal still remains to be done in this direction and the Departments concerned are collaborating to bring this about. As a result it may be possible in time to secure more nationals of adequate professional standard to fill vacancies in our orchestras as they occur.  This, of course, depends on what can be done by the teaching organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that it was agreed that no further foreigners would be employed to the detriment of native musicians?  Has he also considered that the time has now arrived when Radio Éireann and the taxpayers should not be taxed to keep up a symphony orchestra of which 80 per cent. of the people do not approve, and in which a small section only of the people are interested?  Further, does he think he is justified in recommending to the Minister for Finance to put a half-crown increase on wireless licences to maintain a symphony orchestra to <Col N="730" /> which the general body of the people do not listen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Most of these matters are ones which could be more properly raised on the Estimate.

The selection board for that purpose includes Irish citizens of note and their recommendations have I think in the last three years, two of which were in the time of my predecessor, been unanimous.</P>

      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, the improvement of milk production is one of my principal <Col N="731" /> objectives.  In my opinion, this can be achieved by (1) improved feeding of dairy cattle; (2) improved breeding, and (3) elimination of disease.  I propose to continue to do everything possible to encourage developments on these lines.</P>
      <P>As regards improved feeding, a considerable sum is being spent by the Government on the improvement of land, including grassland.  In addition, farmers can help to make more feeding-stuffs available by increased tillage in the knowledge that there is a good market for all they produce.</P>
      <P>On the question of improved breeding, I am arranging for a considerable expansion of artificial insemination this season, and my Department has purchased a substantial number of high-class dairy shorthorn bulls which will be made available to breeders on easy terms.</P>
      <P>As to the elimination of disease, I am encouraging in every possible way utilisation of the schemes for the control of parasitic diseases and contagious abortion, and I am also considering the whole question of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Bill, 1952, contains a very important provision enabling the milk boards to introduce, with my approval, special measures for increasing milk production in their areas.</P>

As regards ware potatoes there is still a long period before the new crop will be available, and I expect that the marketable surplus will be absorbed in stock feed and in supplying the needs of the urban areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that Fine Gael &ldquo;codded&rdquo; his Party. They took three seats off them.  They kept them dangling for three years, refused to let them get their Social Welfare Bill through, and forced them to go to the country with nothing to show except, perhaps, a green-painted window and letter-box in a certain public-house in a certain town in my constituency.  That was the sole achievement of the Labour Party as far as anyone could see.  Here we have a Bill which does try to achieve something for the workers and the community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental difference between this Bill and Deputy Norton's Bill is that the contribution demanded from the workers is 1/3 in this Bill as against 3/6 in Deputy Norton's Bill.  The total contribution demanded from the farmer and the worker in respect of each worker employed is 2/6 under this Bill as against 7/- in Deputy Norton's Bill.  Will anyone seriously suggest to <Col N="735" /> me that 7/- a week is not a considerable amount of money in the budget of both the farm worker and his employer, who, in many cases, is a small farmer, not much better off than the man he employs.  I think it is a realistic approach to the social problem to cut as severely as possible the levy being made upon the agricultural section of the community through the workers and the farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with the Minister when he says that this represents another subsidy to agriculture. I should like to have that proposition analysed because of the fact that agricultural workers, being always available for work which may be provided by the State on roads and afforestation and national work of that kind, are not likely to draw heavily on the unemployment benefits under this Bill, or should not, if the country is well governed, draw too heavily upon those benefits, and, therefore, should not be asked to make as high a contribution as other more specialised workers.</P>
    <P>There is a wide variety of ways in which the agricultural worker can be helped if he becomes unemployed other than by giving him a weekly dole or benefit.  It is the duty of any Government in power in the future, by all possible means at their disposal, to provide, not benefits for unemployed workers, but work for them.  You can do that effectively as far as agricultural workers are concerned, because, if they are not able to find sufficient employment in agriculture, they are manual workers, and, therefore, work of a suitable nature can be provided for them always on roads, on afforestation, on drainage or any other national schemes of that kind.  That is why I think it is quite fair and proper that the contribution demanded from the agricultural worker should be less than that demanded from other types of workers.</P>
    <P>Having demonstrated that the essential and important differences between this Bill and Deputy Norton's Bill is that the levies upon workers and employers are far less in this measure than in the previous measure, I should <Col N="736" /> like to refer briefly to complaints which have been made in regard to certain modifications in the scheme of benefits in this Bill as compared with the previous Bill.  Deputy Norton in the course of his speech cried out: &ldquo;Is there anything wrong with a retirement pension?&rdquo;  I think that this is a matter for very serious consideration. We are a small nation and, to a great extent, a nation with undeveloped resources.  If things were right, we should by development of our resources to the full, by advancement of our industrial programme and by improvement of our agricultural industry be able to employ all available workers in this country.  That is the ideal we ought to strive for rather than to seek to maintain a large number of people who are permanently unemployed.</P>
    <P>The whole basis of the case against this Bill and in favour of Deputy Norton's Bill is that we will for all time have a large number of people who cannot find employment.  I refuse to believe that.  I think that we can eventually overcome the unemployment problem by development of our national resources.  Therefore, I think it is not a valid argument to say, because at the moment there is a substantial number of unemployed, that that is a justification for making permanent provision for a large and ever-increasing number of unemployed people through all the years to come.</P>
    <P>I think that any person over 65 who wishes to work should get every inducement to work.  It may be said there was nothing compulsory in the Bill last year but we all know that under a pension scheme of that kind retirement at 65 is very likely to be made universal. I think it would be far better to approach the problem in another way, that is, to say to a worker, as we can say under this Bill: &ldquo;If you are out of health at 65 or at any other age for that matter, you can obtain disability benefit equal to the retirement pension included in the Labour Party Bill.&rdquo;  We have got to face the fact that the span of human life has extended.</P>
    <P>Whether that is a benefit or not is another matter.  It is true to say that, in the main, people are living longer <Col N="737" /> than was the case 20 years ago.  For that reason we have to ask ourselves is it right to saddle the community with an ever-increasing number of people who will be precluded, to a great extent, from adding anything to the sum total of the goods, commodities and services for the benefit of the people.  I feel that is a matter which has got to get serious consideration.</P>
    <P>There is no merit in shortening the working life of the ordinary person. We can say, from the arguments I have used, that we should not fix 65 as a retiring age: &ldquo;Why fix the age of 70 for old age pensions?&rdquo;  We must remember that the age of 70 for old age pensions has operated for a long number of years.  Nobody would suggest for a moment that it should be altered.  There is no need to bring the retiring age for an ordinary worker down to a lower level.  There are a great number of people in constant employment who would feel completely lost and whose lives would be probably shortened if, through legislation of this kind, they were forced to retire. They might not have developed other interests in life or hobbies which could keep them occupied.  The net result of forcing them into retirement would be to force them to an early grave.</P>
    <P>There is ample provision under existing legislation, and certainly under this Bill, to ensure that the people who are unable to work can derive the full benefit provided in the disabilities section of this Bill.  Therefore, I feel that it would be wrong and, indeed, almost criminal to compel a young married man with a young family to pay 3/6 per week, at a time when he is finding it extremely difficult to support his family, so as to ensure that he would be able to remain idle when he reached the age of 65.  At the age of 65 he might be just as healthy and just as well able to work as he was when he had to pay 3/6 a week out of a modest income.  In my view, the approach to this problem under this Bill is a reasonable one, and it is absolutely consistent with the stand that the Minister took when he was in opposition.  It is also consistent with the stand I took on this particular <Col N="738" /> section when the last Bill was going through.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I feel rather strongly, and that is in regard to disability arising from accidents to workers in the course of their employment. The Minister referred to the fact that there was a suggestion in the original draft of the White Paper for the inclusion of this form of disability in the proposed Social Welfare Bill.  I think it is a pity that it is not included. A man who becomes unable to work, whether his disability arises through illness or as a result of an injury&mdash; whether the injury is caused in the course of his employment or outside the course of his employment should be a matter of indifference&mdash;should be entitled to benefit from the State.  At the present time the law in regard to workmen's compensation is that the employer is solely responsible.  This means that a very heavy liability is placed on the employer, and particularly on a small employer, who must transfer the liability to an insurance company or otherwise face bankruptcy. The net result of the whole position is that when a worker is injured there is a general scramble on the part of the medical profession, on the part of the legal profession and on the part of the insurance companies in an endeavour to find out who will be able to secure the most benefit out of this particular scheme.  I feel that the whole thing is utterly and completely demoralising, demoralising to the medical profession, demoralising to the worker and, if that is possible, demoralising to the legal profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was about to say that Glaring cases of fraud on the worker were proved in many cases, which could be counteracted by a little fraud on the insurance companies.  The whole thing is very objectionable.  For instance, if an employer could have his liability covered by an insurance stamp so that the worker would be compensated by State benefit under this Bill, that would do away with a <Col N="739" /> considerable amount of fraud.  We all know, human nature being what it is, that if a worker finds he is recovering from an injury and if he knows that by keeping up the pretence that he is still disabled he may get what is called a lump sum settlement.  Therefore, there is a strong temptation for the worker to keep on pretending that he is still disabled when, in fact, he is not.  On the other hand the medical doctor is tempted.  He is going to get a substantial slice out of the insurance if a lump sum settlement is made.  There is a temptation on him to overlook the fact that the worker has completely recovered.</P>

      <P>If a provision for this particular type of risk is included in the Bill, the worker will know that he cannot have a lump sum settlement, but that he will have a weekly benefit for the period of his disablement.  I feel that will get over a good deal of the trouble, a good deal of the dishonesty, and a good deal of the fraud which exists at present in the operation of workmen's compensation.  The Minister should consider that aspect of the matter.  It might add somewhat to the cost of the Bill, but as far as the employees section of the community is concerned, I feel they would be prepared to consider an increase in their contributions in order to cover this risk or liability.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is anything very much in the complaint that was made by some members of the Opposition in regard to the maternity benefits that are given under this Bill.  The Minister indicated, in introducing the Bill, that it is intended to take further measures in that respect, and that a Health Bill will be introduced which will make further provision in regard to childbirth and in regard to maternity cases generally.  Therefore, I fail to see that there is anything serious in the objections raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the death benefit, there are very few people anxious to insure against the death of their children. People are not adverse to paying insurance <Col N="740" /> for the funeral expenses of aged people.  Death, I suppose, is the natural termination of life and a natural eventuality in the case of the aged, but I do not think any working man or any small farmer would take up the payment of a weekly, a monthly or a yearly contribution merely to cover the eventuality of having to bury some members of his family.  If you look at it in that light, you will see that there is not much in the complaint.</P>

      <P>That is one of the things that would be added to the cost of the Bill and it is by the elimination of a few matters of this kind and by other alterations that it has been found possible to reduce the drastic and crushing levy that was provided under the Norton Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything very edifying in Deputy Norton's whitewashing of Sir Basil Brooke.  We have nothing to learn from the Six Counties as far as social welfare and social administration generally are concerned. They have their own problems and as an intensively industrialised area have very different problems from those which affect us.  We are in the main an agricultural community and if left to our own common sense we can devise schemes for the benefit of our people which will be very much superior to those in operation in the Six Counties. We have nothing to learn from that area and we do not intend to go to that area to learn lessons in regard to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mistake that has been made by the Labour Party in the past and up to the present, is that they have been looking too much to Northern Ireland and to Britain for their social education. <Col N="742" /> They have been looking too much to the British Labour Party instead of looking to their own people.  The approach made to these problems by the Minister is more in keeping with the realities of the situation that exist here in this agricultural country than the approach made by Deputy Norton when he sought to copy the legislation of the British Labour Party, legislation designed in the main for an intensively industrial country.</P>
    <P>I am glad there are improvements provided in this Bill in respect of old age pensions and that the means test is being further modified to the benefit of the old age pensioners.  That is right and desirable and we can all look forward to this Bill coming into operation at an early date and to its benefits being of a widespread nature.  It will be appreciated by every section of the community, particularly, I would say, by the working people whom, I think, Deputy Norton gravely misrepresented in his speech to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>When the inter-Party Government was formed, one of the principal items of its programme was the introduction of a comprehensive scheme of social security.  The reason for this item in its programme was well known to anybody who had studied the many deficiencies which existed, at the time the inter-Party Government was formed, in the social legislation in our country.  These deficiencies existed by reason of the haphazard nature of social legislation over the last half-century.  The inter-Party Government set itself to try to remedy those defects, in so far as it was within the means of the community so to do.  The principal defects which existed in the social legislation were that the classes of people who benefited from social insurance and from schemes of a social security nature were limited, that the unemployment and disability pensions and contributions were of an uneven character and that pensions were of a too limited nature and that the administration of the scheme was too complex and too confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government recognised that it was necessary to remedy these defects and that a comprehensive <Col N="743" /> scheme of social security was desired. I am of the opinion that if it was possible to point out that a family wage, as it is sometimes referred to, was being paid to the vast majority of our people so that they could provide for themselves against the contingencies of unemployment, ill-health and old age a scheme of social assistance would be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We have got, however, to deal with reality.  We have got to deal with the situation as we find it at the present time and that situation makes it quite clear that the vast majority of people living in this State to-day cannot afford to provide out of their own incomes for the contingencies which arise in the lives of everybody&mdash;unemployment and, perhaps, ill-health and almost certainly, old age.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I think it is justifiable for the State to step in and provide for schemes by which people can help to provide for themselves against these contingencies.  For that reason, I think a scheme of social security, as comprehensive as possible, was necessary and was desirable and that the last Government went a long way towards remedying the defects and the deficiencies which had existed up to the time they came into office.</P>
    <P>Modern thought on the question of social security schemes has all been in favour of remedying the defects by means of social insurance.  The International Labour Organisation of which this country is a member held its 26th session in May, 1944, at Philadelphia and recommended that the proper way to tackle problems of social security was by methods of social insurance rather than by social assistance.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is the generally accepted thought on the subject to-day. In 1938, New Zealand passed a social security Act which did away with the assistance scheme for old age pensions and introduced a scheme of contributions for old age pensions and medical benefits.  In England, which has produced by far the most comprehensive scheme of social security, insurance is the basis of the whole scheme and assistance schemes have been used only as merely ancillary and supplementary <Col N="744" /> to the major scheme of social insurance which they introduced in 1946.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, which was published by the last Government, gave, I think, the main arguments bearing out the necessity and the desirability of bringing in an insurance rather than an assistance scheme into this country. Deputy Ryan, as he then was, dealt with the arguments put forward by Deputy Norton and put forward in the White Paper but I do not think that he really got over the two principal arguments in favour of a contributory rather than an assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>These are that insurance schemes help to safeguard the self-respect of the beneficiary and they provide benefits on a contractual basis.  They provide a certainty for the contributor of the benefits which he will receive if certain contingencies arise.  Assistance schemes, on the other hand, necessarily involve a means test of some sort and I am at one with many Deputies in this House in disliking many schemes which include a means test.</P>
    <P>When there are schemes of an assistance nature means tests are inevitable in view of the resources of this country and any scheme of assistance, whether it is an old age pensions scheme or not, does require a means test of some sort in order to make it work.  It was pointed out in the debate on the last Bill that was before this House and in the White Paper that one of the advantages of bringing in a scheme of social insurance was to do away, as far as possible, with means tests in social legislation.</P>
    <P>I think, under the Bill introduced by the last Government, that the Government was going a long way towards doing away with means tests in our social legislation.  The scheme, as it then provided, provided for many benefits, some of which were existing, some of which were new, but all of which would be given to the insured contributor, irrespective of his means.</P>
    <P>There was a sharp distinction between the views of the then Government and the views of the Opposition at that time.  Deputy Ryan spoke for the Opposition on the Second Reading <Col N="745" /> of the debate and made the Opposition's point that they were against including in a contributory insurance scheme widows' and orphans' pensions. They were against including in the scheme old age pensions.  He made it quite clear that his policy and the policy of his Party was to meet the expenses of these schemes out of taxation and to have, of course, a means test involved.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the ethics of making promises and then not carrying them out.  Deputy Ryan, as he then was, several times in the course of his speech&mdash;he was followed later by Deputy Lemass, who made the same statement&mdash;said that if they were returned to power they would introduce a scheme which would not increase the contributions.  He also said that their scheme would be, as he suggested, one which would not include widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions.  The Minister did not bear out the statements he made then.</P>
    <P>In regard to the inclusion in his scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions, I welcome that change of front.  I only regret that he did not go further and bring in retirement pensions as well.  He has seen fit, in the meantime, to bring in now into a scheme of contributory insurance widows' and orphans' pensions.  He argued on a theoretical basis against doing that on the Second Reading of the Bill last year for the same reasons he argued against bringing in old age pensions.  There can be little consistency in bringing in widows' and orphans' pensions now into the scheme and leaving out old age pensions.</P>
    <P>The many defects in the present scheme have been put forward by the Labour Party in the statement they issued to the Press some days ago.  I agree with everything that was included in that statement.  I think that this Bill is bristling with defects. One of the greatest defects is the omission of retirement pensions, which were granted under the Bill of the Minister's predecessor.  The Bill is not as comprehensive as the last scheme.  There is a ceiling of £600 now in respect of contributors.  From figures given in this House by the <Col N="746" /> Minister a few days ago, in reply to a question, I understand that 20,000 or 30,000 people will be excluded from this Bill.  For the sake of excluding these 20,000 or 30,000 people I do not see why the Minister imposed this ceiling.  The Minister should reconsider this matter and make the scheme as comprehensive as that of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>Another defect in the Bill is the fact that female workers in domestic service are omitted from some of the benefits of the scheme.  The death grant has gone.  The lump sum maternity grant is reduced from £5 to £2.  It is obvious that the method of financing the Bill is different from that in respect of the Bill brought in by the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme introduced by the last Government there was no provision for self-employed persons.  There is no provision for self-employed persons in this Bill either.  An effort should be made to bring self-employed persons into a scheme of social insurance of this nature.  There are almost 250,000 self-employed persons in this State.  I do not know how many of these people it would be practicable to bring into a scheme of social insurance but it should not be beyond the powers of the Minister's Department to devise a scheme whereby small farmers organised into co-operative societies, inshore fishermen who number nearly 10,000, small shopkeepers and professional people would be in a position to contribute, if they so wish, to a scheme of this nature.</P>
    <P>Under the British scheme, self-employed persons are included in a compulsory capacity and greater contributions are paid by them than by employed persons.  Even if the contributions from self-employed persons should be greater than those paid by employees, it should be possible for these types of people to insure themselves, voluntarily, under this scheme. I understand that under the present national health insurance scheme it is possible to become a voluntary contributor and I do not see why it should not be possible to do so under this scheme also.  I should like a provision in this Bill whereby voluntary contributors <Col N="747" /> may join this scheme if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I regard the omission of death duties under this scheme as another great defect in the Bill.  This scheme will be very comprehensive and I understand that it will cost the Exchequer over £2,000,000 this year.  According to the White Paper produced by the last Government, it was estimated that the cost of the death grants would amount to £100,000.  For the sake of saving this sum of money I do not think the Minister should have left out the provision in respect of death grants. Deputy Cogan must be completely ignorant of the circumstances obtaining in this country when he talks of the desirability of omitting the death grants.  Anybody who is acquainted with the circumstances of poor people, particularly in Dublin City, realises that one of their greatest fears is that they will die destitute and that they pay sums of money into so-called insurance companies in order to insure themselves against that possibility.  One of the great benefits, I think, under the last scheme was the fact that this fear, which is a constant and a real fear with poor people in this country, would be removed and that a grant of upwards of £20 would be made to insured contributors under this scheme. The Minister may be saving a comparatively small sum of money.  For the amount involved, I do not think it is worth it.  If necessary, the Minister should cut out the marriage allowance in order to substitute the death grants because I consider that they are much more urgently required in this country to-day.  I do not think a grant of £10 in respect of marriage will make a very great dífference to insured persons whereas a grant, amounting in most cases to £20, would make a very real difference to the poor people of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no provision in this Bill for the payment of health benefits to insured contributors.  I do not know why the Minister has been so silent about his proposals for improving the health services of this country.  I can only hope that he is preparing a comprehensive insurance scheme to cover health benefits to <Col N="748" /> insured contributors in this State. The Minister has had many months in which to draft this Bill and he has had an opportunity of incorporating in it health benefits to insured contributors. Recently the Irish Medical Association worked out a scheme of their own.  It is not necessary to go into the scheme here and probably it is not relevant but one interesting fact which emerges from their proposals is worth mentioning. It is that the many benefits which they propose&mdash;they worked this out on an actuarial basis&mdash;could be brought into operation by the payment by insured contributors of the small sum of 8d.  a week and of 4d.  a week by employers.  That is a small sum for the benefits which it was proposed to give insured contributors under that scheme.  When drafting this Bill the Minister had an opportunity of incorporating in it provisions such as those contained in the New Zealand Act of 1938 in respect of medical benefits of a comprehensive nature.  Even if it meant that insured contributors would have to pay more than they are paying under this Bill, I think it would have been worth it.  If the Minister is contemplating the introduction of legislation to deal with the health problems of this country I hope he will do so on an insurance basis.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill last year, the present Minister, who was then in opposition, informed the House that his Party would bring in an improved scheme of social security.  I do not see that, in any respect, this scheme is an improvement on the scheme brought in last year by the last Government.  It is true that the contributions are less. I think, however, that the people who were to come under the scope of the scheme introduced by the last Government would not have regarded the contributions which they were to be asked to pay as in any way excessive in view of the benefits which it was proposed to give them under that scheme.  To my mind, this scheme&mdash;while providing for reduced contributions from employers and employees&mdash;takes from the scheme of national insurance some of the best benefits which were being introduced by the last Government.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I regarded as one of <Col N="749" /> the most important aspects of the last scheme the fact that it included death grants.  I regarded also as an important aspect the fact that it was comprehensive and that no ceiling was put in regard to the income of wage earners who were to be covered by it. The method by which this scheme is to be financed must be open to suspicion by the Opposition.  It is to be sincerely hoped that the fear which has been expressed that the Minister will use the existing insurance funds for the purpose of defraying the costs of this scheme will not be realised and that this scheme will be run on a businesslike basis.  The danger in the existing financial set-up is that any future Minister for Finance, who may not wish to live up to the obligations imposed on him by this Bill, can get out of these obligations by raiding the insurance funds.  I would regard that as a retrograde step.  I think that the Government has failed to grasp in a courageous fashion the problems presented to this country to-day.  They have failed to introduce a comprehensive plan of social security.  All they have done is to add merely another patch to the patch-work quilt of social legislation of the last 50 years.</P>

      <P>This Dáil and the Government elected by it have many responsibilities to the people of this country, the provision of a social security and welfare scheme being one of them.  The introduction of such a scheme is a very important matter at present because we have suffered over many years from a lack of social security in any kind of comprehensive form.  We had a number of uncoordinated schemes which merely touched the fringe of the problem so far as the people of the country as a whole were concerned.  Plans lay dormant for many years during which the people waited for some co-ordinated comprehensive measure.  Such a scheme was attempted by the inter-Party Government some couple of years back.  An early indication of their intentions was given when Deputy Norton introduced a comprehensive plan to increase the allowances of the lowly paid old age pensioners and widows and orphans.  He indicated <Col N="750" /> that the then Government wanted to come to the rescue of the poorly circumstanced sections of the community, pending the introduction of a more comprehensive scheme.  The preparation of such a scheme could not be speedily brought to conclusion.  In a neighbouring country with all their efforts, it took them three years to prepare such a scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton put his scheme before the House last year.  That scheme was resisted by the present Minister, who moved an amendment in the following terms on the Second Reading of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after &lsquo;That&rsquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Dáil Eireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill, because (1) it does not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community, and (2) it would impose greatly increased burdens on both employees and employers whilst providing benefits little better in many cases than those now available.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To-day we find the Minister who, as Deputy Ryan, moved that amendment, introducing a Bill, the terms of which have forced the Labour Party to move an amendment in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after &lsquo;That&rsquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Dáil Eireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because it proposes to establish an income limit, coverage is not provided in respect of unemployment for female domestic and female farm workers and provision is not made in the Bill for the following benefits:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  retirement pensions without a means test at 65 years of age (60 years for women),</P>
      <P>(2)  death benefits as provided for in the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950,</P>
      <P>(3)  increased maternity grant,</P>
      <P>(4)  maternity attendance allowance, and</P>
      <P>(5)  increased children's allowances.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> I wonder if anybody in the country who takes a serious interest in the legislative activities of their elected representatives, will consider whether this gross delay in dealing with a serious problem is due either to sheer negligence on the part of the present Government, to the fact that great bodies move slowly, or will be inclined to attribute the delay to some motive with a deeper tinge of character. Personally, I am inclined to take the view that it is because of the change of Government and that great bodies do move slowly.  Listening to the document put across to the House this morning by the Minister for Social Welfare, which purported to be a Second Reading speech on a Bill of such importance as a social security Bill, I can only say that it was a most unworthy document and that it bore on the face of it the imprint of its author.  One would not be surprised at that but I was rather disturbed to think from the enthusiasm displayed by the Minister that he seemed to compare the terms of that document with those of a document prepared by another gentleman.  That does indicate fairly clearly, I think, that it was not because of negligence that the people have been kept waiting for this Bill but simply as a political subterfuge and that Dr. Ryan was moved to oppose the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton for no other reason than as a political gesture.  He was a Minister of a political Party who, for 16 years, had failed to do anything to provide a system of social security for our people until Deputy Norton was moved to do so on behalf of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party had power in their hands for 16 years, but they niggled and evaded every attempt to increase the lot of even the old age pensioners and kept their allowance to a maximum of 10/-.  The only effort they made was to provide a miserable increase of 2/6 for certain old age pensioners, a bonus which was to be administered by the local assistance officer during the time of the emergency at a period when prices had soared skywards.  To get that 2/6 one had to be absolutely derelict and destitute. <Col N="752" /> No two persons could get it in the same house.  Where there were two married old age pensioners, only one could get it, and it was paid then only as a result of a visit to the relieving officer, but it was never brought to the Statute Book.  That was the be-all and the end-all of the advance in social security made by Fianna Fáil apart from the widows' and orphans' pensions which were introduced under pressure from the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach promised the Labour Party that they would introduce it.  In fact, a Bill was moved in this House by the late Deputy Murphy for that purpose.  The &ldquo;irresponsible Party&rdquo; still persisted in what they believed to be a rightful policy for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make no apology for proceeding with our programme irrespective of the political theologians who have denounced us as being utterly irresponsible and with having no regard for the finances of the country.  All that is completely unrealistic.  A lot of people have discovered that our programme is a good one and is in the interests of the country.  I say that Fianna Fáil have only paid lip service to these social services.  They gave the widow a pension of 5/- a week with a means test on it.  She was not entitled to earn anything to supplement the 5/-. If she earned 3/-, then 1/- was deducted from the pension while the deduction was 2/- if she earned 4/-. We had inspectors in high powered motor cars going around the country examining into the means of those widows.  I remember myself drawing attention to the fact that a widow in County Limerick had her old age pension slashed because she committed the <Col N="753" /> cardinal sin of keeping a goat.  The next time the inspector came around he found that she had a cow and then her pension was completely cut off. Even the hens were taxed.  I quoted figures here before relating to widows who kept a few hens or a goat.  In fact, if a widow kept any kind of conceivable animal at all she was visited by the inspector.  Her means were examined and her pension was slashed. That went on under the Fianna Fáil régime.  I say that any Government which would apply such tests as these has not its heart in social welfare or social security.  It was only against their grain and their conscience that they left the 10/- to the old age pensioners. At a time when money had completely lost its value, they grudgingly gave an additional half-crown to be taken away at any opportunity that presented itself later.</P>
    <P>The first genuine and honest effort that was made in the case of the old age and other pensioners was that made when the inter-Party Government came in.  The Fianna Fáil Government had made a declaration in the previous October that they could not possibly remit the means test in the case of the old age pensioners.  They said it would cost £500,000.  That was the declaration they made in October, 1947, when we brought forward our motion.  They resisted it and said they could not afford it, that it would cost £500,000.  The motion, as Deputies will remember, was defeated. But in a few months' time, after the change of Government and when the finances of the country had undergone no change, the inter-Party Government were able to remit the taxation that had been put on by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  That remission amounted to between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000.  We remitted the taxes on beer, cigarettes, tobacco and cinema seats.  The Fianna Fáil Government had said that they could not afford £500,000 for social welfare, but the inter-Party Government could afford to provide £2,500,000 straight away for widows, orphans, old age pensioners and the blind.  I admit that it is rather bitter for the Government that I have to repeat these things here, but they are true.</P>

      <P>The leopard does not change his spots very easily.  Fianna Fáil became perturbed when they found that their thunder was being stolen.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he was at the time, told us that he had plans and schemes prepared.  He said his plans were ready all the time.  Fianna Fáil is never slack about planning.  I remember Deputy Dr. Browne saying in the House that when he went to the Custom House, the only thing he found there were plans.  In fact, he could hardly get inside the door. Plans were piled high and he could not push the door in.  Deputy Norton told us that when he went to the Department of Social Welfare he found no such schemes there.  He found nothing except the heads of schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he was then, opposed the Norton welfare scheme on the grounds that it was not good enough.  Another reason he gave was that he wanted to do something better. He did not think that Deputy Norton had gone far enough, and he said: &ldquo;We will do better than that.&rdquo;  I agree that he was like Lanna Machree's dog.  He was prepared to go a bit of the road with everybody, but he would agree to nothing in the finish.  He agreed with certain items in the Norton Bill, but his argument all the time was: &ldquo;Anything that you can do, we can do it better.&rdquo;  He said that the Fianna Fáil Government would introduce a better scheme.  Well, the Norton Bill did not reach its final stage and a change of Government took place.  I think that anyone reading last year's Bill and the Bill which has been presented this year will have to concede that the Minister has fallen down completely on his promises.  He was to give us a better Bill than last year's Bill and was going to make it much more comprehensive than Deputy Norton's.  He was going to do all sorts of things.  I want to deal particularly with the death benefit for which provision had been made in the Norton Bill, and which has now been slashed. Deputy Cogan did not see anything <Col N="755" /> wrong in taking away the death benefit. I think he must be living in the clouds, particularly since he slipped over to that side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy to mention that insurance, in regard to death, was being attended to in this country long before any provision was made by the State in regard to social welfare for the people.  As long as most of us can remember, we have had insurance in regard to death, not by the State, but by the insurance companies.  We know that our people have been accustomed to insure their lives against the time when death would come to them and against the danger, as Deputy D. Costello has expressed it, of dying destitute and not being able to provide decent funeral arrangements.  Our people have always had a proper respect for their dead, and every family, irrespective of its station in life, desires to pay respect and honour to a deceased member.  It was not an uncommon thing for families to plunge themselves into debt because they felt there was a bounden duty on them to bury their relatives decently.  That was one of the principal reasons why people insured their lives, so that money would be available to meet the funeral expenses.  I had personal experience myself of seeing charitable neighbours going around and making a collection in the case of poor people so that the funeral obsequies would be properly carried out.</P>
    <P>I regard that provision in the Norton Bill as one of the most important and fundamental features in social insurance. Yet, it is one of the items taken out of this Bill.  One is inclined to ask why.  Is it because it cuts across a big national industry?  Is it that the State has no right to interfere with some vested interest?  I have a grave fear myself that the reason is that we want to preserve this little happy hunting ground for people who have been doing this business for half a century and, in the financial sense, have been growing well on it.  I have never yet heard of an insurance company that was not doing well.  Whether or not it cuts across the business of insurance companies it is, in my <Col N="756" /> opinion, one of the first things that should be included by any Minister or Government when dealing with a social security plan for the welfare of the people.  I regret that this death benefit was one of the first things that has been slashed in this Bill, and I cannot compliment the Minister on doing that.  I would like to join with Deputy Costello in the appeal which he made to have it put back into this Bill. Unless that is done, no one can honestly or justifiably call this Bill a social welfare plan for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>The big case made is that the contribution under this Bill will be less than in Deputy Norton's plan.  That is agreed.  Last year the Minister told us that he was going to do all this by means of taxation.  He did not agree with the contributory method except in rare instances.  Now he has reduced the contributions.  Deputy Cogan was eloquent in praise of the fact that the farm worker had only to pay ? per week and the farmer ?. I think he is more interested in the farmers than in the workers' side of the matter.  What have the insured persons lost as a result of the reduction of the contribution?  Under Deputy Norton's Bill they would have got old age and retirement pensions at 65 for men and 60 for women.  That is now gone and these people must now wait until they are 70 years of age.  Anyone interested in insurance could determine the value of a contribution which will ensure people the old age pension five years for men and ten years for women before it will be payable now.</P>
    <P>I think the age of 65 could easily be justified as the age for retirement.  The Minister says that people ought not to retire at 65, that they ought to be kept working.  He says that they could make arrangements to get sickness benefit up to the age of 70.  Surely that will be an encouragement to malingering. Men may want to retire from work at 65 and have a reasonable pension in their declining years.  That would provide an opportunity for earlier promotion for others in industry and an opening for youths to get into industry.  The Minister thinks that a <Col N="757" /> man should work until 70.  Employers think differently.  How many employers in the cities and in the country are inclined to keep people at work over the age of 65?  In the biggest industry that we have, Coras Iompair Éireann, which is controlled by the Government, the retiring age is 65.  If you are strong as an Apollo you will not be allowed to work there after 65. They are the biggest employers of labour in the country.  What is the sense of the Minister telling us that he would like to see people continuing to work after 65 when the fact is that more and more employers are putting people on the road at 65? Coras Iompair Éireann give pensions to men going out at 65.  When these men are 70, the pension is cut from 37/6 to 6/- when the men are supposed to get the old age pension. I admit that that is a pretty reasonable pension when compared with that given by other employers.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for the retirement of men at 65 to give them a chance in their declining years of enjoying a rest.  Under Deputy Norton's Bill women were to get the retirement pension at 60; now they have to go on until 70.  In the country there may be some difficulty about that.  The Minister referred to that last year.  But, even in the country districts, I say that retirement at 65 would be more desirable even than in the cities because it would encourage farmers to transfer their holdings to their sons and thus give them an opportunity to marry earlier than they are marrying now.  In that way the birth rate, which has been declining at an alarming rate, would increase. We all know of the problem of late marriages in the rural areas.  That is attributable almost entirely to the impossibility of a young man marrying until such time as his father hands the holding over to him.  There may be two or three sons in the family, but nothing can be done because the old man will not get out.  If he were given a pension at 65, he would be able to hand over his farm.  It is generally conceded by everybody who knows anything about the conditions in the rural areas that that would be a vast advantage to the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>In this Bill there is a complete ignoring of domestic workers. The reason adduced for that by the Minister last year, as reported in column 1,118, Volume 124, when speaking on the 2nd March was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill also brings in farm workers and domestic workers.  I do not know about this question of domestic workers coming in.  What strikes me is that, if you can believe all the talk that goes on, and I think you can, there is never a domestic worker unemployed for want of a job. If that is the case, a domestic worker cannot qualify for unemployment benefit, so it is unfair to put up the contribution.  She can never qualify in present circumstances, and I am quite sure that they are not going to change so that they will be looking for work and cannot get it.  I would be inclined to leave them as they are.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has left them as they are.  The fact is that the domestic workers are not here, and the scarcity is attributable to the fact that they are the biggest section of the workers who are emigrating.  That particular section of the community are pariahs who are ignored here.  They are welcomed, however, by the housekeepers in England for service there.  In every metropolitan and provincial paper we see advertisements for workers for hotels and domestic service in England who are recruited from the girls who should be in this country as domestic servants, but who will not remain here <Col N="759" /> owing to the unfair and unreasonable conditions obtaining.  Therefore, they are pushed outside the door.</P>
    <P>They are not worthy of inclusion in this measure of social welfare for protection against unemployment.  They are not waiting to get employment here.  They go where they will get the best of terms.  These girls should, if possible, be kept here and they could easily be kept here.  I do not think they have any desire to leave this country if it were not for the magnet which attracts them.  A girl from a village here goes to England and writes home telling of the grand time she has, the fine wages, the outings and the general conditions of social welfare.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have a serious responsibility in this matter, and that for the small amount involved it is suicidal for the Government to leave out that important section of the community. In that way they are reducing the possibility of increasing our population here.  These girls are getting married in England, not to Irish boys as a rule, but to Englishmen and men of other nationalities.  I take a very serious view of the ignoring of the position of female workers and I think they should be included, both the female domestic workers and the female agricultural workers.  What is the sense of including the male agricultural workers and excluding the female?  In certain counties, particularly in the dairying counties, the female agricultural worker is at least as important as the male worker.  What is the justification for including the male agricultural workers and excluding the females?  In the Constitution we are supposed to recognise the rights of men and women, but we only pay lip-service to that.  There is very little respect for the women in agricultural or domestic service.</P>
    <P>These are the complaints which I have to lodge against this Bill which is alleged to be an improvement in every way on Deputy Norton's measure. Last year the Minister, in one of his facetious moments, said that Deputy Norton could not look with any complacency <Col N="760" /> on his handiwork; that after three years of office he could not look with complacency on what he had produced, that it was nothing more or less than the Beveridge plan truncated and cut.  If that was true, the present Minister has very little ground for complacency when he presents this Bill.  He got a Bill which he did not improve but which he has disimproved and now he can sit back with all the complacency he can command, having taken over the Beveridge plan which he says the Norton Bill has slashed, to the detriment of the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Keyes has spoken in this debate in such a reasonable manner. While not agreeing with many of his views I am grateful that he has at least been constructive in his criticism. I am always very interested in this question whether people should retire at 65 or 70.  I expressed certain views on that subject when we were discussing the past Old Age Pensions Bill, and I still hold the same views in regard to the retirement benefits.  My grievance has nothing to do with the age of a person.  It has to do with his physical condition.  There are many unfortunate people in this country who are deformed from birth; there are many others who are deformed from some misfortune or other during the course of their lives.  I do feel while we are arguing here as to the merits or otherwise of giving a pension or retirement benefit at the age of 65, we are forgetting those who are incapable of qualifying for any benefit for the reason that they are incapable of doing any work.</P>

      <P>They are not the unemployed.  They are the people who are unemployed by the force of God's providence and not by force of any economic circumstances.  Still, it is one of the things that agitate my mind whenever I consider the state of the law in this country as regards social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been raised about <Col N="761" /> the attitude of insurance companies, and I am prepared to bet&mdash;a very small amount, say, half-crown&mdash;that over 50 per cent. of the insurances that are paid by insurance companies in this country providing for benefits payable on death are effected on self-employed farmers who never contribute a penny and never will contribute a penny so long as the present state of the law exists.  I am not blaming the Minister or the Government or Mr. Norton for this.  We have to crawl before we are able to walk.  We have made strides, and it is not for me to repeat the record of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and the various other Acts which have culminated in the Bill which is before the House to-day.  I am interested on behalf of a section of the community which is not even compensated either in this Bill or in the Bill that was introduced by Deputy Norton&mdash;the self-employed farmer who has only himself to depend on and who, incidentally, has only the commercial insurance companies of this country that he can use as a lever or as a means to provide himself with at least a decent burial.</P>
    <P>In relation to domestic servants I must say my feelings are very much on the side of the Minister that most of them will not, in fact, get any benefit from the Bill.  Surely Deputy Keyes can see that if there are such great inducements to domestic servants to go over to England and if he believes and knows that most of them do go to England, then he should realise that there is little point in asking them to contribute anything while they are in this country because they will never get anything as a result of those contributions.</P>
    <P>One suggestion I have to make to the House with reference to domestic servants is that we should coin a new word and that we should for ever banish the words &ldquo;domestic servant&rdquo; in the hope that the connotation that they have might also be banished from the minds of the people of this country. They are human beings and they are entitled to be regarded as such and to be treated as such.  It is all right <Col N="762" /> if you are a factory worker; it does not matter what kind of menial job you have in a factory; it is all right to brush or sweep or lie on your back against nails on a fair day.  It is not all right to be a domestic servant. Could we take a selection of words from the dictionary, shuffle them together, deal them out, see what we get and use that word in our ordinary language in future in referring to those unfortunate beings?</P>
    <P>I notice that no reference is made in this Bill-there was a reference made by the Minister&mdash;to the fact that it would be a concealed form of taxation to force employers to insure their domestic servants.  That brings me to the point that so far as I know there is no allowance made to the employer for any amounts that he contributes towards national health insurance or unemployment insurance.  Under this new Bill, which will involve a combined contribution of 2/4, the employer contributes over £6 in the course of the year.  He also has to pay income-tax at the present rate of 6/6 in the £ on the same £6.  That means that if he is paying at the full rate he contributes £2 income-tax and £6 insurance contribution, making a total of £8, while the employee, and I am not against him for a moment, receives the benefit and at the same time does not have the amount so contributed taken into account as part of his income.</P>
    <P>I do think that there is some unfair discrimination there between the employer and the person whom he employs. I do not know what suggestion I could make to remedy it.  Perhaps it would meet the case if the £6 which he contributes were to be taken at the bottom like ordinary insurance and six sums at half the standard rate were taken off his gross income in the way in which the premiums which are payable on an ordinary life-insurance policy are taken off at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton had a great deal to say about the provisions of the Bill which was introduced by him in 1951. I am not going to enter into any controversy about the intentions or motives of the then Minister for Social Welfare.  What occurs to me is this; <Col N="763" /> no provision was made in the 1951 Budget for the money which was supposed to be spent if and when the 1951 Social Welfare Bill became law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said you will find it you wait for a week that provision will be made.  It will certainly be found that there was no provision made for Deputy Norton's Social Welfare Bill by the Minister for Finance who introduced the 1951 Budget.  It may be rather footling to mention that under this Bill the person having a means of £1 per week will be entitled to an extra £1, making a total of £2, whereas the person who has already got a means of £2 per week will be entitled to a pension of some sort, say, 5/- or 10/- per week, which will make a total weekly income of £2 5s. or £2 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that if there is going to be discrimination it should be on the side of the person with the lower income. In other words if a person has a £1, he should be entitled to have £2 5s.  If a person has an income of £2 per week I feel he might be left at that.  I would far rather see no discrimination against a person who has lower means for the purposes of calculation in the Bill.  I might also mention that, so far as I know, a very meagre provision was made for social welfare officers throughout the country when the Coalition Government introduced the Social Welfare Bill in 1948.  Obviously every Act of this kind puts a great <Col N="764" /> deal of extra work on social welfare officers.  Apart from the pensions which already exist, many thousands of applications will have to be considered if and when, this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister never said anything like that. It seems perfectly obvious to me, since the ceiling has been raised for the purposes of means far above what it has ever been at before, that new applicants will come forward.  All this additional work will fall to the social welfare officers.  I am quite sure that Deputy Norton, or whoever advised him, made very scant provision for the social welfare officers.  I know they will be told to shoulder their burdens and keep on smiling.  I would appeal to the Minister to make a generous provision in the way of a lump sum for each social welfare officer in the country when he has completed the heavy work which will be entailed when this Act comes into operation.</P>

I am not saying, nor do I believe that the Minister or the Government feel that this will be the last Social Welfare Bill that will be introduced into this country.</P>

      <P>What are you grumbling about then?  To my understanding, this is only part of the scheme which will involve both social services and public health.  There are matters which cannot be dealt with in detail in this Bill, but which will be dealt with when the Public Health Bill is introduced by the Minister in a short time.</P>
      <P>I should have said already, but I will say it now, that I hope the Minister will re-examine the position of the branch managers in the employment exchanges throughout the country.  I feel that they also will have an increased burden to bear as a result of the passing of this Act and that they deserve greater consideration than has been given to them in the past. I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to consider their position and to treat them generously.  They have to handle the vast bulk of the work which is done in the employment exchanges in the smaller towns through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister again for having made this further advance along the right <Col N="766" /> road.  I hope the day will come when another section of the community&mdash; the farming community, who are self-employed as well as the workers, of whom we hear so much from the Labour Party&mdash;will be able, as a result of legislation enacted in this House, to get some of the benefits received by their colleagues, who work in the factories and shops, are now getting.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin is very annoyed.  He is in bad humour.  I cannot blame him, poor man.  Let me say that I think the Minister and the Government are deserving of the best congratulations this House can possibly give them for the manner in which they have introduced this Bill and for the many worth-while provisions in it.  I am not at all surprised that the Labour Party are a bit annoyed having regard to the fact that for three and a half years they had been promising to give the country a comprehensive Social Welfare Bill. The Labour Party is like the old man who dangled a carrot in front of the donkey and said: &ldquo;Lady, if you work well to-day, you will get this carrot very soon.&rdquo;</P>

There is an old saying that the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it.  At long last we are to have a Social Welfare Bill.  It will be the fault of the members who are not on this side of the House if the Bill does not become law in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember well when Deputy Norton, then Tánaiste, introduced his Bill.  The present Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, offered to take the Social Welfare Bill out of the realm of politics a very fine and sensible suggestion, in my opinion.  He offered to agree to a Select Committee of 15 similar to that which we have examining the Defence Bill.  That was turned down. Again, an offer was made, in view of <Col N="767" /> the straitened circumstances of the unfortunate people in receipt of national health insurance, sickness benefit and, especially, of those in receipt of disablement benefit, that a special Bill would be rushed through to give those people a desired increase. That, too, was turned down.  It fell on deaf ears notwithstanding the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government had handed over the social welfare organisation to the Coalition Government with a surplus of almost £8,000,000 in the national health insurance.</P>

      <P>The many false charges made by Deputy Norton were definitely refuted to-day in this House, when the present Minister dealt with the many files that were there prior to 1948.  That, in itself, gave the lie that nothing was being done to implement the Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy Norton referred to those files as a scrap of paper.  I like Deputy Norton's idea of a scrap of paper! It is no wonder that paper is scarce if Deputy Norton's idea of a scrap of paper covers files upon files. That false charge has been nailed to the mast and I hope that no Deputy in this House will again resurrect any false charge against any Minister of State, you had the word of Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, and you have his word to-day.  Not alone had you his word as Minister but, in addition, the Minister produced the very files that were in the Department in connection with the proposed welfare Bill before he left office in 1948.</P>

They passed the 1924 Act by Section 7 of which they assessed any person who had transferred property or income within three years. That was done in accordance with the Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal Bill of 1924 and their subsequent measure in 1928.  That is what Fine Gael did for the old age pensioners.</P>

There were many other sections of that amendment which were of great benefit to many of the old age pensioners in the country.</P>
      <P>I remember well how the blind people were catered for during the régime of the old Fine Gael Government. No person under 50 years of age could claim a blind pension. Again, Fianna Fáil came to the rescue and altered that from 50 to 30.  Then we are told that Fianna Fáil did nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention the Treaty until it was mentioned but I am ready at all times to defend my attitude in regard to the Treaty.  As I was saying, there was no relaxation of the means test.  If people on the Opposition side of the House assert that there was a relaxation of the means test during the inter-Party Government régime I say emphatically that there was not.  No order was sent to the investigation officers or to the surveyors or the supervisors&mdash;certainly no order that we know of.  Therefore, any assertion that there was some relaxation of the means test is not true. The same procedure which operated during the lifetime of the previous Fianna Fáil Government was continued. You will find that the officers who have to do their job will do the very same thing to-morrow regardless of what Government is in power. They will investigate, they are bound by the regulations to investigate, and they will do their work efficiently. Therefore, any charge that they are unduly hard is not quite fair.</P>
      <P>One provision under this Bill, above any other, which I think should be palatable to the jealous people and to everybody in the country is the fact that we are going to give something decent to the widows by way of noncontributory pension and, further, that there will be a relaxation in the means test.</P>

      <P>That, above all other things, should commend this Bill to the House.  Instead of trying to play politics and to gain Party advantages we should welcome this Bill and every Bill of its kind that comes along, as they will eventually, which seeks to improve the lot of the people concerned. They are the people who deserve the money most.  Some people <Col N="773" /> may say that £1 is not much.  I can assure you that if you should find yourself in this city or in any part of the country without 1/- you would consider 1/- a lot of money.  Most of us have seen that day.  Instead of playing Party politics we should try to be constructive in our criticism.  We should endeavour to discover if the Bill can be improved upon in any way because after all, we are here to represent the interests of the community and not to make allegations about something that happened 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>We received many rosy promises during the three and a half years of inter-Party Government.  When I was sitting on the Opposition side of the House I welcomed the Social Welfare Bill of 1949 because I saw that it was a step forward and because, at that time, I was quite sure that the then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Norton, was serious about it and meant to implement it regardless of the consequences.  I felt that he was ready to push that Bill through this House even if it meant the smashing of the Coalition Government.</P>

    <P>There has been some grievance about not including people over 65 years of age in this Bill.  I know many people of 65 who are more active and more anxious to work than men who are very many years younger than them.  In the past few months I have met many people who have reached the age of 70 and who now have a grievance that the county council have let them go because they are 70. <Col N="774" /> These men are as active at 70 as they were 25 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention has been made of Córas Iompair Éireann workers. Córas Iompair Éireann workers were discharged with a pension at 65&mdash;and most of them got a better pension than Deputy Norton proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Their pension was not 24/- a week.  Deputy Norton's proposal was 24/- a week on retirement.  The Córas Iompair Éireann worker, suffering from an infirmity of one kind or another, is entitled to benefit under the National Health Insurance Act until he reaches the age of 70 and the benefits payable under the National Health Insurance Act are far away and beyond those proposed in Deputy Norton's scheme of 24/- a week.  If he is a married man with a wife and children still a liability on him, that is taken into consideration.  That will mean that the Córas Iompair Éireann worker will get under this Bill more than he would get if he were to enjoy a retirement pension under Deputy Norton's Bill.  As it is with the Córas Iompair Éireann worker, so also is it with any other person who attains the age of 65 and who, because of infirmity, is no longer able to give his services to an employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear again criticism because domestic employees are not included in this Bill.  If we are to be honest with ourselves and with the country. we shall have to agree that most of the girls in domestic employment in this country get married at an early age.  Are we going to ask them to contribute heavy sums to a fund out of which they are going to get nothing? The vast majority of them will get nothing out of it nor will they ever <Col N="775" /> have any hopes of getting anything. Therefore I think it would be grossly dishonest to extract from domestic workers moneys which they would have no hope of getting back to any appreciable extent; it would be grossly dishonest to dangle before their eyes benefits which they would scarcely have any hope of enjoying.</P>
    <P>Take the position of the spinster, the domestic servant in employment who prefers to continue in employment on her own rather than join the order of St. Benedict.  There is in this Bill ample provision made for her when she reaches the stage at which her services are not acceptable to employers in this country.  The increased national health allowance is there to tide her over her days of illness.  If there is one thing in regard to which we can all join in saying: &ldquo;Thank God it is finished,&rdquo; it is disablement benefit.  Up to the present we had the sick person getting 22/6 per week national health benefit.  That continued for six months until he became what was known as disabled. Then he was paid disablement benefit at the reduced rate of 15/- per week. I have argued and pleaded in this House on more than one occasion that when a person has been 26 weeks in receipt of sickness benefit, his physical and financial position is much worse than it was six months previously.  Is that the time to reduce his benefit? This Bill obliterates that system, I hope, for ever and I hope no future Government will ever dream of reintroducing such a section or regulation under which there will be a reduction in benefit at the end of six months' illness.  The financial and physical position of a person who has been sick for six months is getting progressively worse and surely his benefit should not be reduced at the end of six months. This Bill will do away with that, I hope, for ever.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of the charge that Fianna Fáil did nothing by way of extending social services during 16 years.  Deputies forget that Fianna Fáil in their 16 years of office increased sickness benefit by 50 per cent.  and disablement by 100 per cent.  Despite that, by good management and supervision and fearless tacties, they handed <Col N="776" /> over £8,000,000 to the Coalition Government a couple of years ago.  There is one particular type of benefit that I would urge the Minister to reconsider and that is the marriage benefit.  I believe that a domentic servant who has been paying national health insurance for a number of years, whether she got benefit during that period, matters not&mdash;should get an increased allowance.</P>
    <P>She is going to cease membership when she gets married, for ever and a day, but she has been paying weekly contributions, perhaps, for quite a while.  I think she is entitled to a little more than is provided and I would urge the Minister to increase the marriage benefit beyond £10.  Most of our domestic servants when they get married find that their pockets are not too full.  Let us give the domestic servant something to help to buy the old dresser, the table and so on.  Certainly I believe a little more would help in a big way to purchase many of the kitchen utensils that are so desirable in a new home.  I think that the Minister should re-examine the position to see if they could be helped in any way.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that we are not going to have any great increase in contributions.  I believe that increased contributions would lead to more unemployment. Many decent employers &mdash;and there are still many decent employers in this country&mdash;have never deducted, from the wages of their domestics or other employees, the insured person's portion of the weekly contribution.  They paid it themselves. That I know would be a heavy burden on some people if the cotributions were increased and perhaps it would be mean that they would let some of their employees go.  I think that would be a disastrous thing.  The alternative, of course, would be to begin to deduct the insured persons' portion each week from the wages of employees, who were not heretofore in the custom of paying contributions.  That would extract from them a heavy weekly contribution such as was desired under the 1949 Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>That was going to disorganise the little weekly household money of many of our workers in the country.  I am <Col N="777" /> very pleased that we are not going to demand under this Bill any very heavy contribution that, perhaps, would have detrimental effects on unemployment. Again, the means test has been considerably altered.  We find that in future the man with the £1 a week to-day will be entitled to get that £1 from the State.</P>

      <P>I know that the Deputies opposite are finding it hard to digest what I am saying.  I am trying to educate them.  The greatest boast that we can make is the political education we have given the Fine Gael Party.  Some of the Deputies opposite were not here when we were doing that.  There are some fine sensible people on the benches opposite, and they know they were educated by Fianna Fáil even to the extent of raising the cost of social services from £3,150,000 to what it is going eventually to be&mdash;over £21,000,000.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the man with £104 a year is going to get his slice of the old age pension.  If he is a married man, and has £208 a year, he still will get a slice of it.  That represents a great advance.  I agree that an income of £4 a week is not too high for a man, yet the principle is there, that the State is prepared to consider such a person in his old age.  I know that if the old age pension code were to be fully examined&mdash;that would take many months of serious thought&mdash;it could perhaps he made more acceptable to the people.  You meet with cases of this sort.  There is a farmer living on one side of the road who is able to meet his obligations.  He transfers his farm to his son on the occasion of marriage regardless of what the valuation is.  At the other side of the road, there is a person with a lesser income and he gets the pension.  I wish that a remedy could be found for that situation.  I have often tried to find one myself, but I must confess that I have not succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> I have on many occasions seen people not exactly deprive themselves of property but hand over property.  I think the section in the Bill dealing with that is a good one.  It will encourage people to get their sons or daughters married, and will enable them to meet their obligations to their families.  The Deputies opposite will find it hard to swallow this Bill because the goods are now going to be delivered.  On the 1st of July next, a new era will dawn for old age pensioners, for sick people and more especially for unfortunate widows who have been left penniless. That is not any empty promise.  It is here now, and it is being backed up by Deputies who are sincere, honest and brimful of giving hope to the needy.  I would beg the Deputies opposite not to obstruct this Bill.</P>

He did not, however, tell the House, or his supporters, the bad parts that are in it, and he did not tell them the good parts in <Col N="779" /> Deputy Norton's Bill which are not in this Bill.  When Deputy Norton's Bill was before the House, Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he was then, put down a motion proposing that the Dáil decline to give it a Second Reading. In view of that, I cannot understand how any Deputy sitting behind the Government to-day can support this Bill.  The reason why Deputy Dr. Ryan then objected to the Social Security Bill and asked the Dáil to decline to give it a Second Reading was because &ldquo;it did not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community&rdquo; and because &ldquo;it would impose a greatly increased burden&rdquo;, etc.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Cowan is such a stickler for order.  I am glad that there is no question that he will not look after in future.  The House is improved considerably by his attention to duty and I want to compliment the Deputy on his keen mind.  If I have been guilty of any breach of order in failing to quote, I am delighted that the Deputy has drawn my attention to the omission because it makes what I am quoting more important.  I am quoting from Volume 124, of the 2nd March, 1951, column 1092, of the Official Reports. After Deputy Norton, the then Minister for Social Welfare, had concluded his second reading speech on the Social Welfare Bill Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, moved an amendment, I presume in the name and with the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I know that he had not the support then of Deputy Cowan, but times have changed and Deputy Davern and he are now on the same side of the House.  Deputy Dr. Ryan said then:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I move: To delete all words after &lsquo;That&rsquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because (1) it does not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first part of the amendment. The only thing that was wrong with the inter-Party Government's Bill was that it was not comprehensive enough.  Yet, the Government now come in with a Bill that is considerably reduced in very important aspects.  At that time they went forward with the Party Press and showed what they would do if they <Col N="781" /> were the Government.  I do not say that it is Deputy Cowan's Press, but it is the Press of the Party to which he now gives support and which he helped to put in office.  That is a freeman's right.  I do not blame him for that.  He has every right to do that if he thinks fit.  The only thing wrong with it was that the Fianna Fáil Party led the electors to believe that, if they were returned to office, they would bring in a Bill on the lines outlined by the present Minister in the speech which he delivered as reported in this volume.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern and Deputy Seán Flanagan said that the self-employed farmer was excluded from Deputy Norton's Bill and they appealed for his inclusion in this Bill.  Of course that is incorrect.  There was a scheme devised by which the farmer could obtain the benefits under Deputy Norton's Bill.  If small farmers, or even large farmers, joined a co-operative society they could secure the benefits from that Bill.  That is conveniently forgotten.</P>
    <P>As to the death benefit, I do not know where some Deputies were reared.  I do know that when death comes to the family of a worker or to a small farmer, it is a cruel hardship in two ways.  There is first the loss of the dear one.  The next difficulty is the cost which arises on that occasion. Where it is possible, an insurance policy is taken out to cover that.  In some cases, it is true to say that it is an endowment policy.  Whether it is an endowment policy or not, it is true that certain people, if they are able to do it even in a small way, try to make provision for that sad event when it arises.</P>
    <P>I remember Fianna Fáil stumping the country advocating pensions at 65. They outdid the Labour Party in shouting for that.  They had 16½ years to give effect to that but they never did it.  Again, we know that when a motion was put down to increase the old age pensions in 1947, we were told that it would cost £500,000 and that it could not be done.  Of course, it was a blessing when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government cut the old age pension by 1/-, because if they had not that <Col N="782" /> argument Fianna Fáil would never have become the Government.  It was a gift then.  Of course, nobody who has any political sense would approve of it.  The fact remains that from that day to this we have never been let forget it.  It is a great blessing that it is not debatable now.  As I say, that was a gift to Fianna Fáil because, to give them their due, they have made full use of it from that day to this. Every time they get an opportunity to throw it at an old fellow or a young fellow, it is thrown, as if that was a criminal act and the only one of the whole Administration.</P>

Deputies may say that there was high taxation but that did not matter to the beneficiaries, who were paying.  There were being appealed to stay where they were getting these great benefits.  When Deputy Norton's Social Security Bill came for the consideration of this House, it was a source of satisfaction to me that the benefits under the Bill were very close to, if not as good as, the benefits which were available in Northern Ireland.  It was also a source of delight to me that the Bill would prove of some inducement to our fellow countrymen in the <Col N="783" /> North or, at least, that it would remove one of the arguments against uniting with the South.  Whether the worker in Northern Ireland is a Unionist or a capitalist he is very fond of the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; or of the &ldquo;half-crown&rdquo; in particular.</P>

    <P>To come back to the Bill.  The comparison which I saw in Northern Ireland was a severe jolt to me.  I was not aware that the advantages were so striking.  It is true that this Bill will go some of the distance.  I am not <Col N="784" /> saying it is not an advance.  It is an advance, and I would like to say that the Labour Party has done a great deal of work.  They have succeeded in doing at least two things; they succeeded in getting the Fianna Fáil Government to drop the Standstill Wages Order.  When they got them to introduce a measure such as this, it was not bad work.</P>

      <P>It could be better. What I am going to try to do is to get the Government to make it better if I can.  I have heard supporters of the Government saying that their Bill is better than the one brought in by Deputy Norton.  I am satisfied then that they are not going to urge the Government to improve the Bill.  The object of the amendment put down by the Labour Party is to improve the Bill.  Surely, it is not meant to go against the Bill.  It is meant to make the Bill a better one and our appeal to the Government is to make it a better Bill, thereby giving the people who are so interested the benefits to which they are entitled, whether they be the aged, the widow, the orphan or the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits have been withdrawn from them.  I think that Deputy Norton was perfectly reasonable when he asserted that the insurance companies were opposed to them.  It is a well-konwn fact that every time the British Government attempted an improvement in the social well-being of the people the big insurance corporations of Britain rushed in and attempted to prevent the Government from doing their duty.  We all know that it is said of a particular Prime Minister in <Col N="786" /> England that he delayed action to enable the insurance companies to rectify their position.</P>
    <P>The principle of insurance companies is the same all over and if this sort of insurance was taken over as a State responsibility it would lessen their takings and interfere to a great extent with insurance company interests.  I know well that the insurance companies in this country dislike these two benefits that have been dropped and I suggest to the Government that they should carefully reconsider this matter and restore them to the Bill.  No Opposition Deputy can put that down as an amendment, in my opinion, and therefore it must come from the Minister himself.  It is true we can talk about it but we may not move it as an amendment.</P>
    <P>The question of omitting domestic servants from the benefits is again, I submit, a serious one.  It is true that it has some bearing on the question of emigration, because if they were protected fully here and had the amenities here that they should have there would not be the same desire to emigrate that exists at present.</P>
    <P>The case has been well made and I subscribe to it that when you include the male agricultural worker, there is no reason why you should exclude the female agricultural worker.  I doubt if it is constitutional to do so, because there must not be sectional legislation; when the law is passed the benefits should be for all, that is, where classes like this are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has been able to tell us what will be in the Budget.  He said that this Social Security Bill will be catered for.  That is some information for us and I hope it is correct. It would be very wise if it was catered for in the Book of Estimates.  However, I suppose Deputy Flanagan knows and, therefore, I will not challenge his information on it.</P>
    <P>We were asked for constructive criticism.  We will criticise as far as we can and we will put down amendments. The motion that is before the House is a constructive one.  It indicates what should be in the Bill and we are asking the Government to <Col N="787" /> consider that matter.  But from the way in which the Government's supporters and the front bench have met it, it is quite clear that no matter what amendment we put down it will not be considered.  That would be a pity and a mistake.  I advise the Government to consider carefully every amendment put down by Labour, by Fine Gael and by the Farmers' Party&mdash; Clann na Talmhan&mdash;to this measure, to improve it and extend its scope.</P>
    <P>No matter what we do there will be still sections excluded that we would like to benefit.  There will be people left out who will have to be protected by the charitably-minded people of the country.  You cannot cater for every individual.  There will be people excluded and there will be border-line cases that you would like to see coming in.  It is a pity that we cannot be perfect but we can make the Bill as perfect as can be.  The nearest approach to perfection that you can get was the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare, sponsored by the inter-Party Government and supported by the various Parties composing that Government.</P>
    <P>There was no brass hat in Fine Gael who opposed that, because the brass hats of Fine Gael are the people who, in spite of what some of the youngsters over there say, subscribed to the democratic programme of Sinn Féin when this country had the first Irish Government in 1919.  Each and every one of us subscribed to that.  Why sneer at us as brass hats?  The brass hats were the people who did lead the country. I, for one, take the description of a brass hat with honour.  I do not think it a reflection.  It is fired sneeringly at times.  To put on a brass hat in the service of this country or of any other country is something to be proud of.  I am proud of the fact that I am a brass hat.  Let me say I hope that I never abuse that brass hat and that every time I ever wore it I dealt with all the questions that came before me with a sense of fair play and justice.  I can say that truthfully.  I hope that everybody else wearing the particular brass hat he wanted to wear can say the same.</P>

      <P>It is a regrettable thing that in discussing an important matter like this we should have such Party politics during this day.  It is regrettable also to see here members trying to take advantage for their Party because of what they are doing under this Bill.  We are accepting the principle of the Bill and the reason we put down the amendment is that we wanted to make it a better Bill and at least as good a Bill as the Bill the inter-Party Government introduced in 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was done in 1951?  Does Deputy Davern or any other member of the opposite side think that we, as a Labour Party, believe that we are doing full justice to those whom we are anxious to help?  In these discussions here to-day we had members trying to score Party points over each other.  What are we doing for the 74,000 unemployed, the 152,000 old-aged and blind pensioners, the 60,000 or 70,000 widows and orphans, as well as the 62,062 people on home assistance at the present time?  Is this the occasion to indulge in Party politics and to try to secure advantage over each other about the miserable things we are doing for these people?  What do the provisions of either the 1951 Bill or this Bill mean to the unemployed man with a wife and two children?  Under the 1951 Bill, which every member of the Fianna Fáil Party voted against, the unemployed man with a wife and two children got 50/- a week.  That man has obligations and rights equal to those of every member of this House or equal to those of any man in the land.  He was expected to provide three meals a day for each of them which means that he has to provide for 64 meals in the week at 9¼d.  per meal per person. In Cork City that man has to pay 6/- a week for rent.  Coal is 8/6 a bag and electric light 6d. a unit for the working man while the industrialists of this country pay only 1d.  a unit. What would it cost that man to clothe himself, his wife and children?  If the two children are going to school it imposes still further expense on him. Yet, that was the best we could do as an inter-Party Government.  In this present Bill the working man will <Col N="789" /> get 50/-, which means 9¼d.  per meal for the seven days of the week.  They cannot get many eggs for that amount. Eggs are 5½d. each and you would pay 10d.  each in the restaurant of this House for them.  Everybody knows that the working man is not going to have any rashers for his breakfast nor can his wife and children.  He will not be able to buy salmon, which I saw displayed in some of the shops in Dublin, at 10/- a lb.</P>
    <P>We should think of the unemployed, the sick and the people on home assistance. Are they any less worthy than any member of this House or any person in the Irish nation?  I was surprised to hear Deputy Davern say that a new day would dawn for the widows and orphans on the 1st July, 1952.  I want to say to Deputy Davern &mdash;and I intend nothing personal&mdash;that I think it was a work of the greatest insincerity and humbug to tell that to the people who are as anxious to rear their children, carry out their obligations to their wives and build a home as any of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is but what is this we hear about the old age pensioners? We are giving the old age pensioners £1 per week which when divided over the seven days of the week allows him something like 2/4 a day.  If he tries to get three meals for that 2/4 it will work out at 9d. a meal.  If he goes to any hostel or to any kind of a restaurant he will have to pay at least a shilling for his meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the poor, including the unemployed, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the blind pensioners, do not live.  They merely exist.  Nobody can deny that truth.  We endeavour in this Bill, to ensure that where a man was thrown out of employment and had to go to the labour exchange he should be paid unemployment benefit or national health benefit on the day he fell ill or the day he became unemployed.  The best we could get agreement on was that for the first three days he would get no benefit <Col N="790" /> whatever.  In other words, he could live on the air.  However, it was an improvement on the procedure that existed before when he had to sign for six days and get nothing.</P>
    <P>Another drawback is the absence of any provision for the payment of pensions at 65.  For my part, I do not believe that men who reach 65 want to retire from work.  This Bill or the last Bill did not compel such men to retire at 65.  We know and every Deputy knows that industrial concerns will not keep a man in their employment longer than 65 years.  Men employed by Córas Iompair Éireann, gas companies, flour milling companies, the Electricity Supply Board, and bakery firms must retire at 65.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing sometimes if some of us would take a walk round on our own and have a look at the situation. It would be a good thing if some of us paid a visit to the libraries and some of the hostels or county homes where you will find decent honest men who have worked and toiled for the last 50 years in the service of the community. Because the industrial system was unable to extract a profit out of these unfortunate men when they had reached a certain age they were scrapped.  We are now trying to come to their assistance and yet we are told that you cannot get a retiring pension until you reach the age of 70.</P>
    <P>Have any Deputies any idea of the number of men who are laid up at 60 and 55 years of age?  If Deputies went into any of the hospitals or county homes they would find there men who are thrown on the scrap heap from our soulless industrial system.  They would find men who have laboured and toiled with the sweat of their brows in different occupations thrown there as mere patients.  And what will they get? We are told they are not going to get a retirement pension at 70 years of age.  I have seen men laid up with rheumatism at 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>I have reports in my possession concerning our mines.  We have not so many mines in this country but the medical officer's report in regard to the men employed in our mines digging up the coal is a most tragic story to study <Col N="791" /> and read.  Many of them have to retire from work before they reach the age of 60.  The percentage of them that draw the old age pension is hardly worth mentioning.  These are the people who cannot get a retiring pension at 65.  They must go to the labour exchange and stand in a queue to register so as to get this benefit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Cabinet and the back benchers of Fianna Fáil to reconsider this Bill and change these three clauses.  In a matter of this kind we should not play at politics.  This is above and beyond Party politics.  Are these unfortunate men and women to be told that they must go to the labour exchange every morning and sign on in order to get a retiring pension?  I would suggest, not for any Party purpose or for any other purpose, that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party should do justice to those people.  They should reconsider this Bill and meet the amendments we have put down.</P>
    <P>In regard to the death benefits removed from this Bill, are we not all aware of the amount of money that the people to whom I am referring pay insurance companies every year not alone in respect of the father and mother but in respect of the little children?  The sum of money they pay is very high. During the past two or three years, we have been agitating for pensions in the different industrial concerns for the workers.  As time went on, we got some big firms to agree to institute a pension scheme.  The result was that 2/6, and in some places 2/- a week, was deducted from their wages.  This was in order to give them a pension when they reached the age of 65.</P>
    <P>We had a good deal of objection to that from the workers because they did not want to be contributing 2/6 of their wages while at the same time contributing to national health and unemployment insurance.  I endeavoured to discover what their real objection was. On several occasions, I asked at these meeting how many men had taken out insurance with the different industrial insurances and, without exaggeration, I do not think six men out of 60, or even 70 men present at these meetings were paying insurance premiums to <Col N="792" /> insurance companies for their families. The next question I asked was how many men were paying at least 2/6 per week for insurance, and about four hands went up.  I then asked if I was to understand that they were paying more than that sum.  One man said that I would be nearer the mark if I mentioned a figure of 6/6 or 7/6.  I then asked the men at these meetings how many of them were paying insurance in respect of themselves, their wives and their children which amounted to more than 6/- per week and I was alarmed at the response which showed that the majority were paying over 6/- per week.  I say to the Fianna Fáil Party that here is the kernel of vested interests.  The insurance companies were 100 per cent.  opposed to this measure in 1951.</P>
    <P>Are the Fianna Fáil Party not aware that Deputy Norton had deputations awaiting him from insurance representatives to drop this death benefit? Were they asking Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, to drop the death benefit provision in the interests of the country or in the interests of the worker?  Not at all. They saw that we were doing something which would put money into the pockets of the men who were going to pay for the death benefits.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Fianna Fáil Government that if they study the amount of money paid by the workers and their families in insurance premiums they will find that the cost of administration of that alone is anything from 55 per cent.  to 62 per cent.  The Bill, as introduced last year, would cost about 12½ per cent.  the cost of administration.  If anybody would take the trouble to study Lord Beveridge's report on unemployment in Britain he would see that Lord Beveridge proved beyond any doubt that for every pound sterling collected in industrial insurance only 7/- is given in benefits.  That is the reason why we have put down the amendment.  We want the Bill to be what we consider it should be.  I hope sufficient pressure will be brought to bear on the Government to compel the Minister to bring in these provisions which have been omitted.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when I sit here day by <Col N="793" /> day and week by week and listen to the speeches made by the different Deputies and Minister&mdash;all the talk, talk, talk, &mdash;I reflect that one would think we were dealing with inanimate objects.  Do not forget that 74,000 people in our Twenty-Six Counties are compelled to go to the Labour Exchanges just now and register every day for unemployment benefit&mdash;though some people have the audacity to say that they are going for the dole.  I spent a number of years on the Court of Referees at the Cork Labour Exchange and from my experience there I know that there is nothing so humiliating or so repugnant to a decent worker than to have to stand before four or five people who will ask him how it is that he has not been able to get work in the past two years or why he is idle for the last six months or whether he has made any effort to get employment.</P>
    <P>These are the types of questions that are asked.  I think I read something to the effect that the Parliamentary Secretary said that if the welfare State comes to this country it will kill the incentive to work.  I often compare the people who get thousands of pounds without lifting a finger to produce any kind of article in this country, and the people who go to the golf courses, to the race courses, and who loll in the hotels on high fare with the people who are unemployed and who have to exist on a few shillings a week. I saw a fur coat in a shop window in Cork recently and the price was 1,150 guineas.  I wonder if the lady who will put that fur coat on her back was deprived of the incentive to work? Does anybody suggest that she has done anything useful for the country? If you look at the shop windows you will see a fur coat for 149 guineas&mdash; and yet we ask the unemployed man and his wife and two children to eke out an existance on £104 for a whole year.  We talk a lot about Christianity but is it not time that we put some of its principles into practice?  I think it was Chesterton who said that Christianity was never tried and found wanting but that it was found difficult and was not tried.  What an appropriate remark to apply to us to-day.  If an industry cannot make a profit out of <Col N="794" /> a worker they throw him on the labour exchange and ask the community to maintain him&mdash;and if he is a single man he gets 18/- a week.  Does anybody expect that such a man can have respect for the State and the institutions of the State?  Why do we expect these men to be so docile?  I suggest, from the experience which I have gained over a long number of years, that the Government&mdash;not alone this Government, but Governments in other countries as well&mdash;is based on the patience and the ignorance of the mass of the people.  But let us be careful. That will not last always.  We have 74,000 unemployed in the Twenty-Six Counties and there are 53,000 unemployed in the Six Counties.  Add these two figures together and you will find that 127,000 people in this island are deprived of the opportunity of producing the goods which they need and of producing the necessaries of life for their families.  Suppose these people start to organise.  What would be the position then?  Would all the talk which goes on in this House and all the Party politics that are played be a sufficient answer to these men?  You may bet your life that it would not. We are too complacent.  Do we not realise that we are going through a world-wide revolution and do we think that the system which we are trying to operate and patch up will continue? We are all aware that the system we are operating is a most immoral system from every point of view&mdash;and yet we sit in this House and talk and hurl taunts about this Bill, that Bill and the other Bill.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about the Labour Party.  I am old enough to remember the time when the Labour Party supported the Fianna Fáil Party in Government in 1932, 1935 and 1937.  Just because the Labour Party were asking for improved social services for the people of this country the Taoiseach called general elections and stated that the Labour Party were on his back and that he would have to throw them overboard.  The Labour Party is only too conscious of all the hardships and heartbreak which the unemployed man has to endure and that is what we are concerned about.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal finally to members <Col N="795" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party to reconsider this Bill.  Do not look upon it as a Party achievement or as a measure with which the Party prestige is bound up.  Remember what it has been introduced for.  The purpose of this Bill, or of any other Bill like it, is to make the people happier and healthier than they are.  I do hope that, bearing all these things in mind, the Party will reconsider the Bill, accept the amendment and make the Bill at least as good as the one that was before the House last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill, the purpose of which is to improve the condition of the people of the country, whether they be workers or otherwise, deserves very careful consideration from this House.  It is not a question as to whether the Bill now before the House is or is not, or whether the Bill introduced last year by Deputy Norton was or was not, a good Bill.  I think a great many people will agree that it would be much better if the people of this country were placed in such a position that they could live without the help of such Bills but, with world conditions as they are at the moment, I suppose that happy state of affairs cannot be brought about overnight. In the meantime, we must have Bills like this to enable the less fortunate of our people to tide over their difficulties, whether these difficulties are of a permanent or temporary nature. The extraordinary feature of this whole social welfare scheme is that it is not a question of what is contained in the Bill; it is simply a question of who introduced the Bill.  Consequently, when Deputy Norton introduced his Bill, Fianna Fáil thought it was their duty to belittle it and to criticise it from every angle.  I suppose, human nature being what it is, the Opposition now think it should be our duty to criticise the Bill introduced by the present Minister.  I do not think that is good for the country.  I am not one of those who is going to bid, just as one would bid at an auction, for votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this Bill as it stands is an advance on the social security scheme as we know it to exist at the <Col N="796" /> present time.  It is natural that those who introduced the last Bill should make comparisons.  We all can agree to differ.  The whole matter resolves itself into a question of whether this Bill is a better Bill or is as good a Bill as the one introduced by Deputy Norton.  It is a fact that people were somewhat critical of the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton and I suppose there are certain sections of the people who are equally critical of this Bill.  Some people think it is going to cost too much and that we are on the high road towards the creation of the welfare State.  I remember when the Old Age Pension Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons over 40 years ago.  It was then stated by some members, with a very conservative outlook, that the introduction of that Bill meant the end of England and the British Empire.  It was contended that the introduction of the Bill, which enabled the then Government to pay 5/- a week, afterwards increased to 10/- a week, to old age pensioners meant the end of England's greatness and of her empire.  The original pension of 5/-, 40 years ago, was later successively increased to 10/-, 15/- and £1.  It now stands at £2 or 45/- and England still lives.  So it is well for those people who think that the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton, and even the present Bill, goes too far and simply means setting up the welfare State to remember that, when all is said and done, the working classes were always foremost in the fight for the freedom for all sections and, therefore, any benefits now conferred on the workers are benefits to which they are fully entitled.</P>
    <P>I think that instead of trying to score political points against one another, we should try to make the best of this Bill and to remember that the resources of this country are not unlimited.  Undoubtedly we have made an advance since the freedom of this country was secured.  The old Cumann na nGaedheal Party made certain advances and then Fianna Fáil came into power.  I do not think much good can be achieved by referring to what happened 15 or 20 years ago.  I should like to refer to this one fact and I hope Deputies opposite will take it in the spirit in which I mention it.  They <Col N="797" /> sometimes refer to the reduction of 1/- per week in the old age pensions introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when they were in power &mdash;a very unwise step I admit.  I was not a member of the House at the time but members opposite cannot escape responsibility from the causes which led up to the cut of 1/- a week at that particular period because, if my memory serves me right, it was the action of the Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, who, in order to satisfy his own vanity, created a civil war in this country which caused damage to the extent of some £70,000,000 or £80,000,000.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle was not in the Chair, but I was just replying to a remark that had been made by Deputy Davern when, in making comparisons between the Bill now before the House and the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton and the attitude of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party away back I think in 1923 or 1924, he said, in so far as the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party was concerned, that they were right at that time in doing what they did do.  In order that that reference will not be made any more to the cutting off of that 1/- I want to see that these men must accept a certain amount of responsibility for the cutting off of that 1/-.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that it has created any controversy.  It is an historical fact, and I want the members opposite to remember that. On the question of social insurance, I think when all is said and done that this is a Bill which can be discussed in all its aspects.  It is an advance on <Col N="798" /> the social services as they exist at the moment.  The last Bill, which was introduced by Deputy Norton, was also an advance.  All that remains now is for Deputies to come together and make the best they can of this present Bill.  This Government is in power and they have introduced this Bill.  It is their duty to see that, when it leaves this House, it will confer as great benefits as possible on the working classes of the country.</P>
      <P>I, like most Deputies, welcome the Bill, as indeed the members opposite welcomed the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton in 1951.  I hope that on the Committee Stage the Minister will give careful consideration to any amendments that may be put down and will meet them in the spirit in which they are put down so that when the Bill leaves the House it will be one which will command the support and respect of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief indeed.  For the past few days we have heard a considerable amount of praise from the Government Benches in respect of legislation introduced since the Government took office.  When we consider the Bills which have been passed, it is a peculiar thing to find that all of them are merely reproductions of Bills which were introduced by the inter-Party Government.  Take, for example, the Foyle Fisheries Bill.  The negotiations in connection with it were opened up by the inter-Party Government. Take the Social Welfare Bill. It was originally introduced by Deputy Norton and now we have an amendment of it before us.  The Sea Fisheries Bill, which we had before us last evening, was originally introduced by Deputy Dillon.  I think that, with the exception of the Undeveloped Areas Bill, no legislation has come before this House since the present Government came into office other than legislation which was originally introduced by the inter-Party Government.  I am not decrying the fact that the present Government saw fit to adopt the various Bills which were introduced by the Government I supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a peculiar thing, when we hear <Col N="799" /> from so many Deputies on the other side that the old age pensioners are going to derive certain benefits under this Bill, that they are going to do that at a time when the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste are telling us that we are facing a financial crisis. If we throw our minds back to 1947&mdash; I was not a member of the House then&mdash;I understand that at that time, when Deputy Norton introduced a motion proposing that the old age pensions should be increased by 2/6 a week, the Minister refused to accept it.  At that time the present Tánaiste was telling us that we were facing a financial position such as, he says, we are facing to-day.  Still the Government can see fit to raise the ceiling whereby old age pensioners may derive an increase, and yet they could not do that in 1947.  I respectfully say the reason is that they are merely adopting the advice which was tendered to them by Deputy Norton and the other members of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I do not see any provision in this Bill for the majority of the people in the constituency which I represent. Unfortunately, as things are and have been for the last 30 years, the great majority of the people on the western seaboard must still migrate to England.  We are bound, unfortunately, by the system which exists and has existed for years.  These people migrate and spend at least eight months of the year in the mines, the harvest fields or on public works in England.  I say that Deputy Norton did more for those people than has ever been done by a native Government in this State.  He made that reciprocal arrangement with the British Government of which Deputies are aware.  Now, when our people go to Britain and pay contributions to the British Government, they derive or may derive some benefit from those contributions during the period they are unemployed at home.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister go further and endeavour to secure that they would derive full benefit for the contributions they pay while engaged over there.  If that could be done we <Col N="800" /> would be going a long way towards helping the people in the congested areas and along the western seaboard. Our people have to work very hard in England.  During the eight months they are employed there they succeed in saving, say, £100.  They bring back that sum of money with them.  It goes to pay the debts incurred by their families during the period they are away.</P>
    <P>The point that I want to make is that when they apply for qualification certificates under the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the Unemployment Assistance Acts, the money they have earned in England is assessed against their means so that, in many cases, they find they are disqualified from drawing unemployment assistance benefit here.  That is a matter which the Minister should seriously consider, this question of the assessment of means for the obtaining of qualification certificates.  It is unfortunate that, when we cannot give these people employment at home and compel them to migrate, the money they earn outside the country should be assessed against their means here.  If the Minister takes up this matter seriously he will be doing something good for the people along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that we are not going to stem migration.  I cannot see it.  What we should do is endeavour to make the lives of those unfortunate people as comfortable as we possibly can during the period they are back in the country.  They have to make contributions to the British Exchequer when they are away by way of payments in respect of unemployment insurance and national health.  Despite the fact that they had been doing that for the past 30 years it was not until two years ago that they received any benefit for the contributions they had made.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take the matter up with his counterpart on the other side and see if that original reciprocal agreement could be further extended.</P>
    <P>On the question of means, I note that as and from the month of January next the ceiling will be raised and certain people will get higher old age <Col N="801" /> pensions than they are getting at present. That is something we all welcome. But, one thing that should be put an end to is the method of investigation of means and the assessment of means by investigation officers.  I really think it is outrageous. I am not criticising these officers as it is their duty, but I am criticising the system by which they have to do this. It is ridiculous to think that these men find out the number of hens and cattle kept, how the people live, the rent they pay, and take all these matters into account in assessing the means.</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that in the County Donegal in assessing the means of people who have 200 acres of mountain land some of these investigation officers place the same amount of value on that land as they would on 200 acres of land in the Midlands.  I know one farm of 1,600 acres which was let for a period of eight years at £8 for the 1,600 acres I personally had difficulty in convincing the investigation officer that £8 a year was a reasonable letting value for that 1,600 acres.  He would not hear of the applicant being eligible for a pension because he was the owner of 1,600 acres.  Deputies will be surprised to know that the poor law valuation of that 1,600 acres is 1d. per acre.  It was only on appeal to the appeals officer that we succeeded in obtaining a pension for that applicant. These are matters which the Minister should consider.  I am not blaming the investigation officers, but the Minister should consider the method whereby these people are interrogated and their means investigated prior to the granting of a pension.</P>
    <P>Then there is another matter.  Unfortunately, our old age pension committees are no longer receiving the respect they should receive.  In nine cases out of ten, where an old age pension committee grant an old age pension, the investigation officer appeals immediately.  Why have these committees at all then?  Why not let a case from the beginning come before the appeals officer, or else why do we not treat with the respect which is due to them the decision of a committee? After all, they are local people.  They know the means of livelihood of the <Col N="802" /> applicant.  They know the class of land on which he lives.  Possibly they know his means.  They know how he has been brought up and how he is bringing up his family.  Taking all these things into account, if they decide to grant a man an old age pension surely the pensions officer should accept that decision and not put that individual to the trouble of making a second case before the appeals officer.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, a number of the applicants for old age pensions are illiterate.  They merely fill up their application form and appear before the local committee.  The committee, not so much on what is said by the applicant, but what the committee themselves know, grant the pension.  The investigation officer appeals.  The applicant does not put in his statement of facts in support of his application because he is ignorant of how to do it. So much so that unless representation is made by a Deputy or somebody else, when the appeal comes before the appeals officer he has merely the statement of the investigation officer and naturally he acts upon that and the pension is disallowed.  The only remedy left open to the applicant is to make a new application.  That is something which the Minister could remedy and he would be doing a considerable amount of good for a considerable number of people if he did that.</P>
    <P>One other complaint I have to make is in regard to the delay in investigating the means of applicants for old age pensions.  I know of the case of an applicant for an old age pension on whom the investigation officer did not call for a period of two months.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I should like to compliment Deputy O'Donnell on some of the statements he has made because, in my opinion, they are a complete answer to the opposition to this Bill. Until such time as a Minister can see his way to bring the people that Deputy O'Donnell mentioned into a social security scheme it is unfair of the Labour Party to ask that these benefits should be applied to one section of the people.  I am sincere when I say that the statements made by Deputy O'Donnell are a complete answer to the opposition to this Bill. I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  Every Deputy will have to agree that, with the present state of the finances of this country, it takes a man of courage to bring in a Bill of this description which entails the expenditure of such a large amount of money.</P>

      <P>Any Minister who has to deal with a Bill of this description has to approach it from different points of view.  He has to approach it from the point of view of the working man and the contributions he is able to pay; he has to approach it from the point of view of the employer and what he can afford to pay, and he has to approach it from the point of view of the community as a whole and what they can afford to pay to make the Bill a <Col N="804" /> success.  From these points of view, I think this Bill is a reasonable one.  I should like to see all the things in this Bill which the Labour Party want.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see a lot of the things mentioned to-day embodied in it.  But, as has been pointed out, we must creep before we walk.  I was in complete agreement with Deputy Cogan when he mentioned this evening that he would like to see workmen's compensation brought into this Bill.  I think it was a pity that it was in Dr. Ryan's first Bill and that it was dropped out of the Bill brought in by Deputy Norton.  It is regrettable that Dr. Ryan did not see fit to include it in this Bill.  It is a great worry for any employer to be obliged to affix three or four different kinds of stamps. In that respect this Bill is doing away with at least two of them.  If he could see his way to cover workmen's compensation it would relieve the mind of the employer.  Employers at the present time must put on stamps for national health, unemployment, wet time; after all that is done he is liable for workmen's compensation, with the result that he never knows where he is.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity from that point of view that the Minister did not embody workmen's compensation in the Bill. I suppose, however, that the cost was what deterred him.  It costs about £4 to insure a man against workmen's compensation and I do not think that any employer would object to paying a fair contribution to have that embodied in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like maternity benefits to the wife of an insured worker, that is, an uninsured woman, to be granted <Col N="805" /> under this Bill.  Take the case of the ordinary workman in the town and country, a man who is working for his weekly wage and rearing a young family.  At the time of confinement it often happens that he has no one to take charge at home with the result that he has to leave his work and mind the house himself.  I have practical experience of this.  I worked for the national health for a long number of years and I realise that this problem is the cause of a great deal of worry. Very often a man is compelled to go on sick benefit himself in order to remain at home to mind the house during this period.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  No matter how small the amount would be I believe the wife of the uninsured worker should receive an allowance for at least eight weeks.  I would sooner see some of the other benefits dispensed with if he could consider bringing in that class.  I know it is easy for me to talk like that.  I suppose the answer the Minister would give to me would be that he has to provide the money, but as I have said, I would rather see that provision brought in and some of the other benefits reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan raised the point that I hope will be looked after in another Bill, that is, the question of people who are disabled for life.  I hope the Minister will see his way in the very near future to bring these people under a comprehensive Bill, because they are the one class of people who have been neglected in this country.  I feel that a Bill of that description, no matter what the cost, will have the wholehearted support of every member of this House.  There should be no difficulty in doing that because I have met quite a few people in different places and I have letters from people from every part of the country pointing out the sufferings of those people.  When there is discussion about a comprehensive scheme and requests to have certain things inserted, I think this is one of the matters that should be given priority, to look after the people who have been disabled by the will of God.</P>
    <P>There are other points about the Bill <Col N="806" /> that I could mention but I do not know whether it would be very wise to go back on some of them.  I would like the Labour people, who are opposing this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Until such time as the comprehensive Bill is brought in to cover all sections of the community, the Labour Party should be more reasonable in their attitude to the Bill. I say without fear of contradiction that anything that has been done to alleviate the lot of the labouring man in this country has been done by Fianna Fáil, and no Labour man sitting on these benches or out of them can deny that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I say in all seriousness that this Bill is going far enough.  I am reminded of the case of a man aged 60 who is at the present time drawing a blind pension.  He is receiving 15/- national health benefit. Under this Bill he will be drawing 24/- and his wife will be drawing 12/-, which amounts to 36/-.  When he comes to 70 years of age he will go back probably to 24/-.  Under the Norton Bill that we are hearing so much about, at 65&mdash;and it will be agreed a man is comparatively young at 65 &mdash; the amount of benefit he would receive would be reduced from 50/- to 24/-. At that stage of his life when possibly <Col N="807" /> he would have young children to rear, you might be doing the man a serious injury in doing that.  Under the present scheme you are giving a man a chance of receiving 50/- until he is 70 when possibly he would have his family provided for.  There is no doubt that you can force such matters too far and too quickly.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Labour people to examine the record of social welfare and of social services in this country.  If they do they will realise who are the people who gave labour social services and social security in this country.  We have been hearing a good deal to-night about the intentions of certain people. Hell is paved with good intentions and one ounce of work carried out is worth a thousand tons of promises.  Regardless of what the members of the Labour Party say or any other members in the House if Deputy Norton had the slightest intention of implementing his Bill, he could have enforced it.</P>

But the Bill we are discussing now will be implemented by the Budget next week. I appeal to the Labour Deputies not to block this Bill by way of amendments but to allow it to pass without obstruction; then later on they can fight for any services they feel are required.</P>

      <P>To get down to the Bill. What we provided, even in a small way, for the farmers has been taken out of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> There are a number of general remarks that should be made for the benefit of everybody in this House who is concerned with social security and with the welfare of the ordinary people.  So far as the basic principles of the present Bill are concerned, there is no substantial difference between the present Bill and the one introduced by Deputy Norton.  That is not merely indicated by similarity of the approach to the problem, leaving aside the distance travelled by the authors of the two Bills.</P>
    <P>It was indicated by the present Minister for Social Welfare, then Deputy Dr. Ryan, when speaking on the Second Reading of Deputy Norton's Social Welfare Bill and examining that Bill point by point, that he accepted one after another the basic principles of social security.  He agreed that it should be comprehensive, that it should be contributory and he was in agreement in respect of the provisions affecting the self-employed people&mdash;the farmers.  From that point of view it is important that we should recall the marked difference in the atmosphere at the present time as compared with the atmosphere during the period of three years during which the Norton Bill was the subject of topic in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a very marked silence at the present time as compared with the uproar and the furore that went on continuously during the earlier period. If there were grounds for objection on moral, ethical or social principles under the Norton Bill, the grounds are still there, and equally strong, in the present Bill.  It is, as I say, remarkable that there is such a difference in the atmosphere now and that there is such a lack of criticism, particularly the unreasoned partisan criticism which was expressed in reference to the earlier Bill.  It is important that we should bear that in mind because it is correct to say that there are many members in the House desirous of providing a social security scheme.  We should be aware of the basis on which criticism is forthcoming in regard to the various social measures that come before this House.  If, as I already said, the Norton Bill was objectionable in relation to the principles on which it <Col N="809" /> was based, then the present Bill is equally objectionable.  Yet, within a matter of 48 hours of the publication of the present Bill, one of the most outspoken critics of the Norton Bill was reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> as welcoming the present Bill.  No reference was made to any objectionable principles or features.  They had all died away and the garden not only looked lovely, but smelt lovely.  That was quite a remarkable change.</P>
    <P>Of the many critics of the Norton Bill, probably the most outspoken and the most bitter in his denunciation was the Reverend E.J. Hegarty.  I do not for a moment, nor would anyone else, object to criticism of any measure coming before the House, whether introduced by the Labour Party or by any other Party, particularly when, as in the case of the Norton Bill, it was deliberately circulated and published over a period with an expectation that it would be subject to criticism. I would prefer a certain amount of consistency.  I am interested to know why it is that these critics of the principles and the policy of the Bill and of the whole idea of social security have suddenly become so quiet.  When I quote to you, as I am about to do now, from an article by Fr. Hegarty in <i>Christus Rex</i>, October, 1950, you can see the extreme limits to which his criticism is directed, not merely against the Norton scheme but against the whole proposals for social security on the basic principles.  I will now quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This article will then review the principles involved in arguing that comprehensive State welfare schemes are opposed generally to moral, legal, social and economic principles and are utterly discredited by experience and history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a nice comment on Deputy Dr. Ryan's Bill.  He concludes his article by an even more definite statement, and remember the introductory paragraph of Deputy Dr. Ryan's opening speech to-day on the Second Reading of his Bill, particularly his reference to the history of his present Bill, the Norton Bill and what he regarded as a more than adequate outline of a Bill <Col N="810" /> which was available in his Department before the inter-Party Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I will continue Fr. Hegarty's article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Hence, rejection of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1950, or at least an amendment to end the scheme as soon as possible, would be a far better policy for national prestige and individual character than proclaiming equivalently to the world the surely unwarranted charge: that our workers are either too hopelessly destitute or too incurably negligent to make decent provision for themselves and their families&mdash;for this charge is implicit in a general plan of State welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not objecting to criticism but we are entitled to examine the principles on which the criticism is put forward, and the times at which it is put forward.  It is remarkable that what might be regarded as extreme criticisms of the early social welfare proposals were made by Fr. Hegarty and that since the present Bill has been circulated there has been a remarkable quiet on that front.  I feel that is not altogether difficult to explain.  There is involved in the whole question of social security, not merely the philosophy of providing security for the mass of the people, not merely the idea of the State concerning itself with the welfare of the mass of the people, but something equally important&mdash;what particular group, what particular body, at any special time, undertakes to give effect to certain social security measures.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point that a number of Fianna Fáil speakers have touched upon during the debate.  They have repeatedly claimed that, in so far as social security or social service in this country is concerned, the whole and nothing but the whole of the credit must go to Fianna Fáil.  Of course, that is a ridiculous claim.  So far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned, my own personal opinion is that, while they did enter into Government in 1932, not with a very advanced social outlook, but with a readiness to deal with certain immediate problems that they could not very <Col N="811" /> well avoid, as the years have gone by they have acquired for themselves, peculiarly enough, the position of being almost the most conservative Party in the State on social issues. The advances that they have made and the measures that they have instituted have not been the outcome of a definite philosophy on their part but have been the means of meeting a particular demand as it arose and meeting it to the minimum extent.</P>
    <P>There is no more marked indication of that than their attitude towards the question of old age pensions.  It is correct that they restored the 1/- taken off by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Having done that, they rested content.  Quite clearly, they could not have avoided giving back the 1/-.  That was one of the most bitter questions raging in the political field at that time.  But, having done that, they rested then for 16 years and at a moment when, according to the Minister for Health, in October 1947, if we are to believe him, there was lying in the Department of Health an almost completed scheme for a social security Bill of the nature that is now introduced, involving considerable increases in benefits in respect of sickness, disablement, unemployment, maternity allowances, and at the very moment when all these enhanced measures for social security were supposed to be only awaiting introduction in the Dáil, the same Minister found it impossible to agree to a proposal to increase the old age pensions by 2/6 a week because that would cost £500,000.</P>
    <P>Is not that indicative of what is quite clear from their record, that when they have moved they have moved because they were pushed?  The only reason we have got a Social Welfare Bill of the type that is before the House to-night is that in the preceding three or four years the question of social welfare and social security had been made by the Labour Party a topic of immediate and general discussion in this country and wide masses of people were looking for some form of social security, whatever might be <Col N="812" /> the limitations placed upon it in the actual granting.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Labour Party, while putting up the amendment to the Bill, wish to make it quite clear that we welcome any advance in the provision of enhanced and improved social measures for the mass of the people, no matter what Government provides them, whether it be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or an inter-Party Government or any other type of Government.</P>
    <P>That is what the Labour Party exists for, either by its own direct and independent activity to secure the implementation of its policy in regard to social welfare or by pressure of all types open to a political organisation in this country to secure the acceptance and the implementation by other groups who happen to have power at the time of the measures that the Labour Party regard as necessary for the mass of the people.  If, as a result of the atmosphere that is created in the country, legislation is passed, the Labour Party is quite entitled to welcome that legislation and at the same time to suggest that it might go somewhat further.  That is the purpose of the amendment that has been put down.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to draw attention to the absence of criticism at the present time in relation to the present Bill as compared with Deputy Norton's Bill, because it is necessary not merely to look at the measures proposed but also to examine their source of origin. I am quite satisfied that the criticism that was directed against Deputy Norton's Bill was for the purpose of confining, cribbing and limiting social advance in this country.  It was criticism that was inspired with the object of erecting barriers and obstacles to the progress of the mass of the common people&mdash;because that is clearly what is involved to a large extent in social security&mdash;at the expense of the more privileged sections of the community. It was, in fact, the age-old conflict that we have had of property and privilege against poverty and under-privilege, even though it may be cloaked in very high-sounding phrases.</P>
    <P>Those who directed that criticism against the plan of Deputy Norton feel <Col N="813" /> quite secure and safe when they see social security measures introduced by Fianna Fáil, because they know that with that Party there will be an automatic brake placed upon the possible exuberant enthusiasm of a Deputy Gilbride or anybody else, that that Party will not move too fast in any particular direction.</P>
    <P>When social measures are introduced by a Labour Party that has definitely indicated its philosophy and its objective, then clearly these measures cannot be regarded as stepping forward on to a position from which there will be no further move made of a voluntary nature and those who dislike or object to an improvement in the position of the common people cannot feel content that no further danger will arise.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that, tied up with the whole criticism of social security, there has been at the same time the criticism and the objection to what is termed the welfare State.  If any Party in this House should defend the welfare State, it is Fianna Fáil.  This is the Party that claims to be a Republican Party, based fundamentally on the Proclamation of 1916.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or 1919.  Of all the historic documents, if there is any document that envisaged a State plan for the welfare of the people it was the Proclamation of 1916.  Therefore, why should they object to the conception of the welfare State and why should they not take the same stand as the Labour Party will take in stating that the welfare State is what the term implies, a State for the welfare of the mass of the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because there is this fundamental difference in approach between the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party that the Labour Party was subjected to that criticism; its plans were subjected to that criticism; and we were told that any progress towards what may be regarded as the welfare State was, to use some of the words in this article, an approach to serfdom for the mass of the people.  Nobody says that in regard to Fianna Fáil because <Col N="814" /> it is quite clear that there is not going to be any approach towards the welfare State so far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Minister's opening speech regarding the two schemes, the Norton scheme and the scheme before us now.  As well as other members of the Labour Party I was particularly concerned with his statement that during the year 1947 a mass of documents had been accumulated and made easily available as the basis for an immediate drawing up of a suitable Bill for social security in a very short time.  In fact one would be quite entitled to draw the conclusion, that the Bill was there ready and awaiting merely the final decision of the Government.  I do not want to comment&mdash;comments have been made earlier in the House&mdash;on the origins of the speech he read but it is quite clear that that speech marked the changes which took place in the Department of Social Welfare.  Probably it is worthy of its sources but it is not altogether worthy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with is that in March, 1951, Deputy Norton's Social Security Bill was before the House on its Second Reading.  The Minister, then Deputy Ryan, spoke on behalf of his Party and as its chief spokesman. I am aware that over a period from March, 1948, repeated statements were made by various Fianna Fáil spokesmen that a social security plan had been readily available in the Department for Deputy Norton, but it is remarkable that when one reads the official report of Deputy Ryan's speech on the Bill in March, 1951, one finds no such claim.  There is no suggestion in that speech that all Deputy Norton had to do was to take the Bill out of its pigeon hole and put it before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That is a very remarkable change and can probably be explained by the fact that at that time he was Deputy Dr. Ryan and the charge would have to be made against the Minister, Deputy Norton, who was still in a position to have full access to all the departmental files.  Now the position is reversed.  Custody of the files has <Col N="815" /> now been secured and statements in respect of which there was a certain timidness in March of last year are now being made fairly recklessly.</P>
    <P>I can read Deputy Lemass's speech in March, 1951&mdash;the Deputy-Leader of his Party&mdash;and I find no assertion there that all that had to be done was to take the Bill out of its pigeon hole. The change that has taken place is remarkable.  It is remarkable to discover now that this Bill was available all the time and required very little delay before being brought before the House.  It is now made quite clear that not merely did Deputy Norton delay but that the Bill which he introduced and had debated in the House in March, 1951, was originally the Minister's, Deputy Dr. Ryan's, Bill with practically no change.  That is a remarkable discovery to make in 1952. It is even more remarkable when you recall how the two actors have changed places in the House and the relative powers they now enjoy in respect of documental records.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to a pile of documents which he placed on the bench.  It would be a most remarkable thing if in any Department of the Government one could not readily get a pile of documents on any subject even remotely connected with the activities of that Department.  Remember that we are dealing with the Department of Social Welfare and that continuously for a period of some years the whole question of extending social benefits had engaged the attention of public men and experts, remember that it was recognised that a further period of advance regarding the whole composition of social securities was expected following the termination of hostilities; if, therefore, the officials of the Department of Social Welfare in the years 1946 and 1947 had not carefully examined all the ideas and projects that were then floating around in this country, in England and abroad and had not their comments and observations ready to be called upon by the Minister at short notice, they would have been failing very grievously in their duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> Quite clearly that is what we are dealing with on this occasion: the accumulation of the preliminary and exploratory comments and observations which any competent official in any Department would make on matters which would be of concern to his Minister and his Department.  To suggest that that is a fully fledged scheme of social security and to discover that only in March, 1952, while the same statement could have been made in March, 1951, provides a peculiar commentary on the way the whole matter has been approached.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the Labour Party naturally welcome any measure to advance the social welfare of the mass of the people and we make no apology for seeking by an amendment a further improvement, particularly as it appears that in respect of many matters we are trying to close the gap which should have been closed by the Minister had he hearkened to the appeals of members of his own Party during the debate last year on the same subject.  The whole question of social security has now been brought to this stage, not merely because of the efforts of the Labour Party over the last four years, but because, through the efforts of that Party whether they were successful or not, social security has become a live issue not merely in the country but in this House.  Irrespective of what their wishes might be Fianna Fáil have found it impossible to relieve themselves of the obligations which they were bound to take on in the course of their political activities.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to indicate a number of important issues. We wish to show that in their general approach to social security Fianna Fáil have pursued the tactic which was theirs on so many other occasions: to commit themselves when out of office by unlimited promises and then to fail to give effect to them.  They are still whittling down what was an entirely much better and more effective scheme.  To try to draw attention to these matters the amendment has been put down and the support of the House is requested to try to correct the mistakes which have been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> It is significant that there is a marked silence on the part of those who spoke for Fianna Fáil regarding some of the main features of the Bill which were the subject of their comments 12 months ago.  Let us, for instance, recall the speech made by the present Minister for Finance on the Norton Bill in March of last year. I will quote from the Official Report, Volume 125, No. 4, column 593.  Let us recall that the present Bill has been stated by the Minister to be, in fact, basically the same Bill as was available almost in complete draft form in the archives of the Department of Health in 1947 shortly before he left office; that all Deputy Norton did was to take over that draft, make a bit of a botch of it and not get it through, leaving it for the present Minister to implement.  The Minister says that it has the same parentage and the same approach to the problem but limited in so far as the measures are conceived in the Bill to deal with the problem. That is the comment of his fellow-Minister, Deputy MacEntee.  It might quite readily, without changing the column, be applied to the Bill we are now discussing:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill is a selfish Bill, framed by self-seeking politicians whose mind is fixed on one ulterior object and that is the purchase of urban political support.  The Bill, I think, has no higher motive than that.  It is not concerned with social justice. If it were, it would not freeze out, as this Bill freezes out, from all benefit and advantages the hardest-working element in our community, the primary producers, the farmers; neither would it be so callous and indifferent to the needs and vicissitudes of the self-employed person as this Bill is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder would Deputy MacEntee, now Minister for Finance, take the present Bill and show us where it deals with the hard-working farmers, the primary producer, the self-employed. That was Deputy MacEntee just 12 short months ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane, now in the more rarefied atmosphere of the Seanad so <Col N="818" /> beloved of the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i>, also had a comment to make.  His comment was a most peculiar one, especially in the light of present circumstances.  Might I remind the House here that to-day we have 11,000 more unemployed than when Deputy Kissane was speaking 12 months ago.  Commenting on the Bill as a whole, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a much greater onus on the State to provide work for the unemployed, of whom we have over 60,000 in this country to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Kissane were with us to-night he would have to amend that figure and make it 73,000.  His comment on social security is that whatever Government is in power should concern itself more with the provision of work than the bringing of such Bills before the House.  It is interesting that, in the short interval that has elapsed since Deputy Kissane removed himself, or was removed, to the Seanad, we have this increase in the number of unemployed. Deputy Corry, who is always very eloquent, also concerned himself with the forgotten man, the farmer, and the self-employed, but I shall deal with him later.  It is interesting to note, however, that he makes the same point that Deputy MacEntee made; so far as the earlier Bill was concerned, there was a complete neglect of the farming community and Deputy Corry estimated that community as numbering 500,000 persons.  It was on those grounds he objected so strenuously to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister for being unable in the present Bill to deal with that problem.  I recall listening to his contribution to the debate in March, 1951, when he very carefully examined the problem of how and in what manner the small farmers, the self-employed, could be brought within the scope of a comprehensive measure of this kind.  He agreed it was practically impossible to do that on the basis of a contributory scheme and he had already committed himself to the principle of a contributory scheme.  It would, therefore, be wholly wrong for me to criticise him on these grounds.</P>
    <P>What is the position then in regard <Col N="819" /> to the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party who, one after another, got up here last March and based their whole objection to the Bill at that time on the grounds that it was not comprehensive since it did not include this section of our community?  Cannot the same criticism be directed against the present Bill, particularly when we recall that in an effort to make some provision, however limited and however inadequate, Deputy Norton, then Minister for Social Welfare, did include a section in that Bill making provision whereby co-operative societies of farmers could enter into group arrangements which would enable them to avail of some of the benefits applicable to workers generally.</P>
    <P>Even that small concession, small though it was, has gone by the board so that even if some members of the Fianna Fáil Party would like to salve their conscience by referring to that section, they will not be able to find it in so far as the present Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>May I recall that in an effort to try to meet the undoubted claims, and the Labour Party would be the first to reject any suggestion that there is not a good and proper claim on behalf of the small farmers and the self-employed, and in order to solve that particular problem a change was made in relation to the means test in so far as the assignment of small farms by parents to their children was concerned? That is one of the peculiar features of the present Bill and one of the peculiar features in the standpoint of Fianna Fáil because that standpoint was not confined to individual members; it was a common cry running through the speeches of every member of that Party who spoke in that debate. The Bill was not comprehensive because it ignored or excluded this large section of our community.  I would be interested to know what is the explanation to-night for the changed attitude in Fianna Fáil?  What is the explanation for their change of attitude to what is, in so far as the spirit of the Bill and its principles are concerned, fundamentally the same difficulty that existed 12 months ago?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> Deputy Lemass had a somewhat different approach.  It was an interesting one.  He concerned himself with many problems in the Bill and he touched upon one very interesting feature, one on which I think we are entitled to have an explanation from the Minister to-night.  Deputy Lemass said in March of last year that the question of social security was one that had been engaging the attention of his Government for some time.  They realised that the benefits paid for national health, unemployment insurance, etc., did require examination and did require to be brought up in view of the change that had taken place in money values.  He also said that if they had been fortunate enough to remain in office in 1948 they would have dealt with the problem.  Then he staked a claim.  I wonder will the present Minister for Health meet that claim in his present Bill.  Deputy Lemass at column 63 of Volume 125, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We judge the value of the proposals in this Bill by relating it to our knowledge of what money will buy to-day.  If in a year's time prices have so risen that the purchasing power of these payments has been substantially reduced, then they will have to be revised.  I am sure that there will be general agreement that they should be revised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder is he quite so sure to-night. These proposals to which Deputy Lemass was then referring were not the proposals merely of Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare, because it now appears that they were the proposals of Deputy Dr. Ryan too when he was Minister for Health in 1947.  Apparently, these figures of 24/- for a man and 12/- for a woman had been originally formulated in 1947. Only the other day in reply to a question we were informed by the Taoiseach that the amount of goods one could buy for £1 in 1947 would require 25/9 for their purchase to-day. Is the Minister going to provide the extra 5/9 in the £ and bring up the rate of benefit from 24/- to 30/- per week and give effect to what Deputy Lemass stated?  No doubt there would be a general acceptance by all members <Col N="821" /> of this House that if the purchasing power of money fell the rate would have to be revised.  I feel that is a reasonable question to put to the Minister because the question has not been raised in my mind originally but has been taken over by me from Deputy Lemass.  Even if we take it that the figures of 24/- and 12/- mentioned in the present Bill and embodied in the previous Bill only related to the year 1951 we still must recall that even within that short period, under a Government whose battle-cry was they were going to reduce the cost of living, prices have gone up somewhere in the region of 8 or 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was quick to stake a claim in March, 1951 but I do not think I am in any way transgressing when I raise the same claim in March, 1952, either on the basis of the rise in the cost of living by 8 or 9 per cent. last year or more truthfully on the basis of what has taken place since 1947 and which the Taoiseach mentioned as being measured as an extra 5/9 in every pound spent.  I would be glad if the Minister when replying would explain to the House what is the answer we are to give Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I recall some of these statements because I think it is important that they should be recalled to the extent that they were the basis on which the criticism was directed against the Bill of Deputy Norton and because they were directed to features of the Bill which represented to the spokesman who gave utterance to the criticisms the defects in the Bill.  They were features which, in any case, neither Deputy Norton nor the Minister could altogether find solutions for.  We are entitled to now question the Minister's sincerity and to some extent the public morality of some of the spokesmen of the Fianna Fáil Party who expressed those views 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to wait with bated breath and expectation to see how their views are going to be presented on the present occasion.  It will be readily summed up that so far as Fianna Fáil in March, 1952, was concerned <Col N="822" /> the general expressions of what they conceived as being a proper social security measure would require to meet the following features.  It must be fully comprehensive including the farming community and the self-employed. Is the present Bill fully comprehensive? Are the members of Fianna Fáil satisfied that the Bill is fully comprehensive?  Are the members of Fianna Fáil satisfied that the Bill is fully comprehensive?  If they regard it as not being comprehensive, then is there a proper explanation as to why it has got that particular defect and is that explanation also applicable to the Bill we examined in this House 12 months ago?</P>
    <P>They were particularly strong in their claim that there should be no increase in contributions.  I do not think that is a very strong point except in so far as there has been some increase. We are also entitled to recall that earlier than the discussion on the Second Reading of Deputy Norton's Bill, Deputy Ryan, in one of his statements, outside this House, if I recall rightly, seemed to indicate that his approach appeared to be one that the financing of the Bill would preferably be dealt with by taxation rather than on a contributory basis.  Many views were expressed among Fianna Fáil speakers that led one to expect that it was going to be based mainly on taxation.  With that I do not differ very much.</P>
    <P>In so far as the scheme is based on contribution it does provide a measure of security for participants against the changes in policies that always take place through Ministers for Finance and those who control the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another marked feature of the Bill that Fianna Fáil required 12 months ago was the increase in children's allowances.  It was not merely an increase in children's allowances but an increase provided for in the Bill.  To-day we are told that there is to be an increase in children's allowances in the Budget.  I trust that is the case but so far as to-night's debate is concerned we are just as much entitled to question that statement as Fianna Fáil was entitled to question any statement made by the Government 12 months ago.  The provision for increased allowances is <Col N="823" /> not in this Bill and yet that was one of the strong criticisms made against the Norton Bill.</P>
    <P>Two other general points were made. The Bill was not suited to Irish conditions and it was not socially just to all sections.  Apparently the reference to social justice referred to the exclusion of the farmers and the self-employed. The Minister is also subject to that charge.  The most interesting point was that it was not suited to Irish conditions.  Within the last few days the Fianna Fáil Party has indignantly rejected a charge that they have been listening to the words of wisdom from Mr. Butler, but whether they have heeded them or not will emerge much more clearly next week. The point is that the Social Security Bill of Deputy Norton was not regarded as acceptable to these ultra-Irish nationalists because it was not suited to Irish conditions.  What is the difference so far as the approach is concerned in respect of Irish conditions as covered by the present Bill and the Bill which the Minister says was taken over when he went out in 1947?</P>
    <P>So far as the two Bills are concerned it is quite a legitimate criticism to say that the present Bill is substantially the same, almost word for word, but in a truncated form, as the one we discussed in this House 12 months ago when Deputy Norton opened the Second Reading of the debate.  It has the same positive good features.  It has the same defects as applied to the earlier Bill.  These defects, in so far as they fail to deal with the farming community and the self-employed, are defects of our economy.  They are defects that all of us should be concerned to deal with. It is neither legitimate nor proper to base the criticism and rejection of one Bill on a particular problem and congratulate another Minister on basically the same Bill that is open to the same defects and the same criticisms.</P>
    <P>I think it is regrettable that certain features of the Norton Bill have been omitted from the present Bill.  I propose now to deal with them.  In the <Col N="824" /> first place there is the general change with regard to income level.  The Norton Bill was originally intended to apply to everybody under contract of service, without limitation of income. In the present Bill the limitation of income is £600.  On first examination that may appear to be quite a reasonable ceiling. £600 is equal to £12 a week and for many people in this country that represents a much higher income than they enjoy themselves. Let us bear in mind, however, that we are speaking to-day of different money values from those we dealt with when the original income limits were placed upon these social security schemes. The income level for national health in 1911 was £160.  Later, in regard to unemployment benefit and the health scheme, we had a limit of £250.  That limit was later lifted by the present Minister to £500.  Let us take a figure of £250 in 1939, or £5 a week, and relate that to an income limit to-day of £600 or £12 a week.  Will anybody suggest that we have made any advance in our spread of social security?</P>
    <P>We must recall that in the early days of social services it was accepted by those who were responsible for their introduction and for placing them on the Statute Book that they were to be limited to certain specified categories of the community&mdash;categories whose economic position entitled them to this special protection and support.  It was felt that these categories must be limited in extent and that there should be no conception of giving this social support and assistance except in very well-proven cases where, quite clearly, there would be dire need if the State did not come to their assistance.</P>
    <P>In the intervening years the whole conception of social security has altered.  It is now recognised that it is no longer sufficient to confine social security in its broadest aspects to the most economically weak members of the community &mdash; those who suffer casual employment and those whose health conditions are particularly poor because of their economic standards and the environment in which they live.  It has been generally accepted <Col N="825" /> that there should be an upward revision of the whole application of social security and it has been equally well recognised that many of the so-called white collar and professional workers, who in former years were regarded as something in the nature of aristocracy among salary and wage earners, have as severe an economic problem to contend with as many of the ordinary manual workers.  Everybody knows that while the white-collar worker may enjoy a higher salary he has correspondingly higher commitments to meet &mdash; commitments which are placed upon him by the attitude of his employers towards his social status and not just commitments voluntarily undertaken by the white-collar worker himself &mdash; and that these commitments render it almost impossible for him, especially in present-day conditions, to make provision against such things as confinements, sickness, deaths, and, above all, to make provision to enable him to retire with some security when he has passed the age of normal employment. From that point of view I regard the limit of £600 as objectionable in itself because it shows no advance whatever and no progressive attitude as compared with the standards that prevailed for many years before 1939.</P>
    <P>I gather, from a reply to a question in this House, that only some 20,000 or 30,000 persons are excluded.  The Minister should review that position with a view to lessening the number of people excluded from the scope of the Bill and, indeed, of bringing all salaried workers within the scope of the Bill so that there will be no suggestion that any section of salaried worker is being excluded.</P>
    <P>Of all the features of the Norton plan which have been omitted in the present Bill, the outstanding one is that which relates to retirement pensions.  Listening to those who speak in favour of the rejection of the plan for retirement pensions, it is quite clear that they have no deep appreciation of what is in the minds of many thousands of workers in this country.  When the original proposals, embodied in the White Paper, were issued, I had, on many occasions, to try and explain to <Col N="826" /> working men what exactly these proposals meant.  Above all other proposals&mdash;even above the increase in unemployment and sickness benefits&mdash; two proposals appealed to them, namely, the retirement pension and the death benefit.  There were very good reasons for that.  It has been suggested in this House that it is a retrograde economic step&mdash;that it is bad for the community, bad for our economy and bad for our social organisation&mdash;to lay down the principle that a man at 65 or a woman at 60 should desist from active work and no longer be a productive element in the community.  My feeling in regard to the ordinary workingman is that, so long as he is physically and mentally capable of doing his work and so long as he himself feels inclined to keep on working, it is to his own benefit to continue his work and his ordinary way of life.  I have seen too many workers reach the age of 65 and, after a lifetime of may be 50 years' continuous work, have to retire compulsorily.  I have seen too many such workers, within a matter of months or even weeks, die of what might be regarded as inactivity.  I know of one person who, to use a plain word, died of a broken heart because of the break in his normal way of life. So long as the ordinary, average workingman is fit and capable of carrying on his work and so long as he is not anxious to give it up, I consider that it is to his own benefit to continue after 65.  Why should any worker in Dublin City or in any of our towns or in the country, who is earning £5, £6 or £7 a week and who is still quite capable, both physically and mentally, of doing a good day's work and of earning that £5, £6 or £7, voluntarily want to give up that job at 65 and go on a pension of 24/- a week?  On the face of it, there must be some explanation and the explanation is very simple.  It is that many working men, especially those engaged in heavy manual labour, find that when they reach that age they meet with increasingly severe physical handicaps in the carrying on of their normal work.</P>
    <P>The Minister felt that when Deputy Norton proposed a retirement plan at 65 he was automatically adopting the <Col N="827" /> viewpoint of the International Labour Organisation and of the spokesmen of social security in industrial countries such as Britain and France which is that it is the widespread practice to-day, in respect of all types of employment, to erect barriers to the employment of men over 65 years of age so that each year as men come nearer to that age, and when they pass beyond it, the difficulty of obtaining employment becomes even greater.  It is a well-known fact that if a man of 55 or 60 years of age seeks employment to-day he meets with very great difficulty in being considered and that there is an ever-growing practice of laying down, arbitrarily, the retiring age as 65.  We know ourselves that in respect to State employment and local government employment we have that retiral age connected with our superannuation schemes but in many employments, where there is no superannuation scheme or in which there are schemes which are completely inadequate, the same retiral age is being enforced.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister would suggest for a moment that the average workingman, no matter how careful he lives or no matter how much he has been fortunate enough to enjoy during his working life constant steady employment, will be able to make reasonable financial provision for himself when he comes to retire at 65, to cover the gap between 65 and 70.  So far as many pension schemes are concerned&mdash;Deputy Keyes has referred to some of them&mdash;they provide pensions from £1 to 37/6 on which a man has to keep not only himself but his wife if she is alive&mdash;a completely inadequate sum and a completely unjust provision in relation to men who have given the best years of their lives in the service of the community.  The Minister's reply to that is that we cannot afford to have persons getting out of work at 65 in the case of men and at 60 in the case of women and that we are not obliged to provide them with a pension in order that they may be able to do so.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister what peculiar principle decides that a Guard or a <Col N="828" /> civil servant, a Minister or a local government official, is entitled to go out on pension at 65 while the ordinary workingman is denied that privilege? To bring the matter nearer home, a Minister is entitled to get a pension after three years' service, a pension equal to the full wages paid to the average workingman in this country. The Minister's attitude seems an absolutely unjust approach to the matter and one that we are quite entitled to ask should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I noticed, when speaking to workers regarding a retiral pension, that it was the one feature of social security that they could appreciate.  Too many aged men have had the unhappy experience, on reaching the age of 65, of either being put out of employment or of being unfortunate enough in or about that age to lose their employment, of being unable to obtain other work and of finding themselves dependent on the goodwill and possibly, to use an obnoxious word, the charity of their children.  It is a blessing for a man to have children but for many it has been a curse, particularly when that man reaches an age when he feels that he would be entitled to the appreciation, the support and protection of his children and is instead met with a rebuff that has not been altogether unknown in our social life. It is to protect themselves not merely against being dependent like that but against a situation arising under which the affections of their children are soured and turned into vinegar, that many workingmen would like to have the benefit of a retiral pension. Even where they are in a position to draw some superannuation payments, they still would require some addition as provided for in the Norton scheme. In so far as they were paying through their contributions one-third of the cost of the scheme as a whole, surely they have got the same claim in principle to a contributory superannuation scheme, as people in State or local authority employment or in private or public employment outside?  This discrimination is, I think, a most objectionable feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that he would meet the problem by allowing them to <Col N="829" /> continue to draw unemployment benefit if they are insured.  He has indicated that in Section 16 he has made what he regarded as a generous provision under which a man over 65, if he has 156 stamps to his credit, can continue to draw unemployment benefit indefinitely subject to the regulation, the regulation being that he is capable of, and available for, work, in addition to which, of course, he will be required to call to that abode of happiness and peace, the employment exchange, to sign up.  Possibly he will have to travel from the outskirts of the city to sign up and while many men are quite active at 65, there are many others who will be compelled to travel by bus and to pay fus fares, so that in order to draw 24/- per week he would have to pay a bus fare of 6d., 8d., or 10d. a day.  That is not a very happy position. It does seem to me that the main reason for dropping the retirement pension is because it represents the biggest source of saving.  It was one of the heaviest commitments in the previous Social Welfare Bill when it required something in the nature of 4/- out of every 10/- of the estimated cost to provide these schemes or in round figures somewhere about £2,100,000. Undoubtedly all of it is not being saved.  There will undoubtedly be some additional expenditure on unemployment benefits caused by the provision extending the period during which such benefit can be drawn after 65.  Nevertheless, the saving is substantial.  I can see it as the only justification for dropping out this very progressive feature that was particularly welcomed by the average working man who was unable to make adequate provision for security in his old age and who felt that he could look forward to some provision and some recognition by the community to which he had given good service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilbride has referred to the question of the maternity allowance. I do not want to stress that except to suggest that even if the Minister is going to deal with that matter in the projected health scheme for mothers and children, it would not have been too much to ask that he might have at least left within the scheme that small provision.  It is not going to cost very <Col N="830" /> much and to many working-class mothers it would have been a particular boon to be able to draw that little extra benefit to help them over a period of trouble.  It is that kind, I shall not say of petty-minded approach, but that kind of unfeeling approach to many of the real problems of the working-class that characterises the approach to the Bill as a whole. I have already referred to the question of increased children's allowances but that is a matter on which we have only to wait and see.</P>
    <P>I also pointed out that we were entitled to expect from the Minister some indication as to why the level of benefits is not being adjusted to the change in money values that has taken place since 1951 and more particularly, in the light of his speech in this House, in relation to the change in money values that has taken place since 1947. Quite clearly, social security benefits, whether they be sickness or other benefits, must be ordered in the same way as wages are, as the means whereby the recipients are enabled to meet day to day living costs as expressed in current prices.  If we are to accept the Minister's statement that as early as 1947 the figure of 24/- was regarded by him as a proper figure for the standard benefit under a social security scheme, it necessarily, in the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, requires something further to bring that figure into conformity with to-day's money values.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask that question and to ask that the Minister would deal with it when replying to the debate. I would be interested to know why it is that even the small provision made in the earlier Bill in respect of farmers whereby, through their co-operative societies, they could enter into group assurance plans with the State, was dropped?  There may be a very good reason why it was dropped, but I feel we should be given some explanation. We all recognise the necessity of making provision for the farming community. While many of us agree with both Deputy Norton and the Minister that there are extreme and very grave difficulties to be overcome in making that provision, so long as there was any <Col N="831" /> attempt whatever made to try, even in a limited form, to provide some helps for the farming community, I think it is regrettable the idea has been dropped.  I do think that if it was dropped as being impracticable, we should have an explanation.  I feel it should not be dropped on the ground of expenditure.  While that provision was in the Norton Bill, I did not regard it as anything more than a kind of a sincere effort and a sincere gesture to try and show that there was appreciation of the farming community's claim and that there was some effort, however limited, being made to try to meet that claim as an indication of the acceptance of the commitment and as an earnest of the effort which would be made at the earliest possible date to try to broaden the channel of entrance into social security for that very important section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have touched upon what I regard as the main defects in the Bill before the House while, at the same time, expressing, as any Labour representative must express, his welcome for any advance in the measures of social security and of social welfare.  I have indicated what I regard to be the defects in this Bill as compared with the earlier Bill which was presented to the House.  I have pointed out that the basic criticism levelled against the Norton Bill by the Fianna Fáil Party still holds good in regard to the present Bill.  I could quite understand if the Fianna Fáil Party took the line of saying: &ldquo;If the Bill is to be comprehensive, it should include the farming community.  We tried to do that and failed and, therefore, anyone who seeks to deal with this problem and meets the same failure as we did, is entitled to understanding and should not be subjected to criticism.&rdquo;  However, the whole criticism and denunciation of the Norton Bill was based on the fact that it was not comprehensive because it did not include this very important section.  The Bill which we have before us to-night suffers from the same defect.  Of course, the Fianna Fáil back-benchers have been given the cue to support the Bill and <Col N="832" /> then to sit down and keep quiet.  However, the Minister should at least deal with this matter in his concluding speech.  He dealt with it 12 months ago and he should at least have the good nature to indicate that if there was a defect in the Norton Bill he has recognised the defect, that he has had to accept it in his own Bill, and that he has been subject to exactly the same difficulties that faced his predecessors. That might indicate to the Fianna Fáil back-benchers that the question of the approach to social security is not merely a question of social thinking but a very difficult question of practical economics.  We are told, as regards this Bill, that it is all the country can afford at the present time.  We have heard that statement so often from Fianna Fáil that one grows tried of it.  To-day we are able to afford a figure for social services in a full year of something around £4,250,000, less increased income from stamp contribution, and this is 1952.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of days until a Budget will be introduced which is going to deal with a situation, which, in the words of the Minister for Finance, is in the nature of a crisis. Yet, we can afford £3,750,000 of an increase in social services.  In 1947 we had the same economic position so far as Fianna Fáil was concerned, and the situation was supposed to be fraught with difficulties.  Wages and salaries had to be controlled, the rights and powers of trade unions were severely limited, and they were reminded that they would have to do what they were told.  No guarantees whatever were given by the Taoiseach in regard to rise in prices and there were no provisions for compensation to wage and salary earners to meet rise in prices. Almost exactly the same economic parallel exist to-day, according to the Minister for Finance.  In 1947 the present Minister for Health could not find £500,000 for the old age pensioners. Now he has been educated.  Whatever the Labour Party did or did not do during the three and a half years of office of the Inter-Party Government, they brought a larger number of people <Col N="833" /> faster along the road than they were originally intended to travel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The main cause for objection was the question of the cost &mdash;£500,00.  You did, in fact, make great play about it.  I do not believe in being unfair, but if we could not afford £500,000 in that situation in 1947, how is that we can afford £3,750,000 to-day?  There is no sound reason why, on cost alone, you cannot leave features in the present Bill, such as retirement pensions, maternity allowances and death grants.  If it is not a question of cost, then it is a question of principle.  If it is a question of principle, as I have already indicated, it should be measured not <Col N="834" /> merely in relation to the workers who are prepared to pay for the cost of their retirement pensions but in relation to the many public servants to whom we quite willingly provide superannuation payments without any contribution at all.</P>
      <P>On the death benefit, may I say that, while it may appear that I am making reference to insurance companies because of some of the comments made in the debate earlier, I am not; but insurance companies do come into the picture.  Deputy Cogan, out of the depths of his ignorance to-day, said that the families who take out insurance take out endowment insurance and not insurance to cover expenses arising from the deaths of members of the family.  Even if that is correct, if they are given some assistance and some relief in respect of the cost of interment, they can take out better endowment policies and spend a little more.  However, I do not accept Deputy Cogan's statement because I am aware that the taking out of policies to cover expenses arising from the death of a child or a husband is a common feature of the life of our people.</P>
      <P>Again, may I say that when, on occasions, I was trying to explain Deputy Norton's Bill to ordinary workers, as I quite intended to do, to convince them of the benefits, the easiest way I could convince them that the payment of 3/6 a week was a good investment was to forget all about retirement pensions, the increased sick benefit, increased unemployment benefit, the maternity allowances, and explain to them in very simple terms the payments in regard to the death benefits and their payments in regard to industrial insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the average working-class family of four, five or six children.  I think it may be accepted that the very minimum they are paying for purely burial insurance would be a sum of 9d. or 1/- a week.  Now if we take the increase proposed by Deputy Norton in his Bill at 1/7 per week and set it against that saving of even 9d. a week on burial insurance payments, the net increase was 10d. a week.  In return for that they were getting as <Col N="835" /> adequate a cover as they would get from industrial insurance plus the satisfaction of knowing that out of their premiums some 60 per cent. would not be absorbed in administrative costs.</P>
    <P>At least whatever may be the criticism of the present Bill or Deputy Norton's Bill, it is a whole lot cheaper than anything you will get from an insurance company for any type of cover.  I suggest when the criticism is made of the cost of retirement pensions and what it means in the form of increased contributions from the worker, let somebody go out and ask a private company to quote what it will cost per week to give a man and his wife 36/- a week at the age of 65 for the remainder of his life and see how much he will have to pay.  This is one instance, anyway, where the State can offer better terms than private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that there is the question which has been referred to on many occasions, the objection to ordinary simple working-class people being not merely influenced but in many cases induced and misled into taking out insurances which very often they may find great difficulty in paying, very often much more than they require and which often they find the greatest difficulty in maintaining. There is the added objection that of the payment they make into that insurance company at least 60 per cent.&mdash;it has often been known to be as high as 90 per cent.&mdash;is absorbed in administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows a little, and I know only a little, of the insurance business is quite well aware that many of the large insurance fortunes which have been collected by insurance companies had their basis in the industrial policy system of the percentage that went in administrative costs as against a small percentage that went back to the policy holder.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister that so far as the death benefit is concerned, whatever other feature is taken out of the Bill or put in, he will bear in mind, that however much he or I or other <Col N="836" /> spokesmen in the House or outside may enter into debate about the high principles of social security, the philosophy of the welfare State, the economics of our community, so far as many thousands of the ordinary simple workingmen are concerned, the most attractive feature of our concern for their welfare was in that very simple provision that the State was going to relieve them of this responsibility in respect of death, which has been the means of their exploitation for many years; that we were going to provide them with this death benefit as part of an all-in system of security; and that they were going to get a more adequate return for increased contributions.</P>
    <P>I would like to close on the note of again stating that the purpose of our amendment is to indicate the weaknesses of the present Bill, of the defects that have arisen by the changes that have been made; to reiterate our belief in the necessity for the restoration of some of the provisions that were particularly required in respect of the mass of our people, and to urge that, as it has been stated from the Fianna Fáil Benches, if we are unable at the moment to find a practicable solution of the problem of giving to the whole of our community, especially the farming community, their share of this type of security, we should not take from other sections of the community what they are entitled to and what they urgently require.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to make the claim on behalf of the small farmer.  I would be one of the first to recognise that claim, but there is one fundamental difference between the farmer and the wage-earner.  The farmer has his land and he always has that land as a base to which he can return. When the industrial worker loses his job, he has not only lost his job, but he has lost his whole economic sheet-anchor. When a man reaches the age of 65 and finds himself out of a job, it is time, particularly for those who believe in the welfare of the majority of the community and for a Party like Fianna Fáil which claims it is based on certain historic principles in this nation, to have regard to that demand and not to use as an excuse and justification for ignoring that claim. <Col N="837" /> the practical difficulty of dealing with the problem as a whole.</P>

      <P>The anxiety and eagerness of the Fianna Fáil Party to support their Minister on this Bill is touching.  Of course when one goes through the long list of speeches that were made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party this time last year it is understandable.  Before I go into that, however, let me just jog the Minister's own mind a little in regard to the interruption he made while Deputy Larkin was speaking.  The Minister purported to suggest that Deputy Larkin said that the motion in 1947 which was rejected by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day and the rejection of which was, of course, moved by the Minister as Minister for Social Welfare at the time, was a motion requesting that there would be complete abolition of the means test in regard to pensions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the basis upon which income is assessed for the purpose of the means test in the case of persons entitled to old age pensions, blind pensions, and widows' and orphans' pensions, requires revision and in particular that in assessing income for such purpose no cognisance should be taken of (a) gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family whether in cash or in kind; (b) any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash, and (c) casual moneys earned by the pensioner, and requests the Government to take all necessary steps accordingly.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The whole trouble and the whole difficulty in regard to the Minister in that respect is that he was caught out and thought he would be able to get away here, as he had on other occasions, and the simulated anger that he displayed here was because he thought I would be fool enough to sit down and let him get away with it again.</P>

      <P>The Minister came in this morning and delivered himself of an oration which certainly was hardly the best method of getting this Bill discussed in an atmosphere of calm consideration, in an atmosphere of any thought for the provisions that are in it or in an atmosphere that would mean that we would be able to get worked out in this House, as there should be worked out having regard to the people that sent us here, a Bill that would embody the collective wisdom of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the question at all as to whether the files that were produced by the Minister and waved <Col N="840" /> in his hand as if he had a television set operating throughout the homes of this country really referred to this matter or did not, but I do say, without question, that if the Minister had any hand, act or part in the many steps that he recounted as having been taken&mdash; whether they were taken or not I do not know&mdash;he should have had sufficient recollection of the work that he did to be able to quote them when he spoke here in this House on the 2nd March, 1950.  If the Minister had any hand, act or part in the work that was put through by his Department, as he stated this morning, it is an amazing thing that he was so extremely modest, so extremely self-effacing when he spoke on the 2nd March, 1950.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon &mdash;1951.  It is amazing that on the many other occasions on which he spoke throughout the country he did not tell the people about them.  One could have understood that at that time the Minister might not be able, when he had not the files to his hand, to give the exact dates upon which certain events had occurred but surely, if these things had occurred at his direction and if he had understood the meaning of the steps that had been taken, he would have been able to tell the country what those steps were and the manner in which they had been done.  That recital would have rung far truer, would have given a much better sound, if it had been produced 12 months ago in this House instead of being produced in the circumstances in which it was produced to-day, when all of us are able to assess the real and the true reasons for the exhibition that was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Social Welfare Bill, 1950, was circulated at the beginning of January, 1951, one of the first things commented on by members of Fianna Fáil was that the White Paper and the tables that were circulated at the time by Deputy Norton, then Minister, were not full and adequate and did not provide the information necessary for the purpose of enabling people properly to assess the effects of the <Col N="841" /> scheme and the benefits that could be incorporated in the scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain, the only basis furnished at all was the White Paper that was furnished at that time by Deputy Norton and, if it was true then to suggest that that White Paper and those tables were insufficient, is it not equally true to-day, and is it not obvious that the objection that was made at that time, in 1951, to the absence of information, was an objection that was being made purely for the purpose of finding some sort of stick with which to beat Deputy Norton, then Minister for Social Welfare?</P>
    <P>The more one looks back and the more one reads the statements and speeches that were made 12 months ago on the Bill that was introduced by Deputy Norton and the more one considers them now in the light of the Bill introduced by the present Minister, the more one is forced to the conclusion that they were entirely and totally dishonest.</P>
    <P>The main objections that were raised then were not objections in regard to detail, not objections in regard to one service or another, but objections in principle.  If they were objections on detail one could understand quite easily that there would be changes, that as a result of more facts being ascertained it would appear that the objections in detail that had been made were unfounded.  Nobody could cavil and nobody would cavil at people changing their mind if they discovered more facts.  But that was not the objection that was raised 12 months ago.  The objection that was raised 12 months ago was fundamentally and primarily one that was started, I believe, at the instigation of the Party opposite throughout the length and breadth of the country because the Bill then published did not include every aspect of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite fair, even though he is not always fair.  The Minister, as Deputy Ryan, did not take that line in this House, but speech after speech was made by the boys behind and by his colleagues in the front bench <Col N="842" /> making it clear that their objection to the Bill was that it did not embrace everybody, particularly the farmers and people who were self-employed. Some spoke in measured terms; some spoke in moderate terms; some spoke in a language hardly of the moderation we are accustomed to hear, say, from Deputy Corry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but wherever they spoke there was the same fundamental objection to the principle of the Bill, not to its details, and it is exactly the same principle which Deputy Ryan, now Minister for Social Welfare, has introduced in this Bill to-day.</P>
      <P>Just for the sake of ensuring that some of the Deputies over there who have already been quoted on statements they made&mdash;and Deputy Burke was quoted a few minutes ago&mdash;do not feel lonely, I want to add a few quotations from the many speeches made at that time for the purpose of making the welkin ring because the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950, did not include the farmers and the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The first person I would like to take is that new adherent of Fianna Fáil who is determined to ensure that he will out-Fianna Fáil.  We all know of course that the reason for Deputy Cogan's anxiety to try to beat the Party opposite in praise of their doctrines is that he believes that there is a little bit more than one quota for Fianna Fáil in County Wicklow and wants to get the spill over in the next election, particularly if an election is going to come shortly as has been suggested by some people and by some newspapers.  He said in Volume 125:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is another very serious defect in this Bill.  It leaves out of consideration almost half the working population of the country.  I regard the health benefits and the provisions for widows and children as important and desirable but under this Bill those benefits do not apply to more than half the working population <Col N="843" /> though the entire population will have to contribute towards the general taxation in order to provide them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I listened to-day to Deputy Cogan; I did not hear him say that about the present Bill although exactly the same criticism would apply to it.  On that occasion too I heard Deputy Cogan state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have indicated that I disagreed with the Bill on the ground that it makes for more intensive centralisation of all social activities in the hands of a centralised Department. The Bill takes away many of the responsibilities which could be left in the hands of the head of the family. It takes away a lot of the responsibilities which could be left with great advantage to a locally constituted body such as a parish council or a parish guild.  We ought to approach this question on Christian lines.  We ought to approach it on the lines indicated by people who have studied those questions from a Christian standpoint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not hear Deputy Cogan approach this Bill on the same basis.  I did not to-day hear Deputy Cogan offer any constructive suggestion as to the manner in which we could improve the Bill in that fashion.  He went on, having one of his fairly regular tilts with Deputy Davin, and said that he wondered whether his friend, Deputy Davin, thought it right to coerce workers into insuring against the incompetence of the Government, unemployment. Deputy Cogan must be aware of the position regarding employment in Wicklow to-day and as it was 12 months ago.  But yet last year he did not think it was wise for a worker to insure against the incompetence of his own Government.  It is indeed Deputy Cogan's own Government that is now incompetent and that has, through its &ldquo;wolf, wolf!&rdquo; talk particularly, brought upon the workers in many parts of the country increased unemployment and short time.</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Colley, representing a Dublin City constituency, adding his contribution on the 4th <Col N="844" /> April.  Deputy Colley's contribution was that he thought that the first fact which would strike him, if he were the Minister responsible for introducing a social security scheme, was that other people, such as small shopkeepers and farmers who could not increase their income, were in the same position and he was complaining that the Bill, as then introduced, did not cover those people at all.</P>
    <P>If it were merely a question of detail it could be understood, but when Deputy Little came along on the 11th April he made it clear that it was not any question of detail with him but a question of principle.  He said (column 541):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To us it is clear that there is a difference on principle because we want to spread the net as wide as possible and to approach the problem from a national point of view, caring for all classes in the community.  For that reason, we feel there is a fundamental difference in principle between our approach and that embodied in the Government measure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We heard nothing to-day from Deputy Little regarding principle.  I saw Deputy Little only a few moments ago leaving this House when he could have added his voice to persuade this Government, with whom he used not so very long ago to sit in the Cabinet room to discuss problems, that the way they had gone since they lost the benefit of his advice was away from the principle of which he spoke some 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult, I must confess, if not impossible to understand how people could get up time after time and state that they were objecting on a point of principle and then come in and stand behind the Minister on exactly the same measure to which they had objected on principle only 12 months ago.  There is only one possible explanation: that they had no principles at all or else that when they were talking about points of principle it was only so much political blah for the purpose of raising Party political capital and making things difficult for the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Deputy Cogan from Wicklow a few moments ago.  Not to <Col N="845" /> be outdone, Deputy Tom Brennan from the same constituency on the 11th April came into the fray.  He said (column 547):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I bewail the fact that almost one-half of the workers of the country, represented particularly by the small farmers, are not covered by the scheme.  I hold that it is a misnomer to call any scheme of social insurance which does not make provision for these people comprehensive. A big number of workers are not covered by this scheme, such as the small farmers, the self-employed man, fishermen and other classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have heard no word of complaint from Deputy Brennan about this Bill although these classes&mdash;and all of them&mdash;are equally left out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the reason why they have not commented upon this Bill is because they have been shut out in their efforts to talk by the members of the Opposition.  That cannot be said because every time a speaker has concluded on this side of the House there has been a certain reluctance for someone on this side to follow him immediately without giving an opportunity to those on the Government Benches to explain their conversion and their change of heart. There has been adequate opportunity offered to them had they wished to avail of it to discuss this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On 11th April, last year, Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, came into this House and, having opened with the sentence which I quoted earlier this evening to the effect that this Bill was a selfish Bill, he then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By reason of its deficiencies and its defects the Bill could be called a measure of social injustice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Following on that, he treated us to what I can only describe as a gem having regard to the manner in which Deputy MacEntee, now Minister for Finance, offered so gracefully to give way to Deputy Cowan on Tuesday night last.  Speaking about that Deputy last year, Deputy MacEntee described him as the &ldquo;nuncio of the red pope of the Kremlin&rdquo;; he stated that he was reminded of the signal ability with which Satan could quote the Scriptures to suit his own purpose and he proceeded to reprimand Deputy Cowan in somewhat strong terms because Deputy Cowan had suggested that the objection in principle that had been put up to the 1950 Bill was not one that was well or validly founded.  He continued as follows at column 596 of Volume 125:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The glaring defect of this Bill is, I think, its refusal to give any consideration whatever to the working farmer and the self-employed person. That was its fatal defect when the Bill was introduced.  It remains its fatal defect to-day, even though some of those who were so outraged by its complete indifference to our agricultural population that they were going to vote against the Bill have been mollified or suborned by the proposal to increase the old age pensions and relax to some extent the means test.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee is now Minister for Finance and as Minister for Finance he must have a somewhat more intimate connection with this Bill than most other Ministers.  It is the Minister for Finance, and his Department, who has more than any other Minister, or <Col N="848" /> Department, an intimate connection with every measure passing through this House which requires money for its implementation.  Unfortunately there are very few measures that do not require some sort of financial backing.</P>
    <P>If Deputy MacEntee was honest when he submitted that objection on principle a year ago, then I find it very difficult to understand how he can reconcile with his conscience to-day the provision of the additional taxation necessary for its implementation.  There is one last quotation I must give.  I do not wish to make the Deputies on the Government Benches any more uncomfortable than is absolutely necessary. The last quotation to which I must refer is from a speech made by a friend of Deputy McGrath, a friend with whom in recent weeks he has had some little differences of opinion on his own side of the House.  Deputy Corry's speech will be found at column 199 of Volume 125.  The bulk of it is taken up with the complaint that the Bill then introduced did not include the small farmers, did not include&mdash;as he put it employed, did not include&mdash;as he put it himself&mdash;the 503,000 farmers, their wives, their sons and their daughters and did not include the 358,000 who were working on holdings of under 50 acres.  He said that these people would wake up one fine morning and find, when they went out to buy their little bit of tobacco, that they had to pay a little bit extra for it by way of tax. For what?  For the Bill that was then being introduced.  If Dame Rumour is not a lying jade, I wonder how Deputy Corry will feel next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Every one of these speeches in relation to that Bill considered in retrospect makes it perfectly clear that there was no point of principle with which the Deputies who were then on this side of the House were concerned; and, if that is not so, then the natural corollary is that they have since sold their principles.  I prefer to give them the charitable explanation of saying that they did not consider that the 1950 Bill was against their principles and were only saying that for political purposes.  It is more charitable to say that than to say they swallowed their own principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> The Bill now before the House, just as the Bill which was before the House 12 months ago, starts off on one basis. It starts on the basis of co-ordinating the existing social services.  Listening to the Minister to-day, one would think that the idea of co-ordinating the social services was an idea of his own just as one would think, from another remark he made, that the idea of children's allowances was originally one of his own.  As far as the co-ordinating of the social services is concerned the fact, of course, is that there was no public suggestion that this should be done until it was suggested in 1937 by Mr. W.T. Cosgrave.  That was the first public suggestion by any public man that what we needed was to co-ordinate the existing services and by co-ordinating them save on the central overheads.  But like so many things that are so obvious they never come to light.  Obviously the method of dealing with the matter is by a single stamp and thus save a very considerable overhead expenditure.  The savings would be available for benefits under the service instead of being eaten up in the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>That was the cardinal principle in the 1950 Bill and that is the cardinal principle in the memorandum circulated by the Minister.  The Minister sets out the main objects of the Bill as being to replace the present separate units by one co-ordinated scheme of social insurance.  With that the Minister will find complete and ready agreement.  If he compares the first paragraph setting out the objects of the Bill, as contained in the explanatory memorandum that he has issued, with the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum issued 12 months ago, he will find that both are almost identical word for word.  He will find that the objects of the 1950 Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, are included in the memorandum of this Bill in exactly the same terms. The Minister will surprise the House if he is able to explain how it was that those paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum were not identical when they were published.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I could understand the viewpoint which was <Col N="850" /> taken by Deputies last year if they made it clear then that their objection was to one aspect or another.  I could have understood the Deputies, who were then on this side of the House, if they had made the case that their objection was only to the retirement pensions or one or other aspects of the Bill.  They did not do that then.  They made the case in entirely different terms.  Hence, I am at a loss when I try to consider the terms of this Bill and compare them with what they have in mind as to its administration.</P>
    <P>We all agree that in any scheme of social insurance it is desirable, first of all, to co-ordinate.  It is desirable to amalgamate.  It is equally desirable to include in any such scheme as many persons as possible.  Last year, we were told that the glaring defect of the Bill was that it did not include a great many people but there was one section included in last year's Bill who is not included in this one.  It is, indeed, a very grave omission and it is very regrettable that it is not so included.</P>
    <P>There was in the last Bill a provision by virtue of which the small farmers, who are not included under the other terms of the Bill, could come together, if they so wished, with their neighbours in the local parish guild or in the parish or co-operative society&mdash;or if there was not a society already in existence, they could come together and form that society&mdash;for the purpose of obtaining the benefits under the Bill.  That provision has been omitted from this Bill.</P>
    <P>If it was wrong in principle last year to introduce a Social Insurance Bill which did not provide for the farmers but which did provide that method by which they could voluntarily come into the scheme, why is it right this year to introduce a Bill without that provision and without any method of such voluntary inclusion?  Perhaps, Deputy Burke, who states he was merely waiting to speak, will, when he does get up to add his contribution, explain to the House why that is so? Why is it that it is desirable to omit that provision by which farmers or other self-employed people in an area could come together voluntarily and <Col N="851" /> come together in a manner which met with approval in the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, and why do the Government consider that the Bill is better for such an omission?  I will be only too glad to sit here and listen to Deputy Burke give an explanation on that matter because it is a point on which the House is entitled to receive an answer.  The explanation will be one which will be awaited with respect by all on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill, too, omits another provision which we were told last year should have been included.  We were told, first of all, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking on the 4th of April, 1951, at column 69 of the Official Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must confess that I was very much surprised at the decision of the Government not to include in this Bill any proposals for the amendment of children's allowances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass, as he then was, was surprised, surely now, as Tánaiste&mdash;and we are told he is the strong man in this Government&mdash;he had opportunities to overcome his surprise and ensure that the members on this side of the House would not be amazed by the omission in the Bill?</P>
    <P>Then we had following his leader on the next day&mdash;at that time the gentleman who has become known as the junior banshee had not realised it was Deputy MacEntee he was following and not Deputy Lemass&mdash;Deputy Childers who also complained that he thought it was an extraordinary thing that the details of the Bill did not include any provision for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>There was very great criticism last year because it was intended to include an additional provision in regard to old age pensions in the Budget rather than in the initial draft that was circulated on the 1950 Social Welfare Bill.  That criticism would be equally valid now in respect of any intention that the Government may have&mdash;if they have any such intention&mdash;of including a provision in regard to children's allowances &mdash;with the exception that any increase in children's allowances would, I <Col N="852" /> imagine, be required to be included in a supplementary Children's Allowances Act and that it would not be proper for inclusion in the ordinary Finance Act which follows the Budget resolutions.</P>
    <P>There has already been some substantial reference to the question of the omission from this Bill, as compared with the previous Bill, of the death benefits and the substitution, in lieu of the death benefits, of a marriage benefit.  I think that that is a very unwise and retrograde step. Quite Candidly, I feel that it is a result of pressure which has been brought to bear on the Government by the agents of insurances companies&mdash;and I want to be quite clear that I am not referring to the Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, in the personal capacity which he has erstwhile held&mdash;that the provision has been dropped from this Bill. While Deputy Cogan was speaking Deputy Corish made one interjection, and, of course, it is the entire kernel of the difference between the two things.  Deputy Corish said that death comes unexpectedly but that marriage is planned and that it is proper that people, when they are making their plans for marriage, should make provision for the financial commitments that are involved.  Death, however, is an entirely different category.  Despite what Deputy Cogan may say, it is common property that people throughout the country have from time to time frequently expressed the fear that they might be forced, through no fault of their own, into the position of having to be buried by the board of assistance or by whoever may be responsible in a particular area.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at the records can find the statement I made in this House last year on the Social Welfare Bill.  I expressed the view then and I express it again now that it is desirable, in regard to employment after 65 years of age, that there should be an inducement to a person to continue to work after 65 if he is able to do so. I said last year that I thought it would be desirable either that there should be a change in the retirement allowance according as a person worked until he was 66 or 67 upwards or that, if that were administratively <Col N="853" /> difficult, there should be some provision in the scheme which was then before us by virtue of which an inducement would be offered by way of increased benefit, so that a person who is adequately able to work after 65 years of age would continue to do so. I suggested at that time that I thought it would be better to do that by way of a deferred capital benefit that would come to the person when, ultimately, he would retire&mdash;that his contributions to insurance after 65 would be set aside and paid to him when, ultimately, he retired.  I still think that that would be desirable. The fact, however, that I held that view then, and that I hold it now, does not mean that I feel that a person who is not able to work after 65 should be denied the opportunity of having provision made for him.  It seems to me that that is where the farmers of this Bill have gone astray&mdash;that they assume that because we say that a person should be encouraged, if he is able, to continue to work after he is 65, it is the same thing as saying that there should be no retirement benefit at that age.  I do not agree with that viewpoint.  I think it is a mistake, and that it is an unfortunate omission.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Corry was not in the House earlier because he would then have heard me quote from the speech he made 12 months ago.  I had a little tag in this volume of Dáil debates marking the speech he addressed to us 12 months ago.  I quoted him, as I quoted various other Deputies.  Unfortunately, I pulled out the tag and I cannot conveniently find the speech now.  However, when he reads the Official Report of to-day's proceedings in this House he will find the little reminder I gave him of the speech he made 12 months ago, and, in the same way&mdash;now that this Bill has exactly the same objection which he had to the Bill 12 months ago&mdash;he will be able, in his own inimitable way, to voice his objections to the present Bill as he voiced them to the Bill last year.</P>

I am sorry if I have hurt the susceptibilities of this very honourable Deputy but I would remind him again that his Party cannot get away with untruths in this House.  They are telling untruths and are guilty of misrepresentation in this House.  Why during the last three years did Deputy Hickey's Party and the Party opposite allow the economy of this country to drift so far that we find ourselves in the position which we are to-day? If Deputies opposite were honest and if they were competent to do their job properly, if they were the great Government they were supposed to be, we would, instead of having unemployment to-day, be compelled to bring in foreigners to work here and we would not be importing stuff that could be produced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, whether you contribute or not, when you come to 70 years of age you will get £1 a week and possibly more later on. When Deputy Norton was Minister for Social Welfare, as the chief angel of the workers, he wanted the lowest paid section of the workers in this country, the farm employees, to contribute very substantially towards any benefit they would gain under the Bill. Under this particular Bill, they are asked to pay an increased contribution of only about 20 per cent. and the amount of benefit they receive will be increased to £2 10s.  Under Deputy Norton's Bill, they would receive approximately 37/-.  That, in itself, is a big benefit to the lowly-paid workers, the agricultural workers, and that is one benefit under this Bill which was not included in Deputy Norton's Bill.</P>
      <P>The only thing that Deputy Norton succeeded in doing for the lowly-paid workers during his three years in office was to ask them to pay 6d. increase and to give them nothing in return. He asked for an increased contribution from the workers&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Sweetman is going.</P>

      <P>During Fianna Fáil's term of office they never let an opportunity for the betterment of the nation pass.  Even during the short time at our disposal since we resumed office from a bankrupt Party in June, 1951, we have definitely pushed ahead with schemes for the benefit of our people. <Col N="861" /> We hope to continue along those lines until the day comes when this nation will be self-sufficient and every person here will be able to live in the manner proper to a Christian civilisation. One section should not persist in saying that they are the ideal section for the betterment of the people.</P>
      <P>A lot has been said about statements made by ex-Ministers during the last year.  I am sure Deputy Sweetman often attended court, and so did I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see that Deputy Sweetman has changed his mind so much as to recognise the great benefit that this Bill will confer. However, I am sure it is a fool who would not change his mind in face of greater enlightment.  I will sell Deputy Sweetman that statement so that he can use it again.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an advance and I want to compliment the Minister for his honest attempt in bringing in a Bill which we hope to have in operation by July.  I trust that this Bill will help our people, and that it will only be the forerunner of other social measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to some undesirable remarks which were made here to-day about officials who are not in a position to defend themselves. Of course, I would not expect any more from the people who made such remarks concerning civil servants during this debate to-day who were associated with the Department of Social Welfare.  I feel sorry that any such remarks were made in this House. I would like to put on record that the Minister's staff are to be complimented <Col N="862" /> for assisting Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister, in his very able presentation of this Bill to the House.  As I said already, I recommend this Bill as being a step on the right road and I want the Opposition to realise that this measure will be accepted by the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a statement to-day to the effect that he was prepared to accept certain suggestions during the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I will reserve some suggestions I wish to make until that time.  Finally, I want to congratulate the Minister and his staff for bringing in a Bill which is well worth being considered and being received wholeheartedly in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a 12-hour sitting such as we have had to-day the light relief given us by the previous speaker was quite welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity, at the commencement of the day's sitting, that the Minister, in introducing this extremely important measure, adopted the attitude of the Minister for Finance when he was presenting the Vote on Account a week ago.  It is to be regretted that the Minister for Social Welfare delivered himself of a statement which, as a new Deputy to the House, I was amazed to hear from him.  I had assessed the Minister for Social Welfare as one of the least vindictive persons in the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, his statement this morning set a very bad headline for every other Deputy in the House who was to succeed him in the discussion.  During the past eight or nine months some very probing inquiries have been made from this side of the House as to the delay in introducing the Bill.  I contend <Col N="863" /> that the measure is now brought in as a red herring to draw the attention of the people away from the genuine concern with which they are facing next week's Budget.  It seems to me the introduction of the Bill at this particular time is designed for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The objection I have to the Bill is based on the grounds that the Minister's opening remarks opposing Deputy Norton's Bill were in very similar terms.  At column 1092, Volume 124, Dr. Ryan said that he &ldquo;put down this amendment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in an endeavour to get a better scheme of social insurance&rdquo;.  The first point made in the amendment was: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because it does not provide a comprehensive or balanced scheme covering the needs of all sections of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We object to the present measure inasmuch as it falls very far short of Mr. Norton's scheme and still further short of the policy stated by Fianna Fáil when they went to the electorate a short time ago.  It is extraordinary that after that short space of time they will not fulfil the promises they made to the electorate and which, no doubt, had an effect in the industrial areas.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned because of the fact that this Bill limits the sections of the people who will derive benefits from it.  In my constituency there is probably not quite as large a proportion of contributors as there would be in others.  Consequently, my concern is more with the small farmer and the non-contributor generally.</P>
    <P>We have the assistance of three schemes.  Setting aside the ephemeral one, which we were told existed and was left behind by Fianna Fáil in 1947, and which, we were told, Mr. Norton, the succeeding Minister, would have no difficulty in introducing, there were three schemes.  There is a distinct difference in the scheme now put forward from the one promulgated also to a certain degree in competition with Mr. Norton's scheme.  It is definitely short of the scheme which we saw displayed on all the posters, and which was publicised in all the propaganda <Col N="864" /> issued by Fianna Fáil at the general election, particularly in the City of Cork.</P>
    <P>From reading the debates of last year I find that the opposition to the Norton scheme and the objections made by the then Opposition, who now form the major part of the support for this Government in the House, I find that the objections were not in any way concerned with the contributions but were all based on the fact of the insufficiency of the benefits.  We therefore must be excused for calling attention to certain omissions in the current Bill.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned because the small farmer is left out.  There was provision in the inter-Party Government scheme, as Deputy Larkin detailed earlier this evening, for the small farmer.  In fact, the ceiling of £25 or £30 poor law valuation was mentioned.  That was a very advisable provision.  To a certain extent, it abolished the demarcation line between the small farmer and the workers, who have so much in common in the difficulties that they have to surmount.  It is only right and proper that a scheme such as this should be comprehensive, not only in name, but in character as well.</P>
    <P>One of the exclusion from this Bill is a provision for retirement at the age of 65.  Perhaps the Minister, when he is concluding, will explain to the House why his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, has issued a directive that rate collectors should retire at that age and why the same yardstick should not be applied to sections of the community that are being dealt with under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is no provision in this Bill for an easement of the means test in relation to widows' pensions. I appreciate that there is an increase in the allowance.  Such an increase is warranted by the extraordinary increase in the cost of living since this Government was elected.  However, there has not been an easement of the means test.  A short time ago, a case was brought to my notice of a widow whose husband had been in receipt of an old age pension of 10/- per week, but, on his death, as a result of the <Col N="865" /> method of assessment employed in the Department of Social Welfare in relation to widows, she was allowed the princely sum of 2/- per week to maintain her for the rest of her days. I had hoped that that unjust method of assessment would be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the assessment of means generally, there is a matter which I suggest is worthy of consideration.  The officers whose duty it is to investigate the means of applicants for old age pensions and widows' pensions, particularly in the dairying counties, one of which I have the honour to represent, make inquiries at the local creamery and include in their assessment of means the amount which the applicant received from the creamery in the past year.  The applicant may not have the help of any member of the family on the farm and must pay for labour. Even though the milk cheque may be higher, the cost of producing the milk would have increased considerably, particularly having regard to the considerable <Col N="866" /> increase in the cost of fertilisers since the advent of this Government.</P>
    <P>I notice that although sections of our people, such as the Civil Service, the Defence Forces and the Gardaí, are considered in this measure, there is power to modify the extent to which they may benefit.  To say the least of it, I think that is a matter for uneasiness. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
