      <P>As stated in my reply on 30th January last to an identical question asked by the Deputy, the particulars asked for cannot be given since the Statistics Act, 1926, does not permit the disclosure of information about individual concerns without the prior consent of the concerns in question, which has not been given in this case.</P>
      <P>It is provisionally estimated that in 1951 the production of coal by all mines was 174,000 tons and that the average number of wage-earners employed was 1,270.  Definitive figures of total production and employment and particulars of the average price per ton ex-colliery of coal mined in that year will not be available until the annual census of industrial production returns for that year have been compiled.</P>

      <P>The work of promoting the development of exports to the dollar has been entrusted to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, which was incorporated on 21st December last.  The company has prepared and distributed a pamphlet giving particulars of its origin, organisation and functions and an indication of the types of service it can make available to exporters.  Trade inquiries covering a <Col N="895" /> wide range of commodities have already been received and dealt with. The company has also secured the services of a number of American experts to conduct a survey with a view to selecting those Irish products which offer the best prospects for urgent development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that, as a result of the fact that during the period of flour rationing the weekly quota was based on the value of the coupons lodged by the flour retailer with the flour miller, the distribution of this quota in small weights to a number of registered customers has resulted in loss of weight causing a shortage of flour to meet the ration requirements of customers and; if so, if he will sanction the issue of a supplementary two weeks' ration of flour so as to make sure that each consumer will be assured of the subsidised flour ration up to the end of the flour rationing period as otherwise <Col N="896" /> consumers will be faced with a two weeks' shortage of flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no representations from retailers about shortages due to this cause.</P>
      <P>I do not think that retailers have had difficulty in obtaining out of each sack of flour the number of rations which the sack represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will take the necessary action to prevent the cost of Irish grown tomatoes to the consumers from reaching excessively high figures and have a reasonable controlled price fixed for home-grown tomatoes immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that it is necessary to control the price of Irish tomatoes.  Imported tomatoes, at a controlled retail price, will be available up to the beginning of August, and it is expected that by that date, supplies of Irish tomatoes will be available in sufficient quantities to ensure a reasonable selling price to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that existing marketing arrangements have proved totally inadequate for the disposal of the large supplies of hand-won turf which remain on the hands of producers in the Pullough, Ferbane and Edenderry areas of County Offaly, and that there is now no prospect of its disposal through ordinary commercial channels, he will make an immediate statement on the matter and indicate what further measures he proposes to take to solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any large supplies of hand-won turf remaining on the hands of producers in the areas to which the Deputy refers.  My information is that all surplus turf produced in those areas in 1951 has been disposed of.  As regards the 1952 crop, the production season has still only reached the half-way stage and <Col N="897" /> marketing cannot be expected to get under way until the crop is harvested and ready for sale.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.  In the case of jams, which are not now controlled by Order, I have arranged with the manufacturers concerned that their prices will be reduced not later than the 5th July next, and that publicity will be given to the matter.  At the present stage it is not possible to give details of the reductions as it will be necessary to have regard to other factors affecting costs such as the price to be paid by the manufacturers for this season's fruit.  The prices of the other commodities mentioned by the Deputy are not controlled.  It is considered that competition in the trade is sufficient to keep prices within reasonable limits.  I do not propose at present to intervene in the matter of the price reductions which should result in the case of these commodities.  If, however, satisfactory reductions in prices are not introduced within a reasonable period appropriate measures will be taken.</P>

      <P>The rate of contribution under the cheap fuel scheme during the summer periods is dependent on the cost of the fuel and is fixed at approximately two-thirds of the cost of the fuel.  That procedure has been continued in the current year and the contribution in most areas is higher than in previous years because of the increases in the cost of the fuel.  It is not possible, therefore, in the case of Dublin, to revert to the rate of contribution which operated there during the summer of 1951.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This, Sir, is the section which operates to bestow on dance-hall proprietors a sum of £140,000 out of the Exchequer.  The House will remember that when we were on an earlier section of the Finance Bill which operated to impose an additional tax on diesel oil we found it extremely difficult to ascertain from the Minister for Finance the magnitude of the burden that the tax on diesel oil was likely to impose on Córas Iompair Éireann.  After protracted inquiry it transpired that he believed the burden would be somewhere between £100,000 and £150,000 per annum.  There is a striking coincidence between the £140,000 which the dance-hall proprietors are to receive on foot of their agreement with the Government that if they subscribed to the Fianna Fáil Party funds and the Fianna Fáil Party succeeded in scrambling into office, the Fianna Fáil Party undertook to remit this £140,000 taxation for the benefit of the dance-hall proprietors.</P>
      <P>The dance-hall proprietors faithfully performed their part of the bargain and they opened the subscription list, as the House will remember, with a subscription of £250, and the other members of the association of ballroom proprietors-because now that they have become so well &ldquo;heeled&rdquo; it is no longer considered proper to call them dance-hall proprietors; they have become ballroom proprietors on the strength of the £140,000-doubtless answered the summons and made contributions which compared reasonably if not favourably with the generous send-off of £250.</P>
      <P>The House will remember, however, that we asked the Tánaiste and we asked the Minister for Finance to translate the burden which the diesel oil tax would put on Córas Iompair Éireann into terms of addition to bus fares.  The Tánaiste baulked that question, and said he did not know what increase it would involve on bus fares or if it would involve any increase.  He went so far as to say that whatever deficit accrues must ultimately be met out of the Exchequer, and he then used a phrase which led some of us to believe he was giving an undertaking there and then that he would not permit Córas Iompair Éireann to increase bus fares in order to recoup themselves for this additional impost, whereupon the Minister for Finance became extremely angry, and jumping to his feet beside the Tánaiste, he said: &ldquo;No matter what anybody else says, I am giving no undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention was directed to this rather singular divergence of opinion between the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, because the House will remember how solicitous the Minister for Finance is for the joint responsibility of Ministers in a Government. He has had two or three weaknesses in this House when he thought of how <Col N="915" /> that sacred principle of joint responsibility was in peril during the previous three years.  Grave as were the perils which may have occurred in the previous three years, I do not think that during the period of our Government's occupancy of office we have ever had the edifying spectacle of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance slanging one another on the Front Bench.  We stand now in the position that the Tánaiste says he does not think there will be any increase in bus fares.  The Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;Whatever undertaking you get from him or anybody else, you will not get any such undertaking from me.&rdquo;  This morning, however, there appears an announcement in the papers that Cónas Iompair Éireann is to increase bus fares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not discuss bus fares on this section.  We cannot discuss every variation of a tax or remission of a tax on the section relating to dance halls.  We will have to discuss the remission of taxation on dance halls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to argue that, inasmuch as this bounty which this section proposes to confer on the dance-hall proprietors will cost the people who travel on the buses a penny addition to bus fares, we should cancel the two sections.  You will remember, Sir, that we have been rebuked by the Minister for Finance for advocating remission of taxation without a corresponding suggestion as to where the revenue is to be found wherewith to remit the tax.  Here is an ideal case.  I am advocating the remission on the tax on diesel oil used in buses so that bus fares need not go up and I am pointing to this Section 14 as the source of revenue wherewith to remit the tax.  I do not see Deputy McGrath here.  I heard him grunting a little earlier, but he seems to have left the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Protesting then.  I heard him making a very civil remark.  I think the last time I heard him he was <Col N="916" /> suggesting in this House that I should be shot in 1941 and, if I had, that that would have spared him a great deal of the trouble and tribulation he has to undergo now.  Apparently, he has left the House.  I want to ask Deputy Burke of Dublin and Deputy McGrath and Deputy Lynch of Cork to join with me in suggesting to the Minister that here is an occasion when two sections of a Finance Bill might with great advantage be deleted without any dislocation of the Exchequer and thereby afford very material relief for a section of the community least able to bear the impost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that earlier sections dealing with mineral hydro-carbon light oil and hydro-carbon oil were disposed of by this House.  We cannot reopen discussion on these now in discussing Section 14.  Section 14 must be discussed by itself.  The proposal is to remit taxation in respect of ballroom dance halls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballroom proprietors. Surely the Ceann Comhairle will recall that the standing rebuke of the Minister for Finance is that Deputies must not press him to remit taxation if they do not indicate a source of revenue wherewith to furnish the remission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be approached in a regular fashion.  We must not discuss all the other sections or any one of them on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the House to believe that I was actuated by any malicious desire to impoverish the poor ballroom proprietors.  These proprietors have all doubtless purchased return tickets to the Continent on the strength of Section 14 and no one would, out of malice or envy, grudge them that continental trip. Perhaps their eyes may turn to Parknasilla, Rossapenna or even Achill Island-they may go native on this £140,000.  We would all be glad to see them have lots of fun.  I am not asking that they should be deprived of their spree or the boodle which they negotiated so skilfully to secure and which they are on the threshold of corralling. <Col N="917" /> I am only asking the Minister to say who is to provide this £140,000 for the ballroom proprietors' spree?  Surely this House must ask itself before we pass a section of the Finance Bill designed to bestow £140,000 on a very limited section of the community, how many ballroom proprietors are there?  Is it 140? Take it it is 140.  Really it is a most fascinating proposition.  Just imagine if one woke up in the morning and found oneself the beneficiary of a section of a Finance Bill which gave one £1,000 into one's lap with full legislative benediction. It is a dramatic proposition. £1,000 each for 140 ballroom proprietors. Surely Dáil Éireann will ask the Minister to say who will provide this hansel.  Out of whom will we screw the money to pay this?</P>
      <P>Bear in mind that Horatio Nelson fought the battle of Trafalgar and saved the British Empire in order to get a life pension passed on to posterity. The ballroom proprietors here have only to subscribe once to the Fianna Fáil election fund to get a pension of £1,000 a year in perpetuity. Well may Horatio Nelson turn in his grave.  He had to risk life and limb, lose an eye and lose an arm, and then his life in order to pass on to his posterity the same largesse.  Great dramatic pictures have been painted of the sacrifice he made to purchase for one descendant a relatively trifing sum.</P>

Their rôle is simply to call on the Tánaiste and to say: &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;  accompanying the words with a suitable gesture with their thumb and first and second finger of a rotary and abrasive kind.

      <P>I am talking about Horatio Nelson, the man with the <Col N="918" /> patch over one eye and an empty sleeve.  The ballroom proprietors make up 140 Horatio Nelsons that this country is asked to maintain.  This is not a proposal to give them one grant of £1,000 apiece.  This is a proposal to exempt them for ever more from the £1,000 apiece they have been paying. It is the most astonishing proposition that has ever been brought before a democratic legislature in the history of democracy.  What distresses me is that, over and above its manifest immorality, and that does not really cause me any great shock when Fianna Fáil is the source of it, it is deplorably bad business. The capital value of an annuity of £140,000 is very substantial.  Would it be unreasonable to expect 20 years' purchase of such an annuity?  An annuity, the capital value of which is £2,000,000 sterling, for the £20,000 or £30,000 the dance hall proprietors put up for the Fianna Fáil Party is very bad value.  It is one thing to buy votes with public money but when you start buying subscriptions of a few thousand pounds with millions of public money somebody must call a halt.</P>
      <P>Come now.  Deputy Burke is an experienced Deputy and one who never hesitates to champion the cause of the Dublin working man.  Here he can do a public service.  Let him join with me in saying that there should be no Nelson pensions for ballroom proprietors here; there should be no perpetual endowment of ballroom proprietors, their heirs and assignees, from the Irish Exchequer.  I do not despair that even at this eleventh hour this most disreputable proposal will be amended or withdrawn.  I exhort those Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who have some respect for themselves, if there are any such, to dissociate themselves from this disgusting and disgraceful transaction.  In reaching their conclusion, I press upon them that they have a duty to ask themselves out of whose pocket will the money be taken?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon talks about 140 ballroom proprietors who will be beneficiaries under the remission of this tax.  When I was speaking on the Budget I referred to the fact that there was no enumeration of the number of dance halls throughout the country owned by parochial committees or town improvements committees.  In County Westmeath there are 23 such halls.  There is only one privately-owned dance hall in that county.  In the town of Athlone there are three dance halls-St. Mary's, St. Peter's <Col N="920" /> and Sportex.  They are all owned by either parochial committees or some other committee.  In Moate, you have a hall which is the property of the Westmeath County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy O'Higgins and say that Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael and Labour have hired these halls and run dances in them.  In the town of Mullingar you have three halls. In the town in which I live, you have a town hall which is owned by a town's improvement committee.  You have halls in Athlone, Moate, Kilbeggan, Tyrrellspass, Crookedwood, Castlepollard, Collinstown, Delvin, Killucan, Rathowen, Ballinacarrigy, Leney, Boherquil, Knockaville, Castletown-Geoghegan, Fore, Glanidan, Cloughan.  All this talk about £140,000 going back to private individuals is not correct.  If an analysis were made of the number of such halls in the province of Leinster it would be a safe bet to say that they are at least ten to one against the privately-owned dance hall.  When we take into account that this £140,000 is not a net amount but a gross amount, and that, as has been pointed out again and again, the cost of collecting it is very high, the question arises, as it arose in 1946, is the tax worth collecting?  I have no apologies, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, for the abolition of this tax.  Fianna Fáil abolished it in 1946.  While Fianna Fáil remained in office, the tax was off.  It was put on again by the Government previous to the present Government, and so Fianna Fáil is consistent in doing away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all these halls in my county that I have mentioned.  There are similar halls in the counties of Meath. Offaly and Longford.  They are hired time and time again by G.A.A. clubs. N.A.C.A. clubs, coursing clubs, tennis clubs, badminton clubs, by the Red Cross, by Muintir na Tíre, feiseanna, Comhdhála, Macra na Feirme, rugby clubs, soccer clubs, agricultural shows <Col N="921" /> and towns improvement associations. The dance that is run by the agricultural show committee is one of the big dances of the year in Moate.  The experience of people in running dances, particularly since the war, has been this: when they hired the hall they discovered that the hire of it had increased since pre-war days and during the war, and that the cost of the band had gone up by at least 100 per cent. They sat at the door and collected the charge and found, in cases where they had honestly paid the dance tax, that they had little or nothing left in aid of the worthy object for which the dance was organised.</P>
    <P>In 1946, when the then Minister for Finance abolished that tax, it was regarded as one of the most popular things that he had done, and tributes were paid to him from every side of this House.  When it was restored by the previous Government the people who supported the Coalition appealed to the then Minister for Finance not to put on the tax.  He modified it somewhat, and did not put on the tax in towns of under 500 of a population.  But that did not meet the public requests or public opinion which favoured the continuation of dances without the tax because in the main, these dances were organised to help the worthy objects of such organisations as the Red Cross and towns improvements associations.  Nobody, I think, will deny that the objects of these associations that I have enumerated are very worthy ones.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, when you make an analysis of the number of these halls, in contrast with the others, and examine the gross sum involved, you will see that the remission of the tax goes to the benefit of those people. In the case of the privately-owned dance halls, they are hired out by these associations that I have mentioned. Therefore, I submit that the remission of the tax in these cases will benefit the clubs and organisations which hire these halls in Dublin or wherever they may exist.  I think the Minister did a very good day's work when he abolished the dance tax.  He certainly has the support and approbation of every G.A.A. man throughout the country of every promoter of a <Col N="922" /> coursing club and of every other organisation that I have mentioned.</P>

I do not see anything wrong in that. They were making a case for a reduction of the beer tax, the hat went round and they gave it.  I would not accuse them of doing anything wrong in that.  I want to say, in conclusion, to Deputy O'Higgins that his organisation, as well as my own, has benefited very much by these dance halls. They have run dances in all these places that I have mentioned to get <Col N="923" /> funds.  If the dance tax were continued they would cease to run these dances.</P>

      <P>That is not my objection to this section and it is not the objection of the Labour Party to this section.  My objection to the remission of the tax on dancing is that it is ludicrous.  It is an insult to the people of this country to remit a tax yielding £140,000 per annum in respect of dancing and at the same time to reduce food subsidies substantially. That is the main objection to the section.  We all know that £140,000 is a very small amount in relation to the total bill this country has to pay this year.  Nevertheless, I suggest that this £140,000 could be used by the Minister for Finance for the relief of people who will be severely hit when the reduction of the food subsidies comes into effect on 4th July next.  I suggest to the Minister that this £140,000 which he proposes to remit would, during every year, enable a non-contributory widow's pension to be paid to a widow without a child at the age of 42 rather that at 48, the age at which she receives it at present.  I suggest that that would be a substantial relief to the widows of this country who, ordinarily, would be entitled to a non-contributory widow's pension and who, at the same time, have to wait until they reach the age of 48 before they receive it.  That information was gleaned here on Friday last from the Minister for Social Welfare. I asked him how much it would cost to reduce that age of qualification for a non-contributory widow's pension from 48 to 45 years and he said that it would cost £80,000.  If, therefore, we take that as the figure, it would mean that that same non-contributory widow's pension could be paid to a widow at 42 or 43 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no evidence that what Deputy MacBride says is correct but I am quite sure the Minister for Finance can correct it if it is wrong.  An assertion has been made that this £140,000 would give a substantial increase to those in receipt of military service pensions&mdash;an <Col N="925" /> increase of 25 per cent.  Would it not, therefore, be more equitable that that £140,000 should be devoted to the relief of that type of person and to the people who are qualified or who would be qualified to receive a non-contributory widow's pension than that the tax should be remitted?</P>
    <P>I was not impressed by the arguments put up by the Minister and by Deputy Cowan.  In normal circumstances I should be prepared to consider and to argue the merits and demerits of a dance tax.  This Budget has been described by all sides as harsh and severe and, in these circumstances, it is ludicrous to remit a tax yielding £140,000.  I do not suggest that the whole of that £140,000 will go to the dance-hall proprietors.  Deputy Dillon was slightly awry, to be kind to him, when he suggested that 140 dance-hall proprietors would each get £1,000.  I do not think that argument would get us anywhere.  It is distributed not alone over the dance-hall proprietors but over all the different associations to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred.  It was not a harsh tax.  It did not break the political clubs, the political associations, the football clubs, the camogie clubs, Muintir na Tíre or any of the committees of agriculture. It is a contribution that could well be made during this year and next year and probably during the following years to help to relieve people who are not in a sound position to provide for themselves adequately in view of the other impositions that are contained in the Budget.  I want to make that point clear.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in what happened between a certain lady and a certain gentleman of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the promise of a subscription.  Neither am I interested in the allegation which the Minister for Finance makes against Deputy MacBride in respect of the greyhound racing industry.  I and my Party are concerned only with the fact that a tax yielding a sum of £140,000 is being remitted to associations and certain private individuals whilst at the same time other proposals in the Budget compel people to pay very steep increases in the price of foodstuffs and <Col N="926" /> other things which they use from day to day.</P>

      <P>The various elaborate and rather fantastic explanations given by the Minister for Finance to justify his action in proposing the removal of the tax on dancing and the handing over of £140,000 to the ballroom proprietors will not deceive anybody in this country.  The main argument which the Minister used in his Budget statement was that dancing was the only form of entertainment in respect of which those who participate actively are taxed.  He waxed eloquent because all-in wrestlers who are engaged in all-in wrestling are not taxed.  If the Minister felt so keenly about the injustice of not taxing all-in wrestlers, why, at a time when he is <Col N="927" /> in search of money, did he not impose a tax on all-in wrestlers?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a perfectly ludicrous and fantastic example for the Minister to take.  You might as well say that all taxes have to be of universal application in respect of all commodities.  May I advert to the attacks he launched on me in relation to greyhound racing as a typical example of the lack of logic in the Minister's arguments?  There is a tax levied on all people who attend greyhound racing.  They pay an admission tax.  There is no similar tax imposed on people who attend horse-racing meetings.  They can get in without paying a tax.  On the basis of the same line of reasoning as that adopted by the Minister, horse racing should be taxed or greyhound racing should be relieved of the tax which it now has to provide for the revenue.</P>
      <P>The simple fact of the case is that at a time when the Government, and the Minister in particular, are declaring that the State is bankrupt, that they must raise revenue by increasing the price of all essential foodstuffs, that they must economise by cutting down even Gaeltacht services, he deprives himself of £140,000 of revenue.</P>
      <P>We used in this House to talk, particularly at Budget time, in millions, in hundreds of thousands of pounds, without very often appreciating the value of money.  It is probably inevitable, when the House is considering Estimates for substantial amounts, that one talks rather glibly about £500,000, or £250,000 or £100,000.  This £140,000 is quite a substantial sum.  It could have avoided some of the cuts on Gaeltacht services or some of the cuts on afforestation.  It could have provided a substantial increase in the pensions of all Old I.R.A. men.  It could have provided 1,000 scholarships of £140 each for primary school children.  It could have provided at least 50 first-class halls for the Gaeltacht or rural areas about which the Parliamentary Secretary was so eloquent a few minutes ago.</P>

      <Col N="928" /> In a state of affairs where the Government was seeking to remit taxation, was seeking to benefit the taxpayers in some way because it had more revenue than it required, I could quite well understand the merits or demerits of the dance tax being discussed although, even in those circumstances, I think a benevolent Government might find a better objective for its benevolence than the ballroom proprietors.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance and the Government are living in a fool's paradise if they think for one moment that the public have any illusions as to the reason why this tax was removed. I think the public have formed their own conclusion and will find it very hard to believe that the removal of this tax was not connected with the correspondence which has been read and which is on the record of this House between the Minister's Party and the Ballroom Proprietors' Association and with the subscriptions which, presumably, the Minister's Party received to fight the last general election.</P>
    <P>The Minister has further weakened his case by resorting to the rather familiar tactic of trying to justify himself by throwing mud all round him. The letter which I wrote to Mr. O'Donoghue on 10th November, 1947, was already the subject matter of the Minister's mud-slinging activities in the 1948 general election.</P>

      <P>At that time several columns of the Minister's newspaper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> were filled with speeches and letters by the Minister in regard to that letter.  The clear suggestion was made that I and my Party were guilty of some improper conduct.  The letter which the Minister referred to but which he was careful not to read the other day in the House was the subject of many speeches by the Minister and many letters.  I think that letter compares extremely favourably with the correspondence which is on the record of this House.  It is, in effect, I think, a model of the type of letter which a public representative should write when he is approached by a substantial body of citizens who have a <Col N="929" /> grievance to air.  But, in those days, the Minister launched his attacks, launched them with the help of his Party paper, on the basis of that letter and the first title that appeared in the columns of the <i>Irish Press</i> over speeches made by the Minister in connection with that letter was, in heavy black type: &ldquo;Is this corruption?&rdquo;&ldquo;Is this corruption?&rdquo;  As I said, I think there is no comparison between the statement I made in 1947 in regard to the greyhound industry in the country and the Government's behaviour in this particular matter.</P>
      <P>I think it would be well for the records of the House if I read this letter in full.  The Minister carefully refrained from reading it.  It is dated 10th November, 1947&mdash;when there was no general election pending:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have gone into the question of the disabilities imposed upon the greyhound industry as thoroughly as I could in the short time available to me.  The following appear to me to be the relevant factors:</P>
      <P>(a)  The breeding and training of greyhounds has become an important industry which is of special benefit in that it is diffused throughout the whole countryside and of benefit to the farmers and the agricultural worker alike.</P>
      <P>(b)  The export of greyhounds amounts to approximately £1,000,000 per annum.  This establishes the importance of the industry from an international trade point of view.</P>
      <P>(c)  The yield from the tax on greyhound racing for the financial year 1945/46 brought in only £19,000 to the Exchequer.  The net yield of the tax when the cost of collection has been deducted must be small.</P>
      <P>(d)  In comparison, the tax accruing from dances brought in £54,000 in the financial year 1945/46.  This tax has since been taken off.</P>
      <P>(e)  There is no tax on horse racing, football or dancing.  Neither football nor dancing contributes anything to the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Having regard to the foregoing factors, I can see no basis for penalising the greyhound industry by imposing upon it a tax which results in such a small yield.  I always think in such matters it is well to examine the position on the basis of principle. In relation to a tax, the guiding principle in my view should be that the tax should primarily be imposed on that section of the community best able to bear it.  Applying that principle to horse racing and to the greyhound industry, I can see no justification for penalising the greyhound industry.  Greyhound racing is essentially the poor man's sport.  It is an industry which brings diffused profits to the rural community. It is an industry that is of value to the national economy.  Not merely is horse racing untaxed, but it has been heavily subsidised out of public funds at the expense of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Who is best able to bear taxation? Those who attend horse racing or those who attend greyhound racing? The owners and trainers of racehorses or the greyhound breeders? The answer to those two questions leaves no room for doubt as to which of these groups are best able to bear taxation.  For those reasons I can see no justification under present circumstances for the tax on greyhound racing.  Likewise, I can see no justification for differentiating between horse racing and greyhound racing in relation to totalisators.  If greyhound racing is taxed on the basis that it comes under the heading of entertainment why then are dances and games not taxed?  Owing to the tendency to approach questions of this nature for the purpose of currying support at the elections, I thought it best to set out the principles and the facts which influenced me in giving you my views on the subject.  I think these principles and facts must coerce any fair-minded person to the same conclusion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stand over every word of that letter. I see no reason why greyhound racing. properly regarded as a form of sport, should be subject to a tax which is <Col N="931" /> not imposed on those who can afford to drive down to the Curragh in motor cars or those who can afford to go to horse racing at other centres.  However, let me make it quite clear that I do not for one moment suggest that at a time when the Government finds it necessary to raise revenue by increasing the price of bread, butter, tea, sugar and other commodities the tax on greyhound racing should be removed.  That should be done only at a time when the Government finds itself in a position to make some tax remissions.  It is quite obvious that in present circumstances, the present Government does not consider itself in a position to make any remission of taxation.  On the contrary it has been shouting &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo; right, left and centre, in justification of its policy in removing the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has availed of the occasion of the discussion on this matter to make, under the privilege of this House, a great many personal attacks, not merely on myself but on persons who are not members of this House.  He has availed of it on this occasion to attack by name not merely Mr. Patrick O'Donoghue but also to make suggestions against his children and the members of his family.  Mr. O'Donoghue's record in the affairs of this country and in the struggle for the independence of the country compares favourably with that of the Minister. The Minister should be the last person to make personal attacks on other people's families.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="932" /> taken the opportunity to attack a man who has made valuable sacrifices for the country.  Possibly the Minister might have been well advised to discuss this matter with his own leader, the Taoiseach, before making these attacks. He might have learned that the Taoiseach had other opinions of Mr. O'Donoghue and that the Taoiseach not so very long ago, sent for Mr. O'Donoghue.  He might have learned that Mr. O'Donoghue was the person who was instrumental in rescuing the Taoiseach from Lincoln Jail.  Is there an explanation of these personal attacks?  Is the Minister going to apologise for them?  Is he at any time going to acquire some sense of responsibility in discharging the responsibilities of his office in this House?  The Minister himself knows Mr. O'Donoghue.  If I am not mistaken he on many occasions wrote to him letters, beginning &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo;.  If I am not mistaken the Minister on many occasions importuned Mr. O'Donoghue for subscriptions for his own election expenses.  Is it because Mr. O'Donoghue refused to subscribe to his election fund that this House is now to be made a medium for attacks on Mr. O'Donoghue?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy MacBride's philosophy with regard to public affairs and public life.  The Deputy professes to be profoundly annoyed because the Minister brought to the notice of the House a certain transaction of his in regard to dog <Col N="935" /> track operations.  I do not want to go into this matter.  I am determined in this section to concentrate upon this section of the Finance Bill and to deal with the remission of the dance tax provided for in the Bill.  I cannot understand why there is such uproar from the Opposition because certain concessions are being given in this section to the poorer section of the community.  Who are the people who will benefit by this remission of taxation?  They fall under two headings: the young people who frequent dance halls for a little enjoyment in the city and in the large towns and the parochial clubs throughout the country who organise dances for beneficial and charitable purposes in their areas.  So far as the young people are concerned, they do not belong to the richer sections of the community.  Deputy MacBride said that dog racing is the poor man's entertainment.  I have never been there, but I am told that a great many fivers and tenners change hands at this dog racing.  We do not see many fivers or tenners change hands in the dance halls.  There you find young boys and girls enjoying themselves for a few hours.  They are people of very limited means.  They are boys who are serving their time perhaps, girls who work in offices and shops and who get very scanty remuneration.  Under this section these people are being offered some small concession.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish says these people will not get 1d. of it.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the net result of this remission must be a reduction in the charges for admission to dance halls owned by dance-hall proprietors.  I have reason to believe that the various associations who organise dances may not reduce their charges as a result of this tax remission. They may thereby benefit by the remission and in that way benefit <Col N="936" /> many useful causes.  Do Opposition Deputies object to organisations like the young farmers' clubs or Muintir na Tíre or any of these beneficial local organisations obtaining a certain benefit from this remission and thereby adding to their funds which they are using for the uplifting of our people? Do they object to the young boys and girls in the cities and towns and wherever there are privately-owned dance halls obtaining that small benefit through this remission of taxation?  Is it their policy&mdash;it would appear to be &mdash;that we ought to encourage drinking rather than dancing?  Do they believe it is better for the young people to go into the public-houses rather than into the dance halls?  Twelve months ago the leaders of the Opposition were thumping their chests in an attempt to show the world their loyalty to the Bishops and to the Catholic Church. Do we not all know that the Bishops have condemned the increase in the consumption of alcoholic liquor and the growing intemperance throughout the country?

At first he wore a malicious grin on his rather pugnacious countenance.  As the Minister proceeded to unfold the operations between &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; and Deputy MacBride the malicious grin disappeared and was replaced by an angry scowl.  Before very long we had Deputy Dillon on his feet howling, yowling and spitting like a cat with its tail caught under a door.  There was no fun for <Col N="937" /> him in the operations the Minister was unfolding to the House.  He and his colleagues were shown up as utterly insincere in trying to make political capital without having any reasonable case. The name of a certain lady was mentioned <i>ad nauseam</i> in this debate.  It was only right that the Minister should offset that by producing to the House the very affectionate correspondence that passed between Deputy MacBride and &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo;.  But &ldquo;Dear Paddy&rdquo; and the secretary of the Ballroom Proprietors' Association were only trotting after the distinguished Christy Reddin who did not put any of his transactions on paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>People sometimes find a difficulty in listening to the truth. The truth must be told.  In opposing the remission of this dance tax Deputy O'Higgins is opposing something that is desirable.  We all want to see well-conducted dance halls throughout the country.  We want to see them run as they should be run.  Deputy O'Higgins and his colleagues want to see the young people drinking in the public-houses. They want more and more drinking and less and less dancing. <Col N="938" /> That is the policy they are openly preaching now in defiance of the teachings of the Irish Hierarchy.</P>
      <P>There is an existing evil that needs to be emphasised.  When it was decided by the Coalition Government to reimpose the dance tax strong representations were made to that Government that the imposition of that tax in the rural areas was very undesirable inasmuch as it was making it virtually impossible for dancing to survive.  As a result of those representations the tax was remitted in towns and villages with a population of less than 500 people.  We have all experienced the difficulties in getting a true estimate of population.  We know that populations vary from census to census.</P>
      <P>Apart from all that, there is evil in relation to the remission that was given.  Any publican in a rural area can increase his income by building a dance hall adjacent to his public-house. In areas within reasonable distance of an urban centre of population many such halls have been erected.  These dance halls are in a rural area and benefit by the remission but they are not there for the benefit of the rural population.  Wealthy people from the cities, the spivs and the children of spivs, and other wealthy sections of the community frequent these dance halls because they can get there and home again in their motor cars.  They can get all the liquor they want.  Steps are frequently taken to exclude the rustic population from these centres of amusement inasmuch as the charge for admission is usually so high as to render dancing for the rural community prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a growing evil under the concession which was made in relation to the rural areas.  The only method of solving that difficulty is to remit the tax entirely and give the few pounds or the few shillings back to the young people who attend these dances or to the local associations that run them for the benefit of the local community. Some people may say the concession is not worth while.  We must remember that the young people who are the backbone of the dancing industry are in the main people with very limited <Col N="939" /> incomes.  They may be agricultural workers, farmers' sons or junior civil servants.  The few shillings that are handed back as a result of this remission will be of benefit to them and will to some extent offset the increased contribution they will have to make because of the increased tobacco tax.</P>
    <P>These young people do not go in for drinking to any great extent.  It seems to me that the guiding motive behind the opposition to the remission of this tax is jealousy on the part of sour-faced old politicians of the young boys and girls of to-day.  They envy the young people their youth and their romance.  They forget that they were young themselves once.  They feel that while it was all right for them to enjoy themselves while they were young, the young people of to-day should be deprived of any enjoyment except what they can be got in local public-houses.</P>

      <P>I have not heard many young people opposing the remission of this tax, but I have heard grizzly old sour faces denounce it bitterly. The only reason I can see why they are denouncing the remission of the tax is that they begrudge to see the young people of Ireland enjoy themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see Deputy Corish reprimand Deputy Dillon for his gross exaggeration in regard to the effects of this remission.  Deputy Dillon suggested that there were 140 dance-hall proprietors, and that they would each receive £1,000.  Deputy Corish, of course, did not accept that at all, because he knows that the dance halls all over the country are owned by various associations and committees. He knew that the real beneficiaries of this remission will be clubs who organise and run dances for public or amusement purposes and, of course, for the young people who enjoy those dances.  I think that Deputy Dillon was in a rather bad mood when he opened this debate on Friday last.  He was just after being severely castigated <Col N="940" /> by his new Party Whip for being late for the operation &ldquo;beer barrel&rdquo; which was staged for 10.30 on Friday morning.  Apart from personal abuse and ridicule, Deputy Dillon made no case whatsoever against the remission of this tax.  His suggestion that all this money will go into the pockets of the dance-hall proprietors is, of course, too ludicrous to be accepted by anybody. I do not think anyone would seriously suggest that it is only the rich who enjoy dances&mdash;that dancing is one of those great luxuries which only the rich can enjoy.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy, I think, said that dog racing was the poor man's sport.  I thing that, to a great extent, dancing is a form of amusement which is greatly enjoyed by young working men and young working girls.  Therefore, I think it is only right that some small concession should be made to them. The people who will benefit by this remission are the young people attending dances, those who are not old enough to receive the increase in the old age pensions which is being provided in the Budget, and unmarried people who will not benefit by the increase in the children's allowances.  In this section, a small concession is being made to those young people.  As I have said, the sour-faced old kill-joys of Fine Gael begrudge the young people this small concession.  I wonder do people realise that, when Deputy Dillon was a member of the Fine Gael Party before, it withered and dwindled and became so small that they threw him out.</P>

      <P>For some time last Friday, and for a considerable time to-day, Deputy Dillon set a new headline for his Party from which he was evicted for trying to get Dublin, Limerick and Waterford blitzed.  He is seeking now to forget that he was thrown out for that dastardly operation, and for advocating such a policy. He is seeking now to lead the Fine Gael Party again from the extreme end of the Front Bench.  He tells them that their line in regard to this section is <Col N="941" /> to concentrate on filthy abuse of that small section of the community which happens to own dance halls in this city, I presume.  By building his case against the remission of the tax on abuse of that section of the community, he thinks that is good Party propaganda&mdash;now that he is in the Party. I think he will realise, and if he does not his newly found friends or colleagues will realise that the people of Ireland have a little bit more common sense and a little bit more intelligence than to be deceived by that kind of propaganda.</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland know that dancing for young people is better than drinking, and that we have all over the country well run dance halls which have been established in our towns with over 500 of a population.  These dance halls cater not only for the provincial and urban centres, but also for the rural areas which surround those towns in which these dance halls have been established.  These halls are of immense value to our young people.  They provide a means of enjoyment and entertainment for them, much better enjoyment than they would be likely to obtain elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We know that social workers who want to uplift our people are advocating the building of more halls for our young people&mdash;better halls which will be better equipped and provided with every amenity.  With the remission of this tax there will, I suggest, be more money available for those beneficial purposes.  The local associations will have more money to spend on the provision of bigger and better halls for our young people.  Is not that a desirable purpose?  Is not that what we should aim at rather than follow the grizzly kill-joys of Fine Gael, who denounce all form of amusement for the young and recommend only one type of enjoyment&mdash;that is the type of enjoyment which can be obtained by getting totally drunk?</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Cogan's contribution to this debate, it is perfectly obvious that he has not yet recovered from the indigestion which he suffered 12 months ago.  His reference here to Deputies who have contributed to this debate was, to put it mildly, in extremely bad taste.  It is rather amusing to find that a Minister, who shares in some way Deputy Cogan's propensity for language a little bit distasteful, should have this proposition supported by two guardian angels, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, one from the left-hand side and one from the right-hand side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to pass this section because of arguments advanced not by the Fianna Fáil Party, with one notable exception with which I shall deal later&mdash;they have remained very silent on this proposition&mdash;but by Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, one speaking from the left-hand side and the other speaking from the right-hand side.  I do not intend to follow the arguments advanced by these two gentlemen in any detail.  I should like to discuss this section as reasonably as it is possible to discuss it in this House.  I think that any Deputy in the House will agree that it is not possible to discuss a proposal such as this without considering the entire background of the Budget which contains this proposal for exemption.  In order to consider whether the exemption is justified, one cannot divorce from <Col N="943" /> one's mind the framework of the Finance Bill in which this exemption proposal is contained.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary, on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, to refer to other sections in which taxation is imposed.  It is important to remember that under Section 14 of the Bill the Minister is asking the House to relieve from a tax liability of almost £150,000 a certain section of the community and at the same time is imposing very severe burdens on the community generally and particularly on the poorer section.  The poorer section&mdash;as well as the rich, of course&mdash; find that under the financial proposals which are being given legal effect to in this Bill, their foodstuffs are taxed and other impositions are imposed upon them.  That is the background to Section 14 under which the Minister becomes the fairy godmother of the &ldquo;Scala&rdquo; and other ballrooms throughout the country.  One must approach the consideration of whether or not this proposal is justified from that point of view.  Approaching it from that point of view, when we find that the people are being asked to bear, whether with justification or otherwise, very heavy burdens, we must look with suspicion on any proposal to exempt a particular section of the community while all the remaining sections are taxed.  I think it is right that we should regard it with that suspicion.  If the Deputies on the left-hand side of the Chair were free to think and free to talk, I am certain that they would agree with me that this proposal is a proposal which, in present circumstances, should be very carefully examined and very rigorously inquired into before it is acceded to.  Now, applying a careful examination to the Minister's proposal to wipe out the dance tax, as I think we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Applying, as I think we should, a searching examination to this proposal, there are certain aspects from which we should discuss it.  If, despite the stunting of Deputy Cowan, the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, were able to say to this House: &ldquo;This tax is uneconomic. It does not yield a revenue commensurate with the cost of the staff which is employed in its collection&rdquo;&mdash;if the Minister were able to make that case &mdash;then perhaps fair-minded Deputies such as Deputy Cowan could with justification say that despite the taxes imposed on the community, including Deputy Cowan's own constituents, in relation to their food, obviously it could not be allowed to stand.</P>
      <P>It is clear to anyone who listened to the Minister's Budget statement, which he was reading from the official brief prepared by his Department, and speaking as the Minister for Finance in this country&mdash;therefore, speaking deliberately and with responsibility, an unusual rôle for the Minister&mdash;that his reason for abolishing this tax was not the difficulty of collecting it and was not the small revenue which it yielded.  In referring to the exempting of the dance-hall proprietors from entertainments duty&mdash;mind you, it is the dance-hall proprietors and only the dance-hall proprietors who benefit from this exemption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I propose to show the House very shortly, the Minister, in Volume 130, No. 8, column 1147, is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am proposing a concession as regards entertainments duty.  Dancing has been the victim of varying fortune in this regard.  The duty on entertainments was first imposed in 1916 but payments for the right to take part in dances did not come within its scope until 1932.  In 1946 the tax, as applied to these payments, <Col N="945" /> was abolished, but was restored by my predecessor in 1949. Dancing is the only amusement which is discriminated against by levying a tax on active participants as distinct from spectators.  I have never been quite convinced that the discrimination was justified by any social purpose and I propose to abolish it altogether as from the 1st August next.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I think that it was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance who, in 1932, included dancing within the scope of the duty on entertainments. According to the Minister it was in 1932 that it first came within the scope of the tax.  In the quotation which I have just read out, the Minister, speaking with responsibility, declared that his reason for abolishing the tax was not the difficulty of collecting it, was not the small revenue which it yielded, was not any of the reasons that have been hastily thought up during this debate by his two guardian angels, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, but was because it was a tax on entertainment which was imposed upon the participants of the entertainment. The Minister says: &ldquo;I have never been quite convinced that the discrimination&rdquo;&mdash;which, he postulated, existed&mdash;&ldquo;was justified by any social purpose...&rdquo;  That, for good or evil, was the reason advanced by the Minister for remitting this tax.  It was a tax on participants and the only form of entertainment tax that reflected itself on those who participated in the entertainment.</P>
    <P>Since this is the Minister's proposal, we must examine it from the point of view of the reasons given by the Minister in support of it.  He says that because it is a tax on the participants we must wipe it out.  I must admit that I find it difficult to understand the Minister's reasoning in that respect.  I would have thought that in relation to most taxes&mdash;not all&mdash; but most taxes on entertainments to a certain extent participants have to bear the tax because, if they did not participate, no tax would be levied. In relation to taxation on beer, tobacco and cigarettes, which constitutes taxation on entertainments. <Col N="946" /> the only way the tax comes to be levied in the long run is by a person either drinking or smoking.  The same thing applies to horse racing&mdash;I am not sure whether taxation still exists&mdash;the tax falls on a winning bet.</P>
    <P>That is the reason the Minister puts forward for wiping out this tax. Approaching it from that point of view, the House will have to remember that over the period of 14 years, from 1932 to 1946, this dance tax was imposed and maintained by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It was removed by them in 1946 and restored by their successors in 1946.  During that entire period no one ever suggested as a reason for abolishing the dance tax that it was unfair on individual dancers because everyone realised&mdash; and I am sure Deputy Cogan should realise, if he ever went to a dance&mdash; that the dance tax, while it may have been intended to be a tax imposed on the individual participant, in fact is not such.  Every single dance nowadays advertises a ticket inclusive of tax and every single person who goes to the dance pays a sum which includes the tax.  Remove the tax that it is being sought to remove here and the 5/- dance ticket still remains 5/- and the 1/6 goes to the promoters of the dance.</P>

      <P>I am talking of the days when he gladly danced.  He will recollect that the ticket he bought, to which the tax applied, was a ticket inclusive of tax.  He should be able to <Col N="947" /> recollect that in 1946, when the dance tax was removed&mdash;I think the Minister for External Affairs was then Minister for Finance&mdash;the admission price to dances remained exactly the same. There was no reduction in the price that the young boy or girl that Deputy Cogan referred to had to pay.  They had to pay exactly the same.  A 5/- ticket remained 5/-.  The tax on a 5/- ticket is just 1/6.  That 1/6 went to the revenue of the dance; it went to the promoters of that dance, whether or not they were the owners of the dance-hall, running the dance for commercial purposes&mdash;as many dances are run at the moment.  In this city and throughout the country, in all population centres, there are commercially-owned dance halls in which the owners on all the popular dates promote and run dances and entertainments for their own profit, which they are perfectly entitled to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will inform the Minister for Finance of some of the tax exemptions that he is presiding over as head of the Department of Finance.  There is not a single educational association, charitable association, young farmers' club or any of these bodies that is liable to any dance tax, good, bad or indifferent, provided it does not run the entertainment on businesslike lines or spend more than 20 per cent. of the receipts in relation to expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before my attention was deflected by Deputy Cowan, I was dealing with the suggestion made by Deputy Cogan that the Minister for Finance, by wiping out the dance tax, will confer a benefit on people who attend dances. Deputy Cogan may derive some solace from that belief; it may ease his political conscience but other Deputies, particularly old hoary Fine Gael <Col N="948" /> Deputies like myself, who, according to Deputy Cogan, apparently, have no experience of ordinary mundane matters, can assert that the people who attend dances will derive no benefit, good, bad or indifferent, from this tax exemption.  In view of that fact, the reason advanced by the Minister for the removal of this tax, namely, that it is a tax on participants, cannot be regarded as a sound reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister's defenders have not confined themselves to Deputy Cogan's absurd proposition.  They have come along to say: &ldquo;Let us forget all about the dance-hall proprietors.  What about the young farmers' clubs?  What about the Gaelic Athletic Association that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare was talking about?  What about the different associations and country halls?  Will they not get a benefit?&rdquo; If one could accept that, I am quite certain one could vote for this tax exemption, despite the fact that it is an exemption in a Budget that taxes food, with an easy mind, at least, with an easier mind than one might otherwise have in voting for that proposition.</P>
    <P>Here are the facts: The dance tax that it is now proposed to abolish is a tax which applies only in centres where the population exceeds 500. The small country hall that the Parliamentary Secretary was talking about, even if it is run for commercial purposes, is not taxed.  The people who go to dances there are not taxed in relation to their entertainment.  In the entire countryside there is not a single hall, big or small, that under existing legislation has to pay any dance tax.  That is fact No. 1.</P>
    <P>We find the Parliamentary Secretary reading out a list of 23 small dance halls in his constituency.  He should remember that these particular halls, if they are in rural areas, are not liable to taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said it before on public platforms and I repeat it now, that one of the troubles of the Minister is that he has never been outside Dublin since he came up here.  A centre with a population of 500 under Fianna Fáil is a centre of a fairly considerable size, and if we do not get rid of them quickly, we shall have far fewer centres with populations of 500. The fact is that this entertainments tax is a tax which is applicable to the larger population centres throughout <Col N="950" /> the country; the tax does not affect to any substantial degree the rural population.  I mention that because of the references to smaller halls.  In fact, this is a matter about which one could have two points of view.  I have a definite view myself.  Under existing legislation the maintenance of dance tax exemptions for the countryside has substantially benefited rural areas.  That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but the fact is that the entertainments tax code, in relation to dances, as reimposed in 1949 and maintained for the last three years, substantially benefited halls in the countryside.  Employment has been given, and quite a considerable amount of money has been made available because of the exemption granted to centres with a population of 500 or lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, having referred to small halls, as he called them, went on to talk about the type of association or organisation that might run these dances.  He mentioned the young farmers' clubs and other bodies of a sporting or educational kind that might get together to run dances.  That is a very cogent argument but it is not a new argument.  It is an argument that was made in the British House of Commons in 1916, when it was first decided to impose duties on entertainments.  Members of the House of Commons spoke, as the Parliamentary Secretary has spoken, with regard to charitable and philanthropic organisations, educational bodies and associations of that kind, that were not profit-making&mdash;young men or women who organised balls, as they called them in those days, and they asked what was going to happen them.  A case was made for exemption which was then incorporated in the Finance (New Duties) Act of 1916, which is still part of our taxation legislation. Under Section 1, sub-section (5) of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, care is taken to provide that any entertainment promoted by a charitable or philanthropic organisation, educational body or an entertainment provided by any group formed for educational or scientific purposes, such as young farmers' organisations, will not be liable to pay the entertainments <Col N="951" /> tax provided there is no profit-making of a personal kind involved in the promotion of the entertainment and provided the expenses do not exceed 20 per cent.  So when we find the Parliamentary Secretary advancing as a reason for abolishing the tax the hardships which it might have on certain organisations, already exempt from the application of the tax, we have got to wonder what is the real case that can be made or is supposed to be made for this exemption.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have heard from the Minister's side of the House&mdash;and I include supporters from the left and right&mdash;any cogent reason advanced as to why this tax should be remitted. Of course, there could not be any reason.  There could not be any argument.</P>

      <P>Under the Budget. If Deputy Allen and other Deputies on the opposite side think that they are going to make me forget what these financial proposals contain, and what they involve for the people, they are making a real mistake.  The fact is that no argument has been or could be advanced by any Deputy as to why the dance tax should be wiped out.  I endeavoured to discuss this proposal from a reasonable point of view, and being as anxious as ever I could to help the Minister, Deputy Allen and Deputy Cowan if there was any reason that could commend this tax exemption to Deputies of the House, I would appreciate it.  I do not think there is.  Even if we could forget the hardship imposed by the Budget and by the Finance Bill, I think the proposal to exempt dancing from entertainment duty is an unsound one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> It is extraordinary how a bad case will drive one to advance a fantastic argument.  I found myself sympathising as a barrister with Deputy Cogan when he was eventually driven to saying: &ldquo;The Bishops of Ireland are against drinking and this will prevent people from drinking and compel them to dance.&rdquo;  I always thought that one of the concerns of many of the organisations which Deputy Cogan mentioned has been to get on to the good side of the parish priest in order to get permission to have a dance.  I do not think that that argument will commend itself to the intelligence of the House.  Although I have endeavoured to help the Minister, I am afraid I am driven to the conclusion that there is something else behind Section 14 other than arguments that should appeal to responsible and intelligent Deputies.  I was impressed, I must say, by Deputy Cowan.  He is a great old campaigner. In the last Dáil, Deputy Cowan was the first into the breach to defend Deputy McGilligan from the assaults of the present Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was always available to defend Deputy Dillon from the snapping of Deputy Cogan.  Deputy Cowan has always been ready to step into the breach to defend anyone and to advance any argument; it does not matter very much what the argument may be. Deputy Cowan said the people were talking about the dance tax.  Do you not remember the last Dáil and a former Deputy who was concerned with the effect of the dance tax, a former Deputy who was a member of an important portion of the inter-Party Government? I had great sympathy for Deputy Cowan and I felt that he was doing his best for the unfortunate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us remember the dance tax being reimposed in 1949.  There was a shriek all over the corridors of this House that the Government was going to fall.  Fianna Fáil stepped into the breech straight away and said: &ldquo;Now, lads, we have them.  Now we will get Deputy Cowan's Clann na Poblachta Party and we will be able to drive <Col N="953" /> them out of the Government.&rdquo;  The present Tánaiste saw what he thought were the opportunities and put down a proposal to oppose the reimposition of the tax.  Unfortunately for the Tánaiste and the present Minister for Finance they were dealing with a Government which could not be bought.  Despite the opposition that Deputy Cowan referred to from a person who was then a Deputy, despite the pressure brought on the then Minister for Finance, that tax was passed into law with the vote of Deputy Cowan, with the vote of Deputy Cowan and with the vote of other Independent Deputies now supporting the Government.</P>

We are now examining the naïve proposal of the Minister for Finance that for some reason unascertainable we should reverse the decision of the House last year and in previous years and suddenly lift the tax off the dance-hall proprietors.  It is the dance-hall proprietors, the people who own commercial dance halls, who are designed to be benefited by this tax exemption.  No reason has been advanced to commend this exemption on its merits.  I suppose, however, it will be passed because of the two guardian angels of the Minister, but not on its merits.  Its merits have not been established.  It will be passed because for the time being the Government have a majority of one or two, but we know that Section 14 was purchased out 12 months ago, bought by the hard cash of the proprietors of the dance halls.</P>

      <P>Of course, I will accept the decision of the people; I always do.  I wish I could recommend the same course to Deputy Cowan.  The fact, therefore, is that this House is being made the conduit pipe&mdash;I am not referring to the Minister for Finance &mdash;between the Fianna Fáil Party and a section outside this House to give them the benefit which they have purchased. That is something which may be understandable, as the Minister tries to say.  It may be quite understandable from a practical political point of view, as Deputy Cowan seems to think, but it is nevertheless a fact. Why have we this façade erected over a bit of Party bargaining of stupid, ridiculous, fantastic arguments advanced here by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, by Deputy Cowan on the left, and by Deputy Cogan on the quasi right?  Why are these arguments advanced when the fact remains that this section has been bought by the dance-hall proprietors and they are now being paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be in keeping with the honour, dignity and responsibility of this Parliament if this tax were not opposed as vigorously as it is possible for us to oppose it.  In normal times arguments might be advanced for the remission of this tax. I have endeavoured to find some such arguments, but even my powers of advocacy fail me in that respect as they have failed Deputy Captain Cowan and others.  It may be that in normal circumstances this House might sympathetically consider a plea by the <Col N="955" /> dance-hall proprietors for the abolition of this tax.  The House cannot be sympathetic in present circumstances when we know that these gentlemen did not make their case in a democratic manner to the representatives of the Irish nation but made them to the backroom boys of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has reminded me of that. <Col N="956" /> Twelve months ago this particular organisation that inhabits a premises in Mount Street and which has the support now of Deputy Captain Cowan made two promises to the electors. One promise was that they would maintain the existing food subsidies. The other was that they would remove the tax on dancing.  Undoubtedly, promise No.  I had an effect on Deputy Captain Cowan.  Promise No. 2 had an effect on the manner in which the last election was fought by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Now, 12 months later, we are looking at the dishonouring of promise No. 1, the maintenance of the existing food subsidies, and the honouring of promise No. 2 &mdash; the remission of the tax on dancing.  Fianna Fáil honoured their promise to the dance-hall proprietors and dishonoured their promise of cheap food to Deputy Captain Cowan's constituents.  We are quite satisfied&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Captain Cowan and other Deputies like him who are released from the care of Party and can give this subject their full consideration are quite satisfied&mdash; that the promise to the ballroom proprietors has been honoured because cash was exchanged, goods were given, a <i>quid pro quo</i> or a consideration passed.  On the other hand, the promise of cheap food to the poor people has not been honoured.  I cannot discuss that under this particular section but it is in these circumstances that the naïve Minister for Finance now proceeds to ask the House to remit this tax on dancing.</P>
      <P>He has not made a very good case and his supporters have done him no service in this debate.  It might be as well, if our consciences permit us, to forget this very sordid business as rapidly as possible.  This is just an example of a little bit of &ldquo;hokey pokey&rdquo; being found out.  This is just an example of one of the things that happened in Mount Street being shown up to the public gaze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fine Gael, and I am sure the same can be said of the other Parties on this side of the House, hope that the people will be afforded an opportunity very shortly of passing a verdict on this section of the Finance Bill.  Should that opportunity arise and should the <Col N="957" /> naïve Minister for Finance become the destructive Deputy MacEntee again he will be asked to vote for a proposal radically altering the exemption he now seeks to bring about in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that when one has a bad case one is driven to fantastic arguments to support that case.  I think it will be agreed that Deputy O'Higgins had a very bad case to make against the abolition of this tax and that he advanced fantastic arguments in support of it.  He told us the Government proposed to take the tax off dancing and put a tax on food.  Possibly the Deputy is repeating an election speech he made last Sunday when he told people down the country, where he assumed they would not know any better, that this Government was imposing taxes on food.  The Deputy should have some regard for the truth.  He would like to be looked upon as a responsible Deputy.  As far as it lies within his power, it is his duty to tell the people the truth on matters of public interest.</P>
      <P>This dance tax was first imposed by a Fianna Fáil Government, curiously enough, away back in 1932.  Its imposition was vigorously opposed at the time by no less a person than the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, amongst his misstatements in regard to the abolition of this tax, did not tell the House that in 1946 a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, in the Budget of that year, removed all taxes on dance halls in the country.  Their removal at that time was objected to by, amongst others, Deputy Dillon. He objected to their removal in 1946, but in 1949 he supported the then Minister for Finance in imposing one of the few new taxes which the Coalition Government dare impose.  They dare not impose any other than a dance tax because of their previous guarantees and commitments to vested interests outside this House.  Because of the large and munificent contributions which those vested interests made to the Fine Gael group in the Coalition, they dare not impose any tax other than a dance tax.  It was the only new tax which they imposed during their three years in office.  It is very peculiar that, in the year in which they did that, they reduced the income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts about the dance tax.  Deputy O'Higgins did not tell the <Col N="959" /> House about it then.  Neither did he tell the House that the leaders of the Fianna Fáil Party, when the dance tax was being reimposed in 1949, undertook that if the opportunity ever presented itself, they would remove that tax again.  This is the first opportunity which a Fianna Fáil Government has had since 1949 of carrying out that undertaking.  That is why the tax is now being removed.  It has been the considered opinion of this Government since 1946 that this is a tax which should not be in operation.  One of their main reasons for so thinking is all the fraud which took place because of its operation previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Numbers of the youth of the country were trained in fraud and in tax evasion.  It was one of the few laws in operation which probably brought more discredit than any other. It trained young people in the ways of fraud.  It did not matter what group organised a dance in the country, people set themselves out to evade the payment of this tax.  All types of fraud were committed over the years between 1932 and 1946, and that was the main reason why it was abolished in that year.  The revenue officers down the country who tried to carry out their duty by collecting it pointed that out time and again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil, Labour and many others were running dances. That happened, even in connection with dances which were run for charitable purposes.  Irrespective of what the object for which a dance was organised, the revenue was being defrauded. That kind of evasion went on and it was morally bad for the community in general.  The tax was in operation but it could not be properly collected.  The young people set themselves out to avoid paying it.  That, as I have said, was the main reason why the Minister for Finance in 1946 decided to remove it.  Representations had been made to him by members of <Col N="960" /> this Party, by the clergy and by the people down the country, that the continuance of the tax was undesirable. The matter was carefully considered and that is why it was removed.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government made a very grave mistake in reimposing the tax in 1949.  That decision of theirs created many serious problems in the country.  Even though the revenue is going to lose £140,000 a year, I think it is a wise move on the part of the Minister for Finance in this Finance Bill to remove this tax completely. Several anomalies have arisen since the reimposition of the tax in 1949.  It applies to towns with a population of 500 and over.  What has happened is that people have built dance halls on the outskirts of those towns.  In that way, they could avoid the payment of the tax.  In a town, say, where the population was 1,000 or 2,000 people, the dance tax was 1/6 on a 5/- ticket, but if the dance were held in a hall three miles outside that town, there was no dance tax.  I think that is a very undesirable state of affairs, and should not be allowed to continue.  It is far better to abolish it altogether.  We have no doubt, of course, that the abolition of the tax will be misrepresented all over the country.  There will be plenty of that misrepresentation in the rural areas during the next three weeks.  We fully appreciate that and we are prepared to meet it.  We also know, of course, that our people have plenty of common sense, and that they will accept the reasons as to why the Government are proposing to remove the tax.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Deputies of this House are as aware as I am that the most difficult period both for parents and for the young men concerned, their sons, is that period when they have left school and await the opportunity of securing their first employment.  During that period they are subject to all sorts of hazards, temptations and so on.  I felt that if I made an appeal, not alone to the young men but also to the parents, I might possibly secure some success.  I pointed out to the parents what life in the Army would provide for their sons&mdash;that it would take them off the streets, that it would provide a means of training them into disciplined young men who, in due course, could become a credit to the nation as good citizens.  At the same time, they would be built up both in body and mind, and I pointed out that, generally, as a result of the amenities which would be provided for them in the Army, their outlook would benefit. I do not mind saying that life in the Army such as I suggest for young men of the type to whom I was making the appeal, is almost the equivalent of life in a boarding-school.  They are provided <Col N="962" /> with all the amenities that a good boarding-school could provide&mdash; gymnasia, sports fields, games of every description, games which would go a long way towards building up the body as well as making the mind active.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the appeal which I made in that regard was to a very great extent successful.  We were looking for a figure of 4,500 men.  I am glad to be able to say that we are almost within 1,000 of that particular mark, even though we have, for a very considerable time past, abandoned the advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>The age which formerly prevailed was 18.  I was faced with the difficulty of finding ways and means to have that age reduced.  Formerly, the period of service was three years.  I felt that if we abandoned that period and made it two years it would, perhaps, make it a more attractive proposition.  The difficulty in regard to reducing the age to 17 years was overcome.  We were able to settle that.  The question of two years' service has also been settled.  The Army authorities would still like to have the three-year period. They felt, naturally, that they could turn out a better soldier in three years than they could in two years.  Personally, I am satisfied that, as most of these young recruits will be serving, in the main, in the infantry, two years is a satisfactory period for that type of service.  It might perhaps not be absolutely sufficient for training for, say, the artillery, but even there I am satisfied that with a concentrated course we could turn out very effective soldiers in that particular arm of the service in that period of time.  It does not mean that a young man is enlisted for two years.  He can enlist for a period of service of two years and of six years in the Reserve.  That was the scheme that I propounded and which I felt would be most attractive to the young men concerned.  We still have the old period, that is, three years' service and nine years in the Reserve.  Any young man who is anxious to join the Army can opt for either of these particular periods.  I think it is a very fine state of affairs for the parents of a young man such as I have described that they can send their boy into the Army of the Irish <Col N="963" /> nation and feel that morally, spiritually, physically and in every possible respect he will be well looked after. In addition to all the amenities which I have described as being available to him, he receives a sum of £1 18s. 6d. a week.  Any young man who has any regard for his parents, who had the trouble and the expense of rearing him to the stage which he has reached, could let them have at least £1 out of that sum of £1 18s. 6d.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, in addition to the fact that the welfare of their son is being looked after, it is a very attractive proposition.  That young man is earning £1 18s. 6d., with all found&mdash;clothing, medical attention, hospitalisation and everything that it is possible to provide for him at his disposal.  At the end of six months he can become what is known as a one-star private, that is, a well-trained and efficient soldier.  When he has arrived at that stage he is then entitled to receive £2 5s. 6d.  As a two-star private he receives £2 9s., and when he reaches the stage of three-star private, which he reaches by his own ability, intelligence and initiative, he receives £2 12s. 6d., and from that he can move into the non-commissioned rank where his wage becomes still higher.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that deliberately because the first and most urgent requirements mentioned by the members of the G.H.Q. Staff were the two items to which I have referred&mdash;men and munitions or warlike stores.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the fact that it was suggested, I think, by a district justice from the bench that it was possible for a young man convicted of a crime to avoid sentence for the crime committed by joining the Army. I want to say in the most emphatic terms in which I can say it that that is not so.  No person who is convicted of a criminal offence is accepted into the Army.  Whether that is good or not, is a matter of opinion.  I am satisfied that if a young man has a tendency towards criminal acts it is desirable that he should not be admitted into the Army. On the other hand, people argue that a young man who is convicted for the first time of a criminal offence ought <Col N="964" /> to be given a chance and that the State ought to give an example in showing forgiveness and helping him to build anew.  However that may be, I am only stating what are the facts and the facts are that no person convicted of a criminal offence is admitted to the ranks of the Army.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that the case has been made in the House that we are withdrawing labour from industries and agriculture. In reply to that I want to say that, in the main, the recruits whom we have secured for the Army have come from the cities and the towns and a very, very small minority have come from rural Ireland.  There is a fallacy in that argument that we are going into competition with agriculture and industry. How can we be in competition with agriculture and industry if, on the other hand, Deputies stand up in the House and twit us with the fact that we have a list of something like 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed?  One or other of these statements is wrong. We have not gone into competition with agriculture or industry for, in the first place, the appeal which I initiated was directed in the main, but not altogether, to boys of school-leaving age who would not in any case have been engaged in any industry, either agriculture or commercial industry.  From that point of view, I want to emphasise the fact that that statement is a fallacy, without any foundation.</P>
    <P>The other point which was made by the officers of G.H.Q. Staff when I interviewed them on the occasion that I have mentioned was, as I have said, munitions.  Having dealt with the question of men, I then applied myself to the question of where, how and when I could do anything to secure warlike stores.  Naturally, the first thing I had to inquire into was what efforts had been made up to date to secure these warlike stores.  Statements have been made in this House, both by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy MacEoin, that they had, to all intents and purposes, practically secured these supplies.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, in referring to it, admitted that &ldquo;the contract was entered definitely in the Minister's time for the Swedish supply&rdquo;.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" />&ldquo;The efforts to secure supplies were made before my time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was giving him that credit.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins then went further and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And the agreement to supply&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>to which I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am perfectly certain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not terribly concerned about who got the supplies as long as we got them.  If we got them, that is the main thing.  But, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of my last acts in the Minister's office was to give sanction for a mission to go to see if the type was suitable, whenever they were ready to go.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in the course of this debate.  In the same debate, Deputy MacEoin said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am glad to know that these arms are a success.  They were paid for out of the last Vote and the previous Vote.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is not true, of course.  There is no foundation whatever for that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the position which I found? The position which I found when I got down to examining the file was, that the first move in respect to this particular type of arms was made on 20th December, 1950, and it was made as a result of information supplied by the intelligence arm of the Army which reported to the Chief of Staff that they were aware that certain types of arms were likely to be secured in Sweden. The Chief of Staff, when he examined that information, decided to acquaint the then Minister of that fact and from that particular date up to the 13th March I could find nothing in the file to show that any ministerial action was taken in the matter.  I did see that the Army Intelligence apparently continued their efforts to secure information in <Col N="966" /> the matter.  On the 13th March, 1951, the Chief of Staff recommended that the Department of External Affairs should be asked to request the Irish Minister in Stockholm to ascertain from the Swedish Government the prospects of obtaining certain war material and, in that connection, whether missions from this country to Sweden could be facilitated.  The then Minister for Defence approved of this recommendation on the 19th March, 1951.  The sanction of the Minister for Finance to proceed accordingly was requested on the 28th March, 1951, and was received on the 17th May, 1951.</P>
    <P>From that date until I began to prosecute my inquiries, no action of any kind was taken and on the 5th July&mdash;I had been in office from, I think, the 14th June&mdash;as a result of the inquiries which I was making, I confirmed the decision to send a mission to Sweden and at the same time agreed that contracts could be arranged by the mission while in Sweden, subject to certain conditions.  The sanction of the Minister for Finance to proceed on the revised basis was obtained on the 14th July, 1951, and the mission was empowered to purchase arms on the spot if the arms, in their opinion, were of a suitable type.  Now it was easy to give that permission because the officers who were on that mission were all experts in regard to the question of arms.  I want to give this in its historical correctness to show that so far as statements made in the debates are concerned, they are not facts, that the facts are as I have related them.  Again of course I want to point out that so far as I am concerned, the very fact that we have secured arms at all, is sufficiently satisfying.</P>
    <P>Somebody stated in the course of the debate &mdash; I think it was Deputy McQuillan &mdash; that there was a rumour abroad that these sources of supply were likely to dry up.  I think there is no likelihood of these sources drying up.  If we are able to provide the money to secure the supplies, I think they will be available.  Someone also in the course of the debate suggested that some of the supplies that we were purchasing were obsolete.  No obsolescent equipment has been purchased or <Col N="967" /> ordered.  All the stores are of the most modern type &mdash; sub-machine-guns, anti-aircraft guns, grenades and mortars. Deliveries to date, even as late as Saturday the 31st May, are valued at between £400,000 and £500,000.  It is anticipated that deliveries to the total amount provided for in the Estimates will be made during the year. In fact, it may well be that a Supplementary Estimate may be necessary so that the statements that we were either purchasing obsolete or obsolescent arms or that the sources of supply were likely to dry up, are not correct.  We hope as a matter of fact to secure still further supplies in addition to the weapons we have already secured.</P>
    <P>The next question which I regard as being very important, is that of civil defence.  Quite a number of Deputies discussed the question of civil defence, and I think rightly so, inasmuch as civil defence is in the main concerned with the protection of the public. Therefore it should have a prominent place in any discussion or debate which takes place on an Estimate for the Department of Defence.  Civil defence officers have carried out extensive surveys of their areas.  They have selected key personnel and personnel who are willing to be trained as instructors.  They have examined the position of local supplies of equipment required for the services and have checked up on the equipment remaining from the A.R.P. schemes during the 1939-45 organisation.  They have recently been asked to plan and divide out their areas on the basis of the most recent information as to the organisation of a civil defence service. This planning will include the selection of buildings or sites to be earmarked for civil defence controls and depots, after a complete survey has been made of all the possible targets in the area. The duties of civil defence officers are the preparation of civil defence plans, the recruiting and training of personnel, the purchase, storage, maintenance, issue and control of equipment and such other defence duties as may be assigned to them by the local authorities and by the direction of the Minister for Defence.  Civil defence officers are appointed by local authorities <Col N="968" /> subject to the approval by the Minister for Defence of the appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Collins who referred to certain people who, he had been informed, had been sent away on certain courses, and that a civil defence school had been opened. He asked what kind of training would be given at the school.  Three types of training will be given.  The first will be a course for the various officials of local authorities who will be involved in the organisation and administration of local schemes.  The second will be a course for persons to be trained as general instructors, instructors who can give the necessary basic training in anti-gas precautions, fire fighting, decontamination and the civil defence aspects of atomic and biological warfare. Thirdly, a course will be given for persons who will train the rescue services.  The training will be realistic and will be with the actual type of equipment which will be used in the operation of the service.  For example, buildings will be set on fire and the fire squads will be trained to extinguish the fires.  Rescue squads will be trained to rescue live persons from the heart of the debris of the demolished houses.  A special training range has been constructed to enable this realistic training to be given.  The types of training mentioned are only some of those which will be given.</P>
      <P>A.R.P. training is being related to the various types of attack which might be made and to the measures by which local authorities and the people themselves can be trained and equipped to deal with the results of attack.  The types of attack against which measures will be required include high explosives, guided missiles, automatic bombs, radiological and biological warfare, incendiary bombs, etc.  Local authorities, of course, can only take such steps to deal with the results of these forms of attack as may be practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher stated that nothing had happened so far as Dublin is concerned. <Col N="969" /> It is not correct to say that nothing has happened, because as far as Dublin is concerned the civil defence officer has surveyed his area. He has arranged for the training of instructors on the first course in the civil defence school to commence on the 16th June.  He has made a tentative division of his area into operational sections and has inquired into the position regarding stores held.  He has had a number of discussions with the Department of Defence on particular problems affecting Dublin.  The Department of Defence has not yet received any request to meet the civil defence committee for Dublin, but any such meeting can be arranged and the Department would be very willing to discuss the position with the committee. The Department is in touch with all local authorities and city and county managers, and all communications regarding duties to be undertaken or arrangements to be made by civil defence officers are addressed to the local authorities and the managers.</P>
    <P>A complaint was made that a number of ex-Army officers were available but that civil defence officers appointed had not served in the Army.  In reply to that I would say that civil defence officers are appointed by local authorities. Generally these appointments are made from among the existing staffs of local authorities but without replacement; that is, civil defence becomes an additional duty of an existing officer.  In a number of instances, however, whole-time appointments were necessary.  The Department is aware that a considerable number of the civil defence officers have had either Army service or service in some of the emergency services.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy asked what type of protection will civil defence afford to the people.  Civil defence embraces arrangements for the warning of impending air-raids, the provision of shelters, the issue of anti-gas respirators, fire fighting, the rescue of persons trapped after raids, the treatment of casualties, the rehousing and rehabilitation of the homeless.  The arrangements also include the protection of vital industries and the organisation of methods to secure alternative functioning of essential services. These are the principal matters.  The <Col N="970" /> auxiliary matters include decontamination, clearance of roads and demolished buildings, burial of the dead, and other tasks of that kind.</P>
    <P>I was also asked what kind of equipment have we got for civil defence. We have a quantity of equipment for operating personnel; for example, steel helmets and service respirators. We have also a quantity of requisites to deal with casualties; for example, stretchers, splints, bandages and instruments. We have 180 fire-fighting pumps distributed throughout the country.  The local authorities are allowed to use these pumps for peacetime purposes as it helps to keep them in working order.  The new types of equipment we are looking for include a new respirator for general civilian use and war-time fire appliances as well as monitoring instruments for dealing with radio activity.  All these types are not yet in general production and we shall have to wait our turn. We hope at least to get, initially, prototypes for training purposes.  The supply position in America and in England is being very closely watched. We will not purchase any equipment that is likely to be described as obsolete or out of date.  The only new equipment so far obtained comprises three rescue lorries with full equipment, an additional set of rescue equipment and a mobile gas van for local anti-gas training.</P>
    <P>I was also asked why the public are not being made aware of civil defence. In that respect, direct appeals to the public and general publicity are not considered desirable until there is at least a nucleus of trained instructors throughout the country.  It is not desired to be put in the position that persons have volunteered for civil defence service and are waiting for a long period without any arrangements being made for their training.  We have largely completed our own central training arrangements and are now concentrating on the building up of a local training organisation.</P>
    <P>I was also asked what particular method of evacuation is contemplated. The final plan has not yet been evolved, but more than likely it will be on the lines of the arrangements <Col N="971" /> made during the 1939-45 organisation, namely, arrangements for a planned pre-emergency evacuation and further arrangements to cope with evacuation problems occurring during or immediately after an attack.</P>
    <P>I was also asked what is the general plan for co-ordinating the Red Cross, civil defence and the Army.  The Red Cross functions in relation to civil defence and the Army have been settled with the society for some considerable time.  The first function of the society is to organise voluntary aid divisions consisting of personnel who would be prepared in time of hostilities to become subject to military law and to act as auxiliaries of the Army Medical Corps.  The second function is to organise first aid divisions consisting of members who for various reasons would not be prepared to assist the Defence Forces.  The functions of the first aid divisions will be to assist the civil defence services either by performing nursing and first aid duties or by joining different branches of the civil defence organisation.  Each member of the civil defence organisation will require a knowledge of first aid.</P>
    <P>Our big difficulty, of course, in respect to the equipping of the civil defence units for the general protection of the public is that it is almost impossible at the present time to secure equipment of that particular type anywhere. We are watching the trend of events everywhere and we have made inquiries both in England and America as to the likelihood or possibility of securing a particular type of equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and no doubt the Deputy is aware that in the last emergency we got through reasonably well and were adequately protected.  Had we not had the men trained to meet the acts of war that were inflicted on us, especially here in Dublin and to a smaller extent down in Wexford, there might have been many more casualties.  People were civil defence minded as a result of the organisation we had built up at that time.</P>
      <P>It must be the object of any Government, even in the absence of the type of modern equipment for which we are looking, to have men trained in defence as far as it is humanly possible so to train them.  I have already mentioned the fact that we are constructing buildings in the Phoenix Park.  These buildings will be used for actual demonstrations of fire and the demolition of buildings and so on.  Real people will be concerned in these rehearsals, and the personnel engaged will have to act under a considerable amount of risk in the completion of the task set before them.  That is as far as we can go at the present moment.  I think it is going quite a considerable distance.  If the Deputy or anyone else can tell me where we can get the equipment I will be very grateful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Procuring the equipment is our biggest obstacle at the moment.  Having said that, I want the House and the public to understand what is being done in relation to civil defence in order to make the people aware that we are as actively minded in relation to civil defence as we are in regard to military defence. Deputies will understand that the prola <Col N="973" /> tection of the public is the first duty of any Government.</P>
      <P>The next subject which loomed very largely in this debate was that of the F.C.A.  I find it difficult to approach this particular subject because I am very far from being satisfied with the present position with regard to the F.C.A.  The position is not as it should be.  Amongst the numerous responsibilities I undertook when I reassumed office as Minister for Defence was the responsibility of endeavouring to instil new life into the F.C.A. When I was in opposition I heard statements of the kind that have been made here recently.  I was told that the Army was antagonistic to the F.C.A.  I did not believe these stories because, knowing the Army as I did, and knowing what the Army had done in the building up of that force initially, I could hardly credit that the outlook in relation to An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil had changed in such a very short time.  If anything, the desire of the Army would be to build up that force as one which could be relied upon at any time during a period of emergency.</P>
      <P>I regret that statements were made here which had a political flavour, statements which should not have been introduced into this debate.  Deputy O'Higgins stated &ldquo;that the former Government undoubtedly did considerable work in building up the local defence force.&rdquo;  He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I know in doing that they did experience a certain apathy from the regular Army personnel towards the F.C.A.  The feeling of suspicion had been experienced for a number of years back by people associated with the F.C.A., but I think that is dying.  I think that even the most conservative regular Army officers in recent years came to recognise the need for a force such as the F.C.A. It is a pity that in the last 12 months the F.C.A. seems to have been put into a back seat again.  The changed outlook has undoubtedly been responsible to a certain extent for the very marked decreases in the available strength for the force ... It is a pity that the Minister should be neglecting the F.C.A.  I <Col N="974" /> can see no sense in anyone suggesting that because our standing army is some 2,000 or 3,000 more than it was 12 months ago, therefore we are better able to defend ourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course nobody made such a statement and that statement is purely a figment of the Deputy's imagination. Far from neglecting the F.C.A, I have done as much as any Minister ever did for the F.C.A. Deputy O'Higgins also had something to say about the F.C.A.:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here by way of criticism might I say that the F.C.A. is not getting the attention from the Army it got heretofore.  Heretofore, half the officers of G.H.Q. above the rank of Commandant were out every week-end with the F.C.A., surprise visits, inspections and paying the unit the compliment of a very high G.H.Q. officer moving amongst them... What was done in my time had to be done by drive, drive, drive, by continuous prodding, by always asking what was done last month.  Otherwise the F.C.A. would be allowed to fade away.  That drive is not there at the moment and the F.C.A. feel it ... I would implore the Minister to look at what attention has been given to the F.C.A. in the last 12 months and compare that with the previous 12 months!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His imploring was not in vain because, in response to it, I decided to look up and find out what the position was generally in regard to the F.C.A.  I was very far from being satisfied with the situation which I found in regard to the F.C.A.</P>
    <P>These figures, I think, will show the reasons for my fears, and why I had to give expression to that opinion.  On the 31st December, 1947&mdash;that was the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government before it was superseded by the Coalition Government&mdash;the total number of officers, N.C.O.s and men was 47,880.  At the end of 12 months, that is, on the 31st December, 1948, the force was reduced from 47,880 to 39,560, a decrease of 8,320.  On the 31st of December, 1949, it had still further decreased from 39,560 to 34,636.  That represented a further decrease of 4,924, almost 5,000 men.  On the 31st December, <Col N="975" /> 1950, the figures again showed a decrease from 34,636 to 30,311, a decrease of 4,325.  On the 30th June, 1951, that was up to the time of the change of Government, the year to which Deputy O'Higgins implored me to look to see what was done in respect of the F.C.A., it had decreased in the six months by no less than 7,941, bringing the total strength down to 22,370.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there was a weeding out process in regard to its effective strength during that particular period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make any excuse he likes.  We can all hold our own opinions as to what was the cause of the decrease.  My own opinion is that there was a lack of activity and excitement.  We know that in the old days of the Irish Volunteers if there was anything actively being done you had people coming in in thousands.  I am only pointing out the fact, when Deputy O'Higgins tries to imply that whatever is happening at the present time is due to the ineptitude and to the inactivity of the present Minister or the present Government or whatever you like to assign it to, that that is not correct.  Here we have a continual bleeding, hæmorrhage from the forces.  On the 31st of December, 1951, the figure was 22,436, and while we are discussing this Estimate here the figure is now down to 18,115.</P>
      <P>These are rather depressing figures. I do not think myself that they mean anything other than what I have suggested, that, if to-morrow there was a call to arms for some emergency purpose, we would not only have the 47,800 that existed in December, 1947, but would probably have every man that was trained in the F.C.A. during all the intervening years, men who had come in and had gone out again.  The astonishing thing that I find, in connection with the F.C.A., is that men are coming in and are going out at the rate of 4,000 or 5,000 a year.  We have a continuous influx into the ranks and an exodus following that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was only a couple of months in the Department of Defence&mdash;after I had dealt with the other matters to which <Col N="976" /> I have been referring in the course of my statement&mdash;when I took up the matter of the F.C.A. and the general situation in regard to it.  I wrote a long minute to the Chief of Staff. pointing out my fears with regard to the whole situation.  I asked him for suggestions as to ways and means by which this depletion could be brought to an end, for any suggestions as to better conditions, or ways and means, by which we could find equipment to interest them.  The general report which I received led me to believe that the Army authorities, while doing everything possible to interest the F.C.A., were having little success.</P>
    <P>I visited every command in the country, and everywhere I went my first anxiety, naturally, was to find out what was the actual position in regard to the F.C.A.  It was almost the same everywhere I went.  Here is an example.  In the Southern Command the officer there, who is very alert, very efficient and very sympathetic, designed a series of lectures to cover, I think, a period of six weeks, a lecture per week.  The series of lectures was very well advertised amongst the members of the F.C.A. all over the area.  Appeals were made to the individuals concerned to come forward and to participate in the lectures.  They were told that they would be very informative, very instructive and very beneficial to both rank and file.  What happened? On the first night the lecturer, the officer concerned, appeared at the hall and found an audience of six men. Naturally, he was very depressed, after all the trouble he had gone to, and after all the trouble the authorities had gone to, to publicise the lecture, to find six individuals sitting facing him. Nevertheless, he decided to deliver his lecture.  He did so, and he appealed to the six who were there to inform their comrades that the second lecture would be delivered on that night week.</P>
    <P>The officer went away and reported what had happened.  He returned again in the following week.  To his amazement he found six more men facing him to hear the second of a series of lectures.  The astonishing thing about the situation was that they were six <Col N="977" /> different men.  They were not the six men who had had the benefit of the first of the series of lectures. Then, having again made his appeal to these men and having reported the unsatisfactory situation, he returned and on his third visit, he found two or three men from the first group and the same from the second group.  His lectures were a complete waste of time.  The first group heard the first lecture but did not hear the second.  The second group heard the second lecture but did not hear the first, and some of each group heard the third lecture.  There is another side to the case.  It is the sort of thing that depresses the Army authorities who are held responsible for the success of this particular service.</P>
    <P>Again, this situation occurred.  The officer in a particular command organised a field day.  A field day is one of the most valuable forms of training for the F.C.A. that the Army authorities can devise.  They planned it several weeks ahead.  All arrangements were made for it.  The Army authorities themselves had everything prepared in the way of rations and other requirements for the men for the day.  When the staff of Army officers turned up for this long-arranged and well-advertised field day they found just a few men&mdash; not sufficient to entitle them to go out and hold what they could describe as a field day.  Therefore, they had to abandon the project.  An inquiry was then made as to why, after all the trouble and difficulty, this particular field day failed in the manner in which it did.</P>
    <P>The reason was that there was a replay of a football match&mdash;a thing which could not have been foreseen. The Army authorities arranged the field day for a certain day after having gone to the trouble of ensuring that this day would be open as far as sport was concerned.  They could not foresee that two somewhat prominent football teams would draw in a game, and that a replay would be fixed for this particular day.  That is what happened.  I very respectfully suggest to the F.C.A. that if they are serious about making the F.C.A. a force on which the nation can depend, they will have to <Col N="978" /> choose between amusements of that kind and their duty to the nation.  If the members of the F.C.A. are not prepared to make that sacrifice, I cannot see what more the Army authorities can do than they are doing at the present time.  I have brought to their notice the statements which have been made that they are, to some extent, not interested in the F.C.A. Their reply was to show me the number of schemes which they had prepared and the results of the schemes &mdash;examples not quite as outstanding as those I have given, but examples which, to some extent, would prevent any body of men continuing to have that active interest that the Army authorities should have.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dr. O'Higgins spoke on this Estimate he said something which I am sure a lot of Deputies will agree with.  I would be prepared to agree with him myself.  I quote from Volume 132, No. 3, column 349, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is unreasonable to expect men to lose money as a result of turning up for annual training.  I hold very, very strongly that, when the F.C.A. personnel turn up for such training with the Regular Army, they should receive marriage allowance, children's allowances and every other allowance in the way of pay in addition to the ordinary training bonus that is given.  I maintain that they should be equated with the conditions existing for soldiers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has put that on record as his belief.  He was the Minister for Defence for three years, and I have no doubt that he made an effort to bring about that position.  If he did make an effort in that respect, he failed.  He is putting it up to me now to succeed where he failed.  I do not mind telling the House that I will have a try.  If, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins believed&mdash;and I, too, share his belief to some extent&mdash;we can succeed, it will improve, perhaps to some extent anyhow, attendances at the annual camps and perhaps at the courses which the Army authorities are continually imploring the officers of the F.C.A. to attend, but with very little success.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that the standard of the officers of the F.C.A. could <Col N="979" /> be much higher than it is if they would only attend the courses.  I quite realise that this is a voluntary force and that the full course would cover a period of three months.  Even in three months it would not be possible to impart to them all the knowledge that would be necessary but it is the shortest possible period that the Army can suggest.  It is short when one considers that the cadets&mdash;that is, officers-to-be&mdash;have to do two years in the training college before they can begin their career as officers.  It is only when they begin their career as officers that, in fact, they begin their education.  I realise that the three months' period is a difficult period for civilians in employment because of the question of securing release from their employment.  If it is possible that the extensions of marriage allowance, children's allowances and all these allowances to which the Regular Army officer is entitled will encourage them to go into annual camps to do the courses which the Army are so anxious they should do, then certainly I shall make every possible effort to secure that these allowances will be granted.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what to say about the attendance of Regular Army officers at the F.C.A. parades&mdash;that is, the nightly parades.  When the F.C.A. was established, regular officers and regular N.C.O.s were attached to these units to develop the units from the military point of view and to put them under expert guidance initially.  It was hoped that, perhaps, in the course of a year or 18 months, the officers of the F.C.A. itself would develop the self-confidence necessary to enable them to undertake the complete and entire handling of the F.C.A. unit themselves.  It was formed in 1946 and this is the year 1952 and, with some honourable exceptions, the position is practically as it was at the beginning. Officers are not prepared to undertake the control and full responsibility of these units and, until they undergo these courses of training which the Army are so strongly advocating, I am afraid that that self-confidence which would make them capable of taking that control will be absent.</P>
    <P>The position is that there is no use <Col N="980" /> in this House, or Deputies in this House condemning, more or less wholeheartedly, the Army authorities for whatever defects there may be in the F.C.A.  As far as I am concerned, I am satisfied that the Army authorities will do everything and anything that is possible to make this force a success. They realise only too well, just as well as any reasonable Deputy, that to have a force of that kind behind the Army, consisting of 30,000 or 40,000 partly-trained soldiers, would be an asset that should not, and could not, be ignored.  Naturally, having that viewpoint, why should they be antagonistic to the F.C.A. or take up the attitude that has been suggested in this House of neglecting the F.C.A.?  I am satisfied that that is not the position, that that is not so.</P>
    <P>I go on from that to the more or less general situation which was discussed in a manner similar to the manner in which the other points which I have dealt with were discussed. However much we may hope and pray that this country will not be invaded, it is our duty, and it would be the duty of any Government, to ensure that, as far as lies within the power of that Government, every effort will be made to prevent an attack upon the freedom of this country.  We heard Deputy Dillon on this subject.  He was very vocal.  He gave us his views in general, on heavy artillery and light artillery, on the value of the orthodox method and the value of the guerrilla method, and all that sort of thing.  In the course of his speech he used these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The danger against which we must provide is airborne invasion by the Russians.  There is not any other danger.  The Americans are not going to invade this country and they will not let the British invade it.  The Russians may.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon made that statement I began to ask myself if Deputy Dillon had a private Department of External Affairs of his own, because I am conscious of the fact that in the last emergency the then Taoiseach made every possible effort to get a guarantee from our neighbours and the associates of our neighbours that <Col N="981" /> this country would not be invaded and he failed to get that guarantee.  He did not get it although he made a very strong plea for it.  Yet Deputy Dillon can stand up in this House and he can, apparently, unequivocally tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If he makes a statement that the Americans are not going to invade this country it is to be assumed that he is making a statement of fact, and we ought to know where he got his guarantees because there is this about that statement, that, if it was a fact, people might say that there is no reason in the wide world why we should be expending money on defence if the great American nation is not contemplating invasion of this country or the British nation is not contemplating invasion of this country.  As <Col N="982" /> I said just a few minutes ago, in the last emergency our Government failed completely to get that guarantee.  When Deputy Dillon makes a statement of that kind he seems to forget that one of these nations has its foot firmly planted in the heart of one of our most historic provinces.  He ignores that fact completely.  If the Russians had their foot in our province we would be sitting up and taking a lot of notice of it, and Deputy Dillon would too, I am sure, but that is not the position. The position is that any military staff that would attempt to ignore that situation would not be doing their duty.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether we should have heavy artillery or light, artillery or rifles or machine-guns, that, again, is a matter of opinion.  As far as I am concerned, I want to say that I am not wedded to heavy artillery at all because I know that, in certain circumstances, it might be impossible to get away heavy artillery and we might have groups of men dying beside their guns rather than surrender them. We can secure for this country weapons like the Brandt mortar, of which we have a number, machine-guns, anti-tank weapons, weapons that are ideally suited for a country of this kind where the country is so close.  I think it would be agreed that our terrain is anti-tank terrain.  With the exception of the main roads, I do not think progress by the tank method could be achieved with much success. Therefore, except for attacking definite posts such as cities or fortified positions, I doubt if heavy artillery is desirable at all in our present situation. I think we must concentrate on a lighter type of an equally destructive weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of guerrilla warfare, as opposed to orthodox military action, so long as the situation in the North is as it is, any military staff worth its salt in this country will have to rely on the orthodox method.  It may be that, in due course, they will have to resort to the other method, the method to which, I would say, our people are temperamentally suited and in which we have, perhaps, given a lead to the world.  If we ever have to resort to it again, it is possible that we shall be resorting to it with a tradition behind <Col N="983" /> us which will be of considerable value. There will also be the fact that we shall have weapons in our possession that we did not have in the last struggle which we undertook.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that subject, I should say that, as far as this Government is concerned, we are carrying out the policy which we carried out in the last emergency and we shall continue to carry out that policy until such time as conditions make it necessary to bring about a change.  If any changes are necessary, this House will be made fully aware of the position in that respect.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy raised a question as to the amount of money that is being expended on new vehicles&mdash;£88,000 is, I think, the sum involved.  I want to inform the House that that sum is provided merely for replacements, and these replacements will be made over the course of a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it will not be spent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get the vehicles it will be spent this year and in the years to follow.  Replacements will follow year by year.  The sum is being allotted for that particular purpose, to replace vehicles which have been used over a considerable number of years, and which are to all intents and purposes now beyond service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an economy to replace them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be.  The question of married quarters has been referred to.  A committee has been set up to ascertain to what extent married quarters can be improved.  The whole problem is bound up with the housing problem generally.  The matter of certain barracks and forts was mentioned by Deputy Desmond, but these places are not at present occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the number of civilians in the Army.  Last year we provided for 2,042 civilians, and this year we are providing for 2,117, an increase of 75 men.  The increase is due to the necessity of providing more tradesmen for maintenance <Col N="984" /> work and the extension of the branch dealing with civil defence.  The whole trend in our Army, as in all others, is to employ civilians on non-military work, and to leave the soldiers to deal with purely military matters.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on this note.  Deputy MacEoin raised the question of the demonstration of the new weapons.  If Deputy MacEoin or any other Deputy in this House is anxious to have a demonstration, I should be very pleased to make arrangements to have Deputies who indicate that they would like to see this demonstration, conveyed to wherever the demonstration will take place, but the demonstration would have to take place on a given day.  If Deputies are anxious to see these weapons in action, I shall be only too pleased to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I gladly accept that invitation from the Minister.  My complaint was that when a demonstration was being given, you could invite army officers from the two nations which Deputy Dillon said would not invade us and that when you were giving a demonstration to them, it did not strike somebody that some Deputies on this side of the House would like to be there on that occasion. It means that you have to make further arrangements now and incur further expenditure for another demonstration. That expenditure should have been avoided.  There is no question about it; I should like to see them. I cannot speak for any body else but I am sure that there are other Deputies who would be glad to have the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I was not in for all of the Minister's speech but I should like to know if he dealt with the question of compensation for the relatives of Army personnel who may be killed in the course of military practice or when engaged on military duties.</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Estimate at £995,080 for the present year shows an increase of £105,500 compared with the Estimate for the previous year, or, if there be taken into consideration a Supplementary Estimate for £20,000 taken in March, 1951, a net increase of £85,000.  This increase is due almost exclusively to a larger number qualifying for military service pensions, Defence Forces pensions and special allowances.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of this Vote is to implement financially statutes and schemes passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The details of the awards already made and to be made under these statutes and schemes are fully set out in the printed volume of Estimates, so that it is only necessary to summarise under a few headings the financial provisions.

    <P>During the past year the Army Pensions Board has dealt with 1,142 claims, of which 808 related to special allowances. In dealing with these claims they were helped to a very large extent by the appointment of pensions medical officers, who, having examined the claimants locally, submitted their reports to the board.  In this way 420 cases were dealt with during the year.</P>
    <P>Tribute must be paid to these officers for the extensive help they have given in the examination of claims, for without their assistance the board would find it difficult, if not impossible, to cope with the work, and most certainly the claims could not be examined as expeditiously.</P>
    <P>As regards the applications and petitions for Military Service Certificates, there were on 31st March, 1952, no less than 16,540.  The Advisory Committee has examined and graded 11,707 cases to date, and have selected for hearing by the Referee 7,267.  Of that number the Referee has actually heard 1,700 claims, and has made to date favourable reports in 713.  During they year there have been held outside of Dublin 21 local sittings, and to date 21 counties have been visited.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by the committee of Old I.R.A. men set up to investigate the existing position in relation to Military Service Pensions.  This claim has been examined by me and is still under consideration but I am not yet in a position to say to what extent (if any) it will be possible to meet these claims.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a considerable amount of criticism from Deputies in regard to the remission of this tax, and I was hoping that the week-end would have enabled Deputies to see the position with some sense of reality.  I was rather surprised this afternoon to find that the old allegations were being trotted out again.  This remission of the tax on dancing is a very small item in a large Budget.  It is an extraordinary thing that so much time is being devoted by Deputies to a criticism of the remission of this tax.  It is significant that it is only in regard to the dance tax remission that some Deputies have intervened at all in the discussion of this Finance Bill.  What was the purpose of that?  At an earlier stage we discussed the remission of taxation under the income-tax relief section. While we had some criticism from Fine. Gael Deputies of the remission of income-tax, we had no contribution on that matter from the members of the Labour Party, who have intervened at length in regard to the remission of the tax on dancing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins described this as a most obnoxious and disreputable part of the Finance Bill.  He said: &ldquo;We are entitled to put on view before the Irish public the completely shady and disreputable background to the removal of this tax.  It is a sordid political bargain bringing public life into a `new low' of degradation.&rdquo;  Deputy Norton said that we are taxing the old age pensioner in the Budget and that at the same time we are remitting this tax.  Deputy Dillon's words of abuse are still ringing around the rafters of this House, abuse of every person concerned in public life in the country.  I do not want to follow Deputy Dillon, nor do I want to repeat the language he used in regard to corruption, degradation and matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair that an approach like this should be made to a simple matter such as the remission of the dance tax. The surprising thing is that, from the moment the Budget was introduced, so many Deputies have referred to the £140,000 that is going to the dance-hall <Col N="988" /> proprietors.  That is high-sounding language.  But, right through the country, people are not fooled with that type of language.  In the towns people begin to ask: &ldquo;Who are the dance-hall proprietors?  Who is benefiting to the extent of £1,000 or £500 within the area that I know?&rdquo;  In no part of the rural areas, no part outside the cities and perhaps one or two of the big towns, will you find the private dance halls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they? This country is administered in the ordinary way by the Government and by local authorities.  Outside of that there are organisations of people who come together voluntarily&mdash;cultural, sporting or athletic&mdash;and do a tremendous amount of useful work. These organisations run dances.  Dances are always regarded as a sources of revenue, but for some time past dances have no longer proved to be a source of revenue to these organisations.  I do not know how many commercial dance halls there are throughout the country.  We have several in the City of Dublin.  Some are run by groups of individuals.  Two of the finest ballrooms are let to clubs and organisations which want to run dances.  There is a fixed charge for the hall irrespective of whether or not there is a tax on dancing.  These proprietors will not benefit financially by the removal of this tax.  The £140,000, if that is the amount, will go to the little clubs I <Col N="991" /> have mentioned and as a saving on the part of the individual who attends dances.  That is quite clear to me.  It is quite clear to the people.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy S. Collins are falling into serious error if they think otherwise.  They seem to think that the people are stupid and will take as stupid a view as they take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that after 1st August next the admission price to dances will be reduced by the amount of the tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter entirely for the organisations that run the dances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Supposing the Irish Auctioneers' Association hires a dance hall up in Parnell Square, the one owned by a trade union.  They pay a fixed charge for the use of the hall.  The admission charge to the dance is entirely a matter for the organisation.  If the admission charge is not reduced there is a bigger profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

I think it is wrong that the House should be used <Col N="992" /> for the purpose of casting offensive aspersions on the Government or the Minister for Finance.  This tax was remitted in 1946.  It was reimposed in 1949.  It was opposed in 1949 and in 1950.  In 1951, the present Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, stated very clearly when he wrote to the Secretary of the Ballroom Proprietors' Association that if Fianna Fáil were returned as the Government they would remit the tax. That was a specified statement of policy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has said that in County Westmeath there are 23 halls, each serving populations of over 500, in which the dance tax was, and is, being charged. In the whole county there is only one commercial dance hall, owned by a private individual and run for profit.

      <P>In reply, Deputy McGilligan was able to prove that during the three years he was Minister for Finance not only did the tax go up the second year but also the third year, and he had no complaints from the revenue authorities about the difficulty or expense involved in collecting it.  If we could rope in, in this financial year, an extra £140,000 or £200,000 which, remember, was gradually going up, could it not be devoted to relieve some of the unfortunate people in this country or could it not be devoted to increasing military service pensions, and so forth?  If these things could be done with it, why should we evade the collection of that tax?</P>
      <P>I make a suggestion to the Minister, and I am making it quite seriously. Each dance-hall proprietor, in applying each year for his licence, pays £2 stamp duty, which is a contribution towards the Exchequer.  Some of these dance halls are better equipped than others. Some of them are bigger buildings and have a bigger turnover than others. Would it not be possible to have a revaluation of the dance halls?  Having got the revaluation, would it not be possible to have a <i>pro rata</i> licence imposed on these dance halls at the annual licensing session?  We would be employing an instrument often employed by the Revenue Commissioners for the free collection of duties.  We would be employing the legal profession to collect these taxes, and it would cost the State nothing.  The Minister may laugh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We take in £2 per dance-hall licence for the State.  We receive nothing whatsoever from the State for the collection of that £2 &mdash; not a penny.  That duty is imposed upon us to collect that money free so far as the State is concerned.  There is no <Col N="999" /> reason why the Minister could not increase that stamp duty in proportion to the poor law valuation of these luxurious dance halls all over the country.  Remember, and the Minister has evidence of it in this county, to evade the imposition of the dance-hall tax, dance halls were built within a radius of 20 miles of Dublin City.  Most luxurious dance halls were built for the purpose of qualifying under the rural Ireland exemption of payment of entertainment taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Further, the proprietor who can afford to put money into that hall can also afford to pay a tax.  I think it would be much more desirable to extract that tax from him, and other dance-hall proprietors like him, than that other sections of the community who can less well afford it should be further taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan said that the majority of dances were held by sports clubs and for charitable organisations.  I am a solicitor.  I act for approximately 25 different dance-hall proprietors.  On each occasion when we apply for a renewal of the dance-hall licence we have difficulty in extracting from the proprietors the small allocation of approximately 20 per cent. of their dances for charitable and other organisations. That is quite true &mdash; and remember that the tax does not apply in most of the cases because they are in rural Ireland. It just shows the monopoly which they have.  Every political Party, even Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and other political organisations, requires funds occasionally.  One of the methods adopted by them for the purpose of raising funds is to hold a dance.  They have difficulty in holding one dance per year in some of these dance halls. I appeal to the Minister and to this <Col N="1000" /> House to consider this matter carefully. In these days when, as the Minister says, a cruel and heavy Budget has had to be introduced, we should at least ask dance-hall proprietors to carry their share of the burden of taxation.</P>

When the tax was in operation they went to all the rounds of the world to try to get out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The local pensions officer, who was also human enough to know that these clubs could exist only if they made some money, had to do his duty and had to get after them if there was any attempt on their part to evade the tax.  He also had to be paid by the State at the rate of 9d. per mile if he went out to check on the activities of these people.  The result is that, in the long run, the game very often is not worth the candle.  In addition to paying the proprietor and the band, if you also had to pay a dance tax on every ticket that was bought at the door, you would not get anything for the club and it would not be worth while running the function.  I defy contradiction that very many small sports clubs throughout rural Ireland have gone out of being for the sole and simple reason that they could not make money in the only way that was open to them, that is, by running céilidhes and dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something, I admit, in what Deputy O'Donnell says about finding it difficult to get halls for dances from time to time.  When there is so much heat generated in debates like this, it is well that we should be reasonable from time to time.  There is something in that statement that it is often hard <Col N="1002" /> to convince a proprietor, a commercial proprietor especially, to give his support to a club which cannot afford to pay what he would usually like to ask for the use of his hall for a night.  Very often, just because the club is local or his son is playing, or for some such reason, he gives the hall for something less than what he would like to get for the evening.  If the hall is being run for a commercial purpose, he cannot afford to do that too often.</P>
    <P>I was very interested also in Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion about increasing the stamp duty.  I do not know if it is a practical suggestion.</P>
    <P>I very strongly agree with what Deputy Cowan said in regard to the speeches made by Deputy Collins and Deputy Dillon.  I want to assure the House, and I would assure Deputy Dillon if he were here, that I am not trying to get notoriety by climbing up on his back.  He suggested the other day that anyone who picked on him did so for the purpose of trying to get vicarious notoriety.  I do suggest quite seriously to the House, when we are talking about bribery, corruption, degradation and one thing or another, it is hardly proper for Deputies like Deputy Dillon and Deputy Collins to stand up here and make speeches such as they did make in the course of the last few days, giving the impression to the whole world that in fact the present Government in conducting the affairs of the country is being guided by bribery, and that it is corrupt, for the sake of what the Opposition variously estimated from £250 to £2,500.  There was no bribery, and there was no corruption involved in it, and Deputy Cowan made an absolutely unanswerable case in that respect.</P>
    <P>You could not stop the dance-hall proprietors from giving a subscription after Fianna Fáil, through the Tánaiste, had given an unequivocal statement about the attitude of the Party on the subject of dance tax.  If any organisation in the country asks Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael for a clear statement of policy on any matter, surely the particular Party will be prepared to give it.  If, thereafter, the people who would stand to benefit by the implementation of the policy decide that they will support that <Col N="1003" /> Party and actually contribute to its funds, according to the definition of bribery, it just is not it or, according to the definition of corruption, it just is not it.  It is one thing to obtain political advantage in any possible way, but it is hardly right to hold up this Parliament to ridicule in the eyes of the world.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have wandered from the original point that I wanted to make, that was, with regard to these little sports clubs.  I am grateful to Deputy O'Donnell for being kind enough to wait.  I intend to vote, of course, for the removal of this tax, if only for the reason that it gives a breathing space and a new hope to these small clubs.  In fairness, I do not think that any Deputy sitting on the benches opposite will say that these clubs are rolling in riches.  I think they will all admit that they are barely able to struggle on.  I think, also, that they will tell Parliament that they play a useful and, indeed, an essential part in the rural life of the country, developing, as they do, the bodies and minds of the young men who will afterwards be asked to carry on the responsibility of citizenship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the present Minister and his predecessors, from time to time, have been approached by most organisations representing the various interests in the community who are the subject of the tax code in this State.  The Minister and his predecessors, when dealing with applications for remission of taxes and when meeting the various demands for remission of taxes from various bodies, should take into consideration, not merely the interests of a particular organisation that is approaching them at the time, but the interests of the community as a whole.  The Minister's duty is not to give remission of taxes to any particular branch of the community, if that remission will work hardship on other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a very powerful weapon to wield annually when he brings in his Budget.  He has it in his power to grant considerable relief <Col N="1004" /> to sections of the community by remission of tax.  He has it also in his power to impose sometimes very onerous taxes on other sections of the community. It is the Minister's task to shoulder that responsibility by distributing the tax as equitably as he can.</P>
    <P>What I object to in the remission of tax enshrined in Section 14 is that the Minister has not distributed taxation in an equitable fashion.  The Minister is giving a remission of tax to people who deserve remission far less than other people whom the Minister could have benefited if he had maintained this tax at its present level.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Fianna Fáil Deputies and other Deputies must be aware as I am, that there are in this State groups of people who are suffering great hardships as a result of the rise in the cost of living, who will suffer greater hardships after July 1st, when the food subsidies come off.  I need only mention State pensioners, pensioners of local authorities, Old I.R.A. pensioners, recipients of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions. I need only refer to people who are in receipt of tuberculosis allowances from local authorities, people whose lives are extremely hard and are going to become harder as a result of the rise in the cost of living and as a result of the decision of the Government to reduce the subsidies.  These people in many cases have an unanswerable case for a reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back to the point I wish to make and which I regard as the kernel of Section 14. That is, that the Minister appears to have had £140,000 at his disposal after he had imposed all the taxes and cut down the food subsidies.  Instead of giving that £140,000 to any of those sections of the community who stood so badly in need of it, he decided to give it back to the dance-hall proprietors. Let us assume for a moment that Deputy Flanagan is correct.  Let us assume&mdash;and it is a big assumption&mdash; that Deputy Cowan is correct, that in fact the people who are going to <Col N="1005" /> benefit from the remission of the tax are not the wealthy proprietors of dance halls but the ordinary promoters of social functions, social clubs and athletic clubs to whom reference has been made in this debate.  Is their case stronger than the case of the State pensioner, the Old I.R.A. pensioner or the widow who depends on a non-contributory pension from the State? Surely the answer is quite clear. Surely no sane Minister for Finance who had £140,000 on hands after balancing his books would give that away to dance-hall proprietors or to the promoters of social functions in preference to giving it to the classes I have named.  Maybe the owners of dance halls have a case, but when Deputy McGilligan asked them to show their profits and told them that if it were demonstrable that they were suffering losses he would consider removing the tax they refused to show their books and so Deputy McGilligan refused to remove the tax.  But let us suppose that there was in fact a case for the promoters of social functions throughout the State, have they a greater title to relief under the Budget than State pensioners, widows in receipt of a State pension or people in receipt of a tuberculosis allowance? Where is the Government's hierarchy of values?  There is a complete inversion of the accepted method of giving relief, if relief were to be given in the Budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan and other Deputies have put forward what I regard as almost pathetic arguments in favour of this remission of taxation. Deputy Cowan wants the young people to be able to dance at a lower cost, but are the young people who want to go to dances entitled to enjoy themselves at the expense of the State pensioners, the Old I.R.A. pensioner or the widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension?  That is the position. The Minister cast his benevolent eye on the £140,000 in his hands, but instead of giving it to the people most deserving of help, he has given it to people who were the least entitled to relief under this Budget, this harsh and cruel Budget.</P>

    <P>It is unnecessary to go into the full implications of the Budget at this <Col N="1006" /> stage, but I would say that none of the arguments put forward to support Section 14 justifies the remission of tax in favour of a small comparatively well-off minority in this country when there are people in a grave state of destitution as a result of the Government's financial policy over the last 12 months.  In view of the speciousness and fatuousness of the arguments put forward, we are entitled to draw only one conclusion, and that is that the reason and the motive behind Section 14 is the notoriously sordid one that has been referred to throughout the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear from the arguments put forward in defence of this relief that those who try to defend the Minister in granting this relief have no case to make.  This was the only bright spot in the savage Budget introduced by the Minister two months ago.  He offered as an excuse the cost of collection.  He told us that the cost of collection did not justify the imposition of this tax, but whatever the cost was, after all costs and expenses were paid, £140,000 came into the Exchequer last year, and the revenue was on the increase.  Three years ago it was £100,000; last year it was upwards of £140,000, and it could be expected to continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the letter which was circulated from the Ballroom Owners' Association asking their members to subscribe generously before the general election so as to enable Fianna Fáil to gain a victory.  I should like to refer now to a letter circulated after the announcement of this relief of £140,000 a letter from the Irish Dance Band Federation to the ballroom proprietors.  That letter told the ballroom proprietors that the members of the Dance Band Federation proposed to adjust their charges upwards. Everybody knows that the fees for dance bands within recent years have shown an upward trend.  More money was being spent in the dance halls and, of course, the dance bands moved their charges upwards.  The very moment this relief was announced by the Minister in his Budget a circular letter was sent out by the Dance Band Federation indicating to the ballroom proprietors that they intended to <Col N="1007" /> increase the charges for their bands. At the same time an indication was given by the Ballroom Owners' Association that they proposed to increase the rent charges for their ballrooms.  There are two sections of the community very keenly fighting between themselves for this £140,000 which the Minister has released amongst them.</P>
    <P>The argument that his will be a relief to the people who attend dances is to say the least of it silly.  Deputy Cogan in his remarks which were wide of the mark said that it was going to benefit people attending dances.  We know very well that the charges for admission to dances are not going to be reduced.  The fee of 5/- as the Minister knows will continue to be 5/.</P>
    <P>The fight is on between the dance bands and the Ballroom Owners' Association for the 1/- tax that was normally subscribed from that 5/-.  It was argued that it would give some benefit to clubs which promoted these dances.  There will be very little left when the battle between the ballroom owners and the dance bands is over. When the Minister announced this remission of tax and at the same time indicated that the loaf of bread for the poorer sections of the community would be increased to 9d. these people have every reason to be annoyed that this remission was given.</P>
    <P>When we examine the correspondence which passed between the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Ballroom Owners' Association regarding a subscription to the general election fund and the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputies on this side of the House have every reason to believe that it was something more than a friendly subscription.  It has been described as bribery, corruption and degradation.  Whatever it was, it certainly had something to do with the undertaking which was given by the Fianna Fáil Party to consider the question of remitting this tax if elected to office.</P>

      <P>This debate has been conducted with a complete disregard of the value of language and of the significance of facts.  It opened, as it concluded, with <Col N="1008" /> a general charge of misconduct amounting to bribery and corruption made by two Deputies, Deputy Rooney and Deputy Dillon, whose minds habitually run on these lines.  This idea of bribery and corruption is never far from their minds and is always on their tongue.  I wonder are they holding themselves out as indicating to people that they are on the hazard, that that is what they are thinking of all the time in public and in political life in this country?</P>

      <P>I have no document to produce about Deputy Rooney, but it does look as if he were saying: &ldquo;The fellows on the other side are corrupt. The gentlemen on the other side will accept bribes.  But look at me, what am I doing?&rdquo;  Are we to assume from that that Deputy Rooney is just waiting to be tempted?  Is that why, throughout the whole course of this debate, he has kept up a running commentary about bribery and corruption? A man should not advertise himself in that way.  He should be a little discreet, because, after all, one day or another, temptation might catch up with him and then he might fall just as any other persons might fall if they were tempted beyond their strength and they were seeking dangerous occasions.</P>
      <P>I was saying that this debate opened with complete disregard for facts.  We had that evidenced in Deputy Dillon's speech.  Deputy Dillon alleged that the remission of this tax would benefit individuals who were very small in number.  Prompted by Deputy O'Higgins, he said that there were only 140 proprietors of dance halls in this country.  If Deputy Dillon had been concerned to base his case upon facts, he would have regard to an answer given to a parliamentary question at the end of April last, and he would see there that there are almost 1,300 licensed dance halls in this country.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; says Deputy Morrissey, but Deputy Morrissey is a little bit like Deputy O'Higgins.  Deputy O'Higgins has no regard for language either.  This tax is not a tax on dance halls.  A tax on dance halls was what Deputy O'Donnell was advocating.  This tax is levied on payments for admission to any ball or dance.  I never yet heard any proprietor of a dance hall paying a tax on behalf of the customers.  When the entertainment duty for admission to cinemas was increased, no person alleged then that the tax was to be paid by the proprietors of the cinema. On the contrary, the Fine Gael people and the groups who composed the Coalition went around suborning every proprietor of a cinema in this country to display on his screen an announcement: &ldquo;If you object to the increase in entertainment duty for admission to a cinema, go and see your T.D. about it, because you are to pay it.&rdquo;  When the tax was reduced the price of admission was reduced.  What is the use of trying to say that what applied in the case of the cinemas does not hold in the case of the dance halls?</P>

      <P>It is clear that there was some discussion, that the cinema proprietors did not conduct this propaganda campaign on behalf of Fine Gael for nothing, that there was some consideration to be given for this first-class publicity which was given to them during the 1948 election.  Therefore, from that I conclude that just as Fine Gael were not above taking a contribution from the publicans towards their campaign funds, neither were they above taking a contribution from the cinema proprietors, including of course the big British subsidiary which controls all the most important cinemas in this State, any more than the Labour Party were some years ago above taking a contribution from a big oil company in this country which was a subsidiary of a British oil company.</P>

      <P>In some cases there has to be a sort of composition.  The organisers of these dances, particularly where functions are run by clubs or other bodies and where the means of the people for whom they are catering are limited, very often, as has been pointed out, have to carry the tax themselves and to that extent the returns which they secure from the functions are correspondingly diminished. In general, in so far as dance halls running <Col N="1011" /> proprietary dances are concerned the tax is paid by the person who patronises the dance hall.  I am told, and I know it for a fact, that in the City of Dublin the competition between dance-hall proprietors is so keen that inevitably this remission will be passed on to the public.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may make that statement but I am sorry to say that, in doing so, he has abandoned his customary sense of responsibility. It is difficult because of the complete disregard for facts, and even for words, which has characterised the course of this debate to answer all the points that have been made.  We were told that the one reason why this section is objected to is because we could have done so much more with the money.  Deputy Declan Costello made that case.  He told us we could have done much better with the £140,000.  To whom did he refer?  He referred to the old age pensioners, to widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions, to those who are in receipt of tuberculosis allowances.  One would think that Deputy Declan Costello had not been in this House during the last two months when we were putting through the Social Welfare Bill which was has now become an Act of the Oireachtas.  Indeed, if one did think that, one would probably be right because the one thing that characterised the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill was the complete lack of interest in its provisions <Col N="1012" /> manifested by the Fine Gael Opposition. They boycotted the discussion. Now they come in and begin to weep crocodile tears on this Finance Bill because of the old age pensioners and because of the widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions and the persons in receipt of unemployment assistance. Each and every one of these classes has been dealt with and will be dealt with before this remission becomes a fact.</P>

Anybody looking at Deputy MacBride to-night, shedding crocodile tears for the Old I.R.A. pensioners, would scarcely believe that he was ever a member of a Government which passed into law a Bill increasing the amount of every public pension but deliberately excluded from the ambit of the Act those who were in receipt of military service pensions.  The pensions of civil servants up to a limit of £450 per annum were increased.  The pensions of ex-Gardaí were increased. <Col N="1013" /> The pensions of ex-Army personnel were increased.  In fact the pensions of certain classes of the R.I.C. were increased.  The only class which was deliberately excluded from the 1950 Act was the Old I.R.A.

      <P>I was saying that I had seldom listened to a more lamentable display of ignorance in regard to the statute law of the country than I listened to to-day from Deputy MacBride. Deputy MacBride, in attempting to justify the letter to which I have referred, said that horse racing was heavily subsidised out of public funds.  Of course, that is not so. Horse racing is not subsidised out of public funds.  It is subsidised out of a levy of 10 per cent. imposed on the totalisator pool.  The totalisator is not a public fund.  The 10 per cent. from the totalisator pool is taken to cover the cost of running the totalisator, and the balance is utilised by the Racing Board to provide improved accommodation for the patrons of racing and enhanced prizes in stakes for horse racing.  But the totalisator, again, is not a public fund.  The levy on the totalisator pool is supplemented by a levy on bets with bookmakers taken on race courses.  These levies are not part of the public funds.  They do not go into the Exchequer, but they go to the Racing Board.  The Racing Board is an independent body of control, set up here for the purpose of encouraging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the other hand, against that there is a levy imposed on bookmakers who are responsible for collecting it from their patrons&mdash;that is, on bets placed on the race course. But it is imposed by the Racing Board, and is collected by the Racing Board. The full disposal of that fund is under the control of the Racing Board and does not come into the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>This is just another example of the manner in which Deputy MacBride will trade on the ignorance of his audience in order to deceive them in relation to a critical fact.  However, I do not want to go further into that except to say that the argument which Deputy MacBride used to-day in order to extenuate his conduct in writing that letter to which reference has been made was in order to show that the transaction was in his mind perfectly open and above board.  I am not prepared to say that it was not.  The only thing I am saying is this, that it was no better or no worse than the letter which was written by the Secretary of the Dance Hall Proprietors' Association&mdash;no better and no worse.  I am not putting it on any other plane than that.  I do not think that there was in either case anything culpable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Deputy, at that time, was going up and down the country making allegations of corruption against the then Government, and I had in my possession this letter. I read the terms of it.  It was not a very happily phrased letter and was obviously written by a gentleman who was not aware of the sinister significance that might be attached to his words.  But, in any event, since Deputy MacBride was accusing the Government of corruption, I asked him if the letter which his friend had issued indicated that Deputy MacBride and his Party were corrupt.  I did not suggest that they were.  I put the question to Deputy MacBride to answer as I am putting it to him to-night.</P>

      <P>I am asked to tell the country why I am taking the tax off?  Because, as I have said, it is an anomalous tax.  It is a tax which runs completely counter to the whole character of the entertainments tax. I have here in my hand the terms of it. You can play tennis, you can play rugby, you can engage in all-in wrestling, you can box and swim and play hurling, you can play football, you can witness an exhibition of aeronautics and you will not be taxed.  But if, as I have said, you take your wife to a dance you will pay tax on the admission fee.  There is no sense in that, and there is no logic in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, you were the gentlemen who reduced the tax on the cinemas.  We did increase the tax on the cinemas.  Apparently, it was all very well for the Coalition Government to reduce the tax on cinemas when they came into office, and it is all wrong for us to reduce the tax on dances.  Mind you, the proceeds of the entertainments duty on dances are taken, as has been pointed out, very often from small clubs&mdash;very often from small people who are running these dances for public purposes.  If one wished to express oneself in the same way as the Opposition have been expressing themselves on this section, one could say that, when the entertainments duty on cinemas was reduced, somebody was placing hundreds of thousands of pounds in the pockets of the cinema proprietors, and that at the same time they would not increase the Old I.R.A. pensions or make better provision for widows.  That is absurd. and I am not putting forward that as an argument, but only to show how absurd is the position which the Opposition has taken up in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying when I started that the general tone of the Opposition speeches in relation to this <Col N="1018" /> matter had no regard either for facts or figures, or for the value of words. Let us take Deputy Corish.  Deputy Corish, like Deputy Rooney, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Higgins, does not know what the incidence of this tax is.  When Deputy Cowan was speaking I think Deputy Corish kept up a running train of interruptions. When Deputy Cowan pointed out that football clubs very often run these dances Deputy Corish got up after him and said that Gaelic Athletic Association dances were exempt.  That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not run dances.  It is against their rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they run dances or céilidhes they are not exempt.  Gaelic Athletic Association social functions are not exempt from entertainments duty on dances.  They fall under Section 14.  What the Deputies in the Opposition are now contending for is that the Gaelic Athletic Association social functions, whether or not they are run as céilidhes and old-time dances, will pay entertainments duty unless Section 14 goes through.  That is the point.  The Opposition are contending also that even a debating society, to which Deputy Rooney occasionally might have resort, a literary society, an ordinary students' society in a college, or any such society, which runs a public dance and invites outside people to it will have to pay the entertainments duty.  That is what you gentlemen are contending for.  However, that is not all.  If you happen to live in a town or a village the population of which does not exceed 500 you will not have to pay tax, but if the population of a village happens to be 501 then you must pay tax if you go to a dance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind two or three places where, since the last census, persons who patronise dances will have to pay the duty on going into the dance.  Let us see what else the members of the Opposition are contending for.  It has been suggested here during the course of the debate that, after all, this is going to apply only to the large towns and cities.  I think Deputy Rooney kept <Col N="1019" /> harping that dances are not going to be taxed in the rural areas.  Let us see what, in fact, is the position in regard to County Dublin.  I think Deputy Rooney represents, among other places, Finglas.  He is now contending that all dances held in Finglas, Rush, Skerries, Windy Arbour &mdash; I do not know for certain whether or not he represents Windy Arbour &mdash; Finglas Bridge and Baldoyle, will be subject to the dance tax and all dances held within three miles of those centres will be subject to that tax.  That is how he has regard for the social amenities of life in rural Ireland.  He wants the boys and girls, who are paying their humble 2/6 to go into the dance, to be liable to pay entertainments duty on the amount which they pay for admission.</P>

That little ticket is the Revenue Commissioners' ticket.  It has already been bought and paid for.  It is the Revenue Commissioners who collect the money, and you have to make your deposit before you get a roll of tickets.  The tickets are solemnly dished out to you <Col N="1020" /> as you go in.  There is no use smiling. That is a fact.  There is no use in any person telling me that, under that system, the patron does not pay the tax on the price of his admission to the dance.</P>

      <P>That tax varies.  If the admission is 1/8, but does not exceed 2/-, then, in addition to the 2/-, another 6d. tax is charged.  That makes a total payment of 2/6 on the part of the person going into the dance hall, of which tax represents 25 per cent.  What Deputy Rooney and Deputy Cafferky and all the other members of the Fine Gael and the Labour Parties who represent rural areas are contending for now is that every working boy and working girl&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now let us see how many people there are who are going to be mulcted in this way if the Opposition have their way in this Budget.  There are no less than 1,200,000 people in the State living in towns of 500 persons and upwards.  Within the 2,900,000 men, women and children in this country at present, 1,200,000 are living in centres of population of 500 and upwards&mdash;and how many more are living within a radius of three miles of such a town?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins was one of the people who suggested that the remission of this tax would only benefit the people in the towns and the cities.  Deputy O'Higgins must be aware of the fact that there are in his constituency Portlaoighise, Mountmellick, Portarlington, Mountrath, Rathangan, Stradbally, Abbeyleix, Tullamore, Birr, Edenderry, Clara, Philipstown and Banagher.  Any person going to a dance in any one of these towns or to any place within three miles of any one of these towns would have to pay the dance tax levied at the rate of 25 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what he was advocating.</P>

    <P>I do not think there was any other point, in fact, made by anyone.  Oh, <Col N="1023" /> yes.  I cannot forget Deputy O'Donnell. Deputy O'Donnell comes from a very interesting constituency in this regard. Deputy O'Donnell comes from Donegal County and Deputy O'Donnell wanted us to believe that, after all, this did not affect dance halls in his constituency. He started off by saying that this did not affect dance halls in his constituency.  Here are the towns of his constituency of population of 500 and upwards&mdash;not in his constituency but in the whole County of Donegal: Letterkenny, Buncrana, Ballyshannon &mdash;Deputy O'Donnell wants the people of Ballyshannon to be taxed every time they go to a dance.</P>

      <P>Here is a very interesting point which Deputy O'Donnell put up to us.  He was urging, of course, that the dance halls ought to be revalued, and that the dance-hall proprietors ought to be compelled to pay upon this valuation.  I do not know how they could be revalued in any way which would increase their existing valuation, because they are at the moment valued strictly in accordance with law.</P>

      <P>The suggestion now is that the incidence of this tax should be shifted from the patron of the dance to the proprietor of the dance hall.  It is strange that those who have made that suggestion have not seen that they were giving their own case away because Deputy O'Donnell, like Deputy Rooney, was one of those who contended that the incidence of this tax did not fall upon the patron of the dance and that, therefore, he would get no benefit if a tax were remitted. Deputy O'Donnell, on the other hand, quite clearly recognised that the patron of the dance hall would get a benefit if this tax were remitted.  He wanted the matter dealt with in the other way. Listen to what it was.  It was that the dance-hall proprietor would be taxed, not the patron &mdash; and that he should be taxed on the valuation of his dance hall.  There is another Act on the Statute Book, an Act passed by a Fianna Fáil Government also.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell wants us to levy a tax on the valuation of a dance hall.  What would be the effect of that?  If, by any chance, we were to do as he suggested, to levy the tax at an enhanced rate, an increased rate, an undue rate, on the dance hall, they would come in here and they would be squealing about the <Col N="1025" /> poor dance-hall proprietor in just the same way as they are squealing at the moment about the poor publican.</P>
      <P>We heard quite a lot of complaints from the Opposition about the fact that the Commissioner of Valuation has been revaluing licensed premises which have been improved in later years and because these improved premises are, naturally, valued at a higher figure than they were before the improvements, renovations and reconstructions were carried out, the valuations went up; the local authority gets more out of the rates; we get some small increase in income-tax and in licence duty.  But, the point about it is that, the moment it is done, the Opposition come in here squealing about it and they say it is unfair that a man should be taxed if he improves his premises. But, it is not unfair, apparently, according to Deputy O'Donnell, to tax a dance-hall proprietor if he improves his dance hall, if he provides proper sanitation and proper amenities.  Then he is going to be taxed, according to Deputy O'Donnell's plan, more heavily. If he is content to go along with any sort of old shack or barn, which would be a menace and danger to the public health, then, of course, he gets scot-free from Deputy O'Donnell's method of tax.  The one thing which would happen in that case would be that, if we were to tax 1,200 or 1,300 dance-hall proprietors according to their valuation, the tax would fall most heavily upon the halls which, from a public health point of view and other points of view, are the most desirable to have in the country and the shacks and the disused barns and other such buildings would go scot-free.  That is Deputy O'Donnell's proposal to brighten and improve the amenities of rural life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, we have this other proposal. Deputy O'Donnell told us that he was acting for a considerable number of dance-hall proprietors in Donegal. He said that solicitors had to collect £2 licence fees.  That £2 licence fee does not come to the State at all. I think it goes to the local authority. It is the ordinary registration fee which is payable, again, under the Public Dance Hall Act, which was <Col N="1026" /> passed by a Fianna Fáil Government, one of the minor reforms which we carried out in an endeavour to ensure that, so far as dance halls existed in the rural areas or in any part of the country, they would be safe from the point of view of fire, that they would be as hygienic and as acceptable from a public health point of view as was possible in the circumstances of the areas in which they were built.  The whole effect of this would be that these 20 dance-hall proprietors for whom Deputy O'Donnell operates would of course have to pay the licence duty. What would happen?  Do you think they would pay it out of their own pocket? Does anyone believe that a publican in Dublin pays the licence duty on his premises out of his own pocket? Would not all of this be passed back on to the shoulders of the patrons, with of course the added profit that the dance-hall proprietor would feel that he would have to charge on his outlay?  That is not the position in relation to the dance tax.  The proprietor does not get anything for collecting the tax because the tax is paid by the patron of the dance hall.  In the reverse situation, if you have the incidence of the tax put on the dance-hall proprietor, the dance hall proprietor pays it out of his pocket and inevitably he will pass it on as part of his charges, in the same way as he passes on rates, rents and the cost of his licence, to the patron.  The patron again will be mulcted and it will not be the dance-hall proprietor.  There is, therefore, no advantage from the point of view of the dance-hall patron in accepting the proposal made by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter before concluding.  Deputy Cowan and Deputy Kennedy have brought out the point well.  Mind you, the vast majority of the halls which are licensed for dancing in this country are not proprietary halls in the sense that they are not halls in which dances are run by the owners of the hall for their own private profit.  They are, in general, halls which are vested in one public society or another.  They are parish halls, club halls or trade union halls&mdash;halls which are let out by various organisations to groups of <Col N="1027" /> people who want to run dances in order to raise funds for one desirable purpose or another, such as a football club, a dramatic society or one or other of these organisations which cater for the social life of the common people of Ireland.  That is one of the most regrettable features of the attitude which the Opposition have taken up.  If you are living in the City of Dublin and you move in certain social circles, it does not matter very much, if you are going to one of the fashionable ballrooms and you have to pay an admission fee of 15/- or a £1, whether 3/- or 4/- dance tax is added to the price of your ticket.  It is a very different matter, as every Deputy knows who has had any association or is familiar with social conditions in the towns and villages or working-class districts, where you are paying 2/6, 3/- <Col N="1028" /> or 3/6 to go into a dance.  It is these people, the working-class people of the country, who paid the greater share of this tax we collected.  Out of the £140,000 revenue, I venture to say that at least £100,000 was collected from what you may describe as workers, urban workers and rural workers throughout Ireland.  That is what the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are contending that we should continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a principle in the American Customs code, which was originally introduced nominally for the purpose of getting an <i>ad valorem</i> duty assessed on imports and which in the judgment of the equivalent of the Revenue Commissioners here would equitably fulfil the purpose of the original tax instrument.</P>
      <P>Therefore, under that the Revenue Commissioners were authorised to determine arbitrarily the nature of an import. Out of that there grew the administrative practice of fixing the <i>ad valorem</i> duty on an imported article at the rate which applied to that element in the finished article which carried the highest rate of duty. Therefore, we might have an <i>ad valorem</i> duty fixed on gloves of 25 per cent. and an <i>ad valorem</i> duty on buttons of 100 per cent. whereupon the Revenue Commissioners, or their equivalent in the United States of America, asserted and subsequently established their right to assess the duty on gloves at the rate appropriate to buttons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as I understand the Minister's explanation of this new section, if a firm in Great Britain has a subsidiary in Ireland and they consign to their subsidiary for sale or processing in Ireland a commodity which is genuinely invoiced as between the principal and the subsidiary at 10s. per unit, we seek to vest in the Revenue Commissioners the right to say: &ldquo;If this firm had been invoicing these goods to somebody other than their subsidiary in Ireland they would have set out the price in the invoice at 17/6 per unit; therefore, although in  <Col N="1032" /> the Irish subsidiary will only pay the principal in England 10/- for its articles, we shall assess the duty on the assumption that they will pay 17/6 for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless some grave abuse exists, it seems to me to be a dangerous principle to introduce charging the Revenue Commissioners with the task not only of satisfying themselves that the invoices submitted are genuine and honest records of the sale and purchase relating to the goods to be taxed but also giving them the right to say: &ldquo;Although we are satisfied that the trade documents submitted are valid and true, we assert that had this transaction taken place between you and a third party you would have charged a different price and we will levy the duty on what we arbitrarily say you would have charged if you had invoiced these goods to somebody else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot quite see at the moment how far that principle can be expanded administratively.  Does it create a situation in which the proof of the validity of documents submitted to the Revenue Commissioners goes by the board and will anybody bringing goods in here now be liable to find himself in the situation that obtains in the United States of America where, although his documents are perfectly valid and true, that is no guarantee whatsoever that he can foresee what rate of duty he will have to pay because the Revenue Commissioners say that the invoiced price should be twice what is actually charged and accordingly levy customs duty at that rate?</P>
    <P>Do I correctly interpret the effect of this section?  If I do, does not the Minister think that this is creating an entirely new precedent so far as our system of revenue collection is concerned? Does it not introduce an element of uncertainty into our external trade, such an element as undoubtedly obtains in the United States of America, and which has been an occasion of very great hardship to those seeking to trade with that country, and which may become a similar circumstance of hardship for those trading with this?  Surely it is a sound principle of taxation that taxes should be certain and uniform in reso <Col N="1033" /> pect of everybody who becomes subject to them.  Does not this section introduce an entirely new principle?  Does it not provide that taxes shall be neither uniform nor universal but at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners, and that there shall be a special distinction made in respect of any exporters to this country upon whom they choose to levy an exceptional duty?</P>

      <P>This matter would have been over in very much less time if it had not been for the Minister's deliberate attempt to suppress the truth. Here is the position.  Speaking in this House on the 6th June on the Finance Bill, as reported at column 867, the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would advise Deputy O'Leary to go and see how much the Labour Party got from certain oil interests in this country in 1935 and 1936.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening the Minister repeated that statement in even more deliberate language, when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... that some years ago the Labour Party were not above taking a contribution from a big oil company in this country which was a subsidiary of a British oil company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the two statements made by the Minister, one in the Official Report from which I have quoted, and the other, an extract from a speech made this evening.  I only want to say this, that nobody can make these statements without knowing that they were deliberate falsehoods.</P>
      <P>No contribution of any kind whatever was ever made to the Labour Party by an oil company, a British subsidiary, or any type of oil company. Not one farthing was ever received by the Labour Party from any such concern.  That is a positive statement. If the Minister wants the matter put to the test, he has an easy way of doing it.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister now to get any judge of any court in this country to investigate the funds of the Labour Party and their accounts, which will be made available, which will prove conclusively that that is a deliberate falsehood.  Secondly, I invite the Minister to make that charge personally outside the privilege of this House against any member of the Labour Party, so that the case can be decided in the court.  Then we shall have the truth established.</P>
      <P>I want to deny categorically the statements which the Minister made. They are a gross perversion of the truth.  They are deliberate falsehoods which could have been made only by a Minister who washes his tongue so frequently in the cesspool of filth.</P>

      <P>When this matter arose we were discussing the comparative revenue administrations of Belgium, the United States and the Republic of Ireland with a view to determining what exactly the Minister had in mind and whether I was right in believing that this section operated to introduce a new principle into our revenue law which, were it expanded indefinitely, would be open to abuse.  I think the Minister will understand that the section is a long and comprehensive section with a schedule attached.  He tells us that it is made in pursuance of a Belgian Convention.  I do not apologise to the House when I admit that I am not familiar with the convention to which the Minister refers.  I should be grateful to him if he would give us, in some greater detail than he has thought necessary so far, information as to what kind of situations this is intended to deal with and in how far we control its operation by the terms of the section he submits.</P>

      <P>I was listening.  I have not heard what it means.  The question was asked whether this was something new&mdash;whether it was a new principle and, if not, then what did it replace.  I should like again to make the point I thought I had made clear enough to the Minister.  Section 15 nowhere is in reference to any other section of any other.  Finance Act.  The Schedule does not mention any other Finance Act.  It appears, therefore, that neither the section nor the Schedule repeal any other section of the Finance Act.  I understand, therefore, <Col N="1041" /> that that is something which has been introduced for the first time.  If that is not so, then it is an amendment of or a substitution for something previously in force.  Where do we find the section that is substituted by this? Surely I am entitled to know that. Where is that substitution?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is anxious to get this information.  I gave it to him before.  He asked if we were introducing any new principle.  I said no.  I said that hitherto the principle was that <i>ad valorem</i> duties should be based on the price of the goods to a typical independent importer.  I then went on to describe that there were cases in what were known as &ldquo;house-to-house&rdquo; transactions in which the importer may be an agent for an outside supplier and in which the duty, if levied on these house-to-house invoices, would not be levied on the true value.  I said that no section was proposed to be repealed.  It was not necessary to repeal any section but the existing section, which is amplified and expressed more precisely, which is, so to speak, contained within the proposed new section is Section 25 of the Finance Act of 1938.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 34 of the Finance Act, 1933 (No. 15 of 1933), is hereby repealed and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the value of any article or goods for any of the purposes of this Act or any other Act (whether passed before or after this Act) relating to the customs or of any Order relating to the customs heretofore or hereafter made under any Act (whether passed before or after this Act) shall, in the absence of provision to the contrary, be taken to be the price which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I trust this fully answers Deputy Dillon:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;an importer would give for such article or goods if such article or goods were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond at the place of importation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the principle to which Section <Col N="1042" /> 15 proposes to give effect.  The manner in which the value of the imported goods shall be computed is set out in the Third Schedule.  Subsection (1) defines that: &ldquo;The value of any imported goods shall be taken to be the normal price, that is to say, the price which they would fetch at the time when they are entered for home consumption (or, if they are not so entered, the time of importation), on a sale in the open market between buyer and seller independent of each other.&rdquo;  That is the basis upon which it has been usual&mdash;&mdash; A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was asked a question.  I shall sit down until this conversation is ended.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  Deputy Dillon was not the interrogator in this case.  It happened to be Deputy McGilligan.  He was so interested in the information which he pressed me to give him that he has been engaging in a running conversation with Deputy Corish while I was replying to his question.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is not necessary to repeal it, as the Deputy will see.  Shall I read the paragraph of sub-section (1) of Section 15 so that I may call the Deputy's attention to the significant words?</P>

      <P>It has been a practice of long standing, where the precise amount of customs duty payable on goods imported is difficult to determine, to allow the delivery of the goods to take place on the security of a deposit covering the approximate amount of duty, the deposit being subsequenlty adjusted when the proper duty has been determined.  The purpose of this section is to give more precise legal sanction for that practice.</P>
