      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the index numbers for gross agricultural output for the years 1949, 1950 and 1951, also if he will state the index numbers for net agricultural output for the same years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>To base 1938-39 =100 the index numbers of the volume of gross agricultural output, including turf, for the years 1949 and 1950 are 99.7 and 96.0 respectively.  The corresponding index numbers of net agricultural output are 102.2 and 95.7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that the figures supplied by him for native wheat delivered to mills in each year from 1935 to 1950 do not correspond with the figures supplied to Deputy Vivion de Valera by the Minister for Agriculture (Official Debates, Volume 125, No. 10, column 1537) and whether he will explain the discrepancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the differences referred to.  They are due to the fact that the particulars of native wheat delivered to millers in each year from 1935-36 to 1950-51 supplied in reply to the Deputy's question on 30th January, 1952, represent total deliveries to flour millers, wheaten-meal millers and permit holders for conversion into flour and wheatemeal, whereas the figures supplied to Deputy de Valera on 25th April, 1951, by the Minister for Agriculture (Official Debates, Volume 125, No. 10, column 1537) referred to deliveries to flour millers only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been drawn to an article in a provincial newspaper of the 29th January, 1952, regarding the export of <Col N="369" /> industrial alcohol to Great Britain in which it was stated that the export of this commodity would result in an ultimate reduction in the price of petrol in view of the fact that petrol companies had paid a price in the region of 10/- per gallon for industrial alcohol; and that the standard of petrol in Munster would not be affected as the petrol-alcohol mixture had been generally sold in the Dublin area while petrol was imported to the South of Ireland directly; and, if so, whether he will state what justification there was for persons purchasing petrol in the South of Ireland having to pay a higher price than that paid in the Dublin area, particularly in view of the fact that this petrol does not contain industrial alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper article to which the Deputy refers.  The differential of 1d. per gallon between the price of petrol in the Dublin zone and in other areas is in accordance with a long-standing trade custom and it has not been considered necessary to interfere with the practice for the purpose of price control. This differential is not affected by the use of industrial alcohol as the prices fixed for petrol have been calculated on the basis of averaging the cost of industrial alcohol with that of the total quantity of petrol imported into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to state (a) that petrol is coming in directly to the South, (b) that industrial alcohol is mixed with the petrol in Dublin, the industrial alcohol roughly costing 10/-per gallon?  If so, and if petrol is coming into the South, why is it that people purchasing petrol in the South are victimised to the extent of having to pay 1d. per gallon more than the people around the Dublin area for petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential of a penny between Dublin and elsewhere has always persisted and is based upon calculations of the oil companies that it costs less to distribute petrol in the Dublin area than elsewhere. It has nothing whatever to do with the admixture of industrial <Col N="370" /> alcohol.  So far as the sale of blended spirit is concerned there are no restrictions on the petrol companies as to where they may sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to state that the people in the South are at the mercy of these petrol companies because it suits them to charge more to the people in the South than in the Midlands or in the Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather the reverse. It is possible to charge a cheaper price in Dublin because the costs of distribution in Dublin are less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to answer the Questions Nos. 28-31 together.</P>
      <P>The question as to the suitability of milled peat for use in the firing of boilers at electricity generating stations has been under examination for a long time.  There have been consultations on the subject between Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board, and recently it has been dealt with in reports submitted by the representative of a firm of consultants engaged under the E.C.A.  Technical Assistance Project. Having considered the results of the examination I decided that certain bogs which are being prepared to provide fuel for generating stations should be developed for the production of milled peat, and this decision was applied in the case of the Boora bogs, where development for sod turf production had commenced but had not been completed.  It is not correct that hundreds of men formerly employed at Boor have been dismissed.  No workers have been dismissed recently at Boora.  Some of the workers residing in the hostel have been transferred to other works of Bord na Móna where they are required, and it is intended to transfer the remainder of the men accommodated in the hostel to other bogs where hostel accommodation is available and where their services are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the change over to milled peat, it has become possible at present to continue development work solely with local labour and, consequently, <Col N="378" /> as further labour is required, it is the board's intention to recruit local workers so long as the numbers available locally are adequate to meet the board's needs.  Heavy machinery transferred from Lullymore works to Boora went into operation on the 11th of the present month and further machinery will be transferred from Lullymore during this week.  The estimated cost of the full development of the Boora bog for the production of sod turf was £1,150,000, of which the actual expenditure to date is approximately £500,000.  While it is estimated that about £150,000 of this expenditure could be regarded as unproductive as a result of the recent decision to change over to milled peat, the savings on production costs using the milled peat methods will, over the life of the Boora bogs proper, amount to at least £2,500,000.  When adjacent bogs in the Boora basin are brought into production, the total estimated saving over the life of the bogs which will be affected by the change over to milled peat will amount to an over-all figure estimated at £4,000,000.  This saving arises from the fact that the work is fully mechanised.  Apart from this considerable saving in money, the milled peat process presents the prospect of a solution of other problems, including that of labour supply anticipated in connection with this development.</P>

I have mentioned that if the decision to use milled peat had been taken before work started on the bog a saving of £150,000 might have been achieved.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I removed control over the price of milk in the areas outside the Dublin and Cork sale districts on the recommendations of the Prices Advisory Body.  In taking this action I had in mind numerous representations which I had received concerning serious local shortages of milk in various parts of the country due to the belief amongst producers that the price fixed during winter months was uneconomic.  This course was also recommended to me by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises now that the effect of the decontrol has been to increase the price of milk. Large numbers of people cannot now buy as much milk as they were able to buy formerly and that will affect the poorer sections of the community, who are worse off than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="381" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite correct.  The matter came up for consideration (1) following representations from the public in respect of their inability to get supplies of milk because of the withdrawal of people from the business, and (2) following an application from the organisation of milk producers for an increased price.  The matter was referred to the Prices Advisory Body who, having considered the application, recommended decontrol.  It was contemplated that decontrol would be followed by an increase in price, generally, but it was thought that decontrol would mean that prices would be adjusted more accurately to local conditions in that way than by making a general Order for the whole country.  While the position in one or two districts is being investigated, I think I should say that the increase which has taken place is not less than what the Prices Advisory Body would have recommended if the decision had been to maintain control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now no ceiling whatever.  It is just left to the rapacity of the local producer to get what he can from those who must buy milk. In this country, which does not consume as much milk as should be consumed, compared with other countries in Europe, large sections of our people will now be deprived of even the small quantity which they used to consume up to now.  The effect of this Order is that the people who need milk most will get less.  Is that desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with what the Deputy says.  It is recognised that any increase in price must have an adverse reaction on consumers.  The position is that large supplies of liquid milk were not available at all in parts of the country.  I think that that situation would have extended if no action had been taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am advised that large-scale removals of sand from this foreshore would accelerate the natural erosion which is taking place.  In order to avoid the hardship which a total prohibition on the removals of sand might cause to the local farming community, licences are granted to farmers living in 16 adjoining townlands authorising them to make limited removals of sand to fertilise their lands. Having regard to the damage from erosion which might be caused to land adjacent to the foreshore by an extension of these concessions, I regret that it is not possible to grant licences to farmers resident in the areas mentioned in the question.  Licences may, however, be obtained on application for removal of sand from the White Strand at Killeen about three miles distant from Glenbeg.</P>

Issues for Supply Services during the nine months ended on that date amounted to £64,268,429 and included an estimated £6,250,000 for voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; under the headings set out in the 1951 Budget Statement.  I cannot admit the propriety of charging all of this expenditure as capital.  The Supply Service issues also included approximately £750,000 in respect of reserve stocks and £2,727,000 paid in discharge of arrears of fuel losses to 31st March, 1951.  Deducting these three items, totalling £9,727,000, from the supply services, we get a figure of £54,541,000, to which has to be added £6,549,000 for Central Fund services making in all £61,090,000, against which revenue <Col N="389" /> amounted to £56,070,000, leaving a minimum deficit of £5,020,000.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, I wonder would the Minister be prepared to clear up one particular point with reference to the Notes.  Did he or did he not formally ask or urge the United States Government, as he has told the Dáil, to sell us arms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a question of what the Deputy means by &ldquo;formally&rdquo;. We did, in one of the Notes, say to the United States Government that the Irish Government was anxious about the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respectfully submit that there is no precedent whatever, <Col N="407" /> if a Note or a series of Notes are not to be presented to the House, for giving <i>ex parte,</i> imperfect and paraphrased extracts from some of the Notes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And, as the Deputy is aware, in America there have been certain references to the Notes that were exchanged.  I had to give here, in reply to a question, certain information about those Notes that had reference to what was published in Washington about those Notes and what had been published in many papers.  I had to give that on the last day, but I think the better course, where Notes pass between two Governments concerning some matter, is that there should be no publication of them at all as a general rule.  The question of the publication of these Notes will have to wait and in that case the reply to Deputy Briscoe's question will have to wait, too.</P>

It is on that point that I should be permitted to put a supplementary question and to get an answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>His distinction has to be won otherwise: by the public example he gives and the standards which he sets, in his family life, in his devotion to duty, in the courage with which he faces the changing fortunes of life, in the extent to which he makes himself a worthy symbol of his people, a rallying <Col N="410" /> point for them in times of danger, and a bond of union in times of adversity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit of advances to the Electricity Supply Board from the Exchequer by £22,000,000&mdash;from the present limit of £36,945,000 to a new limit of £58,945,000. It is estimated that that increase in the advances to the Electricity Supply Board will meet the board's requirements on capital account until 1955. Of the £22,000,000 additional capital provided for the board, approximately £12,500,000 will be spent upon increased generation capacity; £4,000,000 upon extensions of the transmission system: <Col N="413" /> £4,000,000 on distribution; and the balance of £1,500,000 on general purposes and contingencies.</P>
      <P>While that statement I have made is completely accurate, it is perhaps a rather over-simplification of the financial position of the board.  As the House is, I think, aware, it has been the practice of the board to invest its own reserve funds in the undertaking, and in fact at the present time the board's total capital expenditure and commitments on capital account exceed the limits fixed by existing statutes and it is anticipated that by the end of March, 1955, its expenditure and commitments will exceed the limit now being fixed in this Bill.  That is mainly explained by the fact that, in addition to the amounts advanced from the Exchequer, there will be a further investment of the board's own reserves, and also by reason of the fact that capital commitments run ahead of expenditure.</P>
      <P>In preparing the new generating programme of the board for a period roughly ten years ahead regard had to be given to the board's estimates of the increases in demand for electricity that would occur annually during that period.  The present programme now envisaged contemplates that the demand for current will double in the next five years and increase by as much again in the next following five years. It is anticipated that in the present year the board will supply slightly over 1,000,000,000 units.  Their estimate is that the demand will reach 1,075,000,000 units.  The production anticipated from the board's plant for the present year, that is to say the plant which is now working and some new generating sets which will come into operation during the year, is 1,140,000,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that situation appears satisfactory and suggests that the supply of current this year will be ahead of the demand, if not very much ahead of it, it is necessary to qualify that statement in some regards.  The estimated output of the board's stations is, of course, based upon certain expectations as to weather and other conditions this year.  It is normally the practice of the board to calculate the output of electricity from any plant upon the basis of conditions in an average year. <Col N="414" /> Assuming that this is an average year and that the demand for current is on the scale anticipated by the board, then there will be an adequate supply. But, if exceptional conditions of any kind operate either to increase the demand or to reduce the output of the stations, then some period of difficulty might exist.  The position is that the demand for current has grown so rapidly that there is now no question of a stand-by plant and it does not look as if we can make provision for stand-by plant for a considerable number of years ahead.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cause any alarm or to lead people to think that there will be any difficulty in securing electricity for any purpose during the present year.  The board's calculations are as I have given, but I feel that it is reasonably certain that they have been prepared upon a conservative basis and that, subject to abnormal conditions affecting their productive capacity, they will be able to meet this year and the following year, and in fact if the programme we contemplate is fulfilled to date, in every year the demand for current which is anticipated.</P>
    <P>In calculating the output for the present year allowance is made for the coming into operation during the course of the year of four additional generating sets on the Erne producing between them approximately 200,000,000 units of electricity and for the commencement of operation at the Allenwood turf-burning station&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;also for the coming into operation of the Allenwood turf-burning station where two generating sets will be in production producing between them 134,000,000 units.  In preparing the programme for expanding the generating capacity of the board it is necessary to think a fairly long time ahead.  It takes from four to five years to get a new station from the stage of ministerial approval to actual production. <Col N="415" /> I mention that because the expansion of the board's generating capacity during the next four or five years depends entirely upon the completion in time of the new stations approved some years ago and upon which construction work is now proceeding. There is nothing which we can do now, even if it were regarded as necessary, to step up the board's production during that period.  The additional stations which are being considered now and on which the board are beginning to take the necessary preliminary steps will only be available to the board from 1956 or 1957 onwards.</P>
      <P>The position for the next five years, therefore, is that we are dependent on the board's ability to complete the bringing into production of the stations under construction.  These are stations of which, I think, the House is aware because reference has been made to them in previous debates.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the best way to illustrate the board's programme to the House is to indicate the position as it is anticipated it will be in each of these next four or five years.  In the present year, as I have said, the completion of the Erne and Allenwood stations will give the board capacity to meet the anticipated demand.  Next year two additional generating sets at the North Wall generating station will come into production.  As the House is aware, the North Wall station was built upon the site of the boiler house originally constructed in connection with the oil refinery project.  When that project failed, the boiler house was taken over by the board and a rather small power station was built by the board on the adjacent site.  Subsequently, permission was given to the board to extend the station and bring its total capacity to 140,000,000 units.  These two new sets will, it is hoped, come into production next year and that will give the board, it is anticipated, an output under average conditions, of 1,204,000,000 units against an anticipated demand of 1,220,000,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the North Wall, will it be coal or oil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Coal or oil.  In the following year, 1954, the new Cork <Col N="416" /> coal or oil station will come into production. That station, as planned, will have an output of 200,000,000 units. The position in 1954, therefore, is that the board's capacity to generate current in an average year will yield 1,404,000,000 units against an anticipated demand of 1,380,000,000 units.</P>
      <P>In the following year, 1955, the coal and oil station that is being constructed at Ringsend will commence production. At least, two of the three sets which it is intended to install in that station will be in production in that year.  That will bring the total average capacity of the board to 1,604,000,000 units against an anticipated demand of 1,570,000,000 units.  In 1956 the third set at Ringsend will come into production, and, with it, another 100,000,000 units will be added to the board's capacity.  That is the last of the stations in the board's programme as now approved involving the use of coal or oil.</P>
      <P>All the other stations planned up to 1961 are based either upon turf or water power.  In 1956 the Ferbane turf generating station will commence production.  Two generating units will be in operation there producing between them 160,000,000 units, and in that year also the first set of the new generating station contemplated at Bangor-Erris, in Mayo, will also come into production yielding 80,000,000 units.  At the end of 1956, therefore, the position should be, if the programme works out as planned, that there will be an average productive capacity of 1,944,000,000 units against an anticipated demand of 1,780,000,000 units.</P>
      <P>In 1957, the hydro-electric station on the Lee will be in production yielding 60,000,000 units, while the second generating set at the Bangor-Erris station will also commence operation giving another 80,000,000 units, so that the position for five years ahead is that the board will have doubled its generating capacity.  It will have then an average capacity of 2,084,000,000 units.  It is also expected that the demand will be doubled and in that year will reach a total of 2,020,000,000 units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> Deputies will appreciate that the estimates which I have given for the increase in the production capacity of the board are reasonably definite.  If these stations are completed in accordance with the time schedules arranged, then the board will have that capacity and possibly a capacity slightly above the figures which I have quoted, because, again, there has been an element of conservatism in calculating the output of these stations.  The figures which I have quoted as estimates of the probable demand for current are much more speculative. A variety of circumstances can increase or decrease the demand above or below the estimates during that period. Again, I want to emphasise that in the programme as it stands there is no reserve, at least no very substantial reserve, for very bad years or against a substantially higher demand.  While I think the situation is reasonably secure, we have to take into account the possibility of a repetition of the 1933 experience which was the worst year that the board experienced since it was established.  If that should happen, then I think we would be forced to do what we nearly had to do in 1933, and that is to take temporary steps to curtail the consumption of current. But a year like that, according to the records, does not occur more than twice in a century, and it is a reasonable prospect that in these five years the board will be able to meet fully the demand for current, the rapidly expanding demand for current, during that period.</P>
    <P>As I have intimated, it is necessary now to take decisions regarding the programme for the next following five years.  Although that programme has been drawn up, I intend to avoid giving anything in the nature of firm dates for the completion of individual projects, first, because any such information would be of doubtful value, having regard to the unpredictable things that might happen during the next five years, and second because I have asked the board to consider whether there is any action which they could take which could bring forward any of these new stations in their programme, any action which they could take, and which would <Col N="418" /> permit them, to have them completed and in production earlier than is at present anticipated.  Work upon these additional stations is either in preparation or in progress.  In the remaining cases, the constructional work must commence within a year or two, and in so far as the programme includes stations which are designed to use turf then the bog development work must begin also within those years.</P>
    <P>The programme for the next following five years, as it stands at present, includes the following: there are four hydro-electric stations, at least four new developments based on water power.  One is the installation of an additional generating set at Ardnacrusha. The House is aware that an extension of Ardnacrusha was contemplated at the time of its construction, but various considerations in subsequent years made it clear that additional generating capacity could be secured more economically in other directions than by installing a fifth unit at Ardnacrusha.  That situation is now changed.  In fact, I think it is true to say that, by far, the most economical method of producing electric power at present, and that situation is not likely to change during the years ahead, is by water power.  That additional generating set at Ardnacrusha will yield 15,000,000 units.  There is a project for developing the Avonmore River in County Wicklow, where two generating sets, producing about 35,000,000 units, will be installed.  The board also have prepared plans for the development of the Boyne with an estimated output of about 50,000,000 units.  I should, perhaps, say that the board are having second thoughts about the wisdom of proceeding with the Boyne.  The inclusion of a station on the Boyne in the programme must not, therefore, be taken as definite. It stands in the programme at present, but the board have intimated to me that there are reasons why they would like to think over the matter again before finally deciding on it.</P>
    <P>There is the development of the Clady river in Donegal from which 12,500,000 units are assumed.  The other stations in the programme are all steam stations designed to burn turf. <Col N="419" /> I mentioned that the Ferbane station would be in operation in 1956 with two generating sets, but it is contemplated that later, as other bogs in the locality are developed for the production of more turf, two additional sets will be installed at that station, capable of producing between them 160,000,000 units per year.  Similarly, it is proposed to extend the present station at Portarlington by the installation of two additional generating sets capable of producing 45,000,000 units per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite an accurate picture of the present position. The board has not failed to delivery to the Portarlington station the quantity of turf contemplated when the station was being built.  What has happened is that the capacity of the Portarlington station has proved to be substantially greater than the original estimate, so that a greater quantity of turf is required to get the maximum output, and that created a temporary problem, accentuated last year by reason of the fact that there was a strike of the board's workers at a critical period of the turf-producing season; but the Deputy may take it that all the plans for additional turf-burning stations have been prepared in full agreement with Bord na Móna and they have committed themselves to completing their development in each area in time to ensure the delivery to the Electricity Supply Board of the full quantity of turf necessary to achieve these outputs I am quoting.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to ask the Minister a &ldquo;smart-Alec&rdquo; question, but he says that the capacity of the station to consume turf was under-estimated.

      <P>Reviewing the programme involving turf-burning stations, I mentioned two additional sets at Ferbane and Portarlington. It is contemplated also that there will be a further development at Bangor-Erris.  The first stage of development of Bangor-Erris involves the installation there of the two sets I have mentioned as coming into operation in 1956 or 1957, but subsequently a further development of that station is contemplated, involving the installation of two more sets, with a capacity between them of 160,000,000 units per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am going to deal with that later.  There is another turf-burning station to be established in the area of Edenderry-Daingean in Offaly, in the neighbourhood of what is known as Derrygreenagh bog.  That also will have a capacity of 160,000,000 units per year and a further station is included in the programme in Mayo, at a location east of Ballina. near Gowlan in that county, with a capacity of 80,000,000 units per year.  When all <Col N="421" /> these stations which, subject to what I have said about the Boyne, have been definitely decided upon, are completed, by 1960 or 1961, the total capacity of the board's stations in an average year will be 2,800,000,000 units, but if the board's estimate of the growth of demand in that period is correct, they will not be enough to meet the full demand and they will have to be supplemented by other stations yet to be decided upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or thereabouts. The board have in mind, however, the possibility of developing a number of smaller rivers.  A list of some ten or 12 smaller rivers has been shown to me on which the board think it is possible to establish hydro-power stations of varying capacities.  They explained that their difficulty in proceeding with these stations was the burden upon their own planning staff by reason of the heavy programme I have outlined and I have suggested to them that they should consider the possibility of entrusting the development of these ten or 12 smaller rivers to commercial firms &mdash;entrusting them in full, from the planning stage to the actual placing of the construction contracts.  They have told me that they consider that course to be practicable and are giving it further examination now.  If that proves to be so, the construction of these ten or 12 smaller hydro-power stations upon the selected rivers will be proceeding simultaneously with the development of the board's own programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot be definite that in any particular case power development will be practicable.  The board have done little more than carry out a general survey which suggests that the development of these rivers for power purposes can be undertaken, but of course, when the actual planning of works to ensure the best and most efficient utilisation of the power of the rivers is started, certain difficulties may emerge and on that account I think it perhaps desirable that I should not name the rivers which the board are considering, because it might <Col N="422" /> arouse expectations in districts which may have to be dashed, if, when they come down to deal with the actual engineering problems involved, they find no solution of them.</P>
    <P>The board, however, are very keen to develop water-power capacity.  It is, as I have said, by far the cheapest method of adding to their generating capacity and it is reasonable to expect that a large number, if not all, of the rivers which they are considering will, in fact, be so developed.  These power stations will be comparatively small in size, in relation to the Shannon or Erne.  They will not have a very high capacity, but if the full programme which the board considers practicable is completed, they will, between them, add capacity to the board's system equivalent to about 200,000,000 units per year.</P>
    <P>There is one further development I think I should mention, although it is not strictly relevant to this matter of the board's generating programme.  I have asked the Electricity Supply Board to consider the practicability, from their point of view, of establishing in certain western areas auxiliary generating stations designed to use hand-won turf or turf produced by semi-automatic machines.  My hesitancy in mentioning it is this, that the idea of constructing these stations is not so much to add to the generating capacity of the board as to provide a stand-by use for turf in these areas.  One of the problems affecting hand-won turf production is that the market for it fluctuates with coal supplies and the price of coal, and I think it would be a good thing if it proved feasible to establish in these areas stations of that kind which could be shut down completely without prejudice to the supply of electricity in a year in which the turf would be needed for domestic or industrial use but which could be brought into operation and kept in operation in a year when there was a surplus of turf in the locality.  I do not think there is any technical problem in constructing these stations.  From the board's point of view, the difficulty will be largely financial.  I have asked them to examine it in every aspect, however, and let me have their views and particularly <Col N="423" /> the extent to which they might be required to be relieved of uneconomic charges arising from the construction of these stations.</P>
    <P>I hope to have the recommendations of the board in that connection in the early future and I will deal with the matter again on a Bill which will be before the Dáil in a couple of months, for the provision of additional capital for Bord na Móna.  I think it would be more appropriate to deal with it on that Bill, because the idea is more directly related to problems of turf production than of electricity generation.</P>
    <P>That is the whole of the generating programme as it has at present emerged.  If completed in full within that period, it would be just enough to meet the anticipated demand ten years hence but, as Deputies will have observed, it contains no provision for reserve plant of any kind.  We will, I think, have to discuss with the Electricity Supply Board, before the end of this year or early next year, what additions to that programme may have to be made in order to give a greater margin between the productive capacity and the demands at that time.  It is, of course, difficult now to make firm plans for a period ten years hence. Whether it will be possible to install an atomic pile and produce electricity in that way at the end of that period is anybody's guess; but there are developments of a technical character proceeding in this industry, as in all industries, which may affect the whole future of the board's programme.  So far as it is possible to plan ahead now, upon the basis of present knowledge and expectations, it is clear that at some stage during the second five-year period arrangements will have to be made for the installation of additional capacity over and above the stations to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The position regarding rural electrification also arises under this Bill.  The Bill proposes to increase the advances that may be made to the board for the rural electrification scheme from the present limit of £5,000,000 to a new limit of £8,000,000.  That additional £3,000,000 it is anticipated will cover <Col N="424" /> the board's requirements under that scheme for a period of two years.  The rate of erection of the rural network is accelerating.  The number of poles erected and the number of miles of lines strung and the number of consumers connected in 1951 was the highest yet achieved, but I think the House should be informed that the board is encountering some difficulties in proceeding with that scheme as rapidly as was originally intended.  The difficulties which they mentioned to me relate to the supply of materials and equipment and the shortage of technical staff.  The scheme is only 20 per cent. completed to date.  I will admit that when I introduced the legislation here in 1946 which gave the necessary legal authority and provided the finances for that scheme and told the Dáil that I intended to instruct the board so to plan their activities as to permit of the completion of the scheme within ten years from the commencing of it&mdash;that is, from the time when the war-time scarcities would have ended and supplies of materials become available&mdash;I realised I was putting upon the board a very difficult task.  In fact, I emphasised the difficult character of the task by reference to the rate of construction achieved by the contractors for the Shannon scheme and intimated that if the board was to complete the rural electrification scheme in the time I laid down, they would have to do very much better than the highly competent contractors who handled the Shannon scheme construction had been able to accomplish.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious now that the rural electrification scheme will not be finished in the ten year period, reckoning that ten years as starting in 1948, when work was initiated and supplies became generally available.  Only about 20 per cent. has been completed to date, that is to say, of the 800 rural areas to which the scheme will extend the number completed at the end of 1951 was 151.  I have stressed to the board the general desire of the House&mdash;as evidenced by the number of parliamentary questions, themselves indicative of the pressure upon Deputies&mdash;that progress should be as rapid as possible and the board tell me that they are <Col N="425" /> doing everything they can to expedite developments.</P>
    <P>Deputies may desire to query the present arrangement of the board for the selection of areas for development. I have told the board that it is desirable that the basis on which the selection is made should be clearly known and unalterable so that no impression would be created that an area might be taken out of its turn because of any local pressure or other improper cause. I had myself some doubts as to the wisdom of proceeding upon the present basis, that is, a calculation of the fixed charge revenue in relation to capital cost of linking up the area and I wondered whether it would not be preferable to proceed instead upon the basis of the actual percentage of residents in each area prepared to accept supply.  The board have convinced me, however, that it might be undesirable to change from the present system to the one I have indicated.  The advantage of the alternative scheme which I indicated was that it offered a simpler basis on which local committees could approach residents in their areas to induce them to accept supply, a basis that they would understand without difficulty, whereas the present system involves calculations as to the outcome of which local committees are very largely dependent on the information supplied by the board. However, the board are looking into that situation generally.</P>
    <P>One of the considerations which I had in mind in suggesting a change was the desirability of not delaying the poorer areas of the country in receiving the benefit of the rural electrification scheme by reason of the present method of making a selection.  The board, I think, consider that if there is to be a change, it should be rather by taking the undeveloped areas, the congested areas, separately and having a separate calculation in relation to them, but they are considering the whole position and have promised to let me have their views.</P>
    <P>It is now obvious, of course, that the estimated cost of the rural electrification scheme will be very much <Col N="426" /> exceeded.  The estimate was made in 1943 and, as I explained to the Dáil when the Act was before the House as a Bill, we had no basis upon which to calculate cost except pre-war prices and we recognised that these prices were not likely to be restored after the war.</P>
    <P>The provision in the original scheme under which the board is recouped as to 50 per cent. of the capital cost by a State grant was always subject to review in the light of experience gained.  It is now obvious that the original estimate of cost must be increased by about 75 per cent. and, on the basis of present prices, the total cost of the rural electrification scheme will be about £24,500,000.  The scheme under which the State is committed to make available to the board grants equivalent to 50 per cent. of the capital cost has not been changed.  It is not proposed to change it in this Bill.  It is obvious, as I said, however, that a 50 per cent. capital grant is insufficient to enable the board to sell current on the present terms and that, without higher fixed charges, a subsidy of more than 50 per cent. of the capital cost would be needed.  In fact, it is quite clear that a subsidy equivalent to 100 per cent. of the capital cost would be necessary to avoid putting any charge on the board's revenue from general sales.  The situation is not urgent, however, and the position will be reviewed later in the year.  The board is proceeding with the rural electrification scheme and is carrying upon its general revenue the additional charge resulting from the inadequacy of the present State capital grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Of the total capital expenditure on the scheme by the Electricity Supply Board, the State recoups 50 per cent. by way of grant. What I have been explaining is that a 50 per cent. grant is not sufficient to enable the board to carry through the scheme on its original basis and that if there is not to be an increase in the <Col N="427" /> fixed charges, which is not contemplated, then either the proportion of the capital cost met by State grant will have to be increased, increased perhaps up to 100 per cent. or, alternatively, some part of the cost of the scheme will have to be carried on the board's general revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I do not want to confuse the Deputy.  The total which the Exchequer is authorised up to now to advance to the Electricity Supply Board is £36,945,000.  The board's actual capital expenditure and commitments to date are roughly £50,000,000 but it has actually received <Col N="428" /> in cash from the Exchequer only £26,000,000.  In other words, the advances to date do not reach the existing statutory limit but they will do so in the very near future.  It is necessary to get the legal sanction for raising the advances because the board's commitments already take it beyond the limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual cash, to date, £26,000,000 but, as I want to make clear, the actual expenditure by the board has been substantially above that because there has been a re-investment to date of £9,500,000 from its own reserves and, of course, there have also been commitments entered into of a substantial character to the financing of which the State is committed.</P>

      <P>£36,945,00 is the amount authorised by existing law to be advanced to the board of which £26,000,000 has actually been advanced.</P>
      <P>The other provisions of this Bill deal with matters relating to the retirement of, and the pensions payable to, certain of the board's employees.  First of all, there is a proposal to give an increase in pension to the pensioners of the board who retired before the relevant dates set out in the Bill, that is to say, September 23rd, 1946, for manual workers and April 1st, 1946, for the general staff, who were not, for some reason, covered by the general Act passed in 1950 relating to increases in pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 of that Act, which applied to the board's employees, provided only for pensioners whose pensions were on a cost-of-living basis and made no provision for those pensioners whose pensions were on a fixed basis.  The House will appreciate that the present position of the board is such that there is not a uniform system for all their staff.  They have obligations of varying <Col N="429" /> character to former employees of local authorities who were taken over by the board and are now in its service.  Some of these former employees of local authorities had a right to pension on a cost-of-living basis and they got an increase in these pensions by the 1950 Act.  Some had a right only to fixed pensions and they did not get an increase under that Act.  It is proposed now by this measure to give those pensioners of the board who retired before these dates increases in pensions in accordance with the provisions of the 1950 Act.  At least, the increases which they may get will be either the increases authorised by the 1950 Act or the pensions which would be attributable to the actual salaries of which they were in receipt when they retired subject to the revision of those salaries made in 1946.  It will be whichever is the lesser of these two increases.</P>
    <P>The increases are made retrospective to April 1st, 1949, or to the date of the commencement of the pension. Some of the pensioners affected by the Bill will have retired subsequent to the relevant dates but the practice of the board in regard to its general staff is to relate the retirement pension to the average earnings in the previous five years.  A person who is retired subsequent to the relevant dates and whose five-year period for the purposes of the calculation extended behind them would also benefit under this measure.  Any disputes that may arise between individual pensioners and the board will be settled by the tribunals which have been established under previous Acts.  The 1950 Act, whether through oversight, drafting error or design I am not quite clear, had the effect of authorising the payment of the revised pensions to Electricity Supply Board pensioners only from the date on which that Act passed.  In the case of other classes to whom the Act referred the revised pensions were payable retrospectively to the 1st April, 1949.  It is proposed to make the revised pensions of those Electricity Supply Board pensioners who come under the 1950 Act also retrospective to the 1st April, 1949.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in that regard to which perhaps I should refer. <Col N="430" /> Persons who were transferred from the service of a local authority to the board had the right to continue in the service of the board or, if that service was terminated, to appeal to the Minister for Local Government for reinstatement in their employment.  At the time that most of these transfers took place, there was no statutory limit, in respect of age, to employment with a local authority but by the Local Authority Act of 1941 authority was given to the Minister for Local Government to make an Order, which he made subsequently, fixing retirement ages for local authority employees. These former employees of local authorities, however, who transferred to the Electricity Supply Board were not affected by the legislation and they are still in the position that if they are retired from the service of the board at 65, they can appeal to the Minister for Local Government for reinstatement. It is proposed by this Bill to apply the provisions of the 1941 Act to these former local government employees and to give the board power to fix retiring ages.  The board intends to fix the same retiring ages as have been fixed for local authority employees&mdash;65 years for men and 60 years for women.</P>
    <P>There was another provision in that regard which I might also mention. Superannuation schemes prepared by the board under the authority of the Act of 1942 comtemplate a normal retiring age of 65 and, in fact, the actuarial basis of the scheme was calculated on that assumption.  It has been ascertained, however, that that provision in the pension scheme is in conflict with the provisions of the Act of 1942.  This Bill is designed to remedy that defect by determining the normal retiring age as the age specified in the scheme.  If an employee of the board is kept in the service after the age of 65, then that subsequent service will not count for the purpose of calculating his pension.  These provisions relating to pensions, retiring ages and superannuation schemes might be more conveniently discussed in Committee but I think it desirable at this stage to give a general indication of the provisions.</P>

      <P>I shall try to get some definite information for the Deputy, perhaps before the debate concludes. So far as I know the work will start this year.  I understand the position is that some farmers are not quite certain whether they should set their land in tillage because of the uncertainty as to whether the land will be taken over before the end of the year. That matter has been brought to the attention of the board and I think they understand the desirability of making the position known in the area as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome this Bill, particularly in view of a number of statements from the Minister for Finance and some other Ministers in recent months in regard to our economic position.  It is good to see that no decision which has been taken will affect the programme of development which the Electricity Supply Board has in hand and that whatever cuts are likely have not been allowed to fall in respect to this very desirable capital expenditure&mdash;I might say essential capital expenditure.  The Minister gave fairly exhaustive particulars of the proposed rate of development and indicated, so far as the information available to him at this stage could be given as definite, the particular stations which it is hoped to bring into operation in the next five years and the estimated output of each station, on the assumption that supplies of essential raw materials will be available.  He mentioned also the estimated demand in five years and in ten years.  I got some figures in the House last July and so far as I can gather the estimates which the Minister has given now correspond fairly accurately.  There may have been some revision since in respect to <Col N="432" /> individual stations or some change in respect of the estimated demands but any such change is negligible.  The proposals which the Minister announced cover hydro schemes and steam stations.  In connection with the hydro schemes there is not much to be said except that I should like to impress on the Minister and on the Electricity Supply Board the necessity for proceeding with the smaller schemes.</P>
      <P>I note from what the Minister has said that a number of these contemplated smaller schemes that have been surveyed by the board may be handed over for development to private enterprise and that the board will, in time, acquire them.  There are objections to that course just as there are objections to the immediate acquisition of these schemes or to their development by their owners at the moment.  I think the board should consider agreeing now to the terms of acquisition and facilitating or encouraging the proprietors who have these small schemes at the moment to proceed with whatever work is essential or whatever development may be considered essential rather than wait until the scheme will be acquired in the ordinary way. I think it is better in these cases not to mention the names of individual hydro schemes, but there are small schemes in certain parts of the country which have worked satisfactorily enough up to the present and which, if they are to be operated economically in the future, require some capital expenditure and certain equipment.  If these schemes are developed now by the owners it will involve them in greater expense than their resources allow, whether the owners be private individuals or, in some cases, local authorities.  On the other hand, if the Electricity Supply Board encourages them to re-equip the sets or to develop them in any way, that, in turn, will result in the acquisition terms being higher when the board come to acquire them.  I think it is time that some agreement was reached on the terms of acquisition and that the owners should be helped now either by direct assistance from the Electricity Supply Board or by technical advice, or whatever other way appears feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> The Minister said that it is proposed to entrust to private concerns the development of some smaller rivers that are contemplated but have not yet come within the immediate anticipated programme of the board.  They are comparable to the few small schemes I have in mind that could be developed either by private enterprise, with a view to ultimate acquisition by the board, or by the present proprietors, in such a way as to be absorbed into the board's general network in the future.</P>
    <P>The two really important questions for discussion under this Bill are the proposed additional turf-fired generating stations&mdash;or certainly the decision to use milled peat&mdash;and the rural electrification scheme.  As I understand it, the decision to develop the Ferbane station for milled peat was taken, on the basis of the reply which was given in this House to-day, as a result of some technical information available under the E.C.A. technical assistance programme.  Unless there is now some additional information that was not available six or eight months ago, I have grave doubts about the wisdom of the production of electricity from milled peat.  This is a highly technical question and not one on which laymen can express an opinion.  We have experience of the production of electricity from sod turf.  We know what can be accomplished.  The Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna have experience of the working of the two turf-fired stations at Portarlington and Allenwood.  The report which the Minister has mentioned has not yet been published but from information which was available it appeared that milled peat was not an economic proposition on the trials that had been carried out.</P>
    <P>It should be established beyond all doubt that the production of electricity from milled peat is satisfactory before any large-scale capital development is undertaken in that connection.  The Boora bog was developed on the basis of sod turf.  I think it is accepted that if the weather is bad it is possible to win turf for milled peat easier than it is to win turf for a sod-fired station <Col N="434" /> but I do not think there is any information available to show that it is possible to win sufficient turf or to win it economically.  I should like to have some information on the results of the experiment which the Electricity Supply Board conducted with the pilot plant.  Under the 1927 Act, the Electricity Supply Board have a general power of experiment.  I do not think that that power authorises them to experiment with a variety of methods for the production of electricity but they are given a general power of experiment and a pilot plant was in course of erection for the testing of milled peat as a fuel for the production of electricity.  I understand that, since then, the Technical Assistance Mission has reported.  I do not know why that report is not made generally available.  I understand that they have produced an attractive brochure but whether that brochure has behind it results which will stand the tests of economic efficiency&mdash;and there is placed on the board the obligation under the parent Act to produce electricity on an economic basis&mdash;I do not know.  Therefore, I believe it is vitally important that we should satisfy ourselves beyond all doubt that the proposal to use milled peat as against sod turf will prove to be economic.</P>
    <P>I think there is general acceptance of the desirability of utilising to the maximum extent native resources.  It is difficult to follow a number of figures given in reply to a question but, on the results which have already been proved by Bord na Móna, it would be wrong to assume that there will be the saving which is anticipated in the reply which the Minister gave in this House to-day. It is a fact that Bord na Móna have produced just about sufficient fuel to meet the demand of the existing stations.  A variety of difficulties prevented the realisation of earlier estimates but if the scheme which it is now anticipated will be operated in Boora is brought into production, the shortage which occurred in connection with sod turf may manifest itself again. Before embarking on the production of electricity from milled peat the House should be satisfied&mdash;on the tests which the Electricity Supply Board are making <Col N="435" /> or have made and on the basis of the report which the technicians of the Electricity Supply Board are capable of giving&mdash;that it will prove an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>On the general question of turf-fired stations, it is obvious from the figures which the Minister has given on the estimates of the Electricity Supply Board that, allowing for the maximum development of hydro-electric schemes and the development of the turf-fired schemes it is essential as a stand-by that some steam stations based on imported fuel should be maintained.  It may be that if fuel prices rise again in any future emergency the output from these stations will either be greatly reduced or will cease altogether, but if that situation arises it will have to be dealt with then.  A number of people, I think, are not familiar with the economics of electricity development which involves the use of steam-fired stations as a stand-by.  These stations can be eased off when there is a heavy flow in the hydro schemes and, conversely, when the hydro schemes are operating on a light basis in dry weather, steam-fired stations can be brought into production.  That of course applies to any steam-fired station, whether a coal, a turf or an oil station.  On the question of the development of hydro-electric schemes, it should be borne in mind that every water-produced unit of electricity is a saving to the oil or turf-produced units.  Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to realise the necessity not only for developing the major schemes or stations mentioned but proceeding with the rapid development of the smaller sets and stations which the Minister referred to and which have been the subject of examination by the board over a lengthy period.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural electrification, there is one aspect of that development which I think has not received sufficient attention, and that is that on the present basis of selection of areas small pockets of areas are excluded from supply and may be excluded for a great number of years. <Col N="436" /> Deputies are familiar with districts in the country selected for development and which have received a supply or will receive it in the near future.  In some cases two or three or four areas have received the supply, but in between or on the edge of these areas there are small pockets of people insufficient to qualify under the existing fixed charge revenue and unable to provide the capital cost necessary to bring the supply to these districts or people as the case may be.  I believe that if, say, 50 people are prepared to take a supply in an area adjoining an existing developed area&mdash;in fact this applies in some cases in parts of urban districts to the general network of the board and not merely to the rural electrification scheme&mdash;the local authority should, by a county-at-large charge, or by means of raising a loan on the basis of a county-at-large charge, contribute the difference between the cost which the board will have to meet and the sum which these people are in a position to pay.  That is only one suggestion. I do not know whether that suggestion would appeal to the local authorities, but I believe that there is a case to be made for the less convenient areas in counties or the less fortunate districts which are precluded from having a supply provided under the existing fixed charge system.</P>
    <P>There is then the general question of the undeveloped areas.  The matter which I have referred to will become particularly difficult, say, in parts of Connemara, Donegal, Kerry and Mayo, and even in parts of other counties. But the congested areas or the undeveloped areas are more difficult to supply on the basis of the present fixed ratio of 25 square miles.  I think the area for some of these smaller numbers of people should be reduced to, say, five square miles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Electricity Supply Board at your direction formulate a comprehensive scheme for the electrification of the whole coastal area from Donegal through Erris and Galway to Kerry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but no matter how the scheme is operated there is the difficulty in supplying isolated areas <Col N="437" /> or a limited number of people.  I think that is a matter which has not received sufficient attention up to the present. The whole attention of the State has been devoted from time to time to providing by different schemes some system of economic assistance for these areas.  Here is an essential scheme which the board have planned and have, I believe, taken steps in certain areas to extend to remote groups of people or persons anxious to get a supply if the difference between the present fixed charge and what they can pay could be met by a contribution from the local authority or, in the case of some of these undeveloped areas, possibly a contribution under the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  Certainly the present approach to this matter is not sufficient to meet the higher cost involved and some departure from the present rural electrification system will have to be made if a supply is to be brought to these areas.  The Minister could mention some difficulties in that regard, but I think a much more imaginative approach will have to be made if a supply is to be brought to such areas, and that applies in particular to the whole western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which may more appropriately arise on the Committee Stage, but I think some of them should be referred to.  One is the question of pensions which the Minister referred to.  As I understand it, the proposed increases in subsection (1) only apply to employees who were in the service of local authorities; that persons in the service of the board who were not prior to their service with the board, in the service of local authorities will receive no increase.  I believe that the whole question of the persons in the service of the board should be reconsidered on the basis of having a uniform system for all employees.  As the scheme is at present operated, there are a number of omissions from it.  One is, that this amendment, which really refers to the 1950 Pensions Increase Act, does not include those persons who were not in the service of local authorities, but it applies to local authority employees acquired by the Electricity Supply Board who, notionally, had what is known as a free <Col N="438" /> pension.  Some of the board's employees have already retired with ten or 15 years' service and have pensions as low as £1 a week.  In fact, I believe it is true to say that the pensions of some are below that.  I consider that these persons should be given added years in the same way as, in some cases, added years are given to civil servants who retire without reaching the maximum period of service.</P>
    <P>In addition, the 1942 Superannuation Act excluded from the maximum pension a number of persons who were under 40 years of age.  Those who are 40 years or over got, in some way or other, credit in the way of added years, so that they could get a maximum pension but a number of employees who had been with the board from the beginning, and were under 40 years of age, will never get the maximum pension even if they served to the age of 65.  They will never get the maximum pension to which a person with the full number of years' service is entitled.  I think that matter should be reconsidered. If the intention is to provide pensions for services rendered, then the cases of those individuals who, because of their age at the inception of the Electricity Supply Board did not qualify for full pension, should be considered. The board should be given power to give added years in their case so as to make up whatever difference there is.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the general term of office of the board itself which, I think, is worthy of consideration.  As the Act stands at the moment, the members of the board have a five year maximum. On a number of occasions, the board was not appointed for a full five years.  The present warrants, I believe, do give the members a five year term.</P>
    <P>I think it is undesirable that the members of the board should be in the position that they are appointed either from year to year or for an indefinite period.  I think it is time to consider whether there should not be a minimum period of, say, three years, and a maximum of five or seven years, inserted in the Act.  For a variety of reasons, it is unsatisfactory from the <Col N="439" /> standpoint of the board, of the individuals concerned, of the public and, very often, of the Minister, to have persons on State boards appointed for an indefinite period.  If they are on a yearly basis, it certainly leads, or might lead, to all sorts of difficulty, and is not, I think, in the interests either of the particular service concerned or of the State board.  There is then the other, and the wider question which the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 has set as a precedent and which has been followed by a similar section in a number of other Acts&mdash; that is, the exclusion of persons serving with the Electricity Supply Board from being nominated for, or elected to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that that actual provision did not exclude any person.  However, I am not as familiar with that as perhaps some other Deputies. I certainly think, however, that the time has arrived when the matter should be considered on a different basis from that which was accepted at the time the Electricity Supply Board was set up.  Since then, there has been a great increase in the number of statutory bodies established.  I think it is desirable that, if a person who is employed in any of these undertakings is elected to either House of the Oireachtas, the question of his resignation or of his being seconded should be considered but while I say that I feel that the employees of State boards should not be in any different position from that of employees of local authorities or teachers.  It may be that the employees of local authorities and teachers are entitled to certain benefits or facilities at the moment which they should not get, or which should be revised, but certainly there ought not to be one rule for the employees of local authorities and national teachers and another for persons in the employment of State boards.  I think it would lead to undesirable results if people employed by these statutory undertakings were to remain in such employment after they <Col N="440" /> had become a member of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, would inevitably cause difficulties not only for the individuals concerned but for the Minister responsible for the statutory board as well as for other employees or for the board of the undertaking concerned.  While I say that, I think a person should have the right under the law to be nominated for election to either House, but that, if elected, he should automatically cease to be an employee of the board.  In fact, I think that some of the sections in other Acts are so phrased.  Therefore, in connection with the Electricity Supply Board, I think the time has arrived when the matter might be reconsidered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understood what the Minister said, the plants which he envisages in the future, in addition to those already decided upon, will be either hydro-electric or turf fired.  I think it is a pity that we should have in the course of construction at the moment three plants which will have to depend on imported fuel for generating purposes.  Even though there may be difficulties in the way in so far as turf fired plants are concerned&mdash;they may not be 100 per cent. economical in some respects&mdash;we must bear in mind the fact that they will provide employment for our people on the bogs.  That consideration alone will outweigh any other disadvantages there may be in comparison with imported fuel plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> I was glad to hear that a river in Donegal, the Clady, was included amongst those to be developed under the programme outlined to us by the Minister.  We were hopeful that the Clady river might have been undertaken before now, instead of one of these coal or oil burning stations.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects relating to rural electrification on which I agree with the previous speaker.  It is only those who are familiar with the circumstances who will understand the position as he put it.  Under the present system of calculating the economy of an area, there are various pockets left out of the network in the area being developed by the Electricity Supply Board.  When we contact the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;I am sure most Deputies have had this experience&mdash;and ask when they intend to extend the network to a particular townland or area, we are told that the economy calculated would not justify undertaking the work.  The Minister made some reference to this in his statement and mentioned that he had encouraged the Electricity Supply Board, particularly in the undeveloped areas, to go ahead with development work, irrespective of whether the calculated economy would show it to be justified or not.  I understood that from his statement and I want to impress on him very strongly that he should urge that line of policy on the board, so far as it is possible for him to do so.  It is unfortunate that, on the fringe of a very fine network, there should be many townlands&mdash;in some cases the lines actually pass through them&mdash;which have not got the great amenity of electricity which neighbouring townlands enjoy and which have no hope of getting it for perhaps years to come under the present system of calculating the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is not an economic proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Electricity Supply Board are inclined to look on it from the point of view of cold figures of economy, and if we can succeed in getting them to change their attitude so far as undeveloped areas are concerned, we <Col N="442" /> will have achieved something worth while.</P>
      <P>I want particularly to impress on the Minister the need for doing something with regard to an extension of current to the Gaeltacht.  The Gaeltacht is up against exactly the same difficulties as the other areas mentioned.  In some cases, a Gaeltacht area comprises a number of small cottages and the present system of calculating the return from a particular area is based on the floor space of the dwellings concerned. On that basis, many of our Gaeltacht areas would not be regarded as an economic proposition and we in Donegal are faced with quite a few such areas, and I should like the Minister to devote his personal attention to them and to urge the board to undertake development work there, irrespective of whether it would be economic or not.  The Post Office is a Department in which the uneconomic area is thrown in with the economic area, and, one with the other, the Department is made to run on fairly economic lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the board's economy policy and I gather from the Minister's statement to-day that no effort will be spared to ensure that full scale development in relation to an extension of Electricity Supply Board current will be proceeded with in the next ten years.  I am prepared to accept that statement as definite and I am very much encouraged by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to hand-won turf-burning stations.  That is a scheme which would be very welcome <Col N="443" /> in the undeveloped areas and the turf areas.  He said that the programme envisaged made no provision for stand-by plant, but in order to bring forward the development of hand-won turf-burning stations I suggest that these stations could be used as stand-by stations and utilised for the purpose he mentioned, of providing an outlet for the sale of hand-won turf during seasons when its sale would be uneconomic for the producer.  There is a very serious fluctuation in the sale of turf year by year.  It is governed by supply and demand and I could easily visualise many seasons&mdash;as happened in the past&mdash;when the people who devote their efforts to the production of a good deal of hand-won turf would not be amply rewarded and this would be one definite outlet for it and would ensure that there would be a constant consumption of any amount of turf that could be produced.  The stations might be used when necessary and closed when necessary, in accordance with the supply of, and demand for, turf.</P>
    <P>If that could be expedited, if it could be brought forward some years and undertaken as soon as possible, these stations might be used as the stand-by stations the Minister referred to as not being provided for, as yet, in the programme.  Finally, I wish to compliment the Minister on the very fine programme he has outlined, and I ask him to consider at some stage making special provision for the undeveloped and the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes this Bill, and if there is any criticism to be made in regard to it, it arises from the slow development of rural electrification.  One thing I want to say is that I hope that, under this Bill, the board will be answerable to this House.  We are here providing the money for rural electrification, but if we ask a question about anything in relation to which we disagree with the policy of the board, we are told that the board is not answerable to the House.  What is wrong in connection with the slow rate of development is the fact that finances were not available to the board as it wanted them. <Col N="444" /> I should like to remind the House that, for the 20 years ending March, 1950, the Electricity Supply Board got £22,000,000 for electrification purposes. In that same period there has been paid in interest alone over 50 per cent. of the £22,000,000 advanced and less than £1,000,000 of the capital advanced has been paid back.  In other words, we have paid in interest on the moneys advanced to the Electricity Supply Board more than double the capital expenditure in these 20 years.</P>

If Deputy Dillon wants to check on those figures, he can do so, and if he can prove me wrong, I shall be glad to be corrected.  Is that system to continue?  The Minister said that he proposes to deal with the financial aspect in another Bill.  I suggest that we are developing the resources of this country and that we are shackled to the money system.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,140 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Ordnance Survey and of Minor Services including the Facsimile Reproduction of Ancient Manuscripts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The excess arises mainly out of additional expense incurred in building up stocks of papers and chemicals for the processes which are carried on by the staff of the Ordnance Survey.  There is also a certain amount of additional expense incurred in arranging for links between the primary triangulation of this country and the new primary triangulation of the Six North-Eastern Counties; and there is a small sum of £40 required for additional photographic equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, the Chair will have noticed that there is provision for two very interesting items.  One is for the stockpiling that did not take place.  The House will remember that the Minister for Finance has been stumping the country for months explaining that the whole business was a fraud, a lie and a deception; <Col N="446" /> but he trots in here as gay as a thrush and asks for a Supplementary Estimate to pay for the stockpiling that was done by Government instruction in the Ordnance Survey. The astonishing part of it is that&mdash; though, to his credit, he is blushing, it is only a pink blush; he ought to be as red as a beetroot, trotting in here to ask for a Supplementary Estimate to pay for stockpiling while the Chamber is still echoing with the clamour of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to embark on a capital investment programme of £22,000,000 sterling.</P>
      <P>However, while I think it a salutary thing to portray the Minister for Finance on the treadmill of his own prevarications, so that I may make him supple and resourceful for the painful interviews that lie ahead of him, my private interest in this relates to the provision made for photographic equipment for the Ordnance Survey. I want to suggest to the House that we should make provision without delay to enable the Ordnance Survey to effect an aerial survey of the country and, instead of giving £40 for certain photographic equipment, that we should face the fact that we have not got, and cannot get, the equipment necessary to enable the Ordnance Survey with its own staff to carry out a photographic aerial survey.  We might as well reconcile ourselves to the fact that we shall have to do, ultimately, what every other Government of a small country which does not maintain a huge air force has to do, and that is, to get the photographic aerial survey of its country done on a contract basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is photographic equipment.  The Minister did not tell me what that equipment was for and I do not believe he knows, and my guess is as good as his.  They must be photographing something and I am suggesting that the primary function of the Ordnance Survey is to survey the country.  It is common knowledge to us all in the House that the most modern form of survey to supplement the peripatetic survey is an aerial survey and it is done by aerial photography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am primarily concerned in this matter from the archæological standpoint. The Ordnance Survey in all its maps attempts in the peripatetic survey to mark each suspected archæological site.  I believe it is archæologically true that this island of Ireland is the richest of any country in Europe in archæological remains.  I am going to be brief on this and am not going to speak on it at great length, but I tell the House no more than this, that in the ordinary course of my duty as Minister for Agriculture, when I was administering the land rehabilitation project, within one week we were fixed with notice that inadvertently two considerable archæological sites had been disturbed.  I sent out an authorisation to prevent a recurrence of that and it became clear that, without certain fundamental information, they were unable to grapple with it.  Some doubts were expressed as to whether all necessary information to protect the archæological remains of the country could not be secured by reference to maps prepared by the peripatetic survey.  To check on that contention and to demonstrate its illusory character I was enabled to get an aerial survey made of an area well known to the Minister for Justice&mdash;who has now taken his colleague's place&mdash;to wit, Rathcroghan.  On the peripatetic survey of Rathcroghan there are, I think, five suspected archæological sites marked.  On the aerial survey of Rathcroghan the first examination of the photographs revealed 57 archæological sites which had never been beheld by the human eye before.  One comprehensive scheme under the land rehabilitation project on two adjoining farms in Rathcroghan would wipe <Col N="448" /> out one of the richest archæological sites in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is excellent reason to believe that dozens of other such sites exist and have remained so long unsurveyed that there is now no possibility of discerning them except through the medium of aerial photography.  I am informed that the whole country could be photographed and what they call mosaiced, that is to say, the photographs all brought together by a particular process giving you a complete aerial picture of the surface of the country for £60,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in so far as we are appropriating money for the purchase of photographic equipment. What is this photographic equipment for?  I do not know.  However, I understand that the Minister wants £40.  I am suggesting to the House that instead of buying £40 worth for the understaffed survey office in the Park, if he appropriated £60,000 and got a competent body of contractors to do for us what is being done for Great Britain, Scotland, Wales, Iceland, Holland, Belgium, Java and Sumatra, it would be money which perhaps, in the Minister for Finance's estimate, would be unprofitably spent but which I am suggesting that the majority of Deputies in this House would agree would be spent to purchase something which the passage of every day diminishes irrevocably and irretrievably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I formulated proposals to that end. If the Minister consults his files he will find that one of the comments made on these proposals was that it might be a good thing if everything more than 100 years old in this country were blotted out and forgotten.  The discussion of that philosophy was proceeding briskly when I lost my job.  If I had not lost my job I have no doubt as to which side would have ultimately prevailed.  I am afraid my poor successor is so beaten and battered by his colleagues every time he puts up his head that I have no hope for him. <Col N="449" /> So I come to the Minister for Finance and ask him to resume the battle where I left off and, instead of spending £40 on a second-hand camera for the Ordnance Survey, to celebrate his visit to Mr. Butler by proposing an adequate survey.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is for a token sum of £10.  Its object is to seek the approval of Dáil Éireann for widening the scope of sub-head F (5) of the Vote for Fisheries (which deals mainly with compensation payable in respect of the abolition of freshwater netting under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939), so as to cover payments which fall to be made under the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951.  This Act, which became law on the 31st July, 1951, authorises the making of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to certain classes of persons who suffered loss through the abolition of freshwater netting under the Act of <Col N="450" /> 1939, but who are not entitled to compensation under that Act.  The Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951, also provides for payment of interest on compensation paid under the 1939 Act and for contributions towards the cost of showing title to this compensation.</P>
    <P>Sufficient savings are available under sub-head F (5) of the Vote for Fisheries, 1951-52, to meet payments during the current financial year under the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951, which are estimated at approximately £5,000, and, as already stated, the sole object of the Supplementary Estimate is to extend the scope of the sub-head so as to cover these payments.</P>

Under Section 35 of the 1939 Act outstanding claims are as follows: Owners are about 20 in number&mdash;these cases are mostly in the hands of the Chief State Solicitor at present&mdash;and employees outstanding are nil.  Under the 1951 Act eight <i>ex gratia</i> payments have been made to employees, totalling £668.  Eight payments of interest totalled £2,143 6s. 4d., and the claims under the 1951 Act outstanding are as follows: Owners and lessees, approximately 39 in number, employees approximately 27 in number.  The position under the 1951 Act is still fluid, as the period, on the request of Deputy <Col N="452" /> Dillon, for making claims was postponed to the 1st July, so that we may expect further claims to come in up to that date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take a canter on the subject of censorship.  I venture to say that every correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> will now be sharpening his pencil to see if he could hang a laurel wreath on what I am going to say&mdash;another Papist shaking off the stranglehold of the Scarlet Woman of Babylon.  However, this Papist has no intention of shaking off any of his links with the Holy Roman Catholic Church, and that much having been said, I want to ask if it would be possible to prevent a situation arising in which, it seems to me, grave scandal is given, when some old silly billy here declares that a book is, in its general tendency, indecent, and when one reads in the newspaper the following morning that the Archbishop of Westminster recommends all <Col N="453" /> Catholics to read the same book.  A book was adopted by the Catholic Book of the Month Club in the United States of America almost on exactly the same day as we declared it to be, in its general tendency, indecent.  One of Graham Greene's novels was recently consigned to the ashcan.  Then the attention of the Censorship Board was directed to the fact that he was a Catholic author of outstanding merit and the book was promptly taken out of the ashcan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has just appropriated money for the payment of the staff of the Office of the Censorship of Publications. I recognise the difficulty, but all I am asking is that it ought not to be beyond our joint genius to prevent a book such as Graham Greene's last novel being condemned as indecent in its general tendency.  Then when the attention of the Censorship Board is directed to the fact that that is a very grotesque finding, instead of standing their ground and saying that, in any case, it seemed indecent to them, they promptly take the book out of the ashcan and restore it to circulation.  I have got the feeling that such an action makes their whole censorship grotesque and that it evokes public distrust.  This whole question of censorship is a difficult one.  I have never heard anyone yet successfully maintaining the proposition that any form of filth which people try to dump on us should be accepted.  I do not think that anybody could effectively make that case though it is extremely easy to make a powerful case against any form of censorship, and it is a case which appeals very strongly to the unsophisticated mind and very often most strongly to the most highly sophisticated mind.  It is, therefore, of very considerable importance that if Oireachtas Éireann has decided in principle to accept the censorship of books Oireachtas Éireann should keep its eye jealously on the administration of that most dangerous power so as to see that it is, first of <Col N="454" /> all, conducted with propriety and with due regard to human liberty, and it should also have some realisation of the peril of bringing censorship into universal and incontrovertible ridicule.  I fully appreciate the difficulties with which the Minister has to contend and I sympathise with him.  His predecessor and his predecessor's predecessor met with the same difficulties, and were the Minister to say to me: &ldquo;All we can do is to appoint the best men we can find and leave them to act accordingly. Can you propose a better way?&rdquo;&mdash;I am not so sure that I could do it. I would not be able to answer him off the cuff, but by hopping and trotting I think we should be able to evolve some device which would ensure hereafter that novels widely acclaimed by Christian audiences were not foolishly condemned only to be reinstated after a very cursory examination.  The books which secure the acclamation of so large a body of Christian people as the American Catholic Book of the Month Club should not be stigmatised in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, in regard to the novel of Marcel Proust's <i>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</i> the Board of Censorship should not put upon so law-abiding citizens as myself the obligation of wasting the present Minister for Justice's time and patience by applying to him for <i>ad hoc</i> licences to bring in the sixth volume of that work.  Is there any reason in a Censorship Board prohibiting the sale in this country of <i>Le Temps Retrouve?</i>  They might in some shape of prudence or propriety have mentioned other novels in that sextet of classics.  Do you not think, Sir, that it is necessary if we are voting on a Censorship Board to try and overcome the universal reluctance of Deputies and Senators to mention a word on censorship for fear they would get eaten?  It is a serious thing to do so.  There are two great dangers in talking about censorship. One is that one may be praised in the leading article of the <i>Irish Times</i> and that is ruinous politically and the other is that you may be misunderstood by some of your more obscurantist neighbours and that requires vigorous action in the <Col N="455" /> ecclesiastical arena.  I propose boldly to pursue a course between Scylla and Charybdis.  I am not prepared for the moment to indict the Minister for Justice.  I am quite satisfied he is as anxious to see reason prevail in this matter as I am.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is any harm to direct attention to certain of the absurdities to which I have referred not for the purpose of condemning in general principles the censorship because after very long and anxious thought I have come to the conclusion that in a civilised community one has to accept the need of the right to prevent the promiscuous distribution of pornography amongst ourselves, not amongst our betters or our inferiors but amongst ourselves.  In accepting that right I think the duty is heavily upon us to see that the powers granted are moderately and prudently administered and to protect our people from legitimate scandal-taking, if such a board by its actions suggests that some of its decisions have been capricious and so much so that on their being questioned they were almost immediately reversed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say this much that when I first came to the Department of Justice the Minister for Justice had to ban all those books that were put up to him by the Censorship Board.  I did not like it because the <i>Irish Times</i> went out of its way to say that Mr. Gerald Boland had done it.  I do not see any alternative to getting a body of people. It is a voluntary body.  There is a pretty good and representative Appeal Board there now and I do not see how we are going to improve on this system.  If Deputy Dillon knows any way and if he cares to put down an amendment to the Act we will consider it.  I do not see how you are going to have a better system than having an appeal unless you are going to get the unfortunate Minister into it.  I did not expect a full debate on censorship here on an Estimate that would give a few shillings to a member of the staff.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary by reason of the increases in wages and prices of materials during the past 12 months which have raised the cost of Land Commission building works.  These works are provided for under sub-head I (Improvement of Estates, etc.) and the original sum granted under that sub-head for the current year was £390,000; the additional amount required is £65,000, which represents an increase of one-sixth. Savings elsewhere on the Vote, mainly under sub-head A (salaries, wages and allowances), will meet £40,000 of the increase, leaving a balance of £25,000 to be granted.</P>
    <P>With regard to wages, as Deputies know, it is the rates payable by the county councils which, during the year, increased by about 13 per cent.  Over the country as a whole, but the consequent increase in Land Commission expenditure is estimated at 23 per cent. owing to the varying rates of wages and different scales of operations from county to county.  In Counties Galway and Mayo about one-fourth of the total improvement expenditure of the Land Commission is incurred and in these counties during the past year the rate was increased in Galway from 60/- to 72/-, or by 20 per cent., and in Mayo from 62/- to 80/-, or 29 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to materials there have also been increases in progress under the items required for building purposes. The total cost of housing operations under this sub-head is estimated to have increased by about 25 per cent. during the year.  About 76 dwelling-houses and 95 out-offices have been placed for contract during the year and a certain amount of work has been done by direct labour, in which case a contract is placed for the material&mdash;18 houses and 27 out-houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the <Col N="458" /> rate of wages paid by the Land Commission is equal to the rate paid by the county councils in the various counties.  I do not think they are of the same standard.  I want to tell the Minister from my own experience that the result is that Land Commission work is left behindhand because labourers naturally seek work under county councils and desert the Land Commission gangs.  Personally, I see no reason for it since the precedent has been established in the Forestry Department.  I cannot see why a Land Commission worker should not receive the same rate of wages as a county council worker.  In some cases it is quite true that the worker is working on what will ultimately be his own parcel of land or new holding, but that should not be taken into account in view of the fact that the Land Commission gangs are sometimes deserted for county council work, and work very useful from the national point of view undertaken by the Land Commission must be left over until there is a slack period in the county councils.  That is a state of affairs which should not exist.  The difference between the Land Commission rate and the county council rate, as well as that of the Forestry Department, is so little that it would be just as well to make them level.</P>
      <P>The thing I am most interested in is to discover how many of these new houses of which the Minister has told us are being built on new holdings for migrants.  This, after all, is the best yardstick by which the most vital work of the Land Commission, in my opinion, outside vesting can be measured.  If the Minister would say a few words in his reply about that I would be very grateful.  He might tell us how many of the 76 dwelling-houses and 95 out-offices placed for contract, as well as the 18 houses and 27 out-houses being built by direct labour are on new holdings, as distinct from those which are being erected by the Land Commission in the course of rearrangement schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the cost of building materials has gone up, I think, by 25 per cent.  I wonder whether the Minister might possibly be <Col N="459" /> able to take advantage of the Forestry Department's timber for Land Commission housing purposes, particularly from Dundrum in Tipperary where, I believe, they have the best drying facilities for timber in England, Ireland or Scotland at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity to raise one question in connection with Land Commission houses.  They are without sanitary accommodation or plumbing.  Might I say that the Land Commission policy even during my own period of office was rather niggardly regarding the equipment of these houses?  While ten, 12 or 20 years ago it might not have been so noticeable, nowadays the Land Commission should provide these facilities particularly when they see the Department of Local Government and county councils all over the country providing sanitary accommodation in their houses.  That applies particularly to migrants' houses.  The Land Commission should set a good example, move with the times and keep up with what is rapidly taking place all over the country.  The Minister can verify from his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that over 90 per cent. of that Department's housing grants are for houses in which sanitary accommodation is specified.  I do not want to see the Land Commission lagging behind them.  I do not want to see the Land Commission accused of trying to pawn off on migrants or rearranged tenants houses which are antiquated and which may be described a few years from now as barbarous. When foreigners come to our country we come in for very severe criticism because so many houses up and down the country are without sanitary accommodation.  The Land Commission as a Government Department should keep up with the times and provide it in their houses.  The Land Commission are a little bit stingy about making their houses modern or comfortable.  I want to bring to the Minister's notice that some of the houses they are turning out are rather bare and cold and more like out-offices than dwelling-houses except for their outer appearance.  They have concrete floors and no fireplace except a <Col N="460" /> hole in the wall and no sanitary accommodation&mdash;perhaps room is left for it.  That is a most unsatisfactory position.  Although it might cost a little extra to improve them, it would be money well spent because of the good example it would give round about.</P>
    <P>I would be better pleased if the Minister had had to come for a larger sum under sub-head I.  Whether he is aware of it or not, there is a vast amount of grumbling and discontent up and down the country, especially from those who expect relief from the Land Commission, which is a Government Department established for a specific purpose, at the land held in the hands of the Land Commission which is not being allotted.  The Minister may give the excuse that he has not sufficient outdoor staff, but I will not take that, because I remember that he has some 150 outdoor inspectors at the present time.  That was the number when I left office, and it has not diminished since, as none of them has been lent or seconded to another Government Department. There is grave discontent at the idea of the Land Commission letting land and raking in the grazing rent instead of allotting it.  The Land Commission, I think, are obliged by law to dispossess themselves of land as soon as may be after they have acquired it, that is, to those persons who are entitled or qualified to receive it.  I would even go so far as to say that, apart from its being bad practice and giving bad example, it is illegal for the Land Commission to hold land which, by a little extra effort, they could dispose of.  It is the duty of the Land Commission to make the existing tenant farmers land owners by vesting them.  I consider that that is the primary and most important function of the Land Commission. Next to that, and no less important, is the gigantic task of the relief of congestion.  The relief of congestion can be tackled, and I am glad to say that there is a good healthy outlook on the Minister's side of the House now, I believe, for the first time for a long time.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach need not <Col N="461" /> laugh.  If he persists in laughing, perhaps I will give him a few examples of things that happened in the past which I do not want to introduce at this stage, but which, perhaps, may change his countenance.  There is a healthy outlook at the present time, or at least a reasonable outlook, and I would ask the Minister to hold firm.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister again not to be so stingy in the matter of the erection of houses and the fitting of them for migrants.  In some cases, that policy is discouraging.  The saving of a few pounds per house has the effect of discouraging migrants who otherwise would be very glad to accept a change.</P>

      <P>The houses that are required and particulars of which I have given are almost entirely for migrants and tenants of rearranged holdings. About 40 are for migrants in eastern counties.  As regards the question of sanitary accommodation, that has been provided, as the Deputy is aware, in one county, Kildare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that we are trying to get as much work as possible done with the funds at our disposal and I think we are doing fairly well because, as the Deputy knows, it is really the congested holdings included in rearrangement schemes, apart from the migrants, that are benefiting and as compared with the local government grants, I think ours are fairly reasonable.  Perhaps they ought to be better but I am not in a position &mdash;I do not think any Minister is&mdash;to ignore the situation, if costs continue to increase in the way in which they have been doing, and increase the grants accordingly.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the Deputy saying that we do not pay the same wages as county councils unless it is that in a particular case it may have happened that there was some time lag, perhaps more than there should have been, in the Land Commission following the rate laid down by the local county council.  That is the rule.</P>

      <P>Expenditure has increased very substantially by reason of that fact.  There is, of course, a scarcity of labour in certain areas. Inspectors tell me that they find it difficult to get labour, there are so many persons, farmers, institutions, public schemes, competing with them and, of course, Land Commission work is not permanent or even semi-permanent.  A certain amount of improvement work has to be done in connection with a particular scheme and when that is completed it is not possible for us to retain the workers.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing, we have difficulty in allocating contracts.  The Land Commission has dealt with men who are generally small contractors tendering for perhaps a few houses in some midland county, providing for migrants.  There is difficulty in getting these contractors at the present time.  We have been trying to get over that by doing a certain amount, where possible, by direct labour.  That also involves administrative difficulties.  The tradition had been in favour of housing by contract and I think it is the better way if we can get the contractors.</P>
      <P>In the case of migrants, for example, housing would need to be started about a year in advance to enable migrants to take up residence in a particular spring period, so that a good deal of planning has to be done in advance.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there is any other point that the Deputy has raised that I have not mentioned. With regard to Land Commission improvement work generally, it is very largely confined now to the congested areas, to the rearrangement of holdings of which we have over 20,000 and a majority of these will probably have to be rearranged.  In connection with that, we are trying to do what we can to provide land in the Midlands to which some of these tenants&mdash;the larger the number the better&mdash;can be transferred to make more land available to enable rearrangement schemes to be carried through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £835,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1952, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health, and certain Services administered by that Office including Grants to local authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The original net Estimate for the Department of Health was £3,907,600. It is now calculated that net expenditure during the year will amount to £4,742,600.  It is, therefore, necessary to seek a supplementary Vote of £835,000.</P>
      <P>The increased provision is required under sub-head H of the Vote for this Department&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities. Payments under this sub-head are made to health authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947.  This Act provides for the payment to each health authority from State funds of the amount by which its expenses in each financial year on the running of recognised health services exceeds its expenditure on those services in 1947-48&mdash;the standard year&mdash; until such time as current expenditure is twice the expenditure in the standard year.  Beyond that limit half the health authorities' expenditure will be recouped from State funds.</P>
      <P>The original estimate of the grants payable to health authorities during the current year was £4,022,000.  The revised estimate of these grants is £4,872,000, which is £850,000 above the original figure.  Approximately £480,000 of this £850,000 is due to increases in salaries and wages which were granted to local employees with effect from the 1st November, 1950.  The balance of approximately £370,000 is attributable to increases in the cost of food, fuel, medicines and generally of the goods and the services necessary to maintain the existing health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appropriations in aid are expected to bring in an additional £8,000, and it <Col N="464" /> is expected that a saving of £7,000 will be made under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  The net sum is therefore £835,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would consider, as a forerunner of the health scheme, expending some of these sums in establishing ante-natal clinics which are so badly needed in the provincial towns throughout the country?</P>
      <P>We know, of course, that it is the intention of the Minister eventually to introduce an improved medical scheme for the country and a general improvement in all health services.  Of course, we must accept the fact that at the moment our services, in so far as they relate to the care of mothers and children in this country, are totally inadequate.  I would submit to the Minister that it would be a very good time to begin now to expend some of the money that is being voted for his Department in starting ante-natal clinics in the different country towns. I do not suggest that he should start them immediately in every country town, but I would suggest that he should start in a small way, at all events moving in that general direction. We could easily establish an up-to-date clinic in any town in the country for a sum of about £3,000 or £4,000.</P>
      <P>I should like also to point out to the Minister that the dispensaries in rural Ireland have stood as they are at present for a great many years.  In the rural districts, anyway, there are practically no up-to-date facilities. Very few dispensaries have light, heat, or hot or cold water.  The majority of doctors when dispensing for their patients have to use the very primitive method, when making up a bottle, of filling the water from a jug, and the water is often of very doubtful quality.  I think that the money which the Minister is seeking now would be very well expended if he moved in the two directions I have suggested, namely, to provide these ante-natal clinics or, at least, to make a start in that direction, and also to provide decent up-to-date dispensary services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious, indeed, to carry out the proposals made by the Deputy and I have been urging local authorities to provide these clinics in towns and to provide dispensaries in the more rural areas. I do not know if the cost of these clinics will be as modest as the Deputy mentions, although I have been using every endeavour to keep the cost down.  I am at the moment issuing a memorandum on the building of dispensaries to local authorities and suggesting plans&mdash;of course, the decision is theirs&mdash;for dispensaries for rural areas which should not cost more than £1,000 to £1,200 each.  It should not be a very big burden on local authorities to provide these particular buildings.</P>
      <P>Clinics, of course, will vary a great deal according to the size of a town. In a big town, the cost of building a clinic may run to much more than £3,000 or £4,000.  It will depend on what exactly we want to provide. Some local authorities have in mind the provision of buildings suitable even for minor operations, such as the removal of tonsils, dental work and other minor matters of that kind.  Of course, if they do provide for these operations in their clinics, naturally they will cost a great deal more.  I do not say that I am altogether in agreement with them on that but, on the other hand, it is their job and if they insist I am not going to oppose them. I think, however, that there is no necessity to duplicate services that are being provided by the county and district hospitals and especially there will be no necessity to provide these services in a clinic in a town where there is already a hospital.  Generally speaking my inclination, and what I have been pursuing, is to urge on local authorities to provide these clinics and at the same time to keep the cost as low as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking when the Debate was adjourned about the need there is for the Electricity Supply <Col N="466" /> Board being answerable to this House, because on previous occasions when I put down a question asking what were the charges per unit to some of our industrial concerns I was informed by the Minister that he could not tell me, as that was a function of the board. I would be anxious to know, even if I could be told now, what the big industrial concerns are paying per unit for electricity, because I know that working men have to pay sixpence per unit for electricity used in their houses. Looking at the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board, I suggest that the average charge for the whole country works out at something over a penny per unit, and I should not be surprised, if we were told the truth, that some of the big industrial concerns are getting electricity for power and other purposes at as low a charge as a halfpenny per unit.  Is it fair that people who are worth something to the country are to be sacrificed so that others who have a monopoly of manufactures in this country can get electricity at a halfpenny per unit?  A Deputy from Donegal has been talking about the difficulty of getting electricity to remote parts of the country because it is not an economic proposition.  I think until such time as we, who have to provide money for the Electricity Supply Board, make the board answerable to the Dáil, we shall never have anything effectively done in this way.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated in his statement that he was more or less inclined to allow private enterprise to take charge of these hydro-electric units. Am I right in believing that the Minister is prepared to allow private enterprise to operate some of these units?</P>

      <P>I am glad of that, because we had a long experience in Cork of a private enterprise supplying electricity and, until the plant was <Col N="467" /> taken over by the Electricity Supply Board, we had everything but satisfaction. I should like to refer again to the financial position of the Electricity Supply Board.  Am I to understand that the present system of financing the board is to continue for the next ten or 20 years?  Is there to be no change in the system of financing the development of electricity in the country?  The Minister has indicated that the board can spend, when this Bill becomes law, anything up to £53,000,000.  Is the same interest going to be charged on that money as has been charged for the last 21 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the interest here for the 20 years up to March, 1951. For the 12 months ended March, 1951, we paid £960,000 interest on the money advanced to the Electricity Supply Board.  Yet, like our friend in Donegal and people whom I know in different parts of County Cork, and even in Cork City, a person cannot be supplied with electricity if the wires are not near his house, because it would not be an economic proposition.  In spite of that, we can pay up to £13,000,000 in interest over these years.  Why should we pay interest on money lent to people like the Electricity Supply Board?  Why should they draw interest, which is paid by the people of this country, when so many of our people will not be given electricity because it is alleged that it would not be an economic proposition?</P>

      <P>Where are the bankers and lots of other people getting it? Pen and ink is creating it.  Are we <Col N="468" /> to continue to pay that interest and to continue that system for the next 20 or 30 years?  When I look back at some of the speeches made by the Minister nearly 20 or 30 years ago I am disappointed to find him so conservative now in his attitude to the present out-moded financial position.  I see what has happened.  It is sad to think that our country wants electricity and that we have to hand out money and pay people millions in interest for the electrification of our country.  Who are paying that money?  That money is paid by men who work from morning until night by the sweat of their brow.  If that amount of interest had not to be paid then farmers and people living in remote districts would be able to get the supply of electricity which they need.  The present system has got to be changed.  We are not prepared to be fettered and bound any longer by a financial system or group of people who will not allow us to develop electricity except at the price which they demand.  More electricity would be generated were it not that we are strangled by the people who control our money and credit.  I shall insert an amendment on the Committee Stage of this Bill to the effect that the board shall be answerable to this House&mdash;as they have not been up to the present.  Before the change of Government last June, I asked a question in this House as to the charge for power in respect of the important industrial concerns of our country.  I was informed that the information could not be given to me as it was a matter for the board.  Some of the biggest concerns in this country&mdash;concerns which have a monopoly for their product in this country&mdash;are getting their power for practically ½d. per unit &mdash;while men such as farm workers and others have to pay something like 6d. per unit for electricity to light their homes.  I trust that before this Bill is passed the amendments will be agreed to by every member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the rule whereby an employee of the Electricity Supply Board may not be a candidate for election to the Dáil, Seanad or a public body.  That is very unfair and I hope <Col N="469" /> that that, too, will be rectified under this Bill.  At present, if an employee of the board wishes to be a candidate for election as a public representative he must resign his position with the board.  I have often asked myself what qualifications the men on that board have as against those held by some of the people I should like to see on the board.  Of course, the people who could do a good deal of direction as far as labour is concerned get no representation on the board.  Is it not time that they got some representation on a board as important as this board?</P>
    <P>I am glad we are making strides in the matter of electricity.  My criticism is that the Electricity Supply Board have not done their job as expeditiously and as boldly as I would wish. On the other hand, I must admit that I am quite satisfied that since 1927 much more would have been done were it not for the financial system that operated in this country.  I do not blame one Government more than another Government for that state of affairs.  I hope that, now that we have an opportunity of doing something practical, we will not have to pay interest on money for the electrification of our own country.  It is the duty of whatever Government is in power to take over and cease paying interest on money to people who do not give one ounce of energy to provide electricity in our country.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know the position in regard to amendments to the pension scheme.  I have a particular case in mind of a man in Cork who worked in Ford's and who was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  He was rather a skilled man, and when he came to the age of retirement he was kept on for a further number of years.  He retired on a pension of about 30/- per week, although his salary before retiring was something like £10 or £12 per week.  It is hardly necessary to say that that man finds it difficult to manage on such a small retiring allowance.  Can anything be done to cover a case of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the recruitment of labour for the Electricity Supply Board.  I think preference should be <Col N="470" /> given to Irish ex-Servicemen over British ex-Servicemen.  I am aware that, in some cases, that has not happened, and I think it is entirely wrong.  There may be reasons for it, but surely some special consideration should be given to men who served this country as against men who preferred to serve another country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to get the Electricity Supply Board to speed up the change over from D.C. to A.C. mains in Cork.  This is causing much hardship to some manufacturers who have not fully changed over.  I know that the board are working on it, but at the rate they are going it will take years to finish the job.  Manufacturers are advised not to purchase new machinery, because of the eventual change, and I suppose the Electricity Supply Board do not want to have to replace what would be practically new D.C. motors and machinery.  At the same time, I think it should be speeded up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of rural electricfication.  I think we all do; in fact, the majority of us feel rather dissatisfied that it is not going ahead faster.  There is one area which is being attended to by the Electricity Supply Board in the south of my constituency at present which is causing a certain amount of apprehension to farmers in the district. A new line is being laid between Waterford and Wexford which entails the erection of poles.  This line is passing through an extremely fertile area, where there is a great deal of tillage, and the farmers in that area are naturally perturbed.  I asked the Minister a question last week as to whether it would be possible to suspend operations there, and the Minister replied that he felt it was not feasible to do so.  That duly appeared in the local Press, and I have again had representations made to me that the people down there feel, from what they know has happened heretofore, that the laying of this line, which will continue after the 1st April and on during the harvest season, will cause a good deal of hardship to the farmers in the district and a good deal of damage generally to crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> I do not know what the powers of the Electricity Supply Board exactly are, but I gather that they are entitled to enter on anybody's land for the purpose of carrying on the work of electrification, be it rural or otherwise. I should like to know from the Minister if it is usual or if it is necessary for the board to inform land owners when they propose to cross their land, or when they propose to erect poles or when they are going to cut down trees. I know of several instances&mdash;it actually happened on my own land, but I am not worrying very much about that personally&mdash;where the Electricity Supply Board cut down trees although the owners of the land had no idea that they were even entering on their holdings. Naturally, they must have power to go anywhere they want to extend electrification, but surely it is only reasonable that those who own the land should be informed of it.  There is an old feeling in this country that anything is good enough for the farmers. If, for instance, the Electricity Supply Board went into anybody's back garden in Dublin and tore up a couple of raspberry bushes or rose trees or knocked down a bit of a wall, there would be a lot said about it. But it seems that they can go in on a farmer's land and do pretty well as they wish to do.</P>
    <P>We all know that increased production in agriculture is necessary for us at present.  We hear every day that there is an increasing world population and that increased food production is of prime importance everywhere.  It seems all wrong, therefore, that the Electricity Supply Board should have power to go into an arable district such as I have mentioned between Wexford and Waterford, crossing a barley-growing, beet-growing, wheat-growing, oats-growing and potato-growing area&mdash;one of our best tillage centres&mdash;and continue to do so throughout the harvest season.  So far as the Electricity Supply Board higher officials are concerned, they have always shown me the greatest courtesy since I became a Deputy and before I was a Deputy.  But there are men working for these firms who know nothing about the land and care <Col N="472" /> nothing about it.  A lot of these are young chaps reared in the city.  Are they to be trusted, when the crops are growing or during the harvest season, to do work such as this?  I think not. It was a surprise to me when Deputy Hickey mentioned that the board should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I only intervene because it might go abroad that County Wexford did not want electrical development.  That is all wrong.  As <Col N="473" /> far as I know, the farmers are clamouring all over the country to have electricity brought to their doors and installed in their homes.  The work of the Electricity Supply Board is welcomed all over the country. Deputy Esmonde is misrepresenting the farmers of Wexford when he says that they are objecting to having electricity brought to their doors and installed in their homes.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Electricity Supply Board are operating through a certain line of country where crops are growing there may be a certain amount of damage done but it will not be very great.  It is not easy to put up lines in a beet or corn field without doing slight damage.  I think the Electricity Supply Board are bound in law&mdash;they have been doing so to my knowledge&mdash;to point out to farmers on a map the course which their poles and lines will take.  I think that is usual.  I am personally aware of its having been done.  I know a number of farmers over whose land lines have gone and they have been shown a map of the course the lines will take.  I suppose the Minister will deal with Deputy Esmonde's suggestion that the Electricity Supply Board paid nothing back.  I think there is as little truth in that suggestion as in the suggestion that the farmers object.  Common sense will show that if the board were to try to reconcile all differences when bringing their lines over the land of every farmer in the country they would make far less progress than they are making.  None of us want to see any damage done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have advocated before that they should keep their lines as near as possible to fences.  I am aware that they must keep on a straight line all the way.  We all understand that, of course.  The provision in this Bill to increase the amount available for the further development of electricity will, I think, be welcomed generally in the country.  All we say to the Minister is this: if he could in any way speed up rural electrification and <Col N="474" /> have more areas connected up with the current each year, that is what the country is asking for.  That, I think, more than anything else is what the country needs.  Any dissatisfaction that we hear in the rural areas is to the effect that applications are being put on the long finger, and that people have to wait too long before the current is provided for them.  Generally speaking, that is how people in the country feel.</P>
    <P>We know, of course, that at the present time there are great difficulties in the matter of supplies.  Still, supplies are available, and if anything could be done by the Minister to indicate to the Electricity Supply Board that the work of providing current in the different areas should be speeded up, it would be welcomed.  The Electricity Supply Board was set up under legislation passed through this House. That legislation was introduced originally by a colleague of the Deputy who is now sitting on the front bench opposite.  When his colleague introduced that legislation he did not give power to this House to govern the Electricity Supply Board, and very wisely in my opinion.  If he had done so, I think it would mean that we would have to sit here during the 52 weeks of the year trying to determine all the problems that would arise under the board's administration, such as whether an individual should get a week's or a month's employment.  All that could be discussed in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is admitted that everyone in the House is in favour of this Bill.  There are a few points, however, which I should like to put before the Minister.  We are now placing extra moneys at the disposal of the Electricity Supply Board, and I am sorry that Deputy Allen should have taken up the view to which he has already given expression.  The amount of money to be made available to the Electricity Supply Board is now to be brought up to over £45,000,000. The amount for rural electrification is to be brought up to £8,000,000. Some members spoke about speeding up rural electrification.  I know that the Minister, from what he has said here from time to time when Deputies have put down questions asking what the rate of progress was in regard to rural electrification in certain areas, is anxious about that, too. More Deputies would have put down questions of the kind but for the fact that they realised, as explained by Deputy Hickey, that the Minister could only make representations to the board and has no control over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that people in many areas are anxious and worried as to when rural electrification will be available <Col N="477" /> to them.  Even though we know that we recognise that it would be futile to be putting down questions as to when the scheme is likely to reach some of those areas.  I know areas of the kind in my own constituency.  There is one at Whitechurch, one at Carrignavar and one at Donaghmore.  It is because we know that the Minister himself could do very little about it that we realise it would be futile to be putting down questions.  The Minister did say that there are roughly about 800 areas to be covered under the rural electrification scheme at the present time. He has admitted that progress up to the present has been slow.</P>
    <P>We know that the Electricity Supply Board has its own difficulties to meet. What we wish is that, if necessary, these difficulties would be put before us in this House so that we would then be in a position to explain to our constituents the cause of these difficulties and delays, which are very upsetting to a great many people. People in one area feel very upset when they see people in other areas getting a supply of current long before them.  The position is that we cannot explain to them why some areas have got preference over others.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Electricity Supply Board selects any particular area either through pressure or suggestion from anybody.  Even if the Minister were anxious to give us the information, the fact is that we cannot get it.  Since we are now handing over an enormous sum of State moneys to the Electricity Supply Board, moneys which, in the long run, will, I believe, be well spent, I agree with Deputy Hickey that, to a certain degree, this body should be made accountable to this House through the Minister, so that Deputies would then be in a position to ask for information from him.  The Minister would then be able to give us, without any hesitation, any information that we required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all that is being asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did state that these extra sums of money which are now being made available for the Electricity Supply Board may <Col N="478" /> mean that the production of electricity will go up to 2,200,000,000 units, and that even that may not be enough.</P>
      <P>When we consider the large increase in the number of consumers and the extraordinarily large increase in the consumption of electricity, there is one point to which I should like to draw special attention.  The Minister spoke of inducements to people to use current, and if rural electrification is to be made the success which everyone hopes it will be, it can only be done by everybody in the different areas taking advantage of it and having electricity in their homes and, where farmers are concerned, in their out-offices; but there is one section of people who have suffered gravely through the actions of the Electricity Supply Board.  There are places which were catered for by the Electricity Supply Board from the very outset and in that respect I can mention the village I come from, Crosshaven. Crosshaven, in the early 1930's, was connected with the Electricity Supply Board supply, but when we consider the charges made by the Electricity Supply Board at that time to the consumers and the large increases since that time, of which we can get no account in this House, we find that there is no inducement to people to take the supply.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the system can be very severe on ordinary people in that they have to pay a head charge based on the valuation of their houses, and in summer, when practically no electric current is used, this severe head charge is a heavy burden on them.  In Cork City and other areas, there is a charge by the Electricity Supply Board for the use of a meter, but surely in the case of people whose premises were connected with the electricity supply in the early 1930's, the meter should have been paid for long before now.  Whatever about the financial viewpoint behind all this, it is fantastic to believe or even to expect that the people should have to pay back all the cost of this huge development in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in years to come will have the advantage of the electric current now being provided and why <Col N="479" /> should the consumers of the present day be saddled with every possible increase the Electricity Supply Board can get away with&mdash;simply and solely, as I believe, because we here have no say with regard to it?  We have to take it for granted that when they want an increase they will go ahead with it, instead of proceeding on the basis of a long-term policy.  The charges to people who have used electricity for the past 18 or 20 years have gone up enormously, but yet a person getting current in at present will not have to pay anything more than these consumers are paying.  I know many people who had signed for the purpose of getting electricity in, but who, when they considered the heavy charges&mdash;they were anxious to pay as much as they could&mdash;decided that they would be so severe on them that they put it on the long finger. We must realise that the surest way of making rural electrification pay is by providing it at as low a cost as possible, thereby giving everyone an incentive to take the current and to use to the utmost the advantages offered by it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned one point in which we are all interested to a certain degree&mdash;the unfortunate position of people in certain areas, in little pockets, as he called them, who are not lucky enough to be able to get rural electrification.  That is a problem with which every member of the House is confronted&mdash;the problem of having to explain the difficulties to people in his constituency and pointing out to them that it is impossible for him as a Deputy to get it for them. Deputy Cosgrave offered a solution&mdash; he did not say it was an ideal solution but he mentioned it as a possibility&mdash;in the shape of a contribution by the local authority and that is a point I want to deal with.  I want to draw attention to another side of the picture.</P>
    <P>In Cork at present, as in all other places, if we, as members of a local authority, put down a motion asking for the provision of public lighting in any particular village or area, the assistant county surveyor, as the next <Col N="480" /> step, gets into contact with the Electricity Supply Board.  Deputy McGrath will bear me out when I say that we find to our amazement that the charges proposed by the Electricity Supply Board for the provision of public lights in these places are very often prohibitive, and to our grave disappointment we sometimes have to consider the possibility of not going on with a scheme of public lighting in these villages, because the burden is so heavy and because we are afraid that its reflection on the rates eventually will be such as to make it impossible for us to go on with it.  On one occasion, the Electricity Supply Board were asked to provide public lighting in a certain area in the suburbs of Cork City.</P>
    <P>They asked for a very large sum, roughly £200, and I pointed out as a member of the local authority that as everyone in the locality was a potential consumer, it was difficult to understand why the charge should be so high.  The board refused the local authority any information as to why the charge was so high, but about a year and a half later provided the public lighting in that area&mdash;Togher, in the neighbourhood of the Lough in Cork City&mdash;at roughly £40 to £50, instead of £200, and up to the present hour the board have not told the members of the local authority why they reduced the charge.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister.  This is a long standing grievance but I suppose that it is by mistakes we learn and the sooner we realise that one of the biggest mistakes, so far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, is the fact that they undoubtedly have a certain amount of autocratic powers and can act in an autocratic fashion, the better for us. I am not suggesting that they always do so and I know officials engaged on rural electrification who have gone out of their way to help, and they have powers which they can use to the advantage of the community and the members of this House.  We here are agreeing to the provision of extra money for this laudable project but, in the long run, it is the people who are the masters and who are providing the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I want again to emphasise that, where local authorities are concerned, the Electricity Supply Board charges for the provision of public lighting are prohibitive in the extreme.  I want to lay stress again on this matter of the charge on valuation and meter rents. The fact that people have to pay a certain fixed charge on the valuation of their houses all through the years is no incentive to people to connect up with Electricity Supply Board current, and, in the case of meter rents in the cities, when a charge is made for a number of years, the meter should then be free of all charge to the consumer.  I know full well that Deputy Hickey did not for a moment suggest that electric current should be made dearer to industrialists.  It is one of the keynotes of success in our industrial policy to provide such cheap current.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the price charged to the ordinary consumer at present is such that no matter what policy the Electricity Supply Board may formulate or carry out they will never make a success of it unless or until they take the ordinary people, the consumers, into their confidence and make a fairly reasonable economic charge for the current provided, no matter how many years that may take to pay back.  If we are gaining certain advantages now, what about the untold advantages to the people in the future?  Surely we are not wrong in asking the people in the future to pay a little towards this?</P>
    <P>The Minister may mention&mdash;and would be justified in doing so&mdash;the grant of up to 50 per cent. given by the State, while it will take so many years to pay back, plus the interest that Deputy Hickey mentioned; but not being versed in high finance I will have to leave that out.  No matter how many years it may take, it is most important to realise that above all we are not entitled or justified in saddling the ordinary consumer with the high burden of the present charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not in agreement with Deputy Hickey or Deputy Desmond that this House should have direct control over the Electricity Supply Board.  Personally, <Col N="482" /> I am satisfied that the very good job of work that the Electricity Supply Board has done for this country is due to the fact that they are not under the direct control of this House.  If any Deputy desires to get information on any matter I do not think he is prevented from doing so.  As far as I know, the Electricity Supply Board is not hiding anything from this House or the general public.  They are doing a good job and they deserve our very best praise.  I do not know who is on the board, I have not the foggiest information as to who they are, nor do I want to know, as my experience since I came into the House has been that they have been inclined to give fair play to the various areas they deal with.  They base their ideas on certain principles, and I think they carry them out to the best of their ability.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey may not have intended to convey that he had a grievance against the board for giving electricity at ½d. per unit.  I do not think he meant that&mdash;he was making a comparison&mdash;but I think that if industry could get power for even a ¼d. per unit it would be very helpful in fostering industry, especially in remote areas.  I sincerely hope that, whatever grievance anyone has against charges, the Electricity Supply Board will continue to give cheap electricity to industry.</P>
      <P>Again, it has been urged that instead of the present generation being asked to pay on the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis, we should hand on this to posterity. We will be handing enough to posterity without handing them a bill of this kind.  It has been good policy up to now that the consumer should pay for the current he is getting, and should not expect future generations to pay for the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few people would have thought many years ago that we would have made such vast and rapid development in rural electrification, with all the impediments that have come in the way &mdash;wars and threats of wars, difficulties of all kinds.  Nevertheless, rural electrification has certainly gone much faster than I ever had an idea it would go.  Those who have taken the trouble to visit the generating stations will <Col N="483" /> realise that they are a credit to the Electricity Supply Board and to the Minister then in charge, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would urge.  If we are looking for cheap supplies of electricity for any particular thing, I would urge it for water supplies.  There are parts of the country where regional water supplies could be obtained if we had cheap power.  Unfortunately, those who have tried water supplies with electricity find it somewhat dear.  That is rather a pity.  Perhaps it is something the board in its wisdom would consider, that where a local authority desired to have a regional water supply pumped by the aid of electricity they would be given a special rate for it.</P>
    <P>There is just one matter in which I disagree with the board, that is, the cutting off of slices of a parish.  The parish is a unit for all intents and purposes&mdash;in the country, anyhow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be something wrong with me when Deputy Dillon is agreeing with me.  There is nothing that causes greater dissatisfaction in a parish than when the people on one side of a road get the supply and the people on the other side, who live in another townland, are refused, even though that particular parish is being given rural electrification. That is a pity and it is something that is inexcusable.  It is something that we here by anything we can do or say should not condone, as it gives great dissatisfaction.  I can see the point of the board, but I do not think that economy would justify it.  It causes disagreement amongst neighbours and it is something that is very difficult, if not almost impossible, to explain away.  I hope it is going to end.  In the parish of Mullinahone&mdash; Kickham's own parish&mdash;there is grave dissatisfaction because of the fact that about a quarter of the parish has been left without rural electrification.  I say that is a pity.  I hope it is going to stop, and I sincerely hope that is the end of the division of parishes.  We <Col N="484" /> have enough of partition in the country without bringing it into the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>We hope that, as time goes on, the charges will be lowered.  Everyone would like to see them lowered, and it would be a good thing, on the whole; but until such time as it becomes an economic unit I suppose we cannot hope for very much reduction.  One thing we can all hope for is more speed, if at all possible, in rural electrification.  War appears to be looming on the horizon, and now is the time to try to get in materials.</P>

      <P>If we are able to get in sufficient poles and other things that we cannot produce in this country, it would be wise to bring them in.  If we live for another 20 years we will find that we will probably at last have sufficient timber in this country for replacements.  The Shannon scheme came into operation over 20 years ago. People were then inclined to get their houses wired at the least possible cost. In those days the people of this country were not as prosperous as they are to-day.  That was during the period of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government, of which Deputy Dillon was at first a member.  More or less for patriotic reasons, the people of that time got electric light into their houses.  Unfortunately, the houses were wired, especially in many towns, in an unskilled way, not nearly as skilled as the job is done to-day, so that, unfortunately, fires often occur. I urge on the Electricity Supply Board that they should have an inspection carried out all over the country, and where defective installations are found, that they should not only replace them, but should force replacements with a view to avoiding any risk of fire in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting anybody in particular.  However, if I decided to have my house rewired, it would hardly be fair to ask my nextdoor neighbour to finance the job.  I <Col N="485" /> will now point out that the people with defective installations should not alone pay for having these rectified, but should be very thankful that such defects were pointed out to them, thus preventing the danger of fire.  I conclude by wishing the Electricity Supply Board continued success.  A little more speed on their part is all we require. Let them finish the job as soon as possible, thus giving us a proper and necessary lighting system in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You will forgive me if I am touched by the over-generous tributes of Deputy Davern to the expedition with which rural electification is being carried out.  He will remember that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was largely responsible for the preliminary work. When we came into office we had to undertake the executive task and it is a source of gratification to me to learn that Deputy Davern, standing in exterior darkness as he then was, found himself dazzled by the radiance of our performance and aspires to reach our standard of performance in the short period during which he may reasonably expect to sit on that side of the House, nor would I be polite were I not to express appreciation of Deputy Davern's reference to the parish plan. I am glad that he subscribes to the view which I ventured to propose, namely, that the appropriate rural social unit in this country was the parish.  I committed it to his care and to the care of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, whose first act on coming ino office was to scrap the parish plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot endorse Deputy Davern's far-seeing proposal that the Electricity Supply Board should recruit an army of inspectors to go out and examine the installations in every house in Ireland with a view to condemning them and arranging to cut off the supply if the installations are defective, then furnishing the householder with an estimate for rewiring and, unless the householder pays on the nail, cutting off the supply and allowing him to sit in the dark.  Deputy Davern does not believe in postponing till to-morrow <Col N="486" /> the costs of to-day, but the picture of leaving 15 per cent. of the population of this country drinking their tea by the light of a dip candle because they cannot afford to get their houses rewired fills me with gloom and dismay. I think he would be better advised to proceed on the assumption that the average householder in this country has now reached a degree of sophistication which would enable him adequately to safeguard his family against the prospect of a conflagration without the assistance of a perennial inspection by Electricity Supply Board inspectors armed with a pliers and an estimate form, and the name and address of the nearest grocer who sells dip candles.</P>
    <P>It is a stimulating experience to listen to the Minister for Industry and Commerce announcing his intention of seeking the endorsement of Oireachtas Éireann for a capital investment programme of £20,000,000.  Deputies will have noted that while it was in full cry the Minister for Finance came into the House with bowed shoulders and sat uncomfortably on the seat beside the Minister for Industry and Commerce for about three and a half minutes and then fled.  I understood that the Minister for Finance's investigations into the financial services of this country revealed a situation in which there would be considerable difficulty in paying Civil Servants' salaries.  I understood from what the Minister for Finance had to tell us that he could not afford to buy a galvanised bucket, that we would have to go to the loom and start weaving the hair shirt and that the bald ones amongst us would have to go naked.  It is a far cry from that picture to the cheerful vision which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spreads before our eyes, and it is stimulating to hear the chastening word spoken by Deputy Davern who said he believed in the old-fashioned doctrine of pay as you go and that he could not at all subscribe to the heretical doctrines of Deputies Hickey and Desmond about extending the amortisation period of the capital outlay of the Electricity Supply Board. I am a long time in politics but my ears have not yet been trained to the absorption and elucidation of two <Col N="487" /> diametrically opposed stories told to one at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Davern starts to rumble I cannot understand him.  He will have to return to Timahoe and the secretary of the cumann there will interpret him for me.  £20,000,000 will finance the programme of development which the Minister for Industry and Commerce outlined to-day.</P>
      <P>I want to raise four specific questions on that programme.  On the first item he is perfectly right to proceed confidently with the investment of our people's savings in the development of our own power, land and natural resources, such as they are.  I think Deputy Hickey rightly raised the question which many people already excogitated, including my colleague, the ex-Minister for Finance, who actually founded the Shannon scheme. I often heard him say, inside this House and outside it, that, ever since the original legislation was enacted by Oireachtas Éireann, he has often asked himself as to whether the amortisation provisions of the original legislation were not framed on too Draconian a scale and did not lay an excessive burden on the consumers of the present to the undue advantage of those who will enjoy the amenities of electrification in the future.  Personally, I believe that the present Tánaiste agrees with that view, and I imagine that proposals will be made at a reasonably early date, soberly and prudently, to stow away the Minister for Finance in a clothes basket, do what has to be done, put him through the wringer and let him come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the tripe that he has been talking in the last six months makes it much more difficult, soberly and prudently, to make that necessary adjustment, because any relaxation of amortisation provisions, no matter how obviously necessary they may be, are open to the furious onslaught of the hot air and tripe the Minister for Finance has been talking for the last six months. Nobody but a citizen with a <Col N="488" /> countenance of beaten brass like the Tánaiste's could sit beside him and propose the policy for which the Tánaiste is responsible and still commend the tripe of the Minister for Finance to the approval of the public. I must hand him this accolade.  There is no country in the world, not excluding Bechuana, in which you could get a political party to follow two leaders at the same time who are saying the things that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance are saying at the present time, because if any member of the Fianna Fáil Party understood either of them he would have to quit the Party.</P>
    <P>In this particular set-up the Tánaiste is right.  I think the time has come and he ought to tell his colleague this, that shrugging his shoulders and smiling blandly at Deputy Hickey does not provide the answer to a question of increasing urgency that Deputy Hickey almost invariably asks in the wrong way.</P>

Does Deputy McGrath think there is anything wrong if you have only got enough meat that the residents of Montenotte must do with 10d. worth as well as the residents of the slums, or does he think that the butchers should take what orders they can from residents in Montenotte if there is anything left?</P>

The Tánaiste says that if the method of financing it that I commend be accepted there awaits us the awful catastrophe of an economic experience such as that through which Great Britain is passing at the present time.

I want an answer to the question I asked and I do not think it should be indefinitely postponed.  When we are talking in terms of £50,000,000 sterling, and that is the total investment in the Electricity Supply Board if I understand the Minister correctly, the difference between the rates charged to-day and those to which I referred is close upon £1,500,000 sterling per annum.  If that economy were made, it would be sufficient to discharge the entire capital outstanding in something less than 30 years.  Does anybody in this country know what turf costs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that Deputy Davern would know.  I think it is about as difficult to find what a sod of turf costs or what it is going to cost in this country as it is to find out what a unit of electricity is going to cost.  When any Deputy gets his account for the two months, has he the faintest notion what the light cost and what the power used in the cooker cost?  I would suggest to the Tánaiste that the method of charging for electricity is infinitely complicated.  There ought to be a means of knowing if you use a cooker how much the cost will be per unit and if you turn on the lamp how much the light will cost per unit. There are very few places in Ireland where any such simple calculation can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ought to be profitable to find out <Col N="492" /> what turf costs.  I do not believe that anybody knows.  Lots of people know about the cost of producing turf but are studious to ignore the hundreds of thousands of pounds that have been poured into bog development under a wide variety of schemes which never has been and which nobody ever intends to charge against the cost of turf. I discussed the matter with the Comptroller and Auditor-General on one occasion and if anybody wants to find out what it is and if he looks in the Index to the Public Accounts for the year 1941 or 1942, he will find that up to then the quantity of money spent on bog development which has never been charged against the cost of turf at all was a very formidable sum.  If there is added what has since been spent, plus capital employed by Bord na Móna, it would provide a very interesting study as to what the turf which it is intended to use in the generation of electricity actually cost or is likely to cost.</P>

    <P>Deputy Davern said, having given the long years he has spent shedding his radiance on County Tipperary to reflection on the economies of Ireland, that he had come to the conclusion <Col N="493" /> that it was a good thing to supply cheap power to Irish industry.  When that epoch-making statement fell from his lips one felt the gyration of the globe momentarily to stop.  I think that Deputy Davern was right.  I think that power is an essential raw material of every industry in this country, including agriculture.  I think he is right in saying that it should be a matter of supreme importance that it should be made available at the lowest possible cost.  Does anyone in this House seriously suggest that to generate electricity out of turf is calculated to procure power for Irish industry or agriculture at the lowest possible cost?  It is notoriously the reverse of truth.</P>
    <P>What amenity value it may have in providing jobs for turf cutters in bog areas is an entirely separate question. What I would suggest to the Government is that if the Government determine that it is desirable to use turf as fuel for generating electricity which is to furnish power to Irish industry it is the Government's duty if Irish industry is to have a chance, to defray by Exchequer grant the difference between the cost of generating electricity from turf and what it would cost were it generated by the most economic method available.  Nothing is more foolish than to allow the excess cost of turf generation to fall on the industrial consumer; he is the one person that should not be asked to carry it because if he is, you are distorting the whole price structure of the industry in which the power is used.</P>
    <P>We hear to-day that the total consumption of electricity last year was 1,000,000,000 units.  Only part of that, of course, is consumed in providing illumination, but it is a substantial part.  I invite the Minister for Industry and Commerce to charge any independent body to investigate the relevant efficiency of electric lamps in this country with that of lamps of similar prices in Great Britain, the United States, France, Germany or Scandinavia, and if it be true that there is a 10 per cent. loss of current used for illumination in this country owing to the relative inefficiency of the lamps we use in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It would be an interesting thing to discover whether it would be more expedient and more economical to produce lamps of equal efficiency, whatever the cost, in Ireland or to go on producing power for the purpose of making relatively inefficient lamps light up.  There is an easy way of finding out the truth or error of that suggestion and it is in the capacity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make the test to-morrow. He does not have to; he knows the facts, but if he wants to he has the Bureau of Industrial Standards, he has the Industrial Research Council, either of which bodies will provide him with a committee of experts charged with the task of making a truly objective report on that matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many units are used annually in lighting.  If it be 300,000,000, 10 per cent. of that would be 30,000,000, not to speak of the electricity that is spent on carrying these 30,000,000, units over the transmission system.  It seems very foolish to build a new power station in order to supply the electricity which could be saved by making the lamps through which we use it more efficient than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Fianna Fáil are consternated by their own contradiction, but I beg of them to think, if power and light and heat are the indispensable raw materials of industry and agriculture, is it sane to forbear from employing the most efficient and the cheapest methods of generating that power and that light and that heat.  I invite Deputies here to pause a moment and think, to go down to Portarlington and see what the supply of one relatively small station burning turf involves in turf consumption; to remember that the Tánaiste told us here to-day that it was only when the station went into operation it was found that it was capable of consuming twice as much more; to examine the size of the installation and its cost; to remember that to burn turf to generate electricity demands the universal acceptance of the proposition that the <Col N="495" /> station must be brought to the turf on account of its high water content, not the turf to the station; to recall that as the available turf recedes from where the station is built with the passage of years every furlong of transport that is put on that turf makes the power generated a little less economic than it was heretofore.</P>
    <P>Can we get out of our minds the chronic curse which so many people carry in this country: that the available labour in Ireland instead of being something to glory in is a perennial problem to keep statesmen and politicians awake at night?  When that very labour which looks to a Fianna Fáil Government to be a problem to be resolved by relief work, by building turf stations in the middle of bogs, steps on a railway train there are brass bands out to receive it at Holyhead.</P>
    <P>It is worth its weight in gold when it gets there.  High-powered salesmen are in Ireland every day clamouring for them to come, but here we speak of them in terms of another addition to the rolls of unemployed&mdash;what will we do with them; how will we employ them?  Anything is justifiable, because it provides employment.</P>
    <P>I think the greatest insult we can offer to a man in this country is to ask him to engage in work other than work which produces the maximum that his capacity and the equipment are capable of producing.  I have no desire to see our people put out on the bog to work so that for us in Oireachtas Éireann it will be a case of out of sight, out of mind.  I have no sympathy with the argument which says that, even if to generate electricity from the bog is uneconomic, we ought to do it for the sake of the work it provides for the men put cutting turf.  Those men can be employed in producing in our own country better products cheaper than they can be produced anywhere else in the world because they are the men who are employed doing just that in Great Britain and the United States.  They are not employed there because British or American industrialists love the colour of their lovely blue eyes.  They are employed there because, given the <Col N="496" /> opportunity, they can deliver the goods.  Why is it that, to get that opportunity, they have to go to America and they have to go to England?  Why is it?</P>

      <P>Far from accepting the Fianna Fáil view, I propound to the Minister for Industry and Commerce this thesis: that the obligation and the duty of the Electricity Supply Board is to provide for our people the maximum quantity of power and light at the lowest price at which it can be efficiently produced, and whatever method is most effective to that end is the best method and none other should be employed.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this wise old bird seeks to parry it&mdash;is that we in Ireland should scorn to produce anything less than the best because, if we try, we are eminently capable of producing the best.  I am happy to think that Irish agriculture has never had to boast of the relative merits of its products. They were self-evident before the world.  Irish agriculture sold its products on the markets of the world <Col N="498" /> because it had nowhere else to sell them and it was able to do it because they were equal to or better than the best.  I, for one, never doubted the capacity of our people to maintain that standard.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Read my paraphrase and see how it goes.  I want to put this to the Minister: The Electricity Supply Board in connection, I think, with the rural electrification scheme did set up an agricultural advisory division with a view to explaining to farmers and popularising the user of agricultural electrical appliances in areas recently wired.  I would ask him to make representations to the Electricity Supply Board to the effect that there is considerable scope for the extension of that service.  At present I do not think there are much more than three or four men available to instruct.  Quite apart from milking machines and grinding mills and the like, I think the Minister would find if he would inquire from his colleague the Minister for Agriculture that the development of wiring floors of pigsties involves a very low kilowatt consumption of electricity with an unbelievable <Col N="499" /> economy in the consumption of feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe that there is a well-authenticated work to demonstrate that, in the feeding of a 12-stone pig, no less than four weeks' feeding can be saved by the provision of this device in any pigsty, the installation of which costs a £5 note, and which can be done by unskilled labour under the direction of a competent adviser, for the reason that the electric equipment is a small transformer and the remainder is simply wire, bedded suitably in sand.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce realises that it is a matter of very real importance both from the point of view of increasing the farmer's income and from the point of view of economising on the raw material of what can be made the most profitable branch of agriculture at the present time.</P>
      <P>The last question I want to ask the Minister is this.  He spoke of establishing in Erris, in North Mayo, a power station, fuelled by turf, and on the east side of Ballina a power station operated by water-power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Two turf-burning stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this.  When the question of the drainage of the Moy was under examination, it was quite clear that that drainage area had to be taken as a unit, but it is unique in Ireland, in any case, in that it has two watersheds for a source.  One watershed lies between Killala and Lough Conn, and the waters of that shed come down through the two lakes joining the Moy below.  The second watershed lies west of Ballina, and is generally recognised to be the main channel of the original river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks, and I think there is engineering authority for this view, as if it would be a formidable but wholly possible task, to carry the head waters which flow down through the two lakes into the sea at Killala by cutting a canal through that district. If the Minister is familiar with the coastline there, he will remember that as the coast goes west, the cliffs rise to a height of 400 feet.  I cannot recall <Col N="500" /> what the cliff height is at Killala but it is substantial.  If the outfall of that river were taken back, as it could be, from its normal course into the lake, it would provide a very handsome source of hydro-electric power at Killala.  You would resolve at the same time 75 per cent. of the complexity of the drainage problem of the Moy catchment area and you would provide, not relief work, but a splendid imaginative engineering project on which the people of Erris, who are at present going to Scotland and the United States to work on works of that kind, would be pre-eminently suitable to work for the benefit of themselves and their neighbours.  I am not saying it is a scheme which has been examined by engineers.  It may not have got the potentialities which I suggest, but I do suggest to the Minister that it is eminently worthy of examination and that much of the capital costs might be later charged to what would be a very valuable drainage amenity.</P>
    <P>Let me congratulate the Minister again that he has shaken himself free, not for the first time, of that clinging tendril, the Minister for Finance. Whilst the Minister for Finance weeps salt tears on Mr. Butler's bosom about the bankruptcy that awaits him here, about the hair-shirts and the other hardships to which he has to reconcile himself for years and years to come, it comforts me to think that the not insubstantial figure of the Minister for External Affairs will give the living lie to his protestations while the imagination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will reassure us at home that the skies are not as dark as the clinging vine or the junior banshee would have us believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the last speaker in congratulating the Minister upon this Bill and upon his imaginative and progressive outlook in putting a programme of electrical development before the country.  It is what the country needs, what the country is seeking and it is something upon which the nation as a whole will join in congratulating the Minister.  Deputy Dillon widened the scope of the debate.  He has convinced himself, though perhaps he did not convince the House, that the <Col N="501" /> British people are most prosperous and the happiest people on the face of the earth, because they are willing to allow their country to be used as a base of an attack on the continent of Europe.  What a prospect!  Why did the Deputy not make that statement in the British House of Commons and not here?</P>
      <P>I want to refer in the few minutes at my disposal to one outstanding fact, one which will interest the Deputy and which should interest Deputy Hickey also.  There has been talk about providing electricity at the cheapest possible rate.  Then in the figures put before us for expenditure and income last year we had the following facts. The gross revenue of the Electricity Supply Board for 1950-51 was £5,600,000.  Working expenditure was £3,800,000 and interest and the repayment of advances was £1,238,000 and there was a surplus of £500,000.  There you have a position in which 50 per cent. of the cost of producing electricity goes in interest and the repayment of advances.  I am just pointing out that that is one particular aspect of the cost of electricity that does require investigation and I am hoping that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will turn his attention to that particular aspect.  As a result we should be able to provide not alone an adequate supply of electricity for our people but that cheaper electricity which is absolutely essential for our economic progress.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <P>Realising that our national resources are under-developed because of chronic under-investment in our own country, and further realising that emigration and unemployment, which are destructive of family life and of the family unit, upon which Christian society is founded, flow from this underdevelopment <Col N="502" /> of our resources, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the financial policy hitherto pursued, whereby the major portion of the savings of the nation is invested in Britain, should be discontinued in order that credits adequate for the development of our resources and for the provision of housing and other necessary services for our people should be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have sympathy with any Deputy other than Deputy MacBride in introducing this motion. After all, he told us that the reason for asking the Dáil to pass the motion was that the policy pursued hitherto was to invest the major portion of the savings of the nation in Britain. During the two years, 1949 and 1950, the Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member invested&mdash;if you use that word&mdash;through the Central Bank an extra £33,800,000 in British sterling securities and not only did they invest that amount of money in British sterling securities through the Central Bank but they actually imposed a debt on the country of £46,000,000 in dollars in order, as was disclosed in answer to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Davin to-day, to buy dollar maize and sorghums to sell eggs to Britain at 2/- a dozen in order to build up our external assets that Deputy MacBride complains about.</P>
      <P>Not only did they do that but they were so much in haste to build up sterling assets that they sold our Constellations which the previous Fianna Fáil Government had purchased for dollars.  The inter-Party Government would not even keep the Constellations until after the devaluation.  They sold the machinery we had purchased for the building of a chassis factory. Deputy Davin, Deputy MacBride, Deputy Hickey and other Deputies were behind the Government in these three years.</P>

      <P>During Fianna Fáil's time we said we regarded the sterling <Col N="503" /> assets simply as a reserve to enable us to proceed with confidence in the development of the country.  A farmer who had a few hundred pounds in the bank can start off on a development programme knowing that if the next year's harvest does not bring him in what will pay his capital development he can draw it on the bank.  To assert that the major portions of the savings of the nation were invested in Britain is not true of the years during which Fianna Fáil had control in this country before the war and in which our policy could be made effective.  We invested more savings of the Irish people here than the total amount of our net savings in external assets in houses alone in a few years&mdash;146,000 houses. Put them at £1,000 a house; that is £146,000,000 invested.</P>

The Government here is quite prepared to take the risk in buying Constellations or machinery to start a chassis factory even though it may result in a decrease of our external assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of talk at present about Britain's external assets.  They have a few hundred millions.  Some of that money is invested&mdash;if you like to use the word &ldquo;invested&rdquo;&mdash;in dollar securities, in Swiss francs or in Swiss securities&mdash;something which they can realise in order to cover a deficit if they have one.  If Deputy MacBride's plea is that we should get rid of all our sterling assets as quickly as possible because they are going down the drain anyway he may be just as bad a prophet as he was before in relation to sterling.  I think that the British Government acted in 1949 with the <Col N="504" /> greatest foolishness in devaluing.  Its only effect was to postpone the day on which they would have to make ends meet or arrange an international policy to enable them to do so.</P>

When there was talk about devaluation in 1949 I said it was a crazy financial proposition and I still believe it.  I think the British are very much worse off to-day because they took advice to devalue or yielded to pressure to devalue.  If they devalue again now, rather than take the economic steps that are necessary to balance their payments I think that their action would be so crazy as to justify their being locked up in a lunatic asylum.</P>

      <P>That debt was to the tune of 129,000,000 dollars.  What did we spend in capital investment in this country out of that 129,000,000 dollars? Less than 7,000,000 dollars.  To be exact 6.8 million dollars of the 129,000,000 dollars which this country will have to repay in the coming years was put into the purchase of machinery and capital equipment.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy confirm this when replying?  There was one person in the past 20 years who had the opportunity of getting us into a savings arrangement outside the sterling area when the E.P.A. was made. Deputy MacBride was then the Minister for External Affairs.  Will Deputy MacBride solve this mystery for me? This country could have entered into the E.P.U. as a separate and distinct unit by giving credit for a few million pounds, but instead of that&mdash;instead of joining the E.P.U. as a separate and distinct unit, instead of making some progress towards cutting the link with sterling&mdash;he sewed us up in the sterling bag.  We joined the E.P.U. not as a separate and distinct unit, sailing under our own steam, but in the sterling area group.  There was something to be said for that&mdash;but surely there was nothing to be said for it by a person who took and has taken the line which Deputy MacBride took and still takes on this matter both before and since&mdash;and particularly when he took it supported by a Government that, he boasted, on many occasions, he had in the hollow of his hand, and could make them do things.  But we all know the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government regard our sterling assets simply as a reserve to enable us to go forward with confidence in the building up of this country.  We used our sterling reserves in spite of the attitude of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash; in spite of the attitude they adopted towards investment here and the building up of our country.  We encouraged our people to invest in this country so that not only did we build 146,000 houses &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We did that in spite of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party. I hope Deputy MacBride will explain in his reply how it is that if he were, in fact, so much concerned with the building up of our reserves during the three years he was in office as he is when he is in Opposition, we used only 6.8 million dollars of the 146,000,000 dollars we spent on importing goods from the United States on machinery for capital development.</P>
      <P>I think an explanation should be given as to that.  I should also like him to explain to the Dáil why he joined the E.P.U. as a member of the sterling reserve instead of as a separate and distinct entity under our own steam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every country in the world tries to get some foreign assets.  The foreign assets that we have realisable externally <Col N="507" /> are some few million pounds worth of gold and some hundreds of millions or less of sterling assets.  The British are very glad to get dollar assets, and indeed they are very glad to get credit in some of our banks when they can earn it.  I feel that the Dáil should not pass this motion which Deputy MacBride has moved and that they should turn down the allegation that any Government here in the past, whether the Cumann na nGaedheal Government or the Government in which he himself was a member, stood for the policy of investing in England while letting our own people here go short of credit.  As long as this country has sterling assets, a reserve abroad, somebody must hold them.  If the Central Bank or Government Funds do not hold them, then the ordinary commercial banks or some individuals must hold them.  I challenge Deputy MacBride or any other Deputy on the opposite benches to say who is better entitled to hold them than these three institutions I have mentioned.  Are we to take the steps, say, that the British took in relation to dollars?  Is there to be another exchange control authority, to make everybody register their sterling assets and make them sell them to the authority and receive Irish pounds for them?  If we had that, how much further would we be?  I think it is an operation which is not necessary.  If it were necessary, it could be considered, but I do not think it is necessary.</P>

It would be as ridiculous to say that Britain could not increase her credit simply because she has some dollar assets in the New York money market at less than 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one or two questions before he replies.  I intended to raise a number of matters on this motion, but in view of the short time available I must confine myself to one or two items. First of all, I welcome the motion.  I think it is very useful that we should have a discussion here on the question of how our money is being invested. I am sorry that the scope of the motion is not wide enough to embrace the price that is charged for money for investment purposes in the country.</P>
      <P>I presume there will be a division on this motion and I intend to support it.  I should also like to say that I have supported this type of motion any time it came up here in the four years since I have had the privilege of becoming a member of this House. I have supported it willingly and I would be very willing to face the electorate to-morrow morning on such a motion because I think it is vital that this State should have some control over its finance; control over where the money is invested and control of the rate of investment.  I think those two items are the root cause of most of our economic ills for the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this division takes place I am certain that there are many Parties who will go into the Division Lobby <Col N="509" /> to support it.  I wonder are these Parties sincere about what is contained in this motion.  Does the fact that they will walk into the Division Lobby in support of it mean that if they are returned to power they are prepared to put into operation the policy outlined in the motion, or are they only looking for another stick with which to beat the present Administration? I feel very sore in regard to this matter because I am convinced that the power lay in the hands of the inter-Party Government during the three years they were in office to put this policy into operation and they made little or no attempt to do so.  I will repeat something that I have said in this House many times, that it is a case of Tweedledum on my left and Tweedledee on my right.  Neither of the major Parties in this House is prepared to carry out the policy of investment at home and at the same time put a proper charge on the money for home investment.  I should like to see the Government beaten on this motion.  I should like to be able to go to the country to-morrow and on every platform in my constituency say that I stood there to back a policy that would invest money in Ireland and that, for the sake of national development, the money so invested should be given at a rate of interest that would not cripple the community for the next generation or two.</P>
    <P>I feel that, even if the Government were beaten on this motion and that those on the opposite side were to come back, they would do very little to change the circumstances as they exist to-day.  I want to make one further remark in connection with what the Minister for External Affairs has said about our sterling assets and to compare his remarks with those made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when speaking down the country a fortnight ago.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The controllable part of our external assets are a standing army of occupation in England, and it was treachery to the national cause to suggest that that army be brought home.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is terrible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="510" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>These were the remarks made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Now listen to what Deputy Lemass, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, said in an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st February, 1941:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a creditor nation, our foreign assets are mainly in Great Britain. We are now in the position that we are unable to utilise them as we would wish.  For many years our economists have been preaching about the value of those assets. They measure the prosperity of this country by the rise and fall in their value.  There was a Maginot Line mentality about them which prevented a sounder financial policy for the country from developing.  If, instead of those immobilised sterling assets, we had real tangible assets in our own country&mdash;factories, machinery, buildings, stores of goods&mdash;how much stronger we would be?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister, on the one hand, says how much better off we would be if we had those sterling assets in buildings and factories while the Minister for Post and Telegraphs, on the other hand, says that they are a standing army in England and that it would be treachery to the national cause to suggest that they should be brought home. I support the motion even though I do not believe that, if the Government were beaten on it, and if the others were to come back, they would take any steps to put it into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister representing the Government in the House on this motion pursued the course which he did.  He did not refer at any stage to the motion as such.  He confined his speech both to-night, and on the previous occasion, to long political tirades of abuse against his political opponents over the course of the last 25 years.  He started off by criticising the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and compared it with the policy of his own Party.  I had hoped that it would have been possible to have an objective discussion on this motion without these <Col N="511" /> rather cheap and antiquated jibes.  I think it would be extremely easy to take many of the utterances made in other days by the Minister himself and by his colleagues on the Government Benches which would make them look extremely foolish in the light of the speech he made to-day.  There was a time when he attacked the Cumann na nGaedheal Government violently for piling up these sterling assets.  There was a time when he preached that a salary of £1,000 was more than any man should get, and that was put on advertisements and posters throughout the country.  I do not think it is a profitable occupation to go back on these issues.</P>
      <P>The Minister spent portion of his time seeking to misrepresent my attitude in regard to leaving the sterling area.  I have never suggested that we should leave the sterling area.  We are within the sterling area.  It is a geographical fact.  We are in it because we happen to be in that portion of the world and because the bulk of our trade is with Britain.  I have advocated consistently on every platform from which I have spoken, not merely now but in the course of the last eight or nine years and while a member of the Government, that we should repatriate our sterling assets, that we should invest the savings and resources of this country, whether they be in a capital form or in manpower, in the development of our resources.  If there is any sincerity in some of the professions made from the Government Benches, that should be acceptable to them, and that is what my motion proposes. I do not think there can be any doubt as to what my attitude is on these matters.  I have written a sufficient number of articles and pamphlets throughout the last ten years on this question and I have made a sufficient number of speeches on these matters in the course of the last ten years.  I have never varied by one iota from the policy I have advocated on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be it said, in fairness to my colleagues in the inter-Party Government, that probably they regarded some of these views, at first, with doubts, <Col N="512" /> but that they ultimately accepted those views.  The then Taoiseach, in a speech which he made to the Institute of Bankers, if I remember correctly, announced the policy of the Government to repatriate sterling assets. The Minister for External Affairs has, I might say, nearly dishonestly referred to the fact that the holdings by the Government and the Central Bank increased during that period.  The Minister knows perfectly well the explanation for that.  He knows that that arose through the Counterpart Fund, from the Marshall Aid Funds. These money were accumulated in sterling here.  Indeed, it was in order to obviate the constant transfer and investment of these moneys by the Central Bank to England that the Government decided to have them in a special account and to invest them in Ireland.  That is what, in fact, took place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The sterling assets were up £34,000,000 in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>They went up £100,000,000 while the Minister was Minister for Finance himself, and there was no question of having to find an outlet for the Counterpart Fund arising from Marshall Aid.  The Minister sought to convey the impression that the only body that had sterling assets &mdash;that they were all concentrated now in the hands of the Government&mdash;was the Central Bank.  That is not in accordance with the facts.  At the time that the inter-Party Government sought to obtain a loan for the Dublin Corporation the commercial banks had investments amounting to £183,000,000, of which only £14,000,000 were invested in Ireland.  All the rest were invested in England.  Of that £14,000,000, they only had £7,000,000 in Irish Government securities, while they had vast sums in English Government securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the policy which we now want to reverse.  The total amount of sterling assets held by this country in Britain is in the neighbourhood of £550,000,000, though for some extraordinary reason, the Government refuses to give the figure.  They will <Col N="513" /> give only the net figure which, in fact, does not represent the position.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly fantastic that we should charge 5 per cent. to our farmers through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, while at the same time we lend money to the British Government and other British institutions at from 1 per cent. to 3 per cent.  The money which we lend them is utilised in turn by them to lend it to their own farmers and to the farmers in the Six Counties at lower rates of interest than we will make money available to our own farmers. What objection can there be to altering that position?  The result of this restriction of credit, and the high charges made on the extension of credit to our own people here, is to reduce employment.</P>
    <P>Already, as a result of the credit restriction that has taken place in the past few months, 10,000 more people are unemployed.  To-day I asked the Taoiseach for particulars of the number of travel permits issued in the course of the past five months, and they show an increase of 65 per cent.  Sixty-five per cent. more people have left this country &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I have the figures here and I can read them.  Sixty-five per cent. more people have obtained travel permits in order to secure employment <Col N="514" /> abroad in the past five months than in the equivalent five months last year.  True, the figures do not represent the full extent of the immigration, but they are a good index of the emigration which is taking place now and which conceals the true unemployment figures.  That I charge the Government with being responsible for, through its policy of restriction of credit, by refusing to invest money in Ireland and to develop our resources.</P>
      <P>My appeal in opening this motion was that we should approach the whole problem on a non-Party basis and should seek to establish an economic council or, as Deputy Costello suggested recently, an investment board, that would undertake the task of investing our money in Ireland.  That could be done on a non-Party basis and could be approached objectively.  We have the task not merely of mending our economy but of rebuilding the economy of this country, which was never undertaken before, and indeed I should like to draw attention to this point: if there is any unbalance in our trade or in our payments position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world, it arises from the fact that this country is partitioned.  This is one of the factors to which the attention of the British Government might well be drawn by the Minister for Finance if any question arises as to the unbalance of payments.</P>

      <P>That in order to achieve a balanced economy for small-holders resident in Gaeltacht areas and with a view to implementing the Government's stated policy for taking all steps necessary for the revival of the Irish language, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Minister for Agriculture should fix a guaranteed economic price to be given in respect of the total output of tomatoes from Connemara and other Gaeltacht areas for this coming year.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that a scheme was initiated in 1947 whereby grants and other facilities were made available in certain Gaeltacht areas, particularly in Connemara and Donegal, for promoting the development of the growing of tomatoes under glass.  The scheme is a good one, in that it is an attempt to make available to people in the congested areas, where the holdings are uneconomic and where no other form of employment is available, facilities to enable them to produce a fruit or vegetable for which there is ready sale.</P>

    <P>To a certain extent, the value of the scheme is impaired by reason of the low prices which tomato growers in <Col N="517" /> those areas succeed in obtaining.  I noted from time to time that a restriction on the import of foreign-grown tomatoes had been imposed in order to afford a greater degree of protection to our own growers.  By reason, however, of the location of the tomato schemes in the Gaeltacht areas, in Connemara and in Donegal, it is difficult for the growers there to obtain economic prices in the Dublin markets. If my recollection is correct, last year and the year before the marketing of the tomatoes from Connemara was undertaken by a Dublin fruit merchant.  I think it was an arrangement made by the Department.  I am not criticising the Department for having made that arrangement&mdash;it was probably the only convenient arrangement that could be made&mdash;but it does illustrate the difficulties that confront the tomato growers in the Gaeltacht areas.  In the Gaeltacht area of Donegal I think that the marketing was organised through some local merchant.</P>
    <P>The proposal which I bring before the House in this motion is that the Government should guarantee an economic price to the tomato growers in these areas.</P>
    <P>It would entail probably subsidising, to a certain degree, the growers in the Gaeltacht area.  I know that the question of subsidising the production of food or other commodity in one area of the country as against another area is open to criticism but I think we have to be ready to meet that criticism if we are in earnest in our desire to maintain the Gaeltacht, if we are in earnest in making available facilities in those areas that will enable people to obtain a living and also if we are in earnest in our claim that we want to preserve and maintain the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In Connemara I think that the scheme started in 1948 by having 63 houses.  This was extended in 1949 and 1950 and the numbe of houses was increased to 95 houses.  In Donegal the scheme started by having 80 houses in 1948 and this number was subsequently increased to 100 houses; therefore, the total number of tomato houses in those two areas is now <Col N="518" /> something which is under 200&mdash;195, I think.  There may have been some increase in 1951; I have not got the figures for 1951 but in or around 200, I think, may be taken as the total number of houses affected.  The production per house is in the neighbourhood of 18 to 23 cwt.  I mention this to indicate that the total amount of subsidy involved in the number of existing houses would be small.</P>
    <P>The House will have some appreciation of the difficulties that concern the tomato growers in these areas by reference to the prices which were made available to them.  Prices, I understand, in 1950 ranged between 4d. and, I think, 10d. a lb.  I believe the average price in Connemara in 1950 was 7¼d. per lb. while the average price in Donegal in 1949 was 6d. per lb. and 7d. per lb. last year.  These are the average prices and I understand that there is a much greater fluctuation in the prices actually during the season.  It would, therefore, not be very costly to provide a subsidy, if needs be, in order to guarantee a minimum economic price to the tomato growers in these areas. The subsidy, if it amounts to a subsidy, could be raised by imposing a tax on foreign grown tomatoes to make up the necessary amount to defray the cost of the subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy say what an economic price per lb. would be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are given fully by the Department of Agriculture. They make different estimates. In the final analysis it depends on what you consider to be the necessary amount of profit which the grower is entitled to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy any idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give particulars to the Deputy if he wishes.  The average obtained per house in Donegal in 1949 was £47 6s. 3d.  What is described as the prime upgrading costs amounted to £14 15s. 1d., leaving a net difference of £26 2s. 2d, by way of profit for the grower.  Profit is hardly a correct term to use in that connection, <Col N="519" /> because, in effect, that amount represents, not profit in the ordinary sense, but the earnings, the pay for the labour expended by the grower.</P>
      <P>It will be readily appreciated that if this scheme is to be of real benefit to a family, either in Connemara or in Donegal, an annual return of some £26 is inadequate.  I am not attempting to decry the scheme or saying that, even with the small returns that the scheme makes available to the tomato growers in these areas, it is not a good thing, but I do know that the cost of guaranteeing a basic minimum price in those areas, limited to the Gaeltacht areas, would be negligible as compared with the value of such an arrangement and that the cost of this could easily be obtained by a very small levy on tomato imports at different ports of entry.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this proposal very seriously and to approach it on a non-Party basis.  The Minister has this advantage.  He can say: &ldquo;This is a scheme which we introduced ourselves in 1947.  It is an improvement on one of our own schemes, and we are glad to accept any suggestions to improve one of our own schemes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, it is far from that.  If the Minister will look at the returns of his own Department he will see that the number of houses was increased in 1949 and 1950.  However, I do not like the interjection of the Minister because it seems to be another indication that he has no intention of approaching the matter objectively.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is very much more I can add to what I have already said.  I feel that the implementation of what I propose would not be very costly and would be of considerable benefit to the people of the Gaeltacht. It has the further advantage that it could be defrayed by a levy on imported tomatoes without materially affecting the cost to city dwellers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amusing to think that a Minister who occupied an <Col N="521" /> honoured place on these benches so far forgot the Clann na Poblachta doctrine as to support the entry into this House as Minister of Deputy James Dillon, who assumed office on the 18th February, 1948.  No doubt, after a Cabinet meeting with Deputy MacBride he made the following statement with regard to an estimate introduced by his predecessor in office, the present Minister for Local Government. Speaking in the Dáil on the 25th February, 1948, Volume 110, columns 91 and 92, the ex-Minister for Agriculture, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subhead 1 (4) deals with a rather exotic proposal.  With some reluctance I ask the House to grant this money for the astonishing purpose of erecting glasshouses in Connemara. However, with faith&mdash;I might almost say with blind faith&mdash;I propose to allow the glasshouses that have been erected to be glazed, but I am not concerned to press this scheme any further than it has already gone. I should add this, steps have been taken in connection with this scheme in Donegal and in parts of Connemara. I do not propose to recommend to the Dáil that the scheme should be further expanded...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the statement made by a Minister who had been in office only a very short time, having, in fact, been elected seven days previously by Deputy MacBride among others, and put in charge of the fate of the Connemara people, and such was his verdict on the tomato scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is looking for the resurrection of a scheme which was introduced into this House by the Fianna Fáil Government and which was wrecked by the ex-Minister for Agriculture during a period of three years in this House&mdash;wrecked with the support, the blind support if you like, of Deputy MacBride.  I consider it an impertinence on the Deputy's part, having helped to ruin that scheme, to come forward now as a repentant sinner in sackcloth and ashes begging the Fianna Fáil Party to resurrect the industry.  It is a rather amusing picture if there was not tragedy behind it.  I wonder will Deputy Dillon come into the House now and tell us about the poor people down in Meath Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in Dominick Street?  He wanted cheap tomatoes to be imported from Holland for these people and he had not a care about the people of Connemara.  They were no concern of his or of Deputy MacBride's while he occupied one of these benches.  He did not worry because Deputy Dillon, when Minister for Agriculture, had decided, out of the goodness of his heart, that he would not object to give money for the glazing of the glasshouses already erected.  I wonder when are we going to see an end put to humbug in this House.  Is it possible that Deputy MacBride having, as he has now told us, this scheme as one of the principal planks in the Clann na Pobhlachta platform, could come in here and definitely wreck this industry by supporting Deputy Dillon's nomination as Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years before Deputy MacBride ever came into this House I brought forward proposals and suggestions for the improvement of the western seaboard.  I did not, I admit, confine myself to tomatoes.  I dealt as well with all the varieties of small seeds that could be produced in Connemara and with the intensive work of that description that could be done down there so as to provide employment for those people who were forced to emigrate.  It was very little use <Col N="523" /> making any appeal along those lines during the three years when Deputy MacBride had an opportunity, as a member of the Cabinet, of making sure that the tomato industry which had been started, put under way and fostered by the Fianna Fáil Government, would be carried on and expanded in the way in which it was intended it should be expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <P>I have given here the statement made by the then Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the first speech he made in this House.  I have not the speech with me but I hope some other Deputy will have it.  Those who started this industry and got it under way were crushed out of existence in a scandalous manner by the malicious manoeuvring of the late Minister for Agriculture in importing foreign tomatoes.  It was definitely malicious manoeuvring.  This House has passed a Bill which will enable us to go ahead faster in seeing that suitable industries are promoted in the Gaeltacht areas so that we shall be able to preserve in those areas our Irish population. Three or four months after being removed and after going back to the Clann na Poblachta Party with his little theme and after telling them all about the tomato scheme he wrecked, Deputy MacBride came back here with a Party of two.  A bicycle made for two would do him now. After doing that, Deputy MacBride gets up in this House to repent of his sins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another newcomer up there.  He had better keep quiet.  I certainly wish to see the tomato industry in the West not only brought back from the wreckage, but expanded and put in such a position that no tomatoes will be required from the Dutch or from any other foreigners.  We ought to be self-supporting as far as tomatoes are concerned, and there is only one way of achieving that.  The way to expand the tomato growing industry is not to open the floodgates and throw in on top of the unfortunate tomato grower, when he had his tomatoes ready to sell, the tons of tomatoes from Denmark and Holland.  That is not the way to do it, but Deputy MacBride sat in this House when that was being done and supported the Minister who was doing it.</P>
      <P>That is my grievance with Deputy MacBride.  I admit that, when I read his Clann na Poblachta programme first, I was nearly carried away with it and I gave a kind of sympathetic look at him when his Party came in first.  &ldquo;Hang it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as a crowd they might do some good.&rdquo;  But what good could you expect from a Deputy who comes in here, buries his whole policy, sacrifices everything and every principle upon which his Party went before the people, and throws the agricultural community in general and the people in Connemara, in particular, into the rapacious maw of Deputy James Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture?  Hang it, before I would put myself in Deputy MacBride's boots and table a motion like that under discussion I would go out and do something else.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when I was so rudely interrupted, we have those <Col N="527" /> proposals in conjunction with every other proposal.  All I can guarantee is that faithfully we intend taking up where we broke off when the Deputy by his combination succeeded in putting those things back.  Our policy, as far as tomato growing is concerned, will be pushed ahead and carried out without the foolish interference of the Deputy.  One difference is that we have our own way of doing things and we will do them in that way.  I would suggest, therefore, to the Deputy not to waste the time of the House in endeavouring to bring forward here ideas, good ideas perhaps at one time, but ideas which he wilfully wrecked for a place in the sun for a couple of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion and I do so from no political angle.  I had the privilege of accompanying my fellow Deputies from West Donegal on a deputation to the Minister's predecessor for a guaranteed price for tomatoes.  We did not get a fixed price but we eventually did get some measure of help by way of a ban on imported tomatoes at certain periods of the year.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, too much lip service is paid to the Gaeltacht.  Since I came into this House I am convinced that nothing is being seriously done to assist the Gaeltacht.  Here we have an industry established in the Gaeltacht by Deputy Smith when he was Minister, the industry of home grown tomatoes in Connemara and West Donegal.  Remember that West Donegal is the biggest Gaeltacht in this country and nothing has been done for it so far by any Government other than what was done for it by Deputy Smith by setting up a local industry.</P>
      <P>Now we find that a motion is brought in by Deputy MacBride to guarantee to these people a fixed price for tomatoes; in other words, that they should be told in advance what they were going to make during the coming season.  That would be an enticement to them to remain at home instead of emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You would be surprised to know the <Col N="528" /> repercussions of this meagre sum of £25 which these tomato growers receive.  Is the House aware that in order to earn that £25 they are working from the month of April approximately to the following October&mdash; admittedly part-time work?  At the end of that time they receive the meagre sum of £25.  That £25 is taken into account and assessed against their means if they apply for unemployment assistance.  If one of the tomato growers is an old person entitled to the old age pension that £25 is again taken into account and assessed against the means of that unfortunate person.  I know that the people are anxious to make a success of tomato growing but they cannot do it on £25 a year.</P>
    <P>Falcarragh and Cloghaneely, all that particular Gaeltacht in West Donegal where the scheme was inaugurated, is practically denuded by emigration.  I put down a question within the last week to find out whether it was proposed to extend electricity to that particular Gaeltacht. The reply I received was that it would be considered and if it were an economic proposition electricity would be laid on.  I suggest that there is no use in spending money on the undeveloped areas of West Donegal until we first instal electricity.  If we had electricity it is quite possible that the tomatoes could be tinned in the season, that surplus fish could be canned and that potatoes could be canned as cooked potatoes, but until we get electricity into the area none of these things can be done.  I respectfully suggest that the only alternative pending the introduction of electricity into the Gaeltachts of West Donegal and Connemara is to guarantee a minimum price for tomatoes.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Minister that I am aware that his supporters are anxious to see a minimum price fixed, but I do hope that no Party whips will be put on if the motion goes to a vote.  I would not like to see it going to a vote; I would rather see the Minister accepting the motion, because by doing so I think he would be doing something good for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the scheme extended. <Col N="529" /> I am anxious to see the day when each of the tomato houses will be heated by electricity and water laid on.  I want to see as much advantage taken of the scheme in Donegal and the West of Ireland generally as one could possibly imagine.  Do not forget that you are dealing with the areas from which the greatest number of migrants leave the country.  If we are anxious to hold our native Irish speakers at home and stem emigration it is only by subsidising and encouraging native industries that we can do so.  If the Minister could give, by way of subsidy, a guaranteed price to the tomato growers in West Donegal and Connemara it would not mean dearer tomatoes for the people of Dominick Street or anywhere else.  I do understand that there are very big concerns which deal in the growing of tomatoes. We are merely asking them to foster and encourage tomato growing in the Gaeltacht.  I am certain that even if we had an extra subsidy it would not increase the cost of living of the unfortunates of Dominick Street or the other streets of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's reply to a question that I put down for the 30th January was not satisfactory as far as I was concerned and, therefore, I asked permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment. In his reply the Parliamentary Secretary said that the priority list, which is the subject of our main argument with his Department, was not rigid, in other words, that it was not adhered to rigidly.  I should like to inform him at the outset that it was rigidly adhered to up to 1947, with one exception, namely, the Maine valley drainage project.  Every other main drainage scheme has been surveyed and carried through.  The priority list was made out in the following order: the Brosna (No. 1), the Clyde and Dee (No. 2), the Feale (No. 3), Maine catchment area (No. 4), the Corrib (No. 5), and the Moy (No. 6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was made out by the Drainage <Col N="530" /> Board established by the then Government, and it was regarded by the Department as the principal priority list up to 1947.  The Maine valley drainage district was surveyed and the upper reaches were drained in 1932 and completed in 1933, approximately 20 years ago.  While the upper reaches were being drained a survey of the lower reaches of the Maine was carried out and three tributaries of that river were surveyed.  It was assumed at that time that the Board of Works would complete the scheme.  Twenty years have elapsed and the scheme is still incomplete and at the moment we do not know what the position is with regard to it.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the Maine drainage scheme was deleted from the list and I find that it is not mentioned in the major drainage list or in the minor catchment areas list.  I understand that the Board of Works scheduled two lists, one dealing with major catchment areas and the other dealing with minor catchment areas.  Strange as it may appear, the Maine drainage project, which was deleted from the major priority list, was not included in the minor catchment areas list.  During that period the Nenagh River and the River Rye, in Kildare, have been surveyed. I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department that, in regard to the urgency and importance of drainage, there is no analogy between those rivers and the Maine.</P>
    <P>The Government established a Drainage Board to collect evidence and data in connection with all drainage districts in the Twenty-Six Counties and a priority list of major and minor catchment areas was recommended for urgent consideration.  The order was as I have given.</P>
    <P>Owing to serious flooding in this valley in 1946 a report was forwarded to the Land Commission and to the Minister's Department.  A list was included assessing the loss of crops, live stock and farm buildings at £7,000. The recent storm and floods caused, in cattle, horses and equipment, a further loss of £3,000.</P>
    <P>A letter was sent to the Secretary of the Department by the Secretary of the Firies branch of the River Maine <Col N="531" /> Drainage Association.  Deputy Donnellan was informed about the meeting and, if I am not mistaken, Deputy Donnellan visited the district subsequently. The letter that I have referred to is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a meeting of the Firies Branch, River Maine Drainage Association, held on 4th March, I was instructed to communicate with your office as the responsible authority for implementing the Arterial Drainage Bill, 1945.  Pursuant to said Bill a priority list of rivers in Eire most in need of dredging was compiled and the River Maine was placed fourth in this list.  Work is in progress for some time on the first and second of those rivers, namely, the Brosna and the Glyde and Dee, and will begin shortly on the third, the Brick and Cashen.  On behalf of the members of our Branch, who are much perturbed, I would respectfully request an explanation as to why the final survey of the Maine has not been undertaken, considering that said river is next in the priority list and the fact that it was promised by your Department that it would commence in the summer of 1948. Another factor that has not tended to allay their uneasiness is that the final survey of the River Rye in Meath and Kildare, never recorded in any priority list, is nearly completed. The same would apply to the Nenagh River, where a final survey is being carried out.</P>
    <P>To explain why our members are so disturbed, and they have a very good reason, I will briefly refer to the alarming position that confronts them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The letter refers to the drainage of the Maine in the years 1932-33:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" />&ldquo;A big number of bogs at the upper end of the river were opened during the emergency and all the minor drainage schemes were under taken by the Kerry County Council during the past few years.  Broadly speaking, four-fifths of the river remaining to be dredged is tidal and embanked.  Most of these embankments were constructed in 1750, more than 200 years ago, and are crumbling to decay under the stress of years.  Nearly every flood makes a number of breaches, allowing the tide to flow over the lands, often for years, until the Land Commission comes to the rescue and repairs those breaches.  This is a costly business to the local landowners, who not only suffer damage by flooding but who also have their annuities increased in order to pay part of the cost of repairs.  Just one example of the enormous losses suffered by the people living along the tidal portion of the river.  After the August floods in 1946 an assessment was made of their losses.  It amounted to over £4,000, and the details were forwarded to the Land Commission. This assessment was incomplete and an under-estimate.  A separate one was made of the middle and upper reaches of the river, and not included in this total.  Costs were based on the current prices of agricultural produce in the summer of 1946.  When replacement was made in the spring of 1947 prices had increased threefold owing to the inclement harvest and winter.</P>
    <P>From the following I think you will understand the unenviable position in which all those living along the tidal reaches of the river are situated and how they view any delay or infringement of their rights in regard to dredging with very serious apprehension.  In this matter, the Board of Works, charged with the implementation of the 1945 Drainage Act, has grave responsibilities as regards its just administration. Public statements as regards drainage, recently reported in the Press, have had a very disquieting effect on our members and to allay what may be unnecessary fears on their part I <Col N="533" /> would be very much obliged if you would be good enough to forward me information on the following points at your earliest convenience:</P>
    <P>(1)On what date will the final survey of the River Maine be undertaken?</P>
    <P>(2)Does it still occupy its original position, fourth place, on the priority list and what steps are being undertaken, if any, to implement this position?</P>
    <P>(3)If the river has been removed from fourth place on the priority list, please state by whom, when and why?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is signed by Mr. John Moriarty, secretary of the association.  I should like to make it clear to the Parliamentary Secretary that the position there is very serious.  Some of the people concerned are homeless as a result of the recent floods.  Their stock has been destroyed and subscriptions have been invited to a local fund for their relief.  We believe that a great injustice has been done to the people concerned.  I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary is guided in this matter by his officials who state that a resurvey must take place. I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that this area was surveyed on two occasions away back in 1933 and that there is no real necessity for a resurvey.</P>
    <P>As proof of that, I would instance the Corrib where previous surveys were used in the final arrangement and were accepted by his Department. I understand that his chief engineer insists on a resurvey as the survey of the Maine catchment area was originally carried out under the 1925 Drainage Act and that, as it is now being completed under the 1945 Drainage Act, it is imperative to have a resurvey. My answer to that is that even with a resurvey the old data should be utilised.  The old data which was compiled after an exhaustive and extensive survey should be utilised and accepted.  It has been proved in the case of the Corrib and in other areas that a new survey brought about the same result as the old survey and that the data was similar. <Col N="534" /> The rivers in these areas had not changed very much in ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>If my contention is accepted by the Department, it will expedite our scheme inasmuch as even if a resurvey were carried out at the earliest possible date, use of the old data would shorten the period and would give a final result in half the time generally scheduled by the Department. The data compiled in the case of the Corrib gave similar results to those obtained from earlier surveys. When the survey of the Maine was carried through originally, three tributaries of the Maine were included.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask why should any Minister or any Department, after adhering to this list for five years, suddenly delete the Maine drainage scheme from the list.  I do not want to make any charges against the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Donnellan, nor to make any debating point at Deputy Donnellan's expense.  I can win my case, I hope, without being personal in any way, but I do say that this injustice, as we term it, happened in 1948 and we must assume that Deputy Donnellan was influenced in some way, because the Corrib was the fifth on the list while the Maine was fourth on the list and in the end the Maine was deleted altogether from the list.  It was bad enough to have that occur but there was no question of the Maine catchment area being mentioned even in minor catchment area schemes.  It is not mentioned anywhere.</P>
    <P>That is what we are fighting against; that is what our people will protest and agitate against.  The farmers down there are quite determined on this matter.  They have held public meetings and they have informed me that, if necessary, they will agitate against payment to the Land Commission or to any other authority.  We have advised them that saner counsels should prevail and that they should listen to reasoned argument in the matter before any drastic action is taken.</P>

      <P>I wish to emphasise finally that a grave injustice was done when this project was deleted completely from the list in 1948.  Even after that, other rivers were taken on and surveys carried out while this important scheme was deleted altogether.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is sympathetic and that he will do his utmost.  I desire to emphasise, however, that the people in the areas I have mentioned have suffered in the recent floods as no other people in Kerry or in Munster have suffered, and that we are determined to fight on their behalf.  I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will see that justice will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appear to be the culprit in this matter even though Deputy Flynn did not say so outright; he merely hinted it.  Deputy Flynn said that the Maine arterial drainage scheme has been deleted.  It was not deleted in my time and, though I do not know what has happened since, I do not believe that there has been any change whatsoever.  I believe that it still has its priority.  When I was in charge of the Office of Public Works a survey of the River Feale in County Kerry was completed, and they were going ahead with the drainage scheme. As a matter of fact, I think it would be impossible to start another arterial drainage scheme in that county.</P>
      <P>I found a whole province without any arterial drainage scheme at all. The officials of the Office of Public Works&mdash;I was not responsible for this &mdash;felt that the River Corrib should be considered, but that scheme did not in any way interfere with the Maine scheme in Kerry.  I should be long sorry if it were so.  It was just a matter of giving an opportunity to all parts of the country to participate under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act. I think Deputy Flynn is under a misapprehension in this connection.  The Maine scheme was not deleted in my time and I am certain that it has not been deleted since as, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary will inform us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where Deputy Flynn got the priority list from which he quoted.  However, I should like to <Col N="536" /> stress that the priority list drawn up under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 was not rigid in any way and that I think that any slight change that may have been made as regards the Maine will not have any ill effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan) Patrick Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was put down by Deputy J. Flynn but, of course, almost similar questions were asked on previous occasions by Deputy Finucane and by Deputy Palmer.  They got replies from my predecessor in office to the effect that the priority list was not a rigid list.  The difficulty in regard to staff and machinery was also explained.  I have great sympathy with Deputies from rural Ireland who are interested in drainage.  I realise how harassed they are by their constituents who believe that by creating an agitation they will force the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake their particular scheme of work.</P>
      <P>Great stress has been laid on the matter of the priority list, but it must be borne in mind that comprehensive arterial drainage is new in this country.  We had partial drainage but we had not comprehensive arterial drainage.  The Act of 1945 provided for comprehensive arterial drainage. That was as a result of the findings of the Drainage Commission, who reported that partial drainage had been tried for over a century in this country and found to be a failure and a waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must throw our minds back to the time when the Arterial Drainage Act came into operation, and even to the years previous to it after the Drainage Commission had reported.  At that time a war was in progress and the amount of machinery at the disposal of the Office of Public Works was very small.  The engineering staff was equally small.  They were to undertake a big job of work at that time, prior even to the enactment of the Bill. It was not possible for the commissioners or the engineers to say with any degree of certainty when normality would be restored to the world and when it would be possible to get the machinery that would enable them to undertake certain schemes.  Therefore, <Col N="537" /> this priority list was made out in a provisional way.  In my opinion the engineering staff made out a list in such a way as, in the first instance, to undertake the drainage of catchment areas which would present the least difficulties or engineering problems. The Brosna covers a very wide area but, even so, it was regarded as a river that presented less difficulties than any other in the country.  The same applied to the Glyde and Dee. A chance was taken in regard to the Feale&mdash;and it is even a chance to-day. Bear in mind that even yet there is not any certainty, because of the tidal vagaries, that the scheme will be a success. At any rate, the machinery was being built up and the staff was being added to.  The machinery was put on the Brosna and afterwards on the Glyde and Dee and special machinery was got for the Feale.  Were it not that special machinery was got for the Feale that scheme could not have been undertaken.  The Corrib comprises a very considerable area of flooded lands. I believe that when the commissioners saw that the machinery was becoming available they decided they would go on with the survey of the Corrib. However, we could carry on surveys for a long time but that would not get over the difficulties that might be experienced on the various schemes.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the Maine scheme has been deleted from the list.  By a very slight margin, the Maine has qualified as a major arterial catchment area.  It comprises an area of 101,000 acres.  There are a number of rivers in the country that are three or four times as great as the Maine&mdash; including one which is pretty near to my heart, the Suck.  The Suck is about 319,000 acres in extent and a considerable amount of damage is done there too.  Likewise, there is a considerable amount of damage on the Moy, on a river in Clare, and in other places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On every one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with Deputy Flynn and with the other Kerry Deputies who are interested in this matter.  The position is that I have not got the staff to go on with the work and, when they are engaged <Col N="538" /> on another survey which will take them a considerable length of time, sympathy is not of much use when I cannot translate it into immediate action.  The Moy is due for survey.  In fact, an inventory has been taken of the damaged lands and the survey is due to start in the spring.  I had hoped, and I still hope, to have two survey staffs put on the work, but it is not so easy to build up these survey staffs.  My predecessor in office tried, with a certain degree of success, to build up the survey staffs.  On the whole, however, the response is most disappointing.  You publish an advertisement in the newspapers announcing vacancies for so many engineers for a particular job.  Then you receive applications, interview the candidates, select a number of them for the posts and, after all that, some of the successful candidates refuse to accept the posts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  We must try and finish the jobs we are working on before we can undertake any others.  The Brosna is in its fourth year and a half, and perhaps it will take another year and three months. The scheme for the Glyde and the Dee is there.  I am sure that, with the best will in the world and all the machinery which it will be possible to put on it, the Feale will take another three and a half years.  The Corrib has been surveyed: the designs have to be made out and all the other work done.  It is likely that further special machinery of a different type will have to be procured before we can undertake the outfall of the Corrib.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn mentioned surveys made in connection with the Maine and the Corrib, and how they greatly facilitated this matter.  They may facilitate to some extent the Corrib but, at the same time, the recent Corrib survey took three and a half years.  Any surveys carried out before that were carried out in respect of what are known as drainage districts, not catchment areas.  Catchment areas comprise more than one drainage district, and as many as three or four drainage districts <Col N="539" /> in some cases.  Consequently, a fresh survey has to be undertaken because the whole catchment area must be embraced.  What would be a sufficient survey for a drainage district, taking the contour of the land and the different gradients of the tributaries and so forth of a catchment area into consideration would not suit a comprehensive drainage scheme.  Consequently, all these matters must be considered.</P>
    <P>I shall not make any foolish or false promises here.  I could go down to County Kerry and play petty politics of a short-term character.  I could represent to the people there that due to the efforts of Deputy Flynn I was having that survey carried out within six months or a year.  I am not going <Col N="540" /> to act like that because I cannot carry out such a promise.  I have not the staff to do it, and what staff I have are engaged on other work.  There is no hope of augmenting the staff to such an extent as to deal with the Maine immediately.  When it comes to the time to decide what rivers will be surveyed, I shall take advice from the people who are competent to advise me.  I shall not take the responsibility of giving priority to the Maine, the Suck or any other river.  I shall be advised by the people who can give a detached and an unbiassed opinion on matters of that kind, and I shall act accordingly.</P>
