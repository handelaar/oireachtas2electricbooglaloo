      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the failure of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland) to comply with the provisions of Section 46 of the Transport Act, 1950, and Section 55 of the Railways Act, 1924, respectively, requiring these undertakings to regulate the rates of pay and conditions of service of certain of their employees by agreement with the trade unions representative of such employees; and, if so, whether he will take steps to ensure that the law is complied with in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any failure on the part of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) to comply with the statutory requirements to which the Deputy refers.  I have no functions under Section 46 of the Transport Act, 1950, or Section 55 of the Railways Act, 1924, and consequently there is no action which I can take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is furnished with a copy of the relevant correspondence will he undertake to take the matter up with Córas Iompair Éireann?  Is he aware, and, if he is not, will he ask his advisers to make him aware, that apart from the legal rights of the workers concerned, constitutional rights are also involved in the matter?  Will he give an undertaking <Col N="984" /> now that he will raise the matter with Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well that under the Act passed in 1950 the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in these matters. If the Deputy questions something that Córas Iompair Éireann is doing from a legal or constitutional point of view then he has his remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the duty of the Minister to see that the Act is enforced and that the workers employed by Córas Iompair Éireann are given their legal and constitutional rights?  Will he give an undertaking that if he is furnished with the relevant correspondence he will take the matter up with the company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that workers in receipt of workmen's compensation are suffering hardship due to the inadequacy of the maximum weekly payments to meet the present cost of living and that many of these workers with large families are compelled to exist on 50/- per week for a number of years before any settlement is made, and in a large number of cases are compelled to exist on this amount for life; and, if so, he will now introduce proposals for legislation to remedy this unsatisfactory position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that many young Irishmen, residing in England, have recently been notified <Col N="986" /> that they must either join the British Army or leave the country; and, if so, if he will indicate whether citizens of Ireland are not protected against compulsory service in the Army of another country; and, if not, if he will take steps to safeguard their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No liability to be conscripted into the British armed forces exists in the case of Irish citizens who do not ordinarily reside in Britain for permanent purposes for periods over two years.  Even in the case of Irish citizens ordinarily resident in Great Britain for more than two years they do not incur liability for conscription if they are resident there for a course of education or some other temporary purpose.</P>
      <P>Following representations made by the Irish Government, the position has been, since 1940, that no Irish citizen, even if called up for service in Britain, will, in fact, be conscripted if he chooses to return home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that an Irish citizen such as a migratory worker or a worker of that kind need not leave the country when he gets a demand either to join the forces or leave the country?  In other words, can the British Government compel him to leave Great Britain if he does not join the forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>State grants in aid of transport services for the conveyance of children to school can be made in cases where the average daily number conveyed is normally not less than ten.  In order to be eligible for conveyance to school by a transport service a child should be <Col N="989" /> between the ages of six and ten years and reside at least two miles from the nearest school, or be between the ages of ten and 14 years and reside not less than three miles from the nearest school.</P>
      <P>According to particulars furnished to the Department it appears that there are only eight eligible children residing in St. John's Point area.  None of these children, with the exception of one, has more than 2½ miles to travel to the school at Ballysaggart.</P>
      <P>As the necessary conditions in regard to the maintenance of the requisite minimum average conveyed are not fulfilled, I regret that a grant-in-aid of a transport service in this case would not be warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>An ambiguity in the tender form in this case created doubt as to which of two tenderers offered the lower price, so that the acceptance of either tender might be open to question.  Furthermore no prices were included in either tender for alternative forms of construction.  The tender prices would also need to be adjusted for wage and price changes occurring since the tenders were received by the council in May, 1951, and the adjusted prices would represent a high cost of construction.  The decision that the contract should be readvertised was therefore made in order to clarify and elaborate some of the items of cost involved and also in the hope of getting more favourable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As in former years, it is proposed to have a general debate on all the Votes for the Department so that any specific questions may be raised.</P>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £53,560 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charges which will come in force of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the practice of previous years, I propose, if Deputies see no objection, to deal on this motion with the nine Estimates, Nos. 29 to 37, inclusive, for which I am responsible. All of these Estimates are for essential services.  They are made up mainly of salaries, wages and allowances, and apart from changes in rates of pay, they do not vary much from year to year.  Accordingly, I do not think that there is any necessity for me to go into any detailed explanation of the figures.  The Estimates have, of course, increased steadily in recent years, on account of increases in rates of pay, but I can assure Deputies that every effort is being made by way of reorganisation and simplification of procedures to secure economies.  But for these measures, the cost of the services would be higher still.</P>
      <P>The first Estimate, No. 29, is for a total sum of £80,360 for the Office of the Minister for Justice.  It is almost the same as last year's Estimate and does not call for any comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 30, is for £3,608,840 for the Garda Síochána.  It shows an increase of £124,490 over last <Col N="995" /> year's figure.  This increase is due to four main causes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A revision of Garda pay as from 1st January last;</P>
    <P>(2)  provision being made to take in 300 recruits during the current year;</P>
    <P>(3)  provision being made for 53 weekly pay days in 1952-3 as compared with 52 in 1951-2;</P>
    <P>(4)  an increase of £63,000 under sub-head H in respect of transport.</P>
    <P>The increase in respect of transport is due partly to increased running costs but mainly to provision being made for the purchase of 85 cars and eight motor-cycles as an addition to the Garda transport fleet.</P>
    <P>The Prisons Estimate, No. 31, at £197,020, is much the same as last year's.  Owing to increased costs of foodstuffs, fuel, etc., and the need for increased expenditure on maintenance and improvement of prison buildings, the Estimate would have been a good deal higher than last year's but for the fact that economies have been secured by reorganisation.  It was found possible during the year to secure these economies by arranging that only prisoners on remand and prisoners serving sentences not exceeding three months would be kept at Cork and Sligo prisons.  This enabled the staff of those prisons to be reduced.  Deputies will observe that provision is being made this year for a total staff of only 295, including all ranks, as compared with a total of 314 in last year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Votes for the Circuit Court and District Court, Nos. 32 and 33, I am glad to be in a position to inform the House that material progress was made last year in the improvement of the position of the staffs of these courts.  As a result of an examination which was held last year, 71 unestablished officers of the Circuit Court were granted established status.  Out of a total clerical staff of 151 employed in the Circuit Court offices, including 12 employed on probate work, whose salaries are borne on the High Court Vote, only 26 are now unestablished, and it has been <Col N="996" /> arranged that all future vacancies will be filled by established officers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Court Officers Act, 1951, provided for the grant of established status to certain unestablished District Court clerks and the grant of retirement gratuities to other clerks who do not qualify for establishment. A scheme to give effect to these provisions has been agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance and will be put into operation shortly.  Some economies were secured during the past year by suppressing a number of part-time posts of District Court clerk as vacancies occurred and assigning the duties of those posts to other clerks.  Deputies will observe that provision is being made in this year's Estimate for a total staff of 154 for the District Court, as compared with 159 in last year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any need for me to say anything about Votes Nos. 34 to 37, for the Supreme and High Court Offices, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, the Public Record Office and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.</P>
    <P>It has been customary for the Minister for Justice, when introducing his Estimates, to give a brief review of the volume of crime.  I regret to have to say that the situation is not good. Before the war the average number of indictable crimes per annum was around 6,500.  The figure increased steadily up to 1943, when it reached 17,305.  There was a gradual improvement from then until 1949, when the figure fell to 12,171.  In 1950 the number increased to 12,231, and the provisional figures for last year show a further increase to 14,462, which is more than twice the average pre-war figure.  The increase has occurred entirely under the heading of &ldquo;Offences Against Property&rdquo;, which consist mainly of housebreakings and larcenies. In 1938 offences against property totalled 6,142.  In 1951 they totalled 13,128.  Offences against the person have remained fairly constant, the figure for 1938 being 453 and the figure for 1951 being 450.  Of the 14,462 crimes reported in 1951, 9,069 were committed in the Dublin metropolitan district.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> The number of prosecutions for summary offences in 1951 was 145,660&mdash;a decrease of 1,922 on the figure for 1950. Road traffic offences accounted for 86,424 of the prosecutions, offences under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts at 17,212 being the next highest, followed by 10,238 prosecutions for unlicensed dogs and 6,138 prosecutions under the School Attendance Acts.  Prosecutions for unlighted cycles and motor vehicles amounted to 50,000, more than a third of all the prosecutions for summary offences.  It is very regrettable that there should be so much carelessness in complying with this safety regulation and that so much of the time of the Guards and the courts should be wasted enforcing a regulation the need for which is apparent to everyone.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, these nine Estimates are for essential services which vary little from year to year. This year's Estimates do not present any unusual features and I trust that Deputies will have no hesitation in approving them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much in this particular Estimate that one can challenge and I hope to be as brief in what I have to say on this Estimate as the Minister was in introducing it. I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister has not given as much information as he could be expected to give.  There is just one small bright spot in it, that this is probably the only Department&mdash;at least I am afraid it will be the only Department&mdash;that will be able to indicate to the House that there are reductions in staff rather than increases.  The Minister made a passing reference to recruitment to the Garda force and that the intention was to recruit, I think, 300 in the current year.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate to us when he is concluding whether the full 300 have been recruited and, if they have been so recruited, is the Minister satisfied that he now has in the force sufficient Gardaí to protect the person and property of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that there has been a very substantial increase in crime, particularly in crime against property and that, of course, the great bulk of that type of crime <Col N="998" /> lies within Dublin.  Frankly, I am not surprised.  It must be clear to everybody in Dublin that there is very little if any police protection of property in the city.  The city, as we all know, has expanded enormously and certainly the police force within the city and county area has not increased to any degree in proportion to the increase in the number of houses and the extent of the area to be covered.  Nowadays, it is a very rare thing to find a Guard on patrol duty at night in any part of the city and particularly in the outlying parts of it where protection is more necessary than perhaps it is in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a very urgent need for the provision of sufficient police to give adequate protection to people in the City and County of Dublin. There is need for it in other parts of the country also, but it is most badly needed where the great bulk of crime is in order to give protection against housebreaking and larceny.  I believe that the very substantial increase, especially in the last 12 or 18 months, is largely due to the fact that the offenders know that the likelihood of their being detected by the police in the commission of the crime is very remote.</P>
    <P>One must be shocked in this year of our life to learn from the Minister that there were no fewer than 6,000 prosecutions for non-attendance at school.  I hope I got the figure right. It is a figure that ought to shock us in this particular period, in view of the enormous expenditure, comparatively speaking, involved in providing primary education and in view of all the efforts that are being made and have been made over the years to provide better schools and more schools, to bring the schools, so to speak, nearer to the children.  Having regard to the ever increasing necessity for seeing that our children and, in particular, the children of the poor, get the maximum education we can give them, it is, to say the least of it and putting it mildly, very regrettable that there should be no fewer than 6,000 school attendance prosecutions.  Of course, we can take it from that that the 6,000 prosecutions do not cover the whole story, because I am quite <Col N="999" /> sure that the non-attendance on the part of a child or children has to become pretty bad before a prosecution follows.</P>
    <P>May I say, before I go on to the next point, that the Minister and the authorities are to be congratulated on having provided the new uniforms for the traffic duty policemen?  Let us hope that it will be found possible in the near future to give the other members of the force throughout the city and county the benefit of those better-looking and more comfortable uniforms.</P>
    <P>That brings me to traffic and transport.  It is an understatement to describe the traffic in this country&mdash; and, again, more especially in the metropolitan area&mdash;as being chaotic and positively dangerous.  It is a rather ticklish problem to speak on here but from my observation of it all the blame should not be laid, and cannot justly be laid, against the motorist.  I think that the cyclists, and to a certain extent the pedestrians, show a degree of carelessness that is almost criminal.  There are motorists in this country, particularly in this city and county, who in my opinion should never be allowed to sit behind the wheel of a car&mdash;and I am not confining those remarks to those who are inclined to indulge in alcohol.  I have myself seen motorists in this country, and particularly on the County Dublin roads, show as great a degree of carelessness and recklessness at 11 o'clock in the morning as you will see sometimes at 11 o'clock at night.  That is not to be taken as in any way condoning the drunken driver.  I have no sympathy whatever for him and I do not think that anybody else has either.</P>
    <P>There are drivers of cars who have very little regard for the lives or the limbs of the people who are using the highways and, apparently, they have very little regard for their own lives either.  I am not so sure that we have not reached the stage&mdash;some people think that we reached it long ago&mdash; when there ought to be some test before a driving licence is issued.  I realise that there is more than one point of view in that respect but, <Col N="1000" /> having regard to what a dangerous vehicle a motor car can be in the hands of a careless or incompetent driver, or a person who for one reason or another is unsuited to drive a car&mdash;having regard to the danger to life which a car can be in unsuitable hands&mdash;it seems rather strange that, just on the payment of 10/-, any person should be qualified to sit behind a wheel.  I should like the Minister to have another look at that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I feel that we shall never put down the careless driver, in many cases the extremely careless cyclist and in some cases the careless pedestrian, with the present powers which the police have and with the inadequate number of police who are dealing with traffic and transport problems.  I am not so sure that it would not be worth trying a system something like what they have in America which gives the Guard the right in respect of certain offences to inflict the penalty and collect the fine on the spot.  There is a good deal to be said for that system though I know that there are points that can be urged against it.  Anybody who uses the roads of this country, particularly a person who is driving a car, can hardly go out any day of the week without seeing traffic regulations broken with impunity. There is no Guard on the spot; the offender disappears, and there is no more about it.  I should like to see tried out for a time a system of mobile police on motor cycles.  I do not think, either, that it would be any harm if we had a few ordinary motor cars without aerials and loud speakers, and so forth, to announce to all and sundry that they were police cars, with perhaps a few plain-clothes policemen in them.  I think they would be able to detect more quickly offences against traffic regulations than is the position at present.</P>
    <P>I desire to pay public tribute to the police who are on point duty in his city and, for that matter, in other cities also, but particularly in Dublin City, where there is such a tremendous number of motor vehicles.  These men carry out their very onerous duties for fairly long stretches of time.  To keep traffic flowing, even as slowly as it does nowadays, through the centre of the <Col N="1001" /> city requires tremendous concentration, and I think that it is unfair that men should be expected to remain on point duty for long periods of time.  I think that traffic policemen should be relieved as frequently as possible and particularly during the winter and in hard weather.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to add to the almost innumerable duties which at the moment are placed on the shoulders of the police force of this country.  I think a great many of the duties are not worth the time taken up by the police force in the matter of filling up forms and making notes and so forth. I think that a great number of the duties which they have to perform for and on behalf of other Departments of State take up an undue amount of their time and that some effort should be made to get those duties&mdash;in so far as it is necessary to carry them out at all&mdash;carried out in some other way.  In my opinion there is no doubt that a good deal of the time of the Guards is taken up in a type of work which is almost futile and which I doubt serves any very useful purpose.</P>
    <P>There is one particular duty which I should like to see the Guards carry out if at all possible in the areas concerned&mdash;and I say this with full knowledge of the very many duties which the Guards have to perform.  The duty I have in mind could be of great value to the country if it were possible to earmark, so to speak, some Guards for it.  I refer to protection for our inland fisheries.  I have been told&mdash;I am just passing this information along for what it is worth&mdash;that the view is taken in Gardaí circles that the protection of fisheries is none of their business.  If it is not, then in my opinion it ought to be.  For a number of years past we have been talking and writing and making speeches about the value of tourists to this country and of the necesity to attract them here in the off-peak season in an effort to extend our holiday season.  As I have said here on another occasion, it seems to me that there are three ways&mdash;and probably only three ways&mdash;in which we can attract the tourists in the off-peak season and so lengthen the period in which tourists will arrive here.  These three ways are by the development of <Col N="1002" /> fishing, hunting and shooting&mdash;and I think, in particular, fishing.</P>
    <P>I believe that our inland fisheries could be of very great value indeed to the nation but the present system of protection for various reasons is not effective.  I should like the Minister to examine the matter at least to see if there is any way in which he could help.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I ask the Minister if he can tell us anything about the Solicitors Bill&mdash;how far it has advanced, whether we are likely to see it in the near future or what is the position?  I would hope that it is almost ready for presentation to the House and I would ask the Minister if he would indicate the approximate date of its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief indeed. I should like, first of all, to draw the Minister's attention to the increase in the number of gaming machines, particularly in the City of Dublin.  The number has increased enormously in recent years.  I am sure everyone here will agree that there is no need to dwell on the great danger involved for the youth of the city if this tendency is allowed to continue.  In my own constituency, in which there are a number of tenement houses and corporation flats, one can see youngsters gambling at those machines every day.  Not alone does one see children so occupied, but their parents also.  They go in the morning to the shop to get their ordinary rations of tea, bread and butter and a few coppers&mdash;two or three or perhaps up to 12&mdash;will go into the gaming machines.  We have heard the amazing figures from the Minister in regard to prosecutions under the School Attendance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that you will find, in most districts, that many of the children missing from school are occupied at these gaming machines.  I would ask the Minister to be very strict and have these machines removed completely.  I do know of one case in which a young boy developed a craze for gambling at these machines.  He went so far as to steal money in order to satisfy his craze and, as a result, he is now in a Borstal institution.  I do not think these <Col N="1003" /> machines should be allowed, especially in the City of Dublin.  I do not know how the country is affected, but here in Dublin people are gravely perturbed by the increase in the number of these machines and the facilities given for their operation.  I would ask the Minister to have them wiped out completely. They are a scourge and a menace to youngsters of the city.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of recruiting for the Garda.  As Deputy Morrissey has very properly put it, here in Dublin there is very little protection for property at all.  Anybody who has any knowledge of what happens when the Dublin Corporation acquires house property under a compulsory purchase order will tell you that the very next day after the property is vacated, the house is broken into and that the lead pipes, lead flashing and everything capable of being removed is stolen. Even in good residential areas, such as Clontarf and Pembroke Road, when a house becomes vacant you will find that it is broken into that very night despite the fact that there are people living on either side of it.  We who are members of the Dublin Corporation experience a great deal of trouble from the fact that corporation property is damaged in this way.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that when these 300 additional Guards are recruited the greatest number of them should be left in Dublin.  They are needed badly in the city.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the question of damage to houses which are vacated, I should like to say that we have had a number of complaints in connection with the removal of lead piping by the Gas Company immediately these houses are vacated.  Some of these houses may not be in a really bad condition and the corporation might be able to transfer certain people to these houses as a temporary arrangement until such time as they get a reconditioning scheme carried out. When, however, these persons go into these houses, they find that the gas pipes have been removed and the Gas Company will not reinstall pipes unless the incoming tenants are prepared to pay a fee of £3.  Deputy Byrne will <Col N="1004" /> bear me out in the statement that it would be a great hardship on these poor people to have to pay such a sum of money.  The removal of the pipes in the first instance, of course, is due to the fact that we have not sufficient Guards in the city to protect such property.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to see that when these recruits are ready to take up duty they will not be sent outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the boxers are left in Dublin.  I do not know why, but we always seem to get them.  May I say that the Guards assigned to traffic control duty here in the city deserve the greatest possible credit? They seem to have unlimited patience. In that connection, may I repeat a statement which has been made more than once, that the more one sees of lady motorists the less one likes them? The only thing you are sure of when you see a lady motorist with her hand out is that the window is down.  You do not know which way she intends to go.  I do say that the Guards deserve the greatest credit for their tact and intelligence in dealing with the traffic.  I should like also to congratulate the Minister and the Department on the new uniforms supplied to the Gardaí.</P>
      <P>On this debate last year I mentioned the question of providing houses for Gardaí when they are sent to the country.  I have heard complaints that when married Gardaí are transferred to the country they are sometimes offered houses which are not suitable for men with families.  I know the Department of Justice does not erect houses but it might be possible for the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, to formulate some scheme whereby proper houses would be provided for Guards transferred to the country.  Finally, I would again request the Minister to do what he can to get rid of gaming machines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to know that serious crime is not increasing to any <Col N="1005" /> very marked extent.  I think we may attribute that to the efficiency of the Gardaí.  I think everybody has nothing but the highest praise for the efficiency of our Gardaí.  So far as school attendance prosecutions are concerned, I am anxious to know if the Minister can give us any indication as to the principal factor to which the Guards attribute the increase in prosecutions. Is the increase due to lack of parental control?  In my opinion a certain amount must be due to bad housing and to slum conditions.  From personal conversations which I have had with Guards in the City of Cork I know that they do attribute a number of these cases to bad social conditions and to an unsatisfactory home life.  It would be interesting to know what has been responsible for the increase, especially in the City of Dublin, where, of course, there is the largest concentration of population.  I am afraid it has to be looked upon as another of the evils of too large a concentration of population in one centre.  The Minister for Education has a big responsibility in this connection.  My information is that when there is a big movement of population from one district to another in the city, and when children are transferred from the area in which they were born to a new housing scheme, very often there is no school accommodation for them in this new housing area. That is another serious problem which must be considered by those who are responsible for enforcing the attendance of children at school.</P>
      <P>When the houses are ready for occupation there are no schools available in the new housing areas and I think there is need for some co-ordination between the Department of the Minister for Justice and the Department of the Minister for Education in connection with the provision of schools in these built up areas so that the schools will be available to the children as soon as the tenants go into the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to traffic in our cities, I think the most serious complaint in that respect is the speed at which motorists drive through the cities of Dublin and Cork.  I think there should <Col N="1006" /> be a definite speed limit in our cities and suburbs.  I think it is scandalous that motorists should be allowed to drive through these places at the speed at which they drive through them at present.  I do not know that it is always right to blame the pedestrian. Very often the pedestrian is puzzled because of the speed with which the traffic goes and I am inclined to blame the motorists more than anyone else for the number of accidents, particularly fatal accidents, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I agree with everything Deputy Gallagher has said about the housing accommodation for Gardaí on transfer from one district to another.  I have come across quite serious cases of hardship myself where Guards were transferred and failed to find accommodation for themselves and their families.  Some of them have to cycle very far to their barracks because they could not get houses in closer proximity to them.  I would appeal to the Minister to give that matter his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I think the fines imposed for offences under the food regulations are altogether too trivial and I think the Minister should take note of that.</P>

      <P>I am pleased there has been no increase in serious crime but I am concerned with the increase in the number of prosecutions for non-attendance at school and the increase in the number of housebreaking charges, particularly in Dublin.  In that connection I would again appeal to the Minister to establish some co-ordination between his Department and the Department of Education in relation to the question of permitting children of tender years into these cinemas.  Has the <Col N="1007" /> Minister any responsibility in connection with these cinemas?</P>

      <P>It is very distressing to see children of five, six and seven years of age going into the picture houses while there is no restriction on what they may be shown in these places.  Everything is done that seems to take away from our children that civic sense we would like to see them develop.  There appears to be very little censorship of what is shown to children in the cinemas.  I think those of very tender years should be prohibited from attending cinemas and for the other age groups there should be special showings.  I am satisfied that cinemas have a bad effect on children and I think non-attendance at school is largely due to the fact that these children get a conception of life from the cinemas which is contrary to the Irish conception of life.  They become indifferent to parental authority and everything else.  I would like to see some restriction placed on their indiscriminate attendance at cinemas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the new uniform that has been issued to certain limited sections of the Garda Síochána and, like Deputy Morrissey, I trust there will be expedition in the supply of these uniforms to the force in general.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the Garda officers normally on duty within the precincts and within the environs of Leinster House.  I feel there is a special case for giving priority to them in the supply of this uniform.  Leinster House is a centre of attraction for tourists and it would be an improvement to the general tone of the place if the Garda officers on duty were issued with the new uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any indication as to what the results were, if any, of the inter-departmental committee set up to investigate the position of the Garda Síochána in general? Has there been any resolution of the problem of what is the ideal type of future Garda force?  We hear a good deal of criticism with regard to the <Col N="1008" /> supervision of the City of Dublin and I would like to urge once more upon the Minister the desirability of an increase in the mobility of the force together with an amelioration of the conditions under which the men have to do night duty.  I have advocated before that a mobile canteen would be a very useful addition to the depot transport of the Garda authorities so that the patrol men could procure at reasonable intervals some hot coffee and sandwiches.  That would, in turn, enable them to check at a central point.</P>
    <P>I think we are inclined to direct our criticism against the force without adverting fully to the necessity for a more highly mechanised type of efficiency as distinct from purely personnel efficiency.  The increase in larceny and housebreaking must occasion alarm.  I think the most effective way to combat that would be by having an efficiently mobile striking force with the patrol screen outside it.  The more highly mechanised the Guards become the more likely we are to arrest these occurrences at the <i>locus in quo</i> or its immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the housing situation in relation to the Gardaí.  I am also worried about the pensions of certain retired members of the force and, in particular, about the allowances to the widows of some of the deceased members.  I have raised this matter before.  I am not raising it now in a spirit of controversy or with a desire to embarrass the Minister in any way. I am raising it merely in order to keep it on record and to reiterate the appeal that we must make on behalf of these people.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing for Gardaí, I think the time has now come for the Minister to set about having, in a district where you have a sergeant and three members of the force, at least one house available within his own control.  We do know that many transfers have taken place in the case of married men, leaving single men untransferred.  These transfers impose a considerable hardship on those people.  One hardship which we seem inclined to neglect, arises from the initial transfer.  That causes inconvenience, <Col N="1009" /> because in many cases, when a married man is transferred, his children may be at what one may describe as the half-educated stage. Those with experience in the education of children know that it is not exactly the best thing to have a break in a child's life when it has reached a certain stage of education.  It will have settled down to the ways of a school over perhaps a period of four or five years, and so if a married Garda is transferred it may take some time before the children will readily settle down in a different school.  I know the Minister can tell me that is the man's own affair, that the Commissioner may readily tell him that, too, and that the district justice may tell him that, but I submit to the Minister that it is a matter of general concern.  I think the matter is one on which the Minister must have his own personal outlook and, therefore, I would suggest to him that it would be well if he were to examine it again and try to reduce to the absolute minimum the transfer of married men with families, particularly in cases where the educational problem arises.</P>
    <P>There are other facets of the Vote which I want to deal with.  I want to know from the Minister what progress, if any, has been made in regard to the inevitable hardy annual problem&mdash;the Land Registry&mdash;and what progress, if any, has been made in connection with the Circuit Court clerks.  We had a fairly comprehensive advance made on behalf of the District Court clerks.  I am sure they will be pleased to hear from the Minister of the abolition of certain part-time posts and that the number of established District Court clerks is on the increase.  I am glad to see that, because one of the posts that had to suffer the fate of abolition happened to be in my area.  I feel that the contumely which I might have suffered as a Deputy for not being over-vociferous in ensuring its continuance has been justified by the fact that a permanent and pensionable post will become available at some future time as a result of these amalgamations, which were long overdue.  I feel the time has now come to deal with the next type of clerks.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1010" /> Secretary to the Government, who has come in, will, I imagine, have something to say on that aspect of the question because he has a more intimate and more personal knowledge of the matter than I have.  I would ask the Minister to put what pressure he can on the Department to ameliorate the many grievances which those people are suffering from.</P>
    <P>In general, I think we are entitled to say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Minister's Department.  There have been many improvements effected, from our point of view as lawyers, in various aspects of the administration.  We are glad to see that.  With Deputy Morrissey I should like to revert for a moment to the question of the recruitment of 300 Gardaí.  I am completely opposed to Deputy Gallagher's view.  I think that nearly the worst thing that could happen to a young Guard is that he should be sent from the depot to a Dublin station.  I do not think that is the best way to initiate those Guards into a knowledge of their general duties, nor do I think it would produce the most desirable consequences.  I think that most of them want a little bit of experience, and I happen to know that a good many of them might, in the main, be very anxious not to get a city assignment at the moment.</P>
    <P>I might ask the Minister, apropos of that, if he thinks there will ever be a solution of the vexed problem that arises in connection with Gardaí stations in the city.  The Minister must know perfectly well&mdash;we know perfectly well&mdash;that the impact of the cost of living and the difficulty that arises in connection with various types of accommodation, is felt in a more exaggerated way in these city stations than it would, say, in the normal rural district.  I wonder if there is any way of resolving that problem, and whether there might not be some special allowance made to the Gardaí in the metropolitan area to enable them to overcome these particular hardships?</P>
    <P>I feel that many of the multitudinous duties which are imposed on the Gardaí throughout the country should be scrapped.  I would be inclined to go even further than Deputy Morrissey did in this matter.  I think the time <Col N="1011" /> has come for the Minister to retire, as quickly as he possibly can, within his own field.  These Guards are being used as a kind of spare-time filing clerks, for the filling of forms for various Departments, and for the carrying out of various types of investigations.  A great deal of their time is taken up in the filling and completing of forms.  Now that rationing and its implications are, apparently, to go, I think the time has come for the Minister to get this type of archaic form-filling out of the way in the Garda stations throughout the country.  I think he should also try and get rid, as soon as possible, of the accoutrementa and documenta, except those which are immediately relevant to his own Department, which adorn these places, thereby making more time available to the Gardaí to perform their normal duties, as distinct from being worried with filling forms and answering letters from X Departments.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to agree with what Deputy Hickey said about motorists. The main difficulty that is facing us to-day in connection with road traffic is not the much maligned motorist. The much maligned motorist has not got a snowball's chance in Hell if anything happens.  There can be no doubt about that if one bears in mind the chaotic conditions which obtain so far as traffic in this city is concerned.  If one wants to inform himself on that he has only to be around O'Connell Bridge at 5 o'clock in the evening and see what the conditions are there&mdash;a great congregation of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.  In my view, the cyclist has become the real traffic menace in Dublin.  There is a normal regulation which says that only two can cycle abreast.  In certain circumstances three may cycle abreast, but in traffic it was never meant that more than two should travel abreast. Certain very worthy film excerpts have been issued by the Department of Local Government calling on all to &ldquo;make the road safe&rdquo;.  If you are driving a car and you happen to stop at Grafton Street corner or at O'Connell Bridge you will see anything from seven to 12 cyclists cross your <Col N="1012" /> bows.  That is bad enough but when they start dodging in and out between the tiny little spaces which there may be between cars, then woe betide the driver of a car if he happens to touch one of them.  I am not inclined to agree with going for the motorist where the motorist has been wrong. He, in the main, has suffered the consequences. I do not for one moment condone excessive speed in traffic.  I do not for one moment condone any of the crimes that go with alcoholism in motor driving but I do think that the problem in the City of Dublin will have to be tackled to ensure that cyclists keep within a reasonable distance of the side of the road and not go joy-riding in and out of the traffic or form like a cohort or a phalanx across the road when traffic starts off.  That is a facet of Dublin traffic that I would earnestly direct the Minister's attention to.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do with certain pedestrians in Dublin who, with a pedestrian crossing on their right and left, will insist on crossing the road in different directions trying to catch up with some pal who is shopping or trying to shout some observation at someone else?  What you are going to do with that type of pedestrian I do not know.  In connection with the motor accident problem and a good deal of the traffic problem in Dublin, a fair amount of attention will have to be directed to the cyclists and pedestrians.  I think the same is true, in the main, of Cork City.  It is a three-fold problem and all the blame does not rest on the shoulders of the motorists.  I earnestly urge the Minister to give some consideration to the production of regulations to control cyclist traffic in the City of Dublin. With a reasonable amount of control, I think the main difficulties in regard to congestion in traffic control will resolve themselves.</P>
    <P>With other Deputies, I would like to pay a very sincere tribute to the point duty men of both Dublin and Cork.  Patience and tact seem to be theirs in an inexhaustible supply.  They meet with all kinds of difficulties, and I think it would be unworthy of us, on an occasion such as this, not to pay <Col N="1013" /> tribute to that courtesy and tact.  Point duty is a type of avocation within the Guards itself that a person has virtually to have a vocation for in order to be successful.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I should like to urge the Minister to ask the Commissioner&mdash;it is primarily the Commissioner's function&mdash;to review the tour of duty of people on point duty, partiticularly in inclement weather during the winter and early spring.  I think there has been considerable improvement in that direction up to now, but I would urge the Minister to have any further improvement that is necessary carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I think that the problem of school attendance is taken a little bit too lightly by everybody.  Apropos of what Deputy Morrissey said, in the main, prosecution for non-attendance in relation to school children comes not on the first serious lapse or even on the second.  It comes when there is an indication of a general disregard for school attendance not in the main by the child.  The main responsibility in this instance must ultimately revert to the parents and that is where the root of this problem must inevitably lie. The Minister should urge upon his colleague, the Minister for Education, the speedy erection of adequate schools in very heavily populated areas.  Some of the schools in these populated areas have infinitely too many children attending them and it is not possible to check rolls and check attendances efficiently.  It is that type of overcrowding that inevitably leads to this loose system by which the children can either successfully &ldquo;mitch&rdquo;&mdash;maybe some of us mitched in our youth&mdash;or avoid attending school at all.</P>
    <P>That is something which should cause us apprehension.  Having regard to the limited opportunities and, in many cases, the possibility of ultimate emigration from this country, I think the least we can ensure is that the rudiments of education are the heritage of every Irish child in this new, free Republic of ours.  It is a difficult problem to deal with and I am sure it is one that has given the Minister's <Col N="1014" /> Department a good deal of worry and distress.</P>
    <P>It is easy for us to advert to it.  I frankly admit to the Minister that it is not too easy to suggest a solution. You have the instance where the parents are both working and where it is necessary for the maintenance of a big family that both the mother and father have to earn.  In that case, while one may criticise the parents, one must have a ready sympathy for the difficulties that exist.  It is a problem that calls for the co-operation of all sections of the community and particularly of the clergymen of all religious denominations.  It is something that must be tackled now.  It is a growth that has shown its head and it is something which, if not stopped in the beginning, may be infinitely more difficult to stop in later years.  I urge upon the Minister to use every means in his power to deal with the matter. Indeed, he may come to us to look for such other powers as he may feel are warranted to ensure the cessation of this tendency.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, with the output of new personnel from the depot, there will be an increase in crime detection and, as an inevitable consequence of that, a gradual decrease in indictable crime.  We would seriously say to the Minister that, where he has single personnel for too long a time stationed in certain areas, it might be well to advise the Commissioner in the interests of the Garda force itself as well as in the interests of the general detection of crime to do a bit of switching around. I do not think there is anything as likely to impair the efficiency of a single member of the force as what I would call overfamiliarity with his particular district.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck in his efforts to check indictable crime.  I wish him every success possible in the efforts to eradicate the growing increase in non-attendance at school.  Generally, I wish to say that we are appreciative within the courts of the efforts of the Minister himself and of his immediate predecessors in the amelioration of some of the worst problems that arose there.  May I conclude by again making <Col N="1015" /> a plea to resolve as rapidly as possible the problems of the Circuit Court clerks?</P>

      <P>This debate will probably bring up many hardy annuals, as it generally does.  There is one thing new that we noticed and that is the spectacle of Deputy Collins speaking in a quiet and even tone.  It was most refreshing and, in fact, somnolent probably, a contradiction in terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Or having blown himself out from past events.  However, it is good to see that a debate like this is approached in a proper fashion and that any matter that is put forward for the Minister's attention will be treated in an objective manner.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which I will quote from my speech last year which was taken up, that is, the question of the sitting of the Circuit Court in Cork. I read the Official Report of the Debates and I noticed that the speech of Deputy McGilligan was taken up in making the case, only to a small extent, against it but the Deputy said that I contradicted myself in almost every second sentence.  I read what I had said carefully and could see no contradiction in any respect in the way I made the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad, however, to feel that this question will not become a hardy annual and that we soon may see the High Court sitting in Cork as a matter of course.  The Minister, in reply to a question recently, indicated that the matter was receiving serious attention and he thought that all that was in the way was a small revision of the Juries Act.  I would urge on the Minister that it is not necessary to wait for such revision.  It is well known that the jurors in Cork are pretty well overworked in the matter of Circuit Court duties but, having regard to the advantages that would flow, I do not believe that the jurors would consider it a great hardship to serve for one or two <Col N="1016" /> terms on a High Court while awaiting the introduction of whatever amending legislation is necessary to extend the jury district in Cork.</P>
    <P>I have not looked up the matter but I am told that the only thing that is necessary now is a small amendment of the High Court rules, and that only in respect of two small details in the matter of setting down cases for hearing. I do not think that such amendment should take a long time.  Every effort should be made so that in the autumn, when the courts resume after the long vacation, the initial High Court of first instance should be held in Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the question of the establishment of Circuit Court officers.  I do not think he was listening to the Minister's opening statement in which he referred to the fact that about 71 serving officers were recently established as a result of a competition that was held last year.</P>

      <P>From time to time I have put many of the grievances of Circuit Court staffs to the Minister and I shall not delay the House by bringing up any details in this debate but I should like to refer to one outstanding anomaly in the establishment scheme that came into effect recently, namely, that an officer who was established and who was over the age of 30 years was not permitted to receive the ordinary children's allowances to which every established civil servant is entitled.  I cannot understand why there should be a distinction between a man of 30 years or less than 30 years of age who has children and a man who is over 30 years of age and who has children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I do not believe that there is any justification, moral or otherwise&mdash;and certainly not legal&mdash;in denying such established officer the right to receive the usual allowance in respect of the number of children that he has under 16 years of age or over 16 years of age and attending school.  The matter should be looked into and remedied immediately.  Apart from mentioning that matter, I shall not dwell on the question of Circuit Court staffs for the present.</P>
    <P>The recruiting which is now taking place will, it is hoped, provide some easement in the matter of Garda duties.  When I was young in Cork, to say that a man had a bobby's job meant that he had an easy time.  Nevertheless, Gilbert has put it on record that &ldquo;A policeman's lot is not a happy one&rdquo;.  In present conditions I am inclined to agree.  There are Gardaí on duty, particularly in the cities and in some country stations, for long hours, much longer than should be required of any human being.  I believe there is a recurrence of the obligation to do night duty far beyond the ordinary capacity of a man's endurance and health.  However, to a large extent, the recruiting will remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>There is another improvement that could be effected, possibly not immediately, but in the course of time.  The police barracks throughout the country generally speaking, are not very presentable. In Cork yesterday I heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs advert to the fact that the post office and the police barracks are the two public services to which the ordinary citizen has most recourse.  Not only that, but the visiting foreigner, the tourist, usually has occasion, for one reason or another, to go to the police barracks.  Generally speaking, the barracks present a very gloomy aspect. Old-fashioned forms are the only seating accommodation in most of them and, generally, the office equipment consists of old planks on trestles with ink stains, pencil marks and pen-knive marks, which have been there from ten to 50 years.  Some attention should be paid to dressing up our police stations <Col N="1018" /> so as to banish the gloomy, foreboding appearance that they present.</P>
    <P>I support generally what Deputy Morrissey said with regard to the issue of driving licences.  I do not think it is justifiable that one can get a licence without even presenting himself to the motor taxation office.  All that is required is to fill up a form.  A young lad of 12, or even younger, on presentation of a form and a 10/- note can get a driving licence which will qualify anybody over the age of 16 years to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle. I believe that this question has been and is being examined and I hope a statement will be issued in the near future as to what will be done about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to road traffic offences as being by far the largest category of offences which are brought before the courts.  Of the 86,000 odd offences to which he referred, 50,000 were driving offences under the Road Traffic Act.  I feel that that 50,000 would be more than doubled if it were not for a futile piece of legislation that we have at the present time.  I do not know if it is legislation or ministerial Order that obliges a person to have a dimming device on his motor car. There is no corresponding offence, so far as I know, so that anybody who has got a dimming device but fails to use it on proper occasions may be penalised.  There must be some means of bringing him before the court under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act &mdash;possibly under the section which obliges a motorist to drive with due care for other users of the highway&mdash; but beyond that I do not think there is any Order or piece of legislation corresponding to the Order which imposes an obligation to have a dimming device by which it is obligatory to use that device on the proper occasion.  I think it is a matter which should be looked into, although I appreciate the difficulty of apprehending a person who fails to use that device.  It is naturally at night that the dimming device is used, and, in the event of a person not using it, it is practically impossible to catch up with him, unless we are to have the introduction at some future date of the mobile police suggested by Deputy Morrissey.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> There is another matter with regard to lighting offences which I should like to bring to the attention, not so much of the Minister, as of every cyclist who has occasion to use the public roads, and particularly main roads, at night.  The only requirement with regard to a rear light on a bicycle is some kind of reflector and, having travelled main roads frequently late at night in the course of my Dáil duties, I should like to point out to cyclists the danger of having only a reflector. The cyclist by failing to use a proper rear light is causing grave danger to himself.  I say that in no spirit of endeavouring to bring about the imposition of extra taxation or from the angle of the convenience of the motorist.  Generally speaking, the motorist who hits a cyclist from the rear at night will come off best, probably suffering no more than a dent in his left wing, but for the cyclist, the results are serious and if he recovers at all, he will probably suffer from a permanent disability.</P>
    <P>That danger is all the more apparent and obvious where another motorist is coming towards the motorist who is approaching the rear of the cyclist and the earlier matter, the motorist who fails to dim, is possibly connected with this.  Even if that motorist dims, it is still very difficult to pick out a cyclist ahead, with a motorist coming towards you.  I appeal to all cyclists who have occasion at any time to use the public highways at night to equip themselves with at least the required reflector on a white background and, if possible, with a working rear light.</P>
    <P>Another matter of domestic concern so far as my constituency is concerned is the proper distribution of Garda stations.  In Cork, our Garda stations are situated so close together that one could visit all the city stations within half-an-hour.  I should like to take the Minister on an imaginary tour of Cork, entering the city from the Glanmire terminus area, which is the usual road from Dublin.  The first station the Minister will meet is the Lower Glanmire Road station, immediately outside the railway terminus.  Proceeding 150 yards or so, he comes to MacCurtain <Col N="1020" /> Street station, the principal station for the north side.  Then, crossing two bridges, he comes to Union Quay, the principal station for the south side, which is about 300 yards away.  200 or 300 yards further on is the Old Blackroad Road station and within five minutes walk is Barrack Street station. From Barrack Street to the Shandon Street station is only another ten minutes and from Shandon Street to Watercourse Road another five minutes, and he will have passed in the heart of the city the Bridewell, which is another of the major Garda stations. St. Luke's is only three or four minutes' walk from the Lower Glanmire Road station and the Minister will then have completed a circuit of the Garda stations within the city inside half-an-hour.</P>
    <P>Cork, like Dublin, is a rapidly growing city and people have occasion to use the facilities offered by the Garda stations frequently, but with modern transport, there is no reason why these stations should be so closely situated.  Many of these stations are in buildings which are not entirely suitable and there is no reason why they should not be pushed out a little towards the suburbs.  Everybody knows&mdash;I have adverted to it often here&mdash;that the Cork borough boundary encloses a very restricted area, having regard to the general size of the city and suburbs, and for that reason, with the city growing as it is and the real city being so restricted an area, having regard to the over-all size of it, there is every need for a revision of the situation of these Garda barracks.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I have referred on a number of occasions is the question of free legal aid for poor persons who are charged with indictable offences.  When I last spoke on this matter, I referred to the difficulty the poor person has in understanding a long and involved indictment.  One criminal act is often represented on an indictment sheet as five, six and even more indictable charges.  There are various degrees of criminality attaching to the different charges set out and it might be possible that, if a person were properly represented, he might not have to plead guilty, parrot-like, to the <Col N="1021" /> charges as read out, and, there being different degrees of criminality, there are often different degrees of punishment. Generally speaking, judges of the Circuit Court have the greatest sympathy with those people who are not properly represented.  They are given every opportunity, but it would be more satisfactory to the public conscience if we were sure these people were represented, though we know they would be fairly and properly treated by the presiding judges.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to make some reference, when winding up the debate, to the position regarding legal reform.  I read a rather ill-advised leader in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday on the Minister's Adoption Bill, which is coming before the Dáil in the next few days.  I am not going to refer to it beyond saying that though some of the material in the leader was ill-advised, they nevertheless did advert to the fact that apart from the necessity for legal adoption there is necessity for legal reform in very many instances in our legal code. I hope the Minister will have regard to that and if the Law Reform Committee is still alive I hope it will be gingered up a little so that we may see some of its work being put into effect.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Justice gives us a picture of peace from the records of his Department, it is a matter for which we should be thankful and on which we should congratulate ourselves.  It is a great indication of the general trend all over the country. I am glad to see such an era of peace, such a decline in general delinquency and crime; and I am glad to note that the work of the last three and a half years of the inter-Party Government is bearing fruit now, that the prosperity and peace we brought the country is continuing and I hope that nothing will arise to interfere with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to recruiting for the Garda Síochána, I know one case and possibly there are others where holders of the Fáinne, otherwise apparently fully qualified, have been rejected as recruits.  That is setting a bad example.  As far as I understand, they <Col N="1022" /> are perfectly qualified in every other way as regards age, measurements and general suitability.  The cases brought to my notice may have been isolated ones but I believe that at least in one case, which I can give the Minister, something has gone wrong and an injustice has been done.</P>
    <P>With reference to the work of the Land Registry, I am aware that for the last four years a large number of vestings have been sent from the Land Commission to the Land Registry each year.  Over the last four or five years, from 14,000 to 16,000 separate vestings have been sent down for first registration. I notice in the Book of Estimates that the staff has not been increased. The Minister would be wise to increase it as, from my remembrance of the work still left undone in the vesting of holdings, farms and allotments, I think approximately 50,000 to 55,000 remain to be done.  Unless there is a radical change of policy, most of these will be dumped over to the Land Registry Office from the Land Commission in the next three, four or five years.  The fact that these are not being dealt with, or that the staff is not sufficient to deal with them, is causing a certain amount of confusion and sometimes loss to people whose lands are in the transition stage.</P>
    <P>Those who are acquiring building sites from people whose land is only regarded as a schedule number in the Land Registry Office and which has not been dealt with yet, are caused a lot of inconvenience because of the delay in getting a grant from the local authority or in the Department of Local Government as the case may be. I would like the Minister, when replying, to tell the House what number the Land Registry Office is in arrears as regards total vestings.  He might also tell us whether he intends to increase the staff to get shut of the arrears.  I can say from my experience in the Land Commission that it is not likely that the flood of vestings coming from the Land Commission for the next four, five or six years will be less than 12,000 to 14,000 per year&mdash;that is unless his colleague, the Minister for Lands, decides to leave certain parts of the 1931 Land Act in abeyance and <Col N="1023" /> divert some of the staff from vesting, which would be a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Lands, which the Minister for Justice answered to-day, in regard to another point.  I have been aware for quite a while that though the Land Registry Office purports to register a person's property and to set out exactly the amount and its location, they fail signally in a very important matter.  That matter is as to where a man's property begins or ends.  A landowner down the country who may be selling land or buying land may find himself in a dispute with neighbours over fences or boundaries.  Then he asks the Land Registry Office to send him a certified copy map of his folio showing the property he owns.  He gets a portion of an Ordnance Survey sheet from them with a red line surrounding the property he is supposed to own.  There is one serious omission, in that it does not take account of the fences.</P>
    <P>The question I had to the Minister for Lands to-day deals with the sod fences usually used all over the country, the base of which in most cases is not less than six feet wide. The sod fence sitting on six feet of land very often is the cause of trouble or dispute between the parties who own the land on either side.  The Land Registry Office should describe it in one short sentence in the folio, setting out that the land the subject of that folio, runs to the centre of the fences on all four sides or runs to the inside or outside of the fences.  The folio should contain some definite description also as to where the particular holding begins or ends.  It does not do any such thing and that is a serious flaw in the registration of property.</P>
    <P>After all, the Land Registry Office is a very important State office which purports to set out or define a man's property and while it does it in a general way it certainly does not do so particularly enough in any single case.  I would ask the Minister to take the matter up with the legal advisers of his Department and to consult with the legal advisers of the Department of <Col N="1024" /> Lands and of the Land Registry Office in order to settle the matter because there is a very serious gap there.  It has been the cause of very costly litigation up and down the country and one short sentence typed into the folio in each case would set out whether a man owned the ground on which the fence stood, half of it or none of it. That is not too much to ask the Minister to do.</P>
    <P>Two Departments are involved, the Department of Lands and the Land Registry Office.  The Minister may say that it is the fault of the Land Commission when an exact boundary is not set out but it is the Land Registry Office which deals with the matter finally and it is to that office that the owner of registered property must apply in order to find out what that property is.  It is on the Land Registry Office that the final responsibility rests and having accepted the responsibility of defining and certifiying a man's property they should do it to the limit and define where the property begins and ends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like prominent people who profess to be experts in the administration of the law, particularly the traffic laws&mdash;we all do it from time to time&mdash;I am convinced that the Minister and the Government would be fully justified in authorising a considerable increase in the personnel of the Garda.  If I had the power or right&mdash; I have neither one nor the other&mdash;to choose whether the available money should be spent on increasing our national Defence Force or our Garda force I would certainly vote under existing circumstances for increased expenditure on the Garda.  I would do that solely for the purpose of improving the traffic supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who is actually responsible for the final decisions regarding the movement of traffic in big cities and towns, in Dublin City in particular. I have often wondered whether before such decisions are taken the prominent people who are responsible for the operation of our transport systems are consulted in any way or whether their views are taken into consideration.  I have had experience of supervising a fairly big section of a <Col N="1025" /> transport system which operates in this city and I have the idea from observation and experience&mdash;so it is not a new one&mdash;that the people responsible for fixing parking places and the changing of traffic regulations and routes have no regard for the requirements of those who own or operate horse-drawn vehicles.  I think that the people who make decisions on the operation of our traffic laws are purely motor-minded people who do not bother very much about the needs of those who must make a livelihood from horse-drawn vehicles.</P>
    <P>I wonder what these people would think and do if we had another world war&mdash;God forbid that we should have one.  There are people in this country at the present time, owners of private motor cars, who would drive their motor cars up the stairs to bed if they had the room, the space and the opportunity.  They are so lazy, so reluctant to walk, that they want to be landed from their beds in the morning to the place where they spend their daylight hours.  It is bad for these individuals physically and, while I do not know what our doctor members would say, I would say that it is bad for them mentally as well.  I am not blaming the Minister personally for this&mdash;far from it&mdash;but the Minister and his advisers should remember that there are less than 100,000 persons in the State who own motor cars and that the number of motor-driven vehicles using petrol, diesel oil or anything else, is 165,000.  Are we to give priority to the owners of 165,000 private motor cars or other motor vehicles to the exclusion of the rights of farmers, who are the biggest ratepayers, of those who live by agriculture and of others who must depend on the horse?</P>
    <P>Over the years we have boasted&mdash; since I was born&mdash;that we were the best country in the world for breeding horses.  With all that, we started at the very top of the State and did away with the beautiful guard provided some years ago for the President and other people who get a guard and dispensed with the horses, the best horses in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have a motorised force which holds up the whole city whenever the President comes from Árus an Uachtaráin to the ProCathedral. That is by the way but it happened.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister if he agrees with what I say to use his influence to see that those who drive horse-drawn vehicles and have to make a livelihood are considered in future when regulations regarding parking places are made or changed&mdash;and they are changed nearly as often as they are made.  These people should have some rights to move around the city. If the Minister or his advisers consult the people responsible for transport in this city they will find a genuine grievance.</P>
      <P>Horse-drawn vehicles are constantly held up and from my own experience it is not exceptional that a whole transport system is disorganised for a day.  You decide to do something in the morning and you find that it has not been finished by night simply because the men driving the horsedrawn vehicles cannot get into certain streets because they have been allotted as parking places.  These are streets which they must enter if the system is to operate efficiently.  If it is the desire of these motor-minded administrators to do away with the horsedrawn vehicle and deny its rights to move about the city in the same way as motor vehicles, all right then let them confess it and take the consequences. I would like the Minister to convey these views to his advisers when he gets the opportunity.  I am not manufacturing a grievance because I speak with considerable knowledge and experience.</P>
      <P>I would like some information on the movement of bus traffic when the depot starts to operate in the place selected by Deputy Cowan near Amiens Street. Deputy Cowan boasted in this House&mdash; I am sorry if the Minister was not listening&mdash;that he and he only selected the site of this infamous bus depot close to Amiens Street station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant because I want the Minister to ask his advisers if he does not know himself&mdash;he probably does know&mdash;what the position will be when that bus station is ready &mdash;I am taking it seriously now.  Will traffic for the South move across O'Connell Bridge and hold up traffic for the best portion of the day or will it be diverted up the North Circular Road adding a couple of miles to the journey of buses to Limerick, Cork, Waterford and every other part of the South?</P>
      <P>I am putting that as a serious query to the Minister, but not for the purpose of causing him any embarrassment. Apparently, he agrees with Deputy Cowan that this bus depot is in the proper place and I am sure that, with the present governmental conditions, he will not take the risk of losing the goodwill of Deputy Cowan in this matter anyway.  It will create a problem and I think this is a pertinent question, because I presume that before we discuss the Estimate for this Department 12 months hence the depot will be in full operation and then we will have some experience of the matter.  At any rate, the Minister can foresee that certain difficult problems are bound to arise and my question is one which he might discuss with some of his advisers, if he cannot answer it at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who advocate a far more strict test in regard to the issue of drivers' licences for motor vehicles.  As far as I know, there is not any test at all.  If a person pays a fee, he can get a licence whether he applies in person or not.  I am sure the Minister, from his experience and from the reports he has, will agree that there should be a more strict test of the drivers of motor vehicles.  If we had a stricter test, I believe that many of the accidents which occurred last year and in previous years could have been avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a deputation recently with representatives of other Parties in this House from certain temperance organisations. <Col N="1028" /> I would be hypocritical if I misled anybody into believing that I was a temperance advocate.  At any rate, I listened attentively to the very distinguished members of this deputation and their main cause for asking representatives of different groups to meet them was their desire to have certain amendments made in the existing traffic laws to deal with the tremendous increase in recent times in the number of charges brought against citizens for being drunk while driving motor vehicles.  They were particularly anxious to meet the Minister.  I do not know whether the Minister has met them in the last few weeks, but I would advise him to meet that deputation. I am not going to take up the time of the House in conveying to him what was conveyed to us by that very representative deputation of men and women, speaking not alone for one temperance association, but for a group of associations.  I told them that I did not agree with some of the proposals put forward and, therefore, they were under no delusion as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, that there is a case, based on the experience of the last few years, for looking into the question of the punishment inflicted on persons convicted of being drunk while driving motor vehicles.  The drunken driver is a menace to the sober driver.  It is generally the sober driver who pays the penalty when an accident takes place.  Whatever is the reason, the drunken driver generally escapes, but the sober driver in the other car has often to be taken to hospital and, unfortunately, in some cases loses his life as a result of an accident caused by a careless drunken driver.  There is a good deal of comment upon the variation in the type of punishment inflicted upon such people when found guilty.  A heavy fine is inflicted upon some of them which the justice knows perfectly well they are able to pay.  In some cases, the licence is suspended as well.  But the person who cannot pay a heavy fine, and the justice and the people responsible for the prosecution know that, is not fined.  He is sent to Mountjoy for a month or two months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter from the point of view of endeavouring, through the administration, to standardise the type of punishment meted out to people who are found to be drunk while driving a motor vehicle.  There is a good deal of justification for that.  I listened attentively and sympathetically on a number of occasions.  I cannot understand why it is that one justice imposes a fine of £20 or £50 on a person who is fairly well able to pay, while another person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I think the Minister understands what I mean and I shall not develop the matter further except to say that, if the Minister has any spare time, he would be well advised to receive the members of that deputation which recently waited upon the representatives of all Parties in this House and hear what they have to say because they can put the matter better and more forcibly than I can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Garda Síochána, I have no complaint to make.  I do not believe in using this House for the purpose of making complaints in regard to the general administration of the Garda.  I do not think I have ever used this House for that purpose.  But if I have, it was only on a very few occasions during a membership of close on 30 years.  I have always made any representations I have had to make either to the Commissioner or to the Minister responsible for the time being in regard to matters of that kind. There are, however, matters pertinent to the administration and working of the Garda which can be raised and have been rightly raised in debates of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how long it is since the rent allowance paid to Gardaí was originally fixed or how often it has been reviewed.  I can assure the Minister, however, that there is a very strong case for the revision of the allowance given to Gardaí, even those who live in villages and towns in the country districts.  The Minister has <Col N="1030" /> the advantage of being a representative for a rural constituency for a long period and he knows that the cost of housing accommodation and of houses built by local authorities and let by them has considerably increased.  I know of cases in my constituency where Gardaí were given houses built by a local authority in a small town with a population of 1,200.  The Gardaí, and rightly so, were compelled to pay the full economic rent. Nobody can make the case that a Garda should not pay the economic rent as he is given a rent allowance to help him to pay the rent or a portion of the rent.  In this town, the economic rent, with the rates added, is 26/- per week.  In another town, where Gardaí have been given houses by the local authority and which is a town commission area the rent fixed is 32/6, plus rates.  I do not think the rent allowance given to Gardaí is sufficient to meet these very high rents. As time goes on, the rents will probably be higher because the cost of building those houses continues to go up.  Therefore, the Gardaí who were allocated such houses by local authorities in recent times have to pay rents far in excess of the small rent allowance which they are given as a condition of service.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to inquire as to the cause of the delay in starting to build Garda barracks in some towns, for instance, Mountrath, which is in my constituency, where a decision was taken some years ago to provide a new Garda barracks.  Does not the Minister, and everybody else, know that the cost of building continues to go up and that material is not available in the same quantity as it was two or three years ago?  It is better to start now&mdash;better late than never.  There is another case of a place not very far from here in which there was an expenditure of tens of thousands of pounds involved and in which the delay in commencing building operations has caused serious loss. The cost to-day is five times what it was estimated to be and what it would have been if the work had started four or five years ago.  At any rate, do not <Col N="1031" /> delay any longer in commencing to build and complete these barracks in places where the Department has already sanctioned their provision. There is more than one case of that kind and the matter has been raised in the House on many occasions.  If the Minister cannot reply offhand&mdash;I did not give him any notice&mdash;I hope he will convey what I have suggested to the proper quarter.</P>
    <P>Another matter has been the cause of complaint in my constituency.  I cannot blame the Gardaí for this.  It is the refusal of members of the Gardaí, in exceptional circumstances, after normal working hours, to allow their telephone to be used to convey messages from local people who are looking for a doctor.  There should be no red-tape regulation put into operation and, if there is one in operation, it should be removed so as not to prevent the sergeant or whoever is in charge of a Garda barracks from allowing persons in the locality to use the telephone to communicate with a local doctor on an urgent matter.  I certainly would not shake hands with the sergeant or the Garda who would refuse in such circumstances to convey a message at the request of local people. If there is any such regulation in operation it should be removed so far as it applies to rural areas where there is no ordinary telephone service available after normal working hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mention the matter except that it has come to my notice.  In conclusion, I would like to ask the Minister whether he is himself satisfied that there is proper hospital treatment provided, especially in the Dublin area, for Gardaí who become ill.  It is over a year ago now that I was called to see certain Gardaí and I certainly was horrified by the conditions <Col N="1032" /> under which they were housed in a place convenient to the depot.  I talked with the then Minister for Health about the matter and I understand that proposals were under consideration for the better treatment of Gardaí who were ill and had to go to hospital.  There was limited accommodation in the place but I certainly would not congratulate the people who were responsible for the kind of conditions under which I found members of the Garda in what was called a hospital.  It certainly was not a modern hospital so far as the accommodation or treatment was concerned.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister is satisfied that the conditions prevailing in regard to this matter are satisfactory. I do not raise any matters deliberately for the purpose of embarrassing the Minister because he brought with this Estimate a good healthy report from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I do not want to upset him or his responsible advisers by making the position any worse than it really is and I do not want to make it worse than the Minister said it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House because most of the things I wish to say have already been said and there is no use indulging in repetition.  I want to congratulate the Minister on the continued efficiency of the Gardaí and on securing 300 recruits for the Garda Síochána.  My principal reason for rising is to express the hope that the time of some of the new Gardaí will be devoted to a new service of wardens for children attending school.  As regards watching children going to school in big numbers or watching them coming out at lunch hour, I am sure members of the House will agree that there is a need and an urgent need for a new warden service to protect the children of the schools especially in the city areas.  There are at least three schools in Dublin City where there are as many as 2,000 children attending.  To see the children flocking out and flocking inwards and taking the risks that children take, especially boys of 12 years of age or so, who will not look to the right or <Col N="1033" /> left, one realises the danger.  Even if they see a car at a distance the children with more daring than the others will make up their minds that they can beat the car and get across the road. In some parts of England and in America I have seen police protecting children leaving school.  Now that we have these 300 recruits it should be part of their training to protect children going to and from school.  There are various times during the day when they are required.  The children go to school at half-past nine.  That is one time they should be there.  They are met by their mothers leaving school at 12.30; their mothers must bring them back to school at 2.30 and meet them coming out at 4 o'clock.  This happens because there is no adequate protection for the children.</P>
      <P>Can you imagine a housewife, with three or four children, leaving the household four times a day just to see, and very properly to see, that her child crosses the road in safety?  I hold that is a matter for the Government and maybe not altogether for the Government as for the local and public authorities who would have to get full power to act from the Minister's Department.  Legislation of some kind and co-operation between the local authorities, the schoolchildren and the Gardaí are earnestly desired in Dublin City and County at the present moment.  My principal reason for rising in my place is to press that point home and to express the hope that the Minister will investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to join with the other members in congratulating the Minister on the efficiency generally of the Gardaí.  The local traffic superintendent here has a very difficult job to do. He has, I understand, a local inspector on the north side and an inspector on the south side and they are doing splendid work.  I want to express my admiration for the Gardaí on O'Connell Bridge.  It is a treat to watch them directing six lines of traffic at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put another point to the Minister.  I would ask him to give serious thought to reducing the speed limit in the new built-up areas, such as Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Cabra and <Col N="1034" /> Drimnagh.  In these areas, I feel that 20 miles per hour should be sufficient speed for motor cars or for vans delivering goods.  The roads in these areas are short, and the children are numerous.  If people had not four children they would not have got a house.  The children can be seen dashing across the roads, not looking to the right or to the left.  However, I hope that, due to the educational system, they will learn to look to the right and to the left, and be trained in the method of protecting themselves.  The narrow roads in those built-up areas are not suitable at all for heavy traffic and I do not think that cars and motor vans should be allowed to travel them at a speed of 30 or 40 miles an hour.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to cyclists.  I would ask my colleagues in the House not to be too hard on cyclists; they have their rights.  The bicycle is the workman's and the girl's method of getting to and from work. They have to travel long distances, right across the city, say from Fairview to the top of Grafton Street, and from the top of Grafton Street back again to Fairview.  I think a little coaxing would be a better method than any other to adopt towards cyclists. We must remember that the person who rides a bicycle is not in any way assisted by mechanical power such as diesel oil or petrol, but has to use his own energy.  Cyclists ought to get all the protection we can give them.  In my view, the red light on the rear of a bicycle is far more effective and far more necessary than a front light.  It is far more necessary in the interest of the cyclist himself, and it would be well if he saw that he had on his bicycle the red light, or the reflector.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Traffic Committee of the Dublin Corporation, which is presided over by an enterprising young man, by name, Councillor Fred Mullen.  He is very enthusiastic and has made many suggestions to the authorities about the traffic regulations and parking conditions.  I do not really know what can be done about the parking of cars in Dublin.  I feel the Government will have to take the matter in hands and give help and advice and, if necessary, substantial <Col N="1035" /> grants to the municipal authority in order to procure suitable parking places.  People living within a stone's throw of the city insist on bringing in their cars to the very heart of the city. At the present moment I know of no parking place within a mile of Nelson's Pillar, whether one goes north, south, east or west of that monument.  I do not know what can be done about that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin emphasised the point which I also have on my list, and that is in regard to married Gardaí.  We have come across married Gardaí in this city who have two or three children and who are in need of housing accommodation.  The economic rent of a three-roomed house with a kitchen is 32/-.  They are not always asked to pay the economic rent, but a rent of 25/- per week is asked for and paid by most Gardaí.  The rent allowance ought to be increased in accordance with the rent they have to pay to-day, which is more than the rent paid 25 years ago.  A Garda who is moved to Dublin from the country and who has two or three children finds it impossible to get a two-roomed flat for less than 45/- per week.  I feel that the Government should make some effort to build houses for the Gardaí and to let them to the force at a fair rent. Something substantial should be added to the rent allowance at present allowed to the Gardaí, or some inducement should be given to them to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to add only to congratulate the Minister and the Commissioner of the Gardaí on the efficiency of the men.  Their courtesy is talked about everywhere, and we hope that they will continue to live up to that standard.</P>
    <P>To return to the subject of parking cars, a summons should not be issued for the first trifling offence.  The offender should get a caution label informing him that he has overstayed his time.  A &ldquo;Do not do it again&rdquo; caution would be sufficient for the time being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is <Col N="1036" /> probably aware, there is a certain amount of discontent and dissatisfaction in the Carrigart district of my constituency.  That dissatisfaction and discontent has arisen because of the transfer, some time ago, of a Garda sergeant who had been stationed there. That Garda sergeant who came to Carrigart approximately at the time of the advent of the Coalition Government came there to replace his brother who had been a sergeant in the area and who had died.  He was sent to Carrigart station more or less on compassionate grounds&mdash;because of the fact that his brother had left a young widow and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After about a year in the station, a certain element in the district discovered that this man was not going to be led by their dictates.  I say solemnly and in all good faith, irrespective of what arguments may be put forward from the Department's point of view, that this man was changed for no other reason than the fact that a certain element in the district did not agree with him, could not get him to do as they wished and used political pressure to have him removed.  In the first instance, that was a grave injustice to this particular man.  However, what is of far greater importance in the long run is the fact that the circumstances surrounding that case are well known not only to the people in the Carrigart district, to the people in certain parts of my constituency, but to the Gardaí throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Any member of the force succeeding that man in this district or succeeding a man in any other district may say to himself: &ldquo;If I do my duty and if, in doing that duty, I come up against certain elements that do not like the way I do it, I am going to be removed from my station.&rdquo;  Is it not a fact then that such a person, in his own interest, will say: &ldquo;Why should I shove out my neck or chin in doing my duty if I am going to be changed?&rdquo; That is certainly what happened in Carrigart.  I ask the Minister to deny here in the House in his reply that that man was really shifted on political grounds and due to political pressure only.  If political pressure was not <Col N="1037" /> brought to bear on the case, will the Minister point out the reason why the man was transferred, to bolster up the case of the Department?  The man who was changed had served in the force for 20 years and had not a black mark on his record for that period. Why then should he have been shifted, and, in addition to that, why should he have been shifted from a Gaeltacht area to a non-Gaeltacht area resulting in a loss to him of 7½ per cent. in his pay?</P>
    <P>These facts were brought before the previous Minister.  He was well aware of them and also of the dissatisfaction in that particular Garda district because he received a signed petition in that connection from people of all creeds, classes and political affiliations. Eighty-seven per cent. of the total electorate in that particular area signed the petition asking that that sergeant be left where he was.  Despite that petition, the sergeant was changed and very much to his own disadvantage from a financial point of view.  I believe that all the facts were not presented to the Commissioner and that all the facts are not to be found in the Department's files.  That is the only reason that I can think of why that man should ever have been changed, irrespective of what Minister was in office.</P>
    <P>In order to elucidate the full facts, I think there is only one course open to the present Minister, namely, to have a sworn inquiry into this case and to have the full facts placed on the Table of this House.  With that plea, I leave this matter to the Minister and ask him to deal with it if possible in that manner because it is the only way in which we can get full satisfaction and so clear the name of this particular sergeant and give back to all concerned in the welfare of the Gardaí and the keeping of law and order in this country a certain amount of the faith which has been shattered in it as a result of this transaction.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the question of the recruitment of Gardaí.  This is a matter which may have been mentioned by a few people in the House to-day but it will be mentioned by many Deputies within the <Col N="1038" /> next few days.  A few Deputies with whom I was speaking this afternoon all have the same story as myself.  It was only to-day or yesterday that we really learned the facts in connection with certain people who have been turned down and have not been allowed to go forward for the examination.  I have one particular person in mind at the moment; there are a number of others but I will quote one case.  The young man is approximately six feet high, chest measurement about 40 inches or 41 inches.  He has had four years' secondary education.  He was a member of the L.D.F. and later of the F.C.A.  He is a native Irish speaker and he complies with the age limit.  That young man, who has a clean sheet, has been informed in the past few days that he is not eligible for the Guards.  His case is only one typical example of a number of cases of which I am aware and of a number of cases of which I have been made aware by Deputies from other constituencies. What method is adopted in the recruitment of the Guards?  At what stage is it decided that a young man is not suitable or eligible and on whose recommendation is the application of that young man, who apparently is eligible in every way, thrown out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This young man will not have a chance because he is not allowed to go forward for the examination. This is a typical example of what is happening in my own area and, as I have learned this afternoon, in many other areas too.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter before it reaches a stage where nothing can be done.  I ask him to let this young man go forward for examination&mdash;a young man who is, apparently, well equipped to be a Garda.  These young men should at <Col N="1039" /> least be given the opportunity of sitting for the examination.  If they are not successful at the examination nobody can have any quibble with the Minister afterwards.  It is essential that the Minister should look into this matter so that there will not be this dissatisfaction over the recruitment of Gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney has referred to one of the points which I intended to raise.  I think his experience is common to many Deputies of this House.  From what was brought to my notice over the week-end I had come to the conclusion that recruitment for the Gardaí had been abandoned.  A goodish number of young men from my area were measured and fulfilled the requirements in that regard.  Subsequently they received a communication similar to that to which Deputy Blaney has referred.  Every single one that I know of in my part of the county has had that experience.  It is difficult to understand the reason.  If a man has been measured and found to fulfil all the requirements, it is difficult to understand why he should be curtly informed that he will not be called for examination.  They regret to inform him that they do not need him.  I think that the people and, in particular, the candidates are entitled to know who made that decision.  I am not saying that anyone has made a wrong decision but I think that the candidates are entitled to some explanation as to why that decision was made.  Deputy Blaney has said all I want to say in that respect and I shall not delay the House any further on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to something which I think is causing a lot of annoyance in the Garda Síochána.  It would appear that a certain number of young men in the force married before they had completed the requisite period of service.  In consequence of having violated that regulation, their rent allowance has been withheld.  That is rather a childish thing to do.  I do not think that the regulation about the marriage of members of the Garda <Col N="1040" /> Síochána was ever taken very seriously. After all, everybody in this country says that what we really need are early marriages.  Late marriages are blamed for the low population.  Surely it is ridiculous to penalise a man, whether he be in the Garda Síochána or in any other job, because he takes unto himself a wife?  In my opinion, marriage is a thing that should be encouraged. If a member of the Garda Síochána feels that he is in a financial position to support a wife, I do not think any regulation should stand in his way.  We read in our newspapers last year that a test case was brought into court.  A member of the Garda Síochána attempted to recover the rent that had been withheld because he married too soon, according to the Department.  I think the only defence of the Department was the Statute of Limitation. Some rather scathing remarks were made by the gentleman on the Bench in reference to that case.  I am pretty sure that there are not very many of those cases and I am quite certain that the amount of money involved is very small.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter and see that justice is done to these people from whom that money has been withheld.  I think it is nearly time to abandon that rule for which there does not appear to be any good reason.  I am aware that it operated in the force that preceded the Garda Síochána but different circumstances and different conditions obtained then. I think it is time to abandon that rule. I would, therefore, seriously ask the Minister to review cases where rent allowances have been withheld from those men.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would like to refer is the fact that, as everybody knows, during the emergency, members of the Garda Síochána rendered very valuable work in the organisation of the L.D.F. and of the Defence Forces generally.  So far as I know, they have not got any recognition from the State for such work.  Members of the Defence Forces have received due recognition for their activities during that time but members of the Garda Síochána, who devoted a lot of labour and a lot of time to the very <Col N="1041" /> important work which they were assigned, have got no acknowledgment whatever for it.  I think that if they were given either a gratuity, a medal, a ribbon or something that would encourage them, should similar circumstances arise in the future, they would be more inclined to put their heart into the work.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that the experience of people in my county has not been that referred to by Deputy Davin with regard to the use of the telephone in a barracks.  I think everybody in my county will testify that the Guards are anxious to facilitate the people in case of sick calls or during any emergency, when the use of the ordinary telephone is not available.  There is no &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; at all in my area in regard to that matter and the people fully appreciate the kindness of the Gardaí in such circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my remarks on this Estimate will not be too rambling or disconnected.  I did not know that the Estimate was to come up for discussion to-day, and there are many matters which I should like to raise upon it but unfortunately I am not prepared to do so now.  The Minister will, therefore, forgive me if I make what can be regarded only as impromptu remarks on two matters of considerable importance to the country. The first has reference to the jurisdiction of the District Court at the present time.  Those who have even a small knowledge of the administration of law in this country know that the limits of jurisdiction in the District Court are very low being £10 in tort and £25 in contract.  The cost of living, to which reference is so often made in this Assembly, affects litigation as well as everything else because £25 represented far more 20 or 30 years ago when these regulations were first laid down than it represents at present. Furthermore, the cost of litigation in the Circuit Courts, appears to have increased a great deal in the course of that time.  Indeed I would go so far as to say that many people particularly in the West of Ireland and the poorer parts of the country are denied recourse to litigation because the Circuit Court is far too expensive <Col N="1042" /> a court for the purpose of threshing out their grievances.  Even in simple matters, costs on one side alone may run up to £80, £90 or £100 so that the unfortunate person who happens to lose the action will have to face two sets of costs probably running into the region of £140 or £150.  I think it will be agreed that the machinery in operation in the District Court is quite adequate to deal with many of the minor grievances that now find their way into the Circuit Court.  The District Court has no jurisdiction whatever in matters of title, and where a question of title arises in the District Court, the case has immediately to be struck out and adjourned for hearing at the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out, with all respect to the Deputy who, of course, is new to the House, that this is really a matter of advocating legislation? If other Deputies were to do likewise, we should be all out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is advocating increased jurisdiction for the Circuit Court which is out of order since it would require fresh legislation.  Questions of administration only may be discussed on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly advocating legislation in this matter. The other matter to which I was going to refer was the law of intestate succession but since I would also be advocating fresh legislation in any remarks I would have to make on that subject, I shall have to reserve my comments for a more appropriate occasion.  That leaves me without very much ammunition to go on with, because these were the two matters of vital importance which I desired to bring before the House.  One thing that struck me in the course of Deputy Byrne's references to traffic regulations was that there is one regulation which ought to be made immediately in this country, as it might have the result of making it easier for judges and justices to decide traffic cases.  We should bring our regulations into line with those in other countries by making it obligatory on motorists, or cyclists for that matter, coming along <Col N="1043" /> a by-road and approaching a major road, on seeing the sign &ldquo;Major Road Ahead&rdquo; not just to slow up but to come to a dead stop, preferably at a white line drawn across the entry to the major road.  One of the greatest difficulties that confront justices and judges at present is the answer to the question: &ldquo;Did you blow your horn?&rdquo; Very often, in my opinion, there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the fact that the motorist using the major road had to answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that question.</P>
      <P>I do feel that if a motorist is forced by law to blow his horn every time he is approaching a by-road when travelling along a major road&mdash;and he apparently ought to, according to the decisions of the courts in this country&mdash; then he would have to put his finger to the horn at the very commencement of his journey and he could not take it off until he had come to the end of his journey.  A great deal of what I think is unnecessary trouble arises from the fact that there is not a definite ruling that a person coming out of a minor road on to a major road is not at present bound to come to a stop before entering on the main road.  He is, of course, supposed to exercise care as well as the person using the major road, but I think that the degree of care which the law imposes on him should be greater than the degree of care which it casts on the person using the major road and that he should be obliged to come to a stop, as he is in other countries, before he is allowed to travel on the major road. A corollary to that would be that the person travelling on the major road would not have to continue blowing his horn incessantly, in order to protect himself against an adverse decision in court, should an accident occur, or to protect himself against an unfavourable answer to the question which I have already mentioned, which answer might involve him in an adverse decision both in the criminal proceedings in the District Court and, what is far more important, in a large civil claim in the High Court later on.</P>

      <P>I would like to support <Col N="1044" /> the previous speakers who have addressed themselves to the method of recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  I have here a letter that an applicant received from the Civil Service Commissioners:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With reference to your application for admission to the Garda Síochána, I am directed by the Commissioner to inform you that you have not been selected for the examination to be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am to add that the Commissioner cannot undertake to enter into any further correspondence on this subject.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now the applicant to whom that letter was sent fulfilled all the requirements and had excellent references from his parish priest and other responsible people.  I would like to know who decided he was not qualified to sit for the examination.  In the rural areas the blame in a case like this is laid on the shoulders of the local sergeant.  If the local sergeant has no say in the matter, I think that should be explained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local sergeant did not disqualify this man, I think that should be explicitly stated because he is at present getting blamed for it.  On the other hand, if he is responsible for this applicant being turned down I think it is wrong that he should be in a position to decide whether or not a man is qualified.  I think the applicant should be permitted to sit for the examination if he has reached the standard physical requirements and if he has references <Col N="1045" /> from responsible people, even if they are T.D.s.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter because it would seem to be a rather general complaint.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the location of Garda barracks in Cork City.  I had a question down in relation to this some months ago and I was told then that it would be inquired into.  Extensive housing development has taken place outside the City of Cork and it seems ridiculous to have Garda barracks situated within a couple of hundred yards of one another in the centre of the city at Union Quay, Old Blackrock Road, MacCurtain Street, Watercourse Road, Barrack Street, and so on, while built-up areas like Gurranebraher, Spanglehill and Turner's Cross have no Garda station in their vicinity at all.  I think housing development has proceeded far enough now in these new areas to enable the Minister to decide where new barracks should be situated.  These barracks are badly needed as is borne out by the cases appearing in the local courts.</P>
      <P>I support the claim made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government on a couple of occasions for the establishment of the High Court in Cork.  Litigants who are compelled to travel from all over Munster to Dublin to attend the High Court here undergo very heavy expense.  I can see no justification at all for that.  We hear a good deal about decentralisation and I think this suggestion would be a move in the right direction.  It could be done with very little expense and it might compel some of our senior counsel to leave Dublin on occasions. We have a good many of them here in the House and it might be no harm if they had the opportunity of seeing other parts of the country besides Dublin.</P>
      <P>With regard to the complaints made about the Gardaí not permitting people to use their telephone in case of emergency or sickness, we have had no such experience in Cork.  The Gardaí are most courteous there and are always ready to offer the facilities afforded by their phone to anyone who may require them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can feel quite happy with some of the speeches made here this evening but I do not think he can be completely happy in relation to all of them.  I think the situation is, comparatively speaking, satisfactory in relation to major crime but there has been one remarkable change over the last 50 years.  I am sure it is a change that disturbs the Minister and disturbs anyone who is concerned with development generally.  The very remarkable change to which I refer is the growth in what is termed juvenile delinquency or juvenile crime.</P>
      <P>Hitherto, in the history of crime we had a hard core of criminals, each group within that hard core committing a particular type of offence.  When an offence was committed, therefore, it was only a question of running a rule over the group of criminals known to commit that particular type of offence and then by a process of elimination finding out the particular individual or individuals guilty of the particular offence.</P>
      <P>We are now faced with a much more serious new development not in relation to a hard core of criminals and serious crime but in relation to juvenile crime.  This is a matter to which the House and those generally concerned must address their attention. I may be accused of moralising but I am quite indifferent to that accusation. There is a moral question involved and I am talking now only as a layman and from a layman's point of view.  I do not think it would be fair to leave the Minister in the position, or whoever will occupy his post in the future, of being saddled with responsibility for this serious condition of affairs five or six years hence without giving him now the benefit of one's help and one's opinions in relation to the treatment of this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious problem for the Minister and I can see that he will have difficulty in taking effective action.  I may be accused of being censorious.  Again, I am indifferent. I merely give the Minister my opinion in good faith in order to be of any assistance that I can be to him.  It is <Col N="1047" /> difficult to put one's finger right away on the cause of the rapid development of juvenile crime.  It is difficult to say that any one particular factor is the cause of it.  Indeed, I think there are a number of factors involved, but I think we can say there are two main causes and the first of those is lack of parental control.</P>
    <P>The lack of parental control is, in my opinion, the overriding and governing factor in this dénouement.  I am not here to lecture the parents of this country.  I reared a family myself, and I did it mainly within the law, whatever way I did it.  I wish to state categorically that, in my opinion, the main contributory cause to the alarming development of juvenile crime is the lack of parental control.  We have reached the stage now when, apparently, anybody's child, except one's own, can do wrong, but your own pet lambs never can do anything wrong.  They are always right, and, of course, nobody must make the allegation against them that they did wrong.  Nobody must correct them in any way for doing wrong.  We have reached the stage now when this thing has passed on to all our educational establishments in which the teachers must not enforce any sort of ordinary discipline.  That, roughly in outline, is the picture.  It is an alarming one. In very many schools now, a condition of chaos obtains due to the restrictions imposed on teachers by the parents of the children attending them.</P>
    <P>Anybody, with any sense of moral obligation, knows that even at school children must be disciplined.  The first place to discipline them is the home, and the second place is the school.  If it is not done in these two places, then it is going to be just a pity for the society in which that generation is brought up.  I suppose it is quite useless for us here to begin lecturing parents as to how they are to approach the discharge of their moral obligations to their children.  I certainly am courageous enough to state it here, and they can pass whatever judgment they like on what I say.  They do not exercise any control <Col N="1048" /> themselves, and they will not allow the teachers in the schools to exercise control.  Their children are allowed to run about at all hours of the day and night.  Within the last few months, within a gunshot of where I live, the local post office was burgled on two occasions.  That was done by juveniles. and the burglary occurred some time after midnight.  Have we not there a glaring example, and a typical case, of this fact that the parents of those children grossly neglected their duty both to themselves and to the State with regard to the upbringing of their children?  Apparently, parents now think that to enforce any sort of discipline on their own children is almost a crime.  I understand that, if a teacher at school attempts to enforce discipline on a child for being grossly unruly and indisciplined, the parent arrives at the school door and delivers a regular barrage, an attack, on the teacher.  I do not know, but I think I would like to have a law passed that where a teacher imposes moderate and reasonable discipline on a child in school that he should be protected from legal proceedings for so acting.</P>
    <P>Now, this is really a serious matter. The second contributory factor&mdash;it has been referred to already in a sort of a passing way&mdash;is the picture-house.  I think the pictures are a grave cause, and a contributory cause, of the prevalence of juvenile crime.  I regret that. I think that some steps on national lines will have to be taken about that here, assuming that nobody else does it.  We have our own way of life; we have to live our own lives, and we should have our own cultural standards. We should be quite indifferent as to what any outside country did, or was going to do, that is, provided we set high standards for ourselves.  There can be no doubt whatever, as regards many of the pictures which are shown &mdash;not all of them of course&mdash;in which guns and all that sort of highwayism are demonstrated, that they can have a highly disastrous effect on child psychology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And in which even robberies are shown to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where guns are involved and in which crime of all <Col N="1049" /> kinds is involved, at least impliedly. This is a matter to which, I think, Deputy Hickey quite rightly referred to-day.  In my opinion the Minister will have to take action.  The point is that in all these cases in which youth is concerned, and in which youthful minds are susceptible to example, the thing to do, according to the old saying, is&mdash;nip it in the bud.  I do not think that any picture should be allowed to be shown to children in which that kind of thing&mdash;guns, robberies or highwayism&mdash;is exhibited.  It should be absolutely and irrevocably censored.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, a regrettable thing to have to say that, but when one studies child psychology and discovers that youth is so susceptible to example of any kind, you must be always on your guard to guard them.  Of course, it will be said that language of this kind is reactionary.  It is not&mdash;very far from it.  Children gradually grow up, step by step, to have no regard for anything or anybody, to have no regard for individuals or for authority, and to have no regard for property, particularly the property of others.  That is really one of the regrettable things that flow from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now perhaps I have said enough about it.  There is the story of the fellow who took a girl out along the road for a walk.  In the course of the journey he asked her: &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;  She replied: &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;  He then closed up.  They walked on for half an hour without a word from him, when she asked him: &ldquo;Have you anything else to say?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;Perhaps I have said too much already.&rdquo;  It may be the same with me with regard to juvenile crime Other matters have been referred to. A lot has been said about the Guards. The Gardaí are asked to do this, that and the other thing.  I think men should be honest when they are so laudatory about this fine body of men. Have they considered at all the number of men in the average barracks throughout this country&mdash;a sergeant and two men or a sergeant and three men?  They are asked to do this, that and the other thing.  The most amusing suggestion of all was that they should be used to protect our inland fisheries. <Col N="1050" /> The Guards are supposed to look after crime proper and that is their primary duty.  They have to enforce the Noxious Weeds Act.  Why, I do not know, having regard to the number of agricultural inspectors in this country who could look after the country if they were used.  The Guards have to look after scrub bulls.  Why they should have to do this I do not know, but that work is pawned off on the Guards.  They have to look after the old age pensioners, and for what reason I do not know.  I understand that the old age pension books come to the local barracks and they have to be dealt with there.  The Guards have to deal with tillage and agricultural statistics but why they should do that I do not know when we consider the number of agricultural inspectors there are in the country and the amount of money that is provided in the agricultural Estimate.</P>
    <P>In a Garda station you have three men, one of whom is a barrack orderly. Another man is off for the day because he was barrack orderly the day before. There is, therefore, only one man left to look after crime, noxious weeds, scrub bulls, old age pensioners' books and all this paraphernalia.  Is it not realised by the people in this House passing fishery laws that heavy rates are struck for bailiffs to protect the fisheries?  There is an implication that the bailiffs are not discharging their duties.  People should not come into this House and pull the wool down over our eyes.  The Guards are paid money voted by this House for a particular purpose.  Money is voted to another Department to allow conservators of fisheries to strike rates to pay bailiffs for protecting the fisheries. We are asked to require three men in a district to do that.  I think we should at least display some intelligence in this matter.</P>
    <P>This matter of school attendance is also a baby that has been passed on to the Guards.  It is a very serious thing.  Here, again, is an adjunct of the matter I spoke about earlier&mdash;the neglect of parents in the discharge of their moral duties to educate their children.  There were 6,000 prosecutions last year.  That is only a fleabite, <Col N="1051" /> because prosecutions are only brought in in the extreme cases.  The teacher, of course, makes representations to the parents to send their children to school and the Guards do not want to take the most extreme action until the matter becomes chronic. These poor children have no hope or means of receiving education other than that they get until they are 14 years of age.  How to solve that problem is another matter.  It is all right to talk about it.  It is all right to ask the Minister what he is going to do.  Last year, there were 6,000 prosecutions under the School Attendance Act.  I do not know what the Minister can do about it.</P>
    <P>It is a question for parents.  If we had to enlarge the Garda force to cope with all the real delinquents under this Act it would be an enormous task.  I think it would be a good thing if heavier penalties were imposed on parents who deliberately neglect to send their children to school.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin is in a bad way about traffic in Dublin.  I never like to pass a baby on to another man that I cannot handle myself.  What can the Minister do about traffic and parking in the city?</P>

For the last 30 years motor development has taken place in this country and not one step has been taken in this city&mdash;I do not know about Cork&mdash;to make any provision for parking accommodation of cars.  The streets of Dublin are completely congested, not by the traffic going to and fro, but by parked cars. It is almost impossible for people who want to pass and who have a right to pass along the thoroughfares to do so. <Col N="1052" /> What can the Minister do about it?  He cannot make parking places for the cars.  That is a matter for the corporation and they have fallen down on their job.  I do not know whether Dublin Corporation will like that or not, but not one step has been taken to provide parking accommodation having regard to the enormous increase in the number of motors.</P>

      <P>There is another matter I want to refer to before I sit down.  I would rather not, but again one must not shirk one's duty.  The matter to which I wish to refer concerns the Guards and the administration of the licensing laws.  I received complaints&mdash;probably everybody in this House received them also&mdash;that the licensing laws are enforced against a number of licensed owners in a given town or towns and the law is not enforced against the owners of other licensed premises in the same town or towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the beavers, I think there are grounds for complaint.  I think it would be a very good thing for the public and a good thing for the licensed owners if they had the common sense to close and keep closed their licensed premises during prohibited hours.  Every other type of shop has to close and keep closed, and I think that as that is so the law should be enforced.  Either that or it should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read about a remarkable case within the last month or so that took place in the City of Dublin.  A boy of 16 years of age or under picked up a <Col N="1053" /> wallet from the driver of a milk van with whom he was engaged as a helper. The driver accidentally dropped it on the street and did not notice it falling. The lad picked it up.  It contained £14 or £16.  That night, some time after 12 midnight, he was found with others on licensed premises spending the money. In the first place, it was during prohibited hours.  Secondly, a boy of 16 years or under was on the premises, which was wretchedly bad in itself, and thirdly, he was spending money that he had stolen.  That is an example of what it is to carry on illicit trading.</P>
    <P>The Guards should be active in the enforcement of the licensing laws.  I shall not attempt to make any such charge that they would administer these laws partially against any particular person.  I would not say that at all.  The example I have given is a shocking case.  I wonder to what extent the Minister has information as to the tendency of the owners of licensed houses to permit such breaches of the law.  I know that no decent man would do it, but there are always black sheep.  I suppose even amongst saints there would be black sheep.  It is shocking to read a case of a boy of 16 or under being on licensed premises after midnight, spending money that he had stolen during the day from his co-employee.  That is what can flow from carrying on illicit trade, selling drink during prohibited hours, bringing disgrace on respectable fellowtraders.</P>
    <P>The House and the country can congratulate the Minister on the condition in the country with regard to general crime.  The only really serious problem is, not only the amount of juvenile crime, but the tendency towards more juvenile crime.  I shall not attempt to suggest whom we should line up to assist the Department of Justice to bring about a reform and improvement, but the first people to whom I would make an appeal are the parents.  I would appeal to them to see that they exercise parental control, to see that their children are not running about the country and the streets after 10 p.m. in winter or after 11 p.m. in summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in County Dublin as a result of the extension of the city.  In the Ballyfermot, Palmerstown, Finglas and Santry areas there are not enough Guards to deal with the problems that arise from time to time.  In Ballyfermot, which is a big area, there is no barracks.</P>
      <P>During the summer time the Gardaí in the barracks along the seaside in County Dublin are overworked.  I have referred to this matter on previous occasions.  Provision should be made to increase the number of Guards in barracks in seaside areas during the summer time and in the suburban areas where houses are being built week after week.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me in respect of schools situated on main roads adjacent to the city, for instance, the schools in Lucan and Palmerstown.  In Lucan the school is situated at a rather blind bend on the main road.  There is fast-moving traffic there all day.  I have made representations regarding the possibility of placing a Guard on duty there when the children are going to and from school.  The sergeant in the area is very anxious to do all this work but, unfortunately, there are not enough men at his disposal for the purpose.  An extra Guard might be responsible for the saving of life. The Garda strength in such places should be increased so that they may carry out this work.</P>
      <P>There are courthouses in this country that date back to the 17th century.  Some of the courthouses in County Dublin are not heated.  I would suggest that the Minister should take over the courthouses.  At present the county council are responsible for their maintenance.  The change I suggest is long overdue.  A number of district justices have referred to the matter on many occasions.  It is not fair that a district justice or a judge should have to sit for hours in a cold, dismal court trying to keep himself warm with a few rugs.  Courthouses should be improved.</P>
      <P>There is another point with which I have often dealt before.  It is a point with which the Minister has nopower to deal, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it indirectly or, if you like, directly concerns the Minister &mdash;housing for the Gardaí.  I know that a number of Guards find it very difficult to get suitable accommodation. The local authority passes them on to Justice and somebody there passes them on somewhere else, but I know that a number of Gardaí are living in very bad conditions.  A reform in this connection is long overdue and should be faced up to.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin mentioned parking arrangements.  I should like to see some central authority in charge of parking arrangements, not alone in Dublin City but in the seaside resorts along the County Dublin coast.  Somebody is always passing the baby in this matter.  We hear that arrangements are to be made to do this, that and the other, but nothing has been done for the past few years in the matter.  The Guards say they cannot carry on and the local authority says: &ldquo;We will have to do this before next season,&rdquo; but nothing is done.  That has been happening to my knowledge for the past 20 years.  In the summer on fine Sundays you find traffic held up at our seaside resorts by reason of this lack of parking arrangements and possibly because there are not enough Gardaí to do the job as well as they would like to do it, and I suggest that the Minister and local authorities concerned should come to some agreement on a method of co-ordinating the Garda view and the local authority view in this respect so that the chaos which we have experienced for years past will not occur in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Juvenile crime, as we know, is on the increase and we have heard many reasons advanced for that increase.  In other countries, they deal with it as best they can and here we try to deal with it as humanely as possible.  In this connection, I must pay a glowing tribute to the district justice in charge of the juvenile court who has proved himself a very able psychiatrist.  He has been greatly helped by the probation officers, but the few probation officers <Col N="1056" /> attached to the juvenile court are overworked and it will be necessary to increase the number of such officers, if that district justice is to be helped and assisted in his work.  I admire the great Christian work which Justice McCarthy is trying to do to save these juveniles who commit crime from going to jail, because I feel that when they go to jail, they are merely serving their time as future criminals.  The only way in which this great work can be continued successfully is by the appointment of further probation officers to assist this district justice in his efforts.</P>

It is very suitable and very becoming and I am sure the Guards will be pleased to have it, especially in the summer months.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, I have on a number of occasions expressed my dissatisfaction with late dancing and I am still of the opinion that the Minister should give some direction with a view to ensuring that some control will be exercised over the granting of licences for the holding of dances until the early hours of the morning.  It is the desire of every parent and, what is more, the desire in the past few years of 90 per cent. of young men and women who go to dances that the hours of dancing should be confined to normal limits&mdash; 8 p.m. until midnight, or 9 p.m. until midnight.  It is unreasonable and unchristian that people should come out from dance halls at six o'clock in the morning.  We are spending millions on building institutions to cater for the sick, and dancing until the early hours of the morning is one of the ways of ensuring that people will not be healthy&mdash;at a dance until 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and, after one hour or an hour and a half's sleep, out to work.  As a sensible body of men, we should come to the conclusion, and should long since have come to the conclusion, that something should be done in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my view on that point.  With regard to juvenile delinquency and summonses for nonattendance at school, we see from time to time in the Press arguments that children should get longer holidays, that it is unfair to ask them to attend school so often and that they should get off for this period and that period of the year.  The result is that many children get it into their heads that they should not go to school at all, and parents who do not exercise sufficient control find it difficult to get them to go.  If there is a large number of summonses&mdash;I believe they represent only about half of the number that should be summoned, as there is not a strict observance of the rule, that not every school is visited by the Gardaí and some schools máy be visited only once a year, and consequently many parents escape&mdash;the laxity is due to the lack of parental control and the lack of interest parents take in the education of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before compulsory education came into being at all, we went to the national school until we were 16 and sometimes 17.  Now, when a boy reaches 12 or 13, he is anxious to remain at home immediately and thinks he should not go during the last year.  In fact, the last year is not the same to him at all, and he would remind you of a young man in jail. <Col N="1058" /> For the last year he is like that, and the last month seems as long as 12 months.  He is only waiting for the day when he can get out.  Boys know now they can stay at home as soon as they reach 14, so the last year is really wasted.  That results from the compulsory attendance regulations, which have not achieved the solution we expected.  They were meant only to put to school the children whose parents would not take an interest in them and make them attend, those who were neglected by their parents, who left it to the Gardaí, the teachers and the State.  Now there is complaint from them that, when they reach 13, they are finished school.  As a result, the boys and girls leaving school to-day can be described as illiterate.  They cannot read or write, they know nothing, they cannot sign their names. It is a shocking state of affairs, hardly believable, yet it is a well-known fact. In comparison, the boys who leave school now at the seventh standard are definitely not as good as those who left school at the seventh standard 15 or 20 years ago; in fact, those leaving at the seventh standard now are not as good as those who reached the third standard in the years gone by.</P>

      <P>The cause of the large number of summonses for failure to send children to school is the lack of interest taken by the parents in their children.  If anything is to be done to correct that, it must be done by trying to fix the attention of the parents on their duty to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when petrol was scarce during the war, I was travelling in County Kerry late at night and came up against a difficulty which it occurred to me I should bear in mind when the Estimate for the Department of Justice would be under discussion, or which I should deal with in the form of a question.  I spent about an hour in that strange town in County Kerry at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, trying to discover the Garda barracks.  I motored round the town in the spilling rain and discovered the barracks only by accident. Every Garda barracks should <Col N="1059" /> have, at least after midnight, a light or some other indication that it is a barracks.  If you go into any town outside the City of Dublin at night, how are you to discover the barracks?  Are you to go round with a torch looking at every house?  In any other civilised country in the world, there is a light or some other indication that these gentlemen reside there.  Immediate steps should be taken to deal with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>There are times when we have to call upon them and when we recognise and appreciate their importance.  In regard to juvenile delinquency, I daresay that there is more of it in the City of Dublin than in any other city or town in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There is an amazing lack of parental control.  It is quite natural to see little boys and girls of five to nine years of age on the streets at midnight and up to 1 o'clock in the morning with no one to care for them and no one interested in them.  Some law should be introduced by the local authority to prevent that. Parents should be held responsible for having those children indoors after 8 o'clock and they should be punished severely if they do not appreciate their responsibilities.  I do not know what kind of citizens we will have in 20 or 30 years.  You see thousands of children roaming the streets now uncontrolled, like little animals.  Every Deputy knows that is so in Dublin.  It may not be popular for city Deputies to say that, but they should say it. Those children roam around from public-house to public-house and from café to café selling papers, and that money is not put to the best of use either.  That is the regrettable part of it.  Something should be done about that.  It might help to reduce the juvenile crime at a later stage; as it is, in those early years they learn many bad habits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the behaviour of the Guards in general, as a body of men <Col N="1060" /> no one can find fault with it.  On the whole they are helpful, courteous, and a credit to the nation.</P>
    <P>The car parking and traffic problem in Dublin is even worse than in London&mdash;and that is saying a lot.  I know of no street in the City of London, with the exception of one, to equal what you experience in the O'Connell Street and Butt Bridge area.  The Minister for Justice cannot be held responsible for the traffic jams unless the local authorities provide accommodation and also some other means of crossing streets than there is at present.  They must revolutionise their ideas and move with the times to prevent these traffic jams in the city.</P>
    <P>I was one of the first who some years ago in the House suggested new uniforms for the Guards.  I am pleased to see that some of them are wearing them, and I hope that it will not be long until they all have that uniform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gardaí are primarily police officers, and in consequence their co-operation with citizens, their general demeanour and vigilance help to prevent crime, as does of course their ready detection of any evasion of the law.  Judging the Garda force on these lines, I think that we can compliment them on their efficiency.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the control of traffic, particularly in the towns and cities, and from my experiences I can say, in spite of Deputy Davin's complaint, that generally speaking when the streets are wet and slippery, the Guards give precedence to horse-drawn traffic, which is only right, because when they are heavily laden it is rather difficult for the horses to keep their feet under certain conditions, and the streets are so smooth nowadays that they should have that advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the parking problem in the cities there has been, in the south at any rate, co-operation between the public authorities and the Garda superintendents.  Conferences have been held on the questions of the control of traffic through one-way streets, the streets on which parking may be permitted, and for how long. This method has worked out very <Col N="1061" /> satisfactorily, though parking is still a problem and will be a problem while so many motors are on the road&mdash;and the numbers are increasing.  It is just a matter of doing the best thing possible as the occasion arises.  A car park has been provided in Cork by private enterprise, but motorists, I think, are rather slow to avail of it, which is a pity indeed while traffic is as it is at present.  However, recent regulations have helped considerably, and there are very few complaints at the moment.  I think that the same could be said for Dublin: recent regulations have been fairly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies I am sure are aware that when Gardaí are transferred they are often moved miles from the residence of their families and for years are unable to get accommodation near the barracks where their duty calls them.  That is very undesirable from every point of view and I agree with the suggestion that there should be at least one house near each Garda barracks even in rural areas&mdash;because the difficulty is even greater there in many cases&mdash;for the accommodation of married Gardaí who are transferred to these stations.  From the social point of view and considering all we have heard about family life, the present condition should not exist.  We have been told that Gardaí are sometimes penalised because they marry too soon. I think, however, that when the probation period of their service is over they should be as free in that respect as any other citizen.</P>
    <P>Juvenile delinquency has been mentioned and of course there is no doubt that parental control is a very important factor in its prevention.  Life at the present moment is very competitive and in the schools children have long hours of study.  They get a considerable number of lessons to do at home at night which sometimes take many hours.  They are then sent out to take a breath of fresh air after their long hours of confinement and there is a tendency for them to stay out too long. The break should come earlier, after their return from school, and they should do their lessons later in their homes.</P>
    <P>The control of children leaving <Col N="1062" /> schools is difficult.  I do not think that any accidents have occurred in the vicinity of schools because teachers are very vigilant particularly about the younger children.  The accidents have occurred some distance from the schools.  It is not easy for the Gardaí or anybody else, even the parents themselves, at all times to control children in streets where the traffic moves speedily.  Some time ago&mdash;I do not know whether the system still prevails&mdash;one Garda from each barracks dealt with school attendance in his area and he also came to the schools once a month and gave a talk on the avoidance of accidents in busy traffic. Of course a good deal of notice was taken of a comparative stranger like that and I think that it was a very good idea and very helpful to the teachers.</P>
    <P>The influence of the cinemas is a question which has been debated very frequently.  Undoubtedly some of the films we get are not very uplifting, at any rate for our children.  Parents may want to go themselves and as sometimes there is nobody to mind the children it is question of staying at home or bringing the children occasionally to the pictures.  In that way they see pictures in their earlier years and get a desire for them subsequently. When they become a little more mature they form the habit of going to the pictures more frequently than they should.  Until we develop films of our own of a cultural nature which would be of advantage to youthful minds giving them perhaps as well a better knowledge of the history of our own land by showing ancient sites and castles connected with historic events, we will not grip that problem as we should.</P>
    <P>While public houses are open for <i>bona fide</i> travellers there is a temptation for others to go there at the hours prohibited for them.  These <i>bona fide</i> regulations were made at a time when travel was far slower and more difficult than it is now.  The sooner these regulations are done away with completely the better, and the easier it will be for the Gardaí to help in the administration of the licensing laws and to prevent illegal trading.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Generally speaking, we can compliment the Garda force.  They are recruited from rural and urban areas. They have a knowledge of life in this country and certainly they have a sense of proportion.  Because of their efficiency, their method of approaching the rural population and of dealing with those who may inadvertently put themselves in the way of the law, I think that we can be very pleased with the way they carry out their duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two questions of general policy to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister.  First of all, it is essential that the strength of the force should be increased.  That is particularly necessary in the larger cities and towns.  There is, however, another question which arises, the allocation of Gardaí to rural areas, to the scarcely populated country districts.  I have often felt that it is not absolutely necessary to keep three or four Gardaí in every isolated village and to have a member of the force on duty for the whole 24 hours.  In a quiet, country village, a system could be devised by which Gardaí would go off duty just the same as anybody else.  Of course in case of emergency they would be always available, but it is not necessary to have a station orderly on for the 24 hours of the day.  That is one of the most laborious and expensive features of Garda administration.  If a man has to be on duty for the 24 hours of the day, you cannot do that with less than three or four members in a station.  If you dispense with that 24 hours of duty, you can reduce the strength of the force in areas that are thinly populated and where crime is very infrequent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question of general policy, and that is in regard to members of the Garda carrying out duties other than what might be strictly described as police duties.  For example, Gardaí are required to collect statistics and perform various services of that kind in connection with agriculture and industry and commerce, and in other ways also.  I have often heard it suggested that <Col N="1064" /> Gardaí should be dispensed from the duty of regulating traffic and that that should be allocated to a special traffic control force.  It was also suggested to-day that there should be a special force for looking after children going to and coming from school, a sort of wardens to protect the children.  On that whole general question I think that it is not in itself an evil that police should be called upon to do duty other than what would be strictly described as the prevention and detection of crime.  The Garda who travels around the rural areas collecting statistics and perhaps distributing old age pensions books, and doing what might be described as messenger jobs of that kind is doing a useful service. He is keeping in close personal contact with the people of his district and in that way he is making himself more efficient as a police officer.  The same applies to looking after traffic on the roads and performing various functions which the Gardaí are called upon to perform.</P>
    <P>The prevention and detection of crime is the main function of any police force; but it is a duty upon which the members of the force cannot be actively engaged all the time, unless we have a position in which crime is being committed all the time.  Therefore, it is not any harm if members of the force are engaged in other work of an absolutely essential and useful nature, because, as I say, the performance of such duties brings them into contact with the people in a friendly and helpful way.  The Garda who is protecting children going to and from school is rendering a friendly and useful service.  He is showing himself to be a friend of the people, and it is essential for the successful administration of the law that the Garda, as a force, should always be on the friendliest terms with the community.</P>
    <P>In helping to discharge various functions other than detecting crime and prosecuting for offences, they are keeping themselves on terms of friendship with the people and they are living active and useful lives at times when they are not called upon to deal with offenders or criminals.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling also that the Garda, <Col N="1065" /> as a force, should be requested by the Minister to seek out and to survey and bring to the notice of the local authorities danger spots on the roads.  There is a considerable difference of opinion as to what particular sections of roads are gravely dangerous.  Nobody is better qualified to point out the greatest source of danger to traffic than the members of the Garda.  For example, we have all over the country and in this city unprotected quays, piers and waterways, places where there is no protection between the roadway and a river or harbour.  That is true of the city and of many parts of the country.  Nothing has been done about that.  Members of the Garda who have a knowledge of the risk and dangers in connection with such places should be the best qualified to point out and place in order of priority the most dangerous points, the points which require to be protected most urgently.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the country roads.  There are some points on these roads which are particularly dangerous to traffic.  County engineers and other engineers of local authorities try to deal with these dangers by removing dangerous turns, but I feel that it would be helpful to them if the Gardaí were to find out where the greatest dangers arise, what particular points are the most serious menace to traffic, and put them in order of priority so that they could be attended to as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>We all know that the local authorities have a very heavy burden to bear in regard to expenditure on the roads, and that they cannot remove every turn or corner that might be regarded as dangerous.  At least, it would be helpful to them if the Gardaí indicated the particular points which could be regarded as extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>The following is a particular matter in regard to which the Minister should feel a certain amount of sympathy.  I am referring to the members of the Gardaí who retired before the recent pensions increase was granted.  Some of these people still feel very much aggrieved because their pensions, having regard to present-day costs, are inadequate. The particular and most serious grievance arises because of the <Col N="1066" /> conditions operating for widows.  I feel something should be done for these people.  A case came to my notice during the past few weeks of a member of the force who died suddenly, leaving a family of ten children in the position that they were compelled to depend upon the miserable little pension given to the widow of a Garda.  Such a condition of affairs is a great worry to members of the force, particularly to members with families. If anything could be done to improve the present position, it would be much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Another matter which requires urgent attention is the fact that in some districts the buildings where the Gardaí are stationed are in a very decrepit condition.  I have raised in this House before the condition of the Garda station at Baltinglass, which is a building which would prove very difficult to repair and to keep in repair. Steps are being taken to provide a new station but, so far, little progress has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey started off by asking if we had got the recruits yet.  The position is that they have not yet been called for examination. The Civil Service Commissioners could not see their way to provide for the examination until towards the end of June.  It will not be a competitive examination but a qualifying one.  The first contingent of recruits will not be available until about September, and it may be the end of the financial year before we will have the second lot available. There is only accommodation for 150 at the training school; and, therefore; only 150 have been called.  There have been about 1,000 applications for membership of the Gárda force.  I will have to ask the Commissioner how he will arrange matters, but I think he will have to arrange for a certain quota for each area.  However, I am not sure of that.  He is calling about 450 for examination, and he hopes to get among that number sufficient to meet his requirements&mdash;300.  Perhaps he could call all the applicants, namely 1,000, for examination but only 300 would be called to the force.  I do not really know whether that method <Col N="1067" /> would be better.  I do not know how the Commissioner is going to select the Gardaí.  There has been objection raised to this matter on both sides of the House.  Therefore, it does not seem to be on political grounds that he makes his selection.</P>
      <P>I do not want to rub it in, but the fact is that in spite of the big growth in population in this city in recent years, there are 200 Gardaí less in Dublin City now and 750 less in the whole country than was the case when we left office.  I feel that Fianna Fáil would have continued recruiting. Shortly before I left office in 1948 I met a deputation from the Dublin Corporation.  They pointed out to me that all sorts of unruly happenings, such as burglaries and so forth, were taking place in the City of Dublin. Therefore, there were not even sufficient Gardaí in the metropolis then. We are trying to remedy that situation but, unfortunately, it cannot be done as quickly as we wish.  The position is that the first 300 recruits will be allocated to Dublin; they are needed there.  Of course, as I mentioned before, we can only take 150 recruits at the time, owing to lack of accommodation. If there were sufficient accommodation, of course, we would take the whole 300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of school attendance was raised by a number of Deputies. Deputy McMenamin spoke my mind on this matter.  He placed the chief blame for the non-attendance of children at school and for juvenile delinquency on the parents.  I do not know whether or not Deputy McMenamin is correct when he says that the teachers cannot enforce discipline in the schools. Children ought to be corrected, in the first instance, by their parents and after that in the schools, but it is the parents who have the main responsibility in this matter.  When a child has been prosecuted by the Gardaí, he has gone rather far and it is very difficult to say what can be done with him.  My recollection is that when we went into this matter of juvenile delinquency in previous years, and investigated the circumstances of the young delinquents we found it was not the very poor children who were the worst.  If I <Col N="1068" /> remember rightly, the worst offenders, proportionately, were the well-housed children.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the new Garda uniform.  The uniform is really an experiment for the present.  We want to see how people like it and to find out if it will prove satisfactory. If it does, we will probably clothe the whole force in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that. I am sure every Deputy knows that the people mainly responsible for the traffic regulations are the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities, and that the Gardaí are the group who enforce these regulations. The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána makes the traffic regulations in consultation with local authorities and subject to the agreement of the Minister for Local Government. I am not trying to evade responsibility when I say that the Traffic Act is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  All Deputies are aware of that fact.  We all realise that a lot has to be done in this connection. Somebody suggested we should abolish the hire-purchase system and that it would result in fewer cars being on the roads.  I do not know if the abolition of the system would have that result.  However, we all realise that something will have to be done about the traffic problem, but it is not my particular job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different views expressed on the subject of driving tests.  I think it is a fact that a lot of the people who become involved in accidents are very good drivers who would pass any test. The learner and the bad driver are very cautious.  However, those people <Col N="1069" /> who are driving for years take chances. They think they can drive better than anybody else and they are the type of people who become involved in accidents. We have heard the point debated time and again but I feel sure that driving tests would not improve the position.  The person who understands the rules of the road should be able to drive properly.  If drivers did not take so many chances there would be a decrease in the number of accidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe some of them will.  I will pass on the suggestion that the cars should not be easily known.  I suppose some of the occupants should be in mufti so that offenders will not spot them.  It was also suggested that the Gardaí were doing work which was more appropriate to other Departments.  This has been debated time and again.  However, I still hold the opinion that a lot of the work of a non-police nature that is being done by the Gardaí is done better and cheaper than it would be done by employing other officials.</P>
      <P>In many of the rural areas, there is very little ordinary crime and, if this non-police work was not done by the Gardaí, there would be no reason for having Garda stations at all in some of those districts.  I was speaking to a superintendent whom I know and he told me that in connection with old age pensions, when the Gardaí get the books they go around to the people with them.  They are of great assistance in the country places because they know the people and look after them. This man pointed out what I knew myself, that if all the non-police duties were to be taken away from the Gardaí, a lot of the Garda stations could be removed and people would not have anyone to call in an emergency. We all know how useful the Guards were all over the country when the late war was on.  Overnight we were able to establish in every area a local defence force mainly because in every part of the country we had Gardaí, a ready-made organisation, and until times change a lot I do not think it would be desirable to close those barracks.</P>
      <P>The question of the report was also raised.  The committee did report.  A lot of the things that have been recommended in that report are under consideration by every Department at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  We have to await the reactions of the Departments before any decision is taken. Where Departments get their work done by the Gardaí and some of the <Col N="1071" /> suggestions are that it should not be done by the Gardaí, the question of costs and other matters must be taken into consideration.  Deputy Morrissey was here when Deputy McMenamin was speaking and will have heard what he had to say about the inland fishery.  He objects altogether to any attempt to force that duty on the Gardaí.  He says the conservators should do that job and that the Gardaí have enough to do.  I do not imagine that is their job, but the Guards can help.  The bailiffs are appointed for this work.</P>

About the Solicitors Bill which has been under consideration for the last ten years, it is now drafted and I hope finally to have it ready for submission to the Government.

      <P>Now let me come to the problem of the cinema.  Some say that it has no evil effect while others hold the opposite opinion.  As regards the Censor, he can only deal with matters that are supposed to be obscene or questions of that kind from the moral point of view.  I do not think the Censor can deal with the point that was mentioned here, the gunman.  It is very difficult to keep children from seeing films of that kind.  The parents ought not to allow them to go to those pictures.  We cannot expect the State to take over the parents' duties.  It was suggested that the Censor should reserve certain types of films for adults.  If that were done, it might stimulate an unwholesome interest in that particular type of film.  When you consider that aspect of the matter you will see that it is not as simple as it looks.</P>
      <P>On the question of pensions for the widows of Gardaí, the last pensions Order was dealt with by the Minister for Justice in 1950.  The Representative Body would like to get more if they could.  I am not saying that if they make another demand, they will get a further increase.  I am not going to encourage them but, as I say, they have not brought the matter up.  I do not know whether they thought it was hopeless, but the fact remains that they have not done it.</P>
      <P>About the building of houses for Gardaí, I would like to see that done. I know that years ago nearly every Deputy in this House who spoke on the Department of Justice Estimate advocated getting houses for the Guards and financing it out of the housing allowances they got.  We went so far as to take power, if necessary, to acquire sites compulsorily.  It was very urgent to acquire barracks in certain areas, and also sites for houses. It has taken all their time to try and acquire new barracks, because a lot of the old barracks were in very bad condition. So far nothing has been done about houses.</P>

I am in favour of it, and I think it will come as soon as we can get matters straightened out.</P>
    <P>I think that, under the Juries Act. the area of the jury in Cork is rather small and that it will be necessary to extend the area.  However, that is another day's work.  I understand that the matter of children's allowances applies to the whole service.</P>

I think that if we could get more Guards and allocate them to the different areas when the children are coming home from school we should be able to fix the matter.  I imagine that in Dublin a child has to take a double risk.  Under an arrangement which was reached during the war, school children in Dublin have to go home at lunch-time.  That means that they run the risk twice instead of once.  However, that is not a matter for me.  I just mention that it throws twice the risk on a child's being hurt.</P>

Ina theannta sin, is féídir an teastas dá-theangach a ghnóthú ag scrúduithe cínn-chúrsa na gColáistí Oiliúna.  An bónas a tugtar do thuistí agus do chaomhnóirí ís do réir deontais cúig phunt an dalta oibrítear é.  Tá méadú beag ar an mbónas i mbliana. Sa scoil-bhliain 1950/51 tugadh an bónas i leith 700 páisde agus daltaí bunscoile a bhfurmhór mór.  Is le comh-oibriú Coistí na bPáistí a riartar an chion-íocaíocht le haghaidh scoláireachtaí samhraidh.  Sa bhliaín 1951/52, bhí trí coistí páirteach sa scéim agus cuireadh 340 páiste chun na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, i leith an Vóta so, tagairt don mhéid atá dá dhéanamh ar son an chinéil páistí a dtugtar de ghnáth páistí éislinneacha orthu.  Is maith liom é bheith ar mo chumas a rá i dtaobh na scoileanna i gcóir na ndall, gur fusa anois níos mó den teagasc aonair, rud atá fíor-riachtanach, a thabhairt dóibh de bharr líon na n-oidí a mhéadú.  Tá dóchas agam leis go mbeidh ar mo chumas an cineál céanna feabhais maidir le foirinn agus fearas a chur ar scoileanna na mbodhar is balbh.  I dtaobh páistí a bhfuil éislinn aigne orthu, deirim anseo go poiblí gur mór é mo mheas ar an obair atá dá dhéanamh ag Bráithre, Mná Rialta agus tuath-oidí do na páistí seo i scoileanna na nOrd Rialta.  Tá an scéal céanna le rá agam i dtaobh na scoileanna eile.  Tá Bille faoi chomhairle an Aire Sláinte faoi láthair le haghaidh lucht éislinne, idir óg agus aosta, agus nuair a bheidh an Bille sin achtaithe ag an Oireachtas beidh ar mo chumas a chinneadh cad a bheidh riachtanach chun oideachas oiriúnach a thabhairt do na páistí éislinneacha seo.  Má soláthraítear scoileanna oiriúnacha agus foirne dea-oilte is féidir páistí lag-intleachta d'oiriúint, is é sin, an méid díobh is inoilte, chun go mbeidh ar a gcumas iad féin a chothú, a bheag nó a mhór, agus dá <Col N="1084" /> bharr sin saol níos iomláine agus níos sona a chaitheamh.</P>
    <P>Cé ná fuil mírcheann ar bith sa Vóta seo do thógáil na mBunscol is ar Roinn an Oideachais atá sé mar chúram na deontaisí atá le fáil chuige sin a dháileadh.  I rith na bliana seo ghabh tharainn do roinneadh deontaisí de naoi gcéad míle punt.  Níor deonadh riamh suim níos mó ná sin i mbliain amháin.  Dá ainneoin sin féin nílim sásta leis an dul ar aghaidh atáimid a dhéanamh ar an mbóthar chun deireadh a chur leis na sean-tithe mí-fholláine, agus tithe oiriúnacha a chur ina n-ionad, tithe ina mbeidh gach áis agus fearas atá riachtanach. Táim chun mo dhícheall a dhéanamh chun an obair seo a bhrostú.  Ní mór ina theannta sin féachaint chuige go gcoimeádfar na tithe scoile mar ba chóir, teas oiriúnach a bheith iontu sa droch-shíon, agus iad a choimeád glan folláin.  Is é mo thuairim go bhfuil an córas seo againne&mdash;agus níl a leithéid eile ar domhan&mdash;anoiriúnach don tír seo, agus ag cuimhneamh ar an gcóras sin dom creidim gur cheart go mbeadh an mhuintir áitiúil, agus iad faoi stiúradh na mBainisteoirí, freagarthach i gcónaí, ar shlí chinnte dearfa, sna scoileanna, an méid a bhaineann lena dtógáil, a gcoimeád, a ndeisiú, a dtéamh agus a nglanadh.  Ní leor an freagra atá dá fháil ón bpobal sna blianta deireannacha seo agus is iomó cúis atá leis sinCé go raibh an chion-íocaíocht áitiúil le haghaidh tógáil na scol sa bhliain atá díreach caite seacht 17.3 faoin gcéad den iomlán i gcomparáid le 13 faoin gcéad sa bhliain roímis sin, ní mór a thuiscint dá mbeadh na coiníollacha ar fheabhas gur chóir go bhfaghfaí trian den iomlán mar chion-íocaíocht.</P>
    <P>Samhlófaí, dá bhrí sin, gur mhithid réiteach nua a dhéanamh a laghdódh a bheag nó a mhór na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis an socrú atá ann faoí láthair.  Is mór le rá agus is deacair ar fad mar fhadhb le réiteach conas is féidir scoileanna a sholáthar sna cathracha agus go mór-mhór i gCathair Bhaile Atha Cliath.  An t-aistriú teaghlach go dtí ceanntracha nua cónaithe, cuireann sé go mór leis na deacrachtaí.  Tá coiste comhorduithe ar bun sa chathair seo le tamall ar <Col N="1085" /> a bhfuil teachtaí ón Eaglais, ó na Ranna Stáit agus ó Bhárdas Bhaile Atha Cliath, agus tá mo Roinnse, le cúnamh an Choiste sin, ag féachaint chuige ná beidh feasta oiread moille agus a bhíodh idír aistriú na dteaghlach agus tógáil na scol sa limistéar nua. Tá dóchas againn ná beidh ar ball moill ar bith eatarthu.</P>
    <P>Bhí ceisteanna tuarastail agus sochair oifige le haghaidh oidí na mBunscol dá bhféachaint agus dá bplé í rith na bliana faoín scéim idir-réitigh agus eadrána a cuireadh ar bun chun molta a thabhairt i dtaobh na gceisteanna sin.  Is mór an sásamh aigne dhom é gur thárla socruithe tábhachtacha idir teachtaí ó Chumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta ar thaobh amháin agus teachtaí ó na Ranna Stáit ar an dtaobh eile.  Tá glactha ag an Rialtas leis na socruithe sin agus tá na dualgaisi a thagann mar thoradh astu dá gcomhlíonadh. Ba léir an dea-mhéin agus an muintearas idir an dá thaobh le linn na ndiospóireachtaí agus na gcúrsaí gnótha uile, agus is maith an comhartha é ar an gcaidreamh a bheidh feasta idir an Roinn seo agus na hoidí gurbh fhéidir na socruithe sin do thabhairt chun críche gan dul thar an idirréiteach.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VÓTA 41&mdash;MEÁN-OIDEACHAS.</P>
    <P>Is é méid airgid atá ag teastáil ná £1,268,970 nó £56,850 níos mó ná an méid do hiarradh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain airgeadais seo chuaigh thart bhí 10 meán-scoileanna aithinte sa bhreis ann, 434 in ionad 424, agus 1,500 scoláire sa bhreis, 50,179 in ionad 48,559.  Tá an méadú leantach sin ar líon na scoláirí ar cheann de na tréithe is mó tábhacht ar fhorbairt an mheán-oideachais sa tír seo.  Ní leor bliain amháin do chur is gcóimheas leis an mbliain roimpi chun an méadú mór sin d'fheiscint, ach má cuirtear 30,966 sa bhliain 1930 i gcoimheas le 50,179 sa bhliain 1952, chífear láithreach chomh mór is tá an méadú.</P>
    <P>Tá mórán dá dhéanamh ag lucht ceannais na meán-scol le páirt-scoláireachtaí agus le hísliú táillí chun freastal ar an síor-mhéadú seo ar éileamh meán-oideachais.  Déanann an Stát agus na Comhairlí Contae agus na Comhairlí Cathrach a gcion féin.  Tairgeann an Stát 72 scoláireacht gach <Col N="1086" /> bliain do bhuachaillí, agus 40 scoláireacht do chailíní agus bronntar na scoláireachtaí sin de thoradh scrúdúcháin na meán-teistiméireachta.  Seasníonn na scoláireachtaí seo ar feadh téarma dhá bhliain í meán-scoileanna aitheanta. Ina theannta sin, tugann an Stát 18 scoláireachtaí gach bliain de thoradh scrúdúcháin iontrála na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin.  Gheibheann lucht buaite na scoláireachtaí seo oideachas saor ó chostas i meán-scoileanna maille le deontas le haghaidh fearaistí agus taistil.  Ritheann téarma na scoláireachtaí seo cúig bhliana i scoileanna aitheanta de Cineál A.  Tairgeann gach Comhairle Contae agus gach Comhairle Cathrach nach mór scoláireachtaí do mhicléinn ar mian leo cúrsaí léinn a leanúint i meán-scoileanna nó i gceardscoileanna. Sa bhliain 1951 tugadh 515 de na scoláireachtaí sin agus meán-scoileanna a thogh a bhfurmhór mór sin.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1950/51, bhí scoláireachtaí ó Chomhairlí Contae agus ó Chomhairlí Cathrach ag 1,813 dhuine de scoláirí meán-scoileanna.  De bhreis air sin tairgtear gach bliain naoi gcinn déag de scoláireachtaí meán-scol faoi iomaíocht teoranta do réir rialacha bronntanais Erasmus Smith.</P>
    <P>Sa scoil-bhliain 1950/51 glacadh el céad is a ceathair de scoileanna mar scoileanna de Chineal A, is é sin le rá gur i nGaeílge a tugadh teagasc na n-ábhar go léir ach amháin teagasc an Bhéarla agus na dTeangan Eorpach.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin bhí 110 de scoileanna ina ndéantar cuid den teagasc i nGaeilge.  Fágann sin 214 scoileanna as iomlán de 224 de scoileanna ina bhfuil Gaeilge ar barr nó ar an slí chun bheith mar sin.  Bíonn toradh fónta fós le scéim na ndeontas speisialta a tugtar de bharr feabhais faoi leith i labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is chuige a cuireadh an scéim ar bun chun cabhrú le húsáid na Gaeilge mar ghná-theangain chaidrimh ag na daltaí lasmuich de sheomra na scoile agus chun cabhrú leo sa tslí sin chun an cruinneas agus an líofacht a ghnóthú a chuirfeadh ar a gcumas an Ghaeilge d'úsáid mar ghná-theangain labhartha tar éis éirí as an scoil dóibh.  Seo mar oibrítear an scéim: tugtar deontaisí speisialta do scoileanna ina bhfuil <Col N="1087" /> caighdeán ard sroichte ag na daltaí i gcoitinne i labhaírt na Gaeilge.  Tá cead ag gach scoil bheith páirteach sa scéim agus socraítear roinnt na ndeontas ar na limistéir cigireachta ar slí ná bíonn comórtas idir scoileanna a mbíonn difríocht so-fheicse eatarthu, maidir le caighdeán.  Is amhlaidh a déantar suas liosta an aird feabhais go dtugtar na deontaísí dá réir: tógtar i ngach scoil atá páirteach sa scéim uimhir áirithe de dhaltaí a bheadh samphlach den scoil uile agus cuirtear faoi bhéil-triaileacha iad agus sna béil-triaileacha sin cuirtear suim faoi leith san méid a usáidtear an Ghaeilg lasmuich den seomra scoile.  Nuair a cuirtear san áireamh a dheacara a bheadh sé scrúdú labhartha d'fheidhmiú do dhaltaí na meán-scol i gcoitinne meastar go dtugann an scéim seo toradh an-mhaith.</P>
    <P>Is minic a castar leis an gcóras Meán-Oideachais seo againn-ne ná deantar cúram oiriúnach d'ábhair léinn atá fíor-chultúrach ar nós Ealaíon agus Ceol.  Is fíor nach ábhair riachtanacha sa Chlár na hábhaír sin ach tugtar caoi oiriúnach do na scoileanna chun iad a chleachtadh agus leagtar amach cláir oiriúnacha sa dhá ábhar.  An méid a saothraítear an Ceol pé scéal é sna scoileanna ní ceart é áireamh do réir an líon a thoghann an ceol mar ábhar ins na scrúduithe scríofa.  Ina éagmais sin ar fad tairgeann an Roinn bónas le haghaídh cór agus ceolfhoireann agus déantar an bronnadh de thoradh scrúdúcháin a dhéanann painéal de cheoltóiri oilte ar son na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Is é meán-uimhir na gCór a bhíonn páirteach gach bhliain le hocht mbliana anuas ná 195 de chóir agus 53 de cheolfhoirne.  Sa scoil-bhliaín 1951/52, do chuir 230 de chóir agus 53 decheolfhoirne isteach ar na scrúduithe.</P>
    <P>Do bhí an scéim idirréitigh agus eadrána i leith na meán-mhúinteoirí i bhfeidhm san bhliain atá caite agus an socrú a tháinig as an idirréiteach mí na Samhna seo a ghabh tharainn is mór mar a chuaigh sé chun tairbhe do na múinteoirí.  Dála scéil na n-oidí bun-oideachais, ba mhór an sásamh aigne dhom an dea-mhéin agus an muintearas a taispeánadh ag díospóireachtaí na Comhairle Idirréitigh. <Col N="1088" /> Is beag an t-atharú a théann ar an obair ná ar an ngníomhacht coitianta a cleachtar sna meán-scoileanna maidir lena gcineál agus ní bítear ag braith ar athruithe réabhlóideacha ó bhliain go bliain.  Níl gach aon duine sásta gur folláin ar fad an rud é an síorshodar seo i ndiaidh an mheánoideachais ná gurb é an cineál sin oideachais is fearr d'oirfeadh d'eacnamaíocht an náisiúin ach maidir le lucht ceannais agus teagaisc na meán-scol, níl amhras ar bith ná go bhfuilid ábalta agus éifeachtach.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VÓTA 42&mdash;CEARD-OIDEACHAIS.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú de £69,950 ar an Vóta i gcóir Gairm-Oideachais.  Ní hionadh méadú áirithe bliantúil í geás seirbhíse atá ag fás ar nós an Ghairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá 200 scoil Gairm-Oideachais ann anois, agus ina theannta sin b'éigin a lán dena scoileanna sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra a dhéanamh níos mó sna blíanta deireannacha seo.  Sa bhliain atá caite, tugadh udarás chun ocht scoileanna nua a thógaint agus chun cur go mór le deich scoileanna eile. Cosnóidh sé sin £244,200.  85,573 sin é an líon mac léinn a bhí inrollaithe sna hilchineála ranganna a bhí ar siúl faoi Choistí Gairm-Oideachais san tseiseon 1950/51 i gcomparáid 85,948 sa tseiseon roimis sin, agus níor sáraíodh an t-iomlán sín riamh.  D'fhás an uimhir a bhí inrollaithe sna cúrsaí lán-aimsire lae ó 17,885 go 9,230, agus sin uimhir nár sáraíodh fós.</P>
    <P>Bé an t-iomlán a bhí inrollaithe ins na ranga tr thnóna agus sna ranga seiseanta ná 59,268 i gcomparáid le 61,082 sa bhliain 1949/50.  I dtaobh 8,738 díobh sin micléinn do b'ea iad a bhí ag lorg teagaisc in ábhair áirithe a bhain lena gcearda nó le na slithe bheatha féin agus an chuid eile&mdash; 50,530 is amhlaidh a bhí suim acu sna hábhair éagsúla ar chúiseanna áirithe a bhain le cultúr, nó le teaghlachas, nó ar chúiseanna pearsanta eile.</P>
    <P>Tá oiliúint na bprintíseach tagtha chun cínn go mór agus i roinnt mhaith ceard scaoiltear anois le hoibrithe óga ar feadh tréimhsí oiriúnacha gach seachtain nó ar feadh tréimhse iomlán de chúpla mí gach bliain dá bprintíseacht chun tinnreamh ar ranga lae i scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais.  Sa tseiseon <Col N="1089" /> atá caite bé an líon printíseach do scaoileadh saor amhlaidh sin chun tinnreamh ar chúrsaí páirt-aimsire lae ná 2,027 agus diobh sin do bhain 1,211 le cathair Bhaile Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir d'urmhór na bprintíseach agus na n-oibrithe óga bheith ag brath fós ar ranga tráthnóna chun ceardoideachais foirmiúil d'fháil.  Is trua sin mar an aigne a bhíonn tuirseach tar éis obair agus buaireamh an lae ní bhíonn sí ar bharr a maitheasa chun teagasc teicniceach a ghlacadh isteach agus ní hannamh tarrac na n-ilchineál caiteamh-aimsire a bhíonn le fáil go flúirseach sa tráthnóna ró-láidir don duine óg.  Tá súil againn dá bhrí sin go dtiocfaidh de thuiscint chun tuilleadh fostóirí gur cheart agus gur chiallmhar an rud é printísigh agus oibrithe óga eile a scaoileadh saor ón obair cupla leath-lá sa tseachtain chun tinnreamh ar ranga lae osna Ceárd-Scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Is mór tábhachtach mar chéim ar aghaidh é bunú na gcúrsaí ar eolaíocht sóisialta atá dá dtabhairt ag na trí. Coláistí den Ollscoil i dteannta na gCoisdí Gairm-Oideachais.  I gCoreaigh a soláthraíodh na cúrsaí léinn seo ar dtúis i gcóir fostóirí, lucht na gceardchumann, agus oibrithe óga ach anois tá cead ag cách tinnreamh orthu.  Níorbh fhada gur leathnaíodar amach ó Chorcaigh go cathracha eile ar fud na tíre agus ina dhiaidh sin go dtí na bailte beaga agus ceantracha tuaithe.  Tá trí déag d'ionaid i gCúige Mumhan fé láthair, sé hionaid i gCúige Laighean agus tá cúrsa neamhspleách dá thabhairt ag Coláiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh.</P>
    <P>Dul ar aghaidh taithneamhach eile i gcúrsaí oideachais i gcoir na ndaoine fásta is ea bunú na rang cór-cheoil.  Do cuireadh ar bun i gContae Chorcaighe sa tseiseon 1948/49 scéim na rang cór-cheoil agus do cheap an Coisde duine a bhí mar oide Gaeilge agus cór-cheoilina thimire speisialta i gcóir an chór-cheoil. Tá an scéim sin bunaithe go daingean anois agus ba mhór an bhail ar an oideachas a leithéid de scéim a bhunú i limisteírí na gCoistí eile.</P>
    <P>Cúrsaí eile atá an-tábhachtach is ea na cúrsaí i gCeárdúlacht tuaithe a tugtar fé stiúradh na gCoisdí Gairm-Oideachais. Nuair a cuimhnítear ar an méid atá an meaisín ag gabháil ceannais <Col N="1090" /> ar an saol agus ar an méid atá leictrichiú na tuaithe ag dul ar aghaidh is fuirist a tuiscínt gur riachtanaí ná riamh ardchaighdeán ceardúlachta agus deaslámhachta. Tá ceaptha cúrsaí tuathghaibhneachta do chur ar siúl an samhradh seo sna bailte seo: Muimhneachán, Roscomáin agus an tInbhear Mór agus tá ceaptha cúrsaí ar fhoirgníocht tuaithe a chur ar siúl in ocht gcinn d'ionaid, is é sin Muileann Cearr, Acaill, Cill Rois, Cill Chathlaigh, Móin Chuinn, An Obair, Co. na Midhe, Baile na Míle, Co. Phortláirge agus Ospidéal, Co. Luimnigh. Do cheardaithe óga nó do phrintísigh sna cearda atá luaite na cúrsaí sin.  Cuirfear scrúdú ar na mic léinn ag deireadh na gcúrsaí gaibhneachta agus tabharfar teastaisí de thoradh an scrúdúcháin sin.  Sna cúrsaí foirgníochta déanfar teagasc ar na hoibriúcháin go léir a bhaineann le tógáil an bheagfhoirgnimh, cuir i gcás tógáil tí dhá úrlár.  Mar sin tabharfar don cheardaí óg teagasc luachmhar nach fuirist a fháil sa tuaith.</P>
    <P>Do tugadh cúrsaí ar fhoirgníocht feirme ina lán ionad ó am go ham chun a chur ar chumas na bhfeirmeoirí feidhm a bhaint as an deontas a thugann An Roinn Talmhaíochta i gcóir tithe, agus chun oiliúint speisialta a thabhairt dóibh ar obair choitianta deisiúcháin.  An cúrsa ba mhó le rá dár tugadh an seiseon seo ghabh tharainn is ar an Ráithín i gCo.  Chiarraighe a bhí sé.  Is amhlaidh ba mhian le muintir na háite cóir slí do sholáthar chun ranga lámh-oibre a chur ar siúl do dhaoine fásta.  Laistigh de dhá mhí bhí foirgneamh tógtha ina raibh seomra mór amháin i gcóir lámh-oibre agus seomra beag ranga.  Faoi stiúradh dhá theagascóir lámh-oibre, duine acu a bhí na ard-mháistir, a deineadh an tógáil.  Tá an foirgneamh ar fáil anois mar scoil Ghairm-Oideachais agus níor chosain sé ach £800 ar Choiste Gairm-Oideachais Chontae Chiarraighe.</P>
    <P>Is mór an tógáil chroí dhúinn an iarracht áitiúil seo, agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh a lán áit eile sampla na Ráithíneach.</P>
    <P>Tosnófar an Deireadh Fómhair seo chugainn ar chúrsa dhá bhliain chun fiche teagascóir obair adhmaid d'oiliúint.  Tosnaíodh ar dhá chúrsa eile an Deireadh Fómhair seo caite, <Col N="1091" /> ceann le haghaidh sé dhuine dhéag de theagascóirí obair miotail, agus an ceann eile le haghaidh fiche teagascóir obair adhmaid.  Críochnófar an dá chúrsa sin mí an Mheithimh na bliana seo chugainn.  An Cúrsa i gcóir seacht nduine dhéag de theagascóirí tuaith-eolaíochta ar ar tosnaíodh an Deireadh Fómhair seo caite críochnófar é sin leis mí an Mheithimh na bliana seo chugainn. Tosnófar ar cúrsa eile arís an Meán Fómhair seo chugainn&mdash;is é sin cúrsa i gcóir chúig dhuine fichead de theagascóirí Ghacilge agus Abhar Leantach, agus críochnófar é ar an Meitheamh, 1953.  Glacaim an chaoi seo chun mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le lucht ceannais na hOllscoile i gCorcaigh agus leis na Coisdí Gairm-Oideachais i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus i gCathair Chorcaighe de bharr an chúnaimh a thugadar don Roinn i dtaobh na gCúrsaí seo.  Thugadar an cúnamh sin go fial, flaithiúil.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin uile tionólfar, mí Iúil seo chugainn, cúrsaí gairide samhraidh ar modha múinte tuaith-eolaíochta agus Gaeilge faoi scéimeanna gairm-oideachais.  Is chuige atá na cúrsaí seo dá gcur ar bun chun a chur ar chumas céimnithe ollscoíle agus fochéimnithe na teastaisí faoi leith a thugann an Roinn a ghnóthú san Tuaith-Eolaíocht agus sa Ghaeilge leith ar leith.  Cáilíochtaí riachtanacha na teastaisí sin a bheith ag an té a dheineann teagasc na n-abhar sin i scoileanna gairm-oideachais.</P>
    <P>Tionólfar cúrsa ar Tuath-Fhoirgníocht i mBéal Átha na Sluagh, Co. na Gaillimhe, chun teagascóirí Obair Adhmaid a toghfar d'oiliúint ar oibriúcháin éagsúla na Foirgníochta, ionas go mbeidh ar a gcumas sin arís cúrsaí ar Tuath-Fhoirgníocht a thabhairt do phríntísigh ina gcontaethe féin.</P>
    <P>Tionólfar cúrsa i gCathair Chorcaighe ar láimhseáil meaisíní talmhaíochta chun teagascóirí an obair mhiotail d'oiliúint ar úsáid agus ar dheisiú na meaisíní sin ionas go mbeidh ar a gcumas mic léinn na scoileanna gairm-oideachais agus feirmeoirí a bhaineann le Macra na Feirme a chomhairliú agus a theagasc ar úsáid agus ar choimeád na meaisíní sin.  Tionólfar cúrsa eile i gCathair Chorcaighe ar tuaith-eolaíocht agus is é a chuspóir sin ná eolas <Col N="1092" /> praicticeach a thabhairt do theagascóirí an ábhair sin ar an gClár nua tuaith-eolaíochta i gcóir cúrsaí gairm-oideachais lae .i. an Clár a cuireadh timpeall chun na gCoistí gairm-oideachais le déanaí.</P>
    <P>Tá ar intinn ag Coistí gairm-oideachais dhá chúrsa athnuachainte i gcóir teagascóirí a thionóladh.  Cúrsa ar Cheirdne Tí ceann díobh seo, agus is i gcóir teagascóirí tís é agus faoi stiúradh Coiste Ghairm-Oideachais Chathair Phortláirge a bheidh sé.  Cúrsa CeardTeastais Gaeilge an ceann eile agus tionólfar é sin sa Cheathrú Rua faoi stiúradh Choíste Ghairm-Oideachais Cho. na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh an Chúrsa ar tuaith-eolaíocht i gCorcaigh, ba mhaith liom tagairt faoi leith a dhéanamh do thriail nua a tosnaíodh an tEarrach so caite.  Is é atá i gceist agam ná an scéim tionscaintí le haghaidh daoine óga a cuireadh ar bun le déanaí ag Móin Chuinn i gContae Chill Coinnigh.  Do bhí comhdhála ag an Roinn le teagascóirí tuaith-eolaíochta de chuid na gCoistí gairm-oideachais agus de thoradh na díospóireachta a tharla do cheap an Roinn nár mhór an tuaith-eolaíocht a láimhseáil ar slí níos praicticiúla agus do bheartaigh scéim obair tionscnaimh do na mic léinn.  Is é brí an scéil nár mhór do na mic léinn obaír speisialta praicticeach éigin a dhéanamh sa bhaile, cuir i gcás, gamhain nó banbh a chothú, coirceog bheach a choimeád, éanlaithe tí a thógaint, bog-thoraí nó blátha nó eile a chur ag fás.</P>
    <P>Do tharla go raibh Macra na Feirme timpeall an ama chéanna ag cuimhneamh ar conas fhéadfaidís suim a mhúscailt ag a ndritháireacha agus a ndriféaracha óga sa bhFeirmeoireacht agus i saol na tuaithe.  Tharla go raibh ceaptha acu cumainn sóisear a chur ar bun.  Do thuig Macra na Feirme ná féadfaidís beartú fónta a dhéanamh mura bhfaghaidís cúnamh a n-eolais agus a dtaithí óna teagascóirí tuaith-eolaíochta atá ag obair faoi na coisdí gairm-oideachais, agus d'iarr an Mhacra orm cabhair na Roinne a sholáthar dóibh.  Tar éis diospóireacht an-cháirdiúil, ba léir go raibh an Macra agus an Roinn ar aon-aigne go bhféadfadh an scéim seo an-mhaitheas a dhéanamh, agus do socraíodh triail a bhaint aisti <Col N="1093" /> i ndosaen ionad nó mar sin i mbliana. Tá na triaileacha faoi stiúradh na dteagascóirí tuaith-eolaíochta sna háiteanna éagsúla, ach toisc gur sa bhaile a déantar iad ní foláir comhoibriú na dtuistí a bheith le fáil.  Do gheall Macra na Feirme go ndéanfaidís gach dícheall sna cumainn áitiúla ar an gcomhoibriú sin do chur ar fáil agus do ghabhadar mar dhualgas orthu féin gach ullmhú a dhéanamh sna hionaíd ina mbeadh scéim na mbeart tionscnaimh le cur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Glactar go forleathan anois, mar fhianaise cáilíochta i gcóir cinéala áirithe fostaíochta, leis na Teastais do Ghairm-chúrsaí Lae, go mór-mhór iad so a bhaineann le lámh-obair agus le tráchtáil.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na mac léinn a dhein freastal ar na cúrsaí leantacha lán-aimsire lae agus a chuaigh faoi scrúdú teastaisí, bhí méadú ar líon na n-iarrathóirí ó 2,954 sa bhliain 1950 go 3,243 sa bhliain 1951 agus d'éirigh céadchodán na bpás ó 61 go 66.</P>
    <P>Bíonn scéim scrudúcháin in ábhair single le haghaidh mic léinn na ranganna tráthnóna ar siúl faoi stiúradh na Roinne gach bliain.  Ceaptar cuid de na scrúduithe seo ar shlí go n-oirfidís go speisialta do riachtanaisí na macléinn a bhíonn ag iarraidh cáilíochtaí teicniciúla sna ranga ceárd agus teicníochta idir ranga lae agus ranga tráthnóna.  Sna scrúduithe sin déantar triaileacha béil, triaileacha praicticiúla agus triaileacha scríofa d'oirfeadh do chaighdeáin éagsúla na mac léinn. 20,575 a chuaigh faoi na scrúduithe sin anuraidh, is é sin timpeall an líon céanna is chuaigh an bhliain roimis sin.</P>

    <P>Tugtar faoi ndeara go bhfuil méadaithe ina lán de na fó-mhírchinn a thagann faoi'n vóta seo.  Baineann a bhfurmhór le gníomhachtaí náisiúnta agus cultúrtha.  An £3,500 a soláthraítí go dtí seo chun leabhair, láimhscríbhinní agus aroile a cheannach don Leabharlainn Náisiúnta ní leór é. B'éigin, sa bhliain 1951/52 meastachán breise de £1,250 a thabhairt isteach chun a chur ar chumas na leabharlainne a lom-riachtanais a shású agus dá bhrí <Col N="1094" /> sin, tá £1,000 eile dá thabhairt mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá £1,000 dá chur leis an £5,000 a ceadaíodh cheana chun análacha de chuid na hÉireann atá i dtíortha iasachta do bhreithniú agus cóipeanna a dhéanamh díobh.  Tá breithniú iomlán déanta ag an Leabharlainn Náisiúnta ar a bhfuil de na hanálacha seo cláraithe i Leabharlanna iasachta, agus le cabhair an deontais bhliantúil faoin vóta seo, is ró-dhócha go mbeidh cóipeanna de na hanálacha atá i gceist le fáil san Leabharlainn Náisiúnta ar ball.</P>
    <P>Tá an soláthar don Chomhar Dramaíochta árdaithe ó £2,500 go dtí £3,100.  Is é cúis is mó atá leis an méadú so ná an t-aistriú ó Amharclann na Mainistreach go hAmharclainn na Banríona.</P>
    <P>Tá an deontas do Chumann Drámaíochta na Scol dhá ardú ó £340 go £590 chun go bhféadfar an obair thábhachtach atá dá dhéanamh aige a leathnú amach.</P>
    <P>D'éirigh chomh maith sin anuraidh leis an Scéim deontais do chumainn drámaíochta sa Ghaeltacht gur beartaíodh £250 d'iarraidh mar mhéadú ar an £500 a tugadh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Tá ar intinn agam £3,000 a chur leis an £6,000 a soláthraíodh cheana le haghaidh Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  D'fhéadfadh an chuallacht seo obair ana-thábhachtach agus anríachtanach a dhéanamh le comhcheangal agus comhordú a dhéanamh ar ghníomhachtaí na gcuallachtaí éagsúla atá ag obair ar son na teangan.  Agus é seo go speisialta, gurab í an Chomhdháil is mó faoi ndeara an fás mór atá tagtha ar cheannach na leabhar Gaeilge ar fud na tíre.  Tá ar intinn ag an gComhdháil raint oiriúnach den mhéadú deontais a chur le leathnú na h-oibre sin.</P>
    <P>Tá ar aigne agam an chioníocaíocht leis an Oireachtas d'ardú go £1,250. Is mór é tábhacht na féile seo.  Samhlaíonn sé dhúinn an dul ar aghaidh atá déanta i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus an caighdeán atá bainte amach go coitianta, ach ina theannta sin tugann sé le chéile furmhór na ndaoine atá gníomhach in aithbheochaint na Gaeilge ionas go mbíonn ar a gcumas a smaointe, a dtuairmí agus a dtaithí do chur i <Col N="1095" /> gcóimheas in atmosphiar taithneamhach.</P>
    <P>Tá an chioníocaíocht i gcomhair na dtréimhseachán Gaeilge dá árdú ó £9,600 go £10,360&mdash;sin árdú de £760. An t-árdú atá tagtha ar chostaisí cló agus páipéir faoi ndeara sin.</P>
    <P>Iarrtar árdú de £500 i gcóir Institiúid Náisiúnta na Scannán.  Is é cuspóir choitianta an deontais a tugtar don chuallacht seo ná a chur ar a gcumas leabharlann de scannáin oiriúnacha oideachais a chur le chéile agus chun na scannáin Ghaeilge a chur dá n-úsáid níos coitianta.  Anuraidh do chuir an Institiúd leagan cainte Gaeilge le sé cinn de scannáin oideachais, agus táthar ag beartú chun dul ar aghaidh i mbliana le húsáid scannán agus stiallscannán sna scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Táthar chun £1,000 sa bhreis do thabhairt don Choiste um StairEaladhna. Is é tuairim an Choiste go bhfoillseofar i mbliana an staidéar a tosnaíodh sa bhliain 1947 ar an nGorta Mhór.</P>
    <P>Níor tugadh aon deontas faoin mír-cheann deontaisí do Choláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht sa bhliain 1951/52 ná in aon bhliain roimhe sin, ach cuíreadh £12,000 ar fáil do Chomhaltas Uladh i meastachán breise sa bhliaín 1951/52. Níor híocadh aon airgead leis an gComhaltas, toisc ná raibh an Dintiúir Iontaobhais ullamh acu.</P>
    <P>Is é méid atá dá chur ar fáil faoin mírcheann seo i meastacháin na bliana 1952/53 ná £7,500.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na coiníollacha ar a n-íocfar na deontaisí seo is ea go ndéanfaidh sealbhóirí nó iontaobhuithe na gcoláistí connradh trí Dhintiúr Iontaobhais gur mar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeilge amháin a úsáidfear na tithe, agus má bristear téarmaí na Dintiúire go mbeidh suim an deontais mar fhiacha ar an tseilbh i bhfoirm morgáiste.</P>
    <P>Tá £100 dá chur ar fáil le haghaidh mion-chostaisí a bhaineann le taispeántaisí de phictiúirí a dhein daltaí anseo is annsiud ar fud na tíre.  Taispeánfar Líníocht agus Deannaireacht a chuireann na daltaí isteach ar chomortaisí trí Radio Éireann.  Bíonn samplaí breagha d'obair ealaíonta na bpáistí sna taispeántaisí seo, agus meastar gur chóir go bhfeicfeadh an pobal iad, <Col N="1096" /> go speisialta, páistí, tuistí agus múinteoirí. Is é Radio Éireann agus an té a chuir tús leis an gcomórtas a dhéanfaidh socrú chun na taispeántaisí do chur ar bun agus díolfaidh an Roinn Oideachais na costaisí as an deontas seo.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VÓTA 44&mdash;SCOILEANNA CEARTÚCHÁIN AGUS SCOILEANNA SAOTHAIR.</P>
    <P>£236,700 an méid airgid a meastar don bhliain seo nó £50,490 níos mó ná an méid glan a tugadh le haghaidh na bliana atá caite, 1951/52.  Taobh amuigh den £200 sa bhreis a caithfear ar thuarastail, is é rud is cúis don mhéadú ar an meastachán ná méadú ar na Deontaisí Caipitíochta.  Ar an gcéad lá d'Eanáir sa bhliain 1951, méadaíodh Deontaisí Caipitíochta ón Stát le haghaidh cothú cionntóirí óga agus daltaí ar a gcoimeád i Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus i Scoileanna Saothair: méadaíodh na deontaisí ó 12/-go dtí 14/6d. sa tseachtain i gcás na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus ó 9/6d. go dtí 12/- i gcás na Scoileanna Saothair.  Cuíreadh 3/- sa tseachtain leis na deontaisí sin ar an gcéad lá d'Eanáir i mbliana.  Siad na rátaí íocaíochta ón Stát atá i bhfeidhm anois na 17/6d. sa tseachtain do na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus 15/- do na Scoileanna Saothair.  Méadaíodh cioníocaíocht na nUdarás Aitiúla do réir na méaduithe sin.</P>
    <P>Is é méid airgid a hiarrtar le haghaidh na Scoileanna Ceartúcháin i mbliana ná £11,700 nó £1,850 níos mó ná mar hiarradh anuraidh.  Is é méid an mheastacháin le haghaidh cothú sna Scoileanna Saothair ná £230,410 nó £42,510 níos mó ná meastachán na bliana seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá tuilleadh slí dá chur ar fáil san Scoil Ceartúcháin sa Daingean, is é sin le rá, dhá sciathán nua ina mbeidh seomraí ranga, seomraí codlata, seomraí glantacháin, agus ceardlanna. Críochnaíodh sciathán amháin san Samhradh sa bhliain 1949 agus is dóigh go mbeidh an dara sciathán réidh roimh deireadh na féil-bhliana seo.</P>
    <P>Bíonn deichniúr ar an meán-mhéid ar a gcoimeád san Scoil Ceartúcháin i gCill mo Choda, ach níorbh fhéidir <Col N="1097" /> costaisí reatha do ghlanadh dá mbunuítí deontaisí an Stáit ar an líon atá dá gcoimeád ann uair áirithe.  Dá bhrí sin, tugtar íocaíocht do bhainisteoirí na scoile sin le haghaidh ceathracha, gidh ná fuil san uimhir sin ach buille faoi thuairim.</P>
    <P>Ar an 31 ú lá de Mhí na Nollag 1952, bhí 227 páistí sna Scoileanna Ceartúcháin, agus 6,195 sna Scoileanna Saothair.  I gcoitinne, taispeánann na huímhreacha sin laghdú beag i gcoimheas le na huimhreacha ar an dáta céanna sa bhliain 1950.  Is é Teach Maol Bhríde, Glas Naoidhean, an t-aon áit choimeádta amháin atá faoi chumhacht mo Roinnese.  Tá slí ann do 50 buachaill. Aon duine dhéag sa ló an meánlíon a bhí ann sa bhliain darbh chríoch an 28ú Mí Feabhra, 1952 agus 28 an líon ba mhó a bhí ann lá ar bith. Ordaítear buachaillí isteach ann ar feadh tréimhsí nach faide ná mí nó cuirtear ann iad go sealadach go dtí go dtugtar breith na Cúirte orthu. Glacann cuid de na Scoileanna Saothair le daoine óga a hordaítear isteach mar sin nó a coimeádtar go sealadach go dtrialtar iad agus dá bhárr san bíonn a thuilleadh slí le fáil do chásanna den tsaghas san.</P>
    <P>Tá an scéim faoi shaoire sa bhaile do thabhairt do dhaltaí na Scoileanna Saothair dá oibriú go sásúil.  Tugadh saoire sa bhaile do thimpeall is 2,300 dalta sa bhliain 1951.  Creideann mo Roinnse go ligeann na bainisteoirí dahaí abhaile ar saoire i gcónaí nuair is féidir é sin do dhéanamh gan díobháil a dhéanamh do na daltaí féin.  Aon lá déag is fiche an tréimhse saoire is faide a tugtar.  Nuair nach féidir nó nach cuí daltaí a ligean taobh amuigh den scoil ligtear ar shealga nó ar thurasanna iad. Soláthraíonn líon beag de na scoileanna campaí cois fairrge do na daltaí nach féidir a ligean abhaile ar saoire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister on the fluent manner in which he read his speech but, being a native Irish speaker from Donegal and having beside me a native Irish speaker from Kerry, I regret to say I understood but one-fourth of what the Minister said&mdash; not through any inability on his part but merely because of the manner in which the speech was prepared.</P>
      <P>We have here three distinct dialects: we have Gaeilge Chúige Mumhan, Gaeilge Chúige Connacht, and Gaeilge Chúige Uladh.  I am very, very sorry to say that the Minister's speech was read in none of these dialects.  I do not blame the Minister and I will be pardoned for replying in Bearla Sacsa.  Let us get down to the facts.  After approximately 30 years of freedom in the Twenty-Six Counties is it not a tragedy that, during a ministerial speech in the native language, this House should be almost denuded of members?  We have not even got a quorum, but I am not drawing the attention of the Chair to that now. Why is there such a paucity of attendance? It is because we are fundamentally wrong in our teaching of the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day we departed from the modh direach and the day we departed from the method of teaching our people to speak Irish&mdash;never mind the writing of Irish or the reading of Irish&mdash;Irish was finished in this country.  When we come back to the methods introduced by the late Father Toal in Belfast, and <Col N="1100" /> when we compare them with the methods introduced to-day, does not our effort to revive the language seem a mockery to all of us?  We have our children swotting and slogging in their efforts to read Irish and write Irish. In the days of the Gaelic League, and prior to the Treaty when we wanted our people to speak Irish, they were the days when we were getting somewhere in the revival of our language as the spoken tongue.</P>
    <P>Coming down to the present day, we have, in the Gaeltacht of Donegal, Connemara, Kerry and Waterford, the deontas inspectors coming along and interrogating the children to discover whether or not they are entitled to the £5 deontas.  These inspectors are sent up to us and down to us and west to us, these gentlemen who have learned what I describe as &ldquo;Gaeilge Oifigiúl&rdquo;. Is it not time we took stock?  I may be hard, though I do not wish to be, on very efficient inspectors.  Indeed, I do not blame them.  I blame the system that inflicts them on us.  It is time we revised the system.  Let us not cod ourselves any longer.</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht is dwindling.  It is dwindling for many reasons, but one of the principal reasons is that the language in which we heard the Minister read his speech to-night is not the language of the Gaeltacht.  Again, I do not blame the Minister.  I know the present Minister, and I know that he is most sincere in all that he does. If we want to preserve the Gaeltacht, let us send to the Gaeltacht cigirí&mdash; inspectors&mdash;from the Gaeltacht to examine the children in the Gaeltacht. Then we shall get somewhere.  Perhaps I have said more than I should on this embarrassing subject.  Believe me, I have no desire to criticise the present Minister or the present Government in particular.  I am criticising our native Governments for the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>Let us now take stock.  How far have we advanced?  We have not advanced; we are going back.  If we want to learn a lesson, we must go up to the Nationalists in the Six Counties. There is more Irish spoken in Belfast than there is in the City of Dublin. Irish is spoken there as the vernacular. Perhaps I have said enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> The Minister struck a sound note when he said that we have done very well inside the schools, so far as the teachers are concerned, but we are not going far enough outside the schools. We should concentrate on our school buildings.  I know that the Minister has his heart and soul in school buildings, and we are all behind him in his efforts to improve them.  We must improve our schools.  Some of them are quite primitive.</P>
    <P>As I said on another occasion&mdash;mark my words&mdash;university education is the curse of this country.  If we concentrate more on vocational education, we will go a long way towards improving the country.  Unfortunately, our primary schools are merely stepping stones to the university.  If we could make our primary schools stepping stones to vocational training, we would be doing a great deal to improve the country.  Remember, it was from vocational education that the present machine age developed.  To-day our fisheries are denuded.  Why?  Because we have no net-makers.  We have no marine mechanics, and we have no navigation experts.  Why? Because there is one thing we are concentrating on in our primary schools, and that is, push into the secondary schools and push into the universities.  It would be worth while considering how many deep-sea navigation officers we have in the country, and how many deep-sea first class engineers we have at the moment.  Contrast their number with the number of undergraduates we have studying in the various faculties in the universities.  Is it any wonder that the country is denuded of fishermen and of navigational experts, and of various other arts and trades in which we should have experts?  I agree, as I said at the outset, with the Vote and with everything which has been said of it by the Minister, particularly the things that I did not understand.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House but I do know that if we want to get down to facts then let us not delude ourselves or cod ourselves by having the Minister for Education coming in here and reading a speech.  Mind you, I am not criticising the Minister for <Col N="1102" /> reading it.  I did not hear the Minister's prompt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to follow in the footsteps of my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, by congratulating the Minister on his very clear and full statement, which covered the whole educational field.  I regret very much that, in the unavoidable absence of the ex-Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy, it is incumbent on us to follow the Minister in the order in which we are doing.</P>
      <P>In dealing with education we might regard the schools as factories.  They are really the most important factories in any country, because it is fully recognised that the progress of a nation depends on the education of its people.  When we deal with the school we must take that into consideration and regard it as a sort of factory&mdash;a cultural or a mental factory if you like&mdash;and we must also think of the raw material of that factory, which is the child; also the worker&mdash;the teacher, the overseer&mdash;the inspector and, of course, the real factory itself &mdash;the school.  If all these together are fully catered for in the best manner possible we should expect that when the child has passed through the primary school he is in a sense not fully moulded until he goes through another process in the secondary or the vocational school and, if possible, in the university.</P>

    <P>My colleague has stated that the universities are a curse.  Well, to a certain extent, perhaps, because in this country at the present time we have numbers of people who have the leaving certificate, the matriculation certificate, university degrees, and so forth.  I agree that they are not able to take their place in helping the progress of <Col N="1103" /> the nation because we cannot find suitable positions for all these people. I think that what Deputy O'Donnell has suggested is correct, namely, that when children leave the primary school we should concentrate more on trying to get them a vocational education and a secondary education, if possible.</P>
    <P>Now, I shall take the child.  The home, first of all, is the real moulder of the character of the child.  On the type of parents will depend that moulding with, of course, the surroundings of the home and so forth.  Then at the very young age the child goes, full of hope and perhaps of fear, to school.  The work of the home will be supplemented in the school by the teacher.  In that way a great responsibility falls on the teacher.  On him, or on her, will depend the future of those children.  First of all, if we have teachers capable of carrying out their work efficiently and if they are devoted entirely to the welfare of the child, they must be so trained and so paid&mdash; all other conditions being favourable&mdash; as to enable them to carry out their work at the highest efficiency.</P>
    <P>The present system of training of teachers is not, to my mind, the correct one, because when they enter the preparatory colleges they are, I believe, segregated for four years, more or less, from the outer world, and for two further years they are confined in a training college.  I think it would be much better if a system were brought into operation by which the teachers of the children of the nation would be able to mix more with other people and so get to know better the ways of the world and the movements of society.  The course in the preparatory colleges, or some equivalent course, could be such as to enable them to get the leaving certificate and entitle them to enter the training college or to get the matriculation certificate to entitle them to go to the university.  These certificates could be obtained either in the secondary schools or in the preparatory colleges. When the time came for them to enter the training college, I think that, instead of segregating them for a two further years&mdash;they would then have <Col N="1104" /> reached the age of 17 or 18 years&mdash;they should enter the university in the ordinary way for the purpose of taking their degrees, whether the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Commerce, or the degree of Bachelor of Science.  My idea would be that, if then they expressed a desire to become teachers, they would enter the training college. They would do that, not exactly for the purpose of getting any further education, but rather to gain a greater experience of teaching methods.  To gain that experience, they should have the opportunity of teaching in local national, convent or other schools.</P>
    <P>The two years in a university would give them the opportunity of mixing with people who would be preparing for various other occupations.  That would broaden their minds and give them a bigger idea of life in general. Having completed their training course, they would be fully and well equipped to carry on their duties in the schools.  Having the extra qualifications, they would be well entitled to claim decent salaries commensurate with the important duties that they will be called on to discharge.  Certainly, if teachers are to do their work efficiently they must be free from financial worries.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the State to pay them a salary that will enable them to carry out their work as it should be done.</P>
    <P>Down through the years the worst paid servants of the State have been the teachers.  Under the English Government the pay was miserable in the extreme.  Our Irish Governments did not make a good beginning.  I had better not refer to that because I would have to blame all the different Parties in the House.  However, advances have been made as regards salary and conditions of service in various ways.  While I do not wish to compliment any member on this side of the House, teachers will agree and Deputies will agree that the previous Minister for Education, Deputy General Mulcahy, brought about a great improvement in the conditions of teachers.  One great thing was the setting up of the Conciliation Arbitration Board which should for all future time prevent a recurrence of what happened in 1946.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> Let us hope that through that Conciliation Arbitration Board, in the very near future, the teachers will get an opportunity of further increasing their salaries to keep in line with the increased cost of living, and to give them once and for all a salary that will satisfy them to such an extent that they can devote all their attention to the work of the schools.</P>
    <P>In connection with salaries, I must also refer to the fact that teachers, like all others, must look to the time when they have to retire from their duties. Then, of course, they will expect that generous provision will be made for pensions.  The pensions will depend on the retiring salary.  We know that in years gone by teachers' salaries were miserably small, and that there are some retired teachers living on something like £30 a year.  It is a sad commentary on a country that was supposed to be so fond of education that teachers, people who were interested in advancing the education and culture of the children of this country, should be in that financial state.</P>
    <P>I was really disappointed that in the Minister's statement there was no reference to the claim of pensioned teachers who retired prior to 1st January, 1950, and who are still asking that the gratuity that is paid to their brethren who retired at that period should be granted to them.  It has been granted to their fellow-teachers in Northern Ireland.  I should like to remind the House of the fact that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation is perhaps the one body in this country that has never recognised Partition.  Teachers north and south are members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  We are all fighting for the same ends.  When pensioned teachers in the south are refused that gratuity which has been given to their brethren in the north, they certainly have cause to feel very displeased with the Government of the Republic of Ireland.  It is a pity that a question like that should arise, which really affects Partition and causes, in various ways, a kind of partition&mdash;a partition of pensioned teachers.  There are so many partitions in the teaching profession as regards salaries, emoluments, <Col N="1106" /> and so on, that it is rather peculiar.  I do not know whether it is the Department of Education or the Department of Finance that is responsible. Different types of teachers have grievances as regards salary and pensions.</P>
    <P>The pensioned teachers who are being denied the gratuity did their duties well under difficult conditions. It is a pity that these grand old teachers should be denied what they feel is their just right.  We had hopes, and still have hopes&mdash;because the Minister has not yet said that it would not be granted to them&mdash;that provision will be made for them in the very near future, that it will be made now, so as to satisfy the claims of those teachers. If the minister does nothing else during his period of office, however short or long it may be, but grant the gratuities to the pre-1950 teachers, he will earn the gratitude, not only of those pensioned teachers but of all serving teachers.</P>
    <P>That is so much about the teachers. Now we will come to the schools.  The condition of the schools has been a very sore point, not only with teachers, but with managers, Ministers, the Department of Education as a whole and, of course, with the parents.  There are such types of schools in this country that I am surprised, and any person would be surprised, that parents send their children there at all.  It is difficult for the children but it is even more difficult for the teachers to carry on their work in such buildings.</P>
    <P>I know that great strides have been made in the building of schools, but there are still hundreds of schools in such a condition that they are not fit to house cattle.  These are schools with leaking roofs, broken windows, damp walls, holes in the floors full of rats and mice, and with no sanitary facilities whatever, or, where there are sanitary facilities, they are of the most primitive nature.  Some beautiful schools have been built, but there is the difficulty with regard to the local contribution of 33? per cent. and we can never advance with a scheme of school-building until some change is made in that respect.  The Minister did intimate at the Teachers' Congress <Col N="1107" /> in Tramore or somewhere else that he was examining the matter to see what could be done, and, while I would not be entirely opposed to a local contribution, I maintain that local conditions must always be taken into account.  There are areas where there should be no difficulty in getting the local contribution and there are others where it would be impossible to get such a contribution.  However, I admit that, in such cases, the Minister and his Department have always agreed to accept less than the 33? per cent., and, in fact, I believe the average local contribution is something like 17 or 18 per cent.  It is only right that, where at all possible, a local contribution should be demanded, because parents must realise that, in a Christian democratic country, they should be responsible to a certain extent for the education of their children and should make the contribution demanded of them so that their children will be educated in decent conditions. While this difficulty remains with regard to the local contribution, I am afraid we can never make the advance we should like to make in the building of schools in the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>The remote Gaeltacht and FiorGhaeltacht areas deserve special attention, and special consideration should be given to them in connection with school buildings.  They should have decent schools but not elaborate schools, and in fact I have often thought that some of the schools we have built are too elaborate and too costly, because after the lapse of 40 or 50 years they will be more or less out of date and obsolete.  If we provide good, well-built schools with sufficient accommodation for the children, with proper sanitary arrangements, with drinking water supplied and with a decent playground attached to the school or in the immediate vicinity where the children can take part in all kinds of games, we will have done very well for the children, the parents and the teachers.</P>
    <P>The maintenance, heating and cleaning of schools devolves on the manager, but managers have no funds except the heating and cleaning grant, <Col N="1108" /> by which they can maintain schools in a proper condition and have them properly heated and cleaned.  It is not the wish of teachers or of the teachers' organisation, of parents or of anybody else that the managerial system should be changed, but the system in regard to the maintenance, the heating and the cleaning of schools should be changed.  When schools are built they are vested in trustees and repairs are carried out by the Board of Works for a certain number of years.  I do not know what the view of managers or of the Hierarchy would be on this matter but I think that the schools should then be re-vested and their maintenance continued by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>Some provision is made by which somebody is employed to set fires and to clean a school but the amount given is not sufficient and nobody, in the country areas at any rate, would undertake the work, and so the children still have to do it.  It is entirely wrong in this progressive age, and it was wrong at all times, that the children should be obliged to brush, wash and dust the schools, set fires, and so on, and that the teachers should be responsible for the carrying out of that work.  I believe that the heating and cleaning of schools should be the duty of the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is the local authority who should be responsible, and, in order to carry out the work, they should strike a certain rate for the purpose.  That would, in a sense, make the parents responsible, or at least would make the local people responsible for the heating and cleaning of schools and until some such steps are taken, we shall always see children coming to school on cold mornings with a sod or two of turf under their arms and setting fires, brushing the school and so on.</P>
    <P>All that should be done away with. We have not got that system in the secondary or vocational schools and why should we have it in the primary schools, which are really the most important, because it is there that the moulding of the characters of the children and their education begin?  I think it is about time that representatives of the teachers' organisation, of the managers and of the Department <Col N="1109" /> came together in conference and hammered out some scheme by which the old primitive method of heating and cleaning schools would be abolished.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the child, of the teacher and of the school and I come now to the inspector.  I do not think I have very much to say in that connection, because, while it was a very serious problem some years ago, the whole system of inspection has been so changed that there are now very few grievances in connection with it.  I believe that our native Ministers and the officials of the Department and the higher inspectors, perhaps, came to realise that the inspector's work should principally deal with inspection, with making suggestions to the teachers and in consultation with him or her; and that he should no longer come into the school as a sort of detective to find fault only and to say nothing good of the work of the teacher.  If the Minister and the Department will see that that is done and that inspectors do their duties as gentlemen, it will certainly help to bring about a continuance of the good relations that now exist on the whole between teachers and inspectors.</P>
    <P>I suppose that in all walks of life you will find a black sheep.  We will have black sheep in the teaching profession and in the inspectorial field&mdash; and, of course, in the Department of Education, although they would not admit that.  We have made wonderful strides, on the whole.  By the way, when I refer to the officials, I have nothing to say of them but what is good.  They have often been called bureaucrats and so forth, but I suppose they are working to a certain system. On the whole, I have always found them very courteous, helpful and sensible men and women.  I never found them anxious to injure a teacher or anybody else.  They always dealt with cases in a sensible way.  I just make that remark in passing, as I did refer to them.  We must have good officials and a good Minister &mdash; we have not been so bad in that way, too, and even the present Minister is regarded as being honest and sincere and anxious to do his best and I am sure he does it and will do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> In regard to the primary school programme, there are various types of so-called educationists who think that all kinds of subjects should be taught in a primary school.  I can assure the Minister and the House that teachers have great difficulty in trying to get through the subjects at present in the programme. If the children are taught how to read well, how to write, arithmetic and perhaps a general knowledge of Irish history and Irish geography and perhaps a general knowledge of the geography of Europe and the world, and of course the best possible knowledge of spoken and written Irish, that is all that should be required in a primary school.  Singing and needlework will always be taught in an elementary way.  There is no use in talking about introducing agriculture or rural science or nature study.  All educational cranks interested in any one subject or two think they should be taught in the primary school.  There should be no provision made for them, because children of that age are not able to imbibe the knowledge, or at least there is no opportunity or time available by which they could gain even a rudimentary knowledge of such extra subjects.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to a matter in which a number of lady teachers are interested.  When speaking about it last year, I remember asking the Minister, if he could not give a decision himself, to submit the matter to the Council of Education, if possible.  I speak of the marriage ban.  The Minister has said he will set up a new training college this year&mdash;I do not know whether it is for men or women. We have numbers of lady teachers, fully trained, who had to retire on marriage.  I can never make out who was responsible first of all for introducing that rule.  The Minister states there is no marriage ban.  Of course, there is not; a lady teacher can get married but when she does so she must cease to be a teacher in a school, if she was trained since 1934. I believe that has a very bad effect on education.  A lady teacher is trained under heavy expense, not only to her parents but also to the State.  If she thinks or can foresee that teaching will be her profession for the next 40 years, <Col N="1111" /> she certainly will be anxious to equip herself for the work and she will do everything possible to carry out her duties efficiently.  But when she feels that if she gets married she must relinquish her post, there is certainly no inducement to her to do her work as carefully as she would do it if she knew that she would be continued as a teacher.  And so the child will suffer. After all, a married woman&mdash;a mother, with children herself, perhaps&mdash;can understand children better than an unmarried girl.  The Minister should look into the matter again and consult whatever authority was responsible at first for the introduction of the rule, to see if anything could be done to abolish it.</P>
    <P>A mistake was made in building vocational schools in cities and towns; they should really belong to rural areas.  It was a mistake to build a school in Cathal Brugha Street; it should have been built out in the country surrounded by the beauties of nature.  Having regard to the subjects taught in these schools such as rural science and domestic economy some ground should be attached to the school where the children could get a good knowledge of practical agriculture and where the vegetables for the cookery classes might be grown.  After all we must admit that agriculture is the basis of our whole progress and perhaps such an education would entice the children to live on the land.  In fact the whole surroundings of the school in a rural area would be such as to make them love nature and the land. The school was one of the first things to entice children away from the rural areas into towns and cities but that should be reversed and children from the villages, towns and cities should be brought out into the country.</P>
    <P>I would admit that good progress has been made in vocational education and the building of schools, but they are too few at present.  While we have vocational schools in all the principal towns only very little provision has been made for vocational education in rural and remote areas.  The vocational school should be the centre of vocational education in the parish and all the surrounding parishes and itinerant <Col N="1112" /> teachers should be sent to halls in the surrounding areas to give night classes and day classes too in the same subjects as are taught in the parent school. The people who pay rates provide for the building and upkeep of these schools and everybody who pays rates for that purpose should have the opportunity of having his children educated in one of them or in a branch of those schools.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Minister, to his predecessor and, I suppose, to his predecessor again, that holidays in the primary schools should conform somewhat to the holidays given in secondary and vocational schools, and it is considered that the best period for holidays in national schools would be July and August, when children can be very useful at home saving hay, other crops and turf.  The attendance in the schools during those two months is so irregular that the work done by the teacher is practically nil.  Education will lose nothing by giving those extra ten days' holidays, and I do not think that the Department of Education would suffer any loss either.</P>
    <P>I have covered primary and vocational education, and I think I had better not touch secondary or university education beyond the reference I made to them at the beginning of my speech.  I am sure that the Minister and all his officials are fully alive to the requirements of the various branches of education.  They are also aware that if they will always meet the teachers, managers and all others interested in the welfare and education of the children of this country they can feel perfectly sure that they can get their co-operation, so that, in the end, they will work wisely together and co-operate in such a friendly spirit that we shall uplift the educational standard of the children of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to Deputy Palmer and, being a new Deputy, I cannot say what his occupation is, but it would appear to me from his knowledge of the teaching profession that he is either a teacher or a retired teacher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I must pardon him for devoting the whole of his speech to teachers' salaries and pensions and to the building and cleaning of schools.  He said very little &mdash;and I should have liked to hear him, because I do appreciate that he certainly knows a good deal of his subject&mdash;on the teaching of the children.  I must say that I was waiting very patiently, but he apparently was overcome by the desire to fight the claims of his colleagues and former colleagues in the teaching profession. He put his case very well, but I would like to have heard more from him on the teaching of our children, which is the most important aspect of the question to every Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputies O'Donnell and Palmer dwelt a great deal on the importance of vocational education and said that vocational teachers were doing valuable work.  Is it not only fair then to ask why these teachers should be treated as cinderellas of the teaching profession?  Deputy Palmer forgot about the vocational teachers when it came to that.</P>
      <P>For three years they were kept knocking at the door by the previous Minister and only in June last they received the Civil Service award more or less as a stop-gap.  I understand they were offered by the present Minister the secondary scale.  There again, like the proverbial horse, they are living and hoping.  From my knowledge of vocational teachers in Dublin I can say that they are doing excellent work and they should not be treated as the cinderellas of the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Palmer did not agree with the technical schools being built in the city.  I should like him to go to Bolton Street, or Parnell Square or Rathmines or Cabra when the students are enrolling and see the queues miles long trying to get into these schools.  Does he suggest that we should send them to County Meath or County Dublin or elsewhere?  I agree with the Minister's policy of building technical schools where there are big housing schemes.  I know the Cabra school very well and it is doing excellent work.  There is also a school in Clogher Road and others elsewhere.  As far <Col N="1114" /> as these housing schemes are concerned, the corporation will provide sites for the schools.  The pupils may not have the rural surroundings, but building the schools in these places keeps down the bus fares, etc.  It would be a nice thing, of course, to send Dublin children, say, to Mosney to attend school, but it would be hardly fair to ask them to undergo the expense of travelling that far.</P>
    <P>I thought I would have heard more from Deputy Palmer regarding the programme in the primary schools, but he simply glossed it over.  People like him who have teaching experience should give more information of that kind to Deputies who are not teachers. It would be better for him to ask the Minister, as I will now ask him, is he satisfied that the programme for the primary schools is perfectly satisfactory? Is the standard of the pupils leaving the primary schools as high as it is supposed to be?  I do not think it is.  Then, again, he could ask him should not more attention be paid to oral Irish and less to written Irish? The Deputy could deal with these questions better than I can.  I suggest that when the Estimate for this Department comes before us next year we should hear more about these things from the Deputy and the other teachers.</P>
    <P>I also notice that the Report of the Council of Education is taking shape. I can assure the Minister that the report is eagerly awaited by everybody interested in education and the welfare of the children.  I would ask the Minister to see that the memorandum submitted to the Council of Education by the Federation of Irish Sport gets a good hearing from the council.  It was drawn up by people who are keenly interested in the physical welfare of the children and who went to a great deal of trouble in preparing it.  The federation is a voluntary body and the Minister should see that the memorandum gets full consideration by the council.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see from the Minister's statement that there are to be better staffing facilities in the schools for the blind so as to enable the children to get a good deal of individual attention as that is very essential. <Col N="1115" /> That is a step in the right direction, and the Minister, or whoever is responsible, is to be congratulated on it.  It is a good thing that at last these children are to get a good deal of individual attention.  I also notice that there is to be an improvement in the staffing and equipment of the schools for deaf and dumb children.  I have some interest in one of these schools, and it is a great thing to see such an improvement being brought about as it has been needed for a long time.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to see that there is some hope in that connection for children who are handicapped mentally, for subnormal children.  There is no doubt that the devoted brothers and nuns and lay staff in the schools provided by the religious are doing good work.  It is pleasing to know that the Minister for Health has under consideration a Bill to deal with handicapped persons, including children.  I hope that that Bill will be introduced soon.  These children should receive every possible help. Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the good work he is doing.  When you go to him with any problem you are always received with a caed mile failte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is a most important one, because it deals mostly with primary education. Deputies congratulated the Minister on being able to read his speech.  I do not know whether the Minister appreciated the congratulations or not. I do not see really why he should be congratulated on being able to read his speech, which was prepared for him by his experts and advisers.  Any of us could do that.  I should like to ask the Minister and the House where are we travelling so far as the Irish language is concerned?  What advance have we made?  If we could speak our minds freely, we would say a lot more in regard to the Irish language.  That goes for all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the language of a nation is very important. The fact remains that the revival of the language seems to be making very little progress notwithstanding the time and energy spent on it, notwithstanding the considerable amount of money, energy and time that has been spent in that direction.  The average parent, be it father or mother, in County Mayo, particularly in the constituency which I represent, feels that the Irish language as taught in the national school, which is the poor man's university, is impeding the attainment of knowledge by the average pupil, and is more of a disadvantage than an advantage.  That may not be the popular thing to say; it may not be good politics; it may not be a sound statement to make in a national Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we must face the fact that the average Irishman looks on the subject of Irish as taught in the schools as being a burden and a hindrance so far as the education of his children is concerned.  The simple reason for that is that one year after leaving school every boy and girl has forgotten seven-eighths of the language they have learned.  To my surprise I have discovered that the boy or girl who has left the national school, gone on to the secondary school, and spent four, five or six years there, as the case may be, having left that school, if they do not advance to a university, have forgotten the language after a year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we not entitled to put the question: What is the benefit and where is the advancement or the achievement in that direction?  I believe in the revival of the Irish language. If there is anything the <Col N="1117" /> present head of the Government has ever said which I believe to be true it is that a nation without its own language is in danger.  But we must face facts as they are and we must confess to the criticism that is in existence in the constituencies that we represent.  I am telling you in truth and in honour what the people are saying at the present moment.</P>
    <P>A big percentage of the boys and girls leaving school to-day, and in particular the boy and girl over whom the parents do not exercise control and, mind you, careful control, in seeing that they are kept at home and helped with their lessons in every possible way, are deficient so far as their educational standard is concerned.  I knew a day when a boy or girl leaving the national school could be employed in a shop or firm, or even the Civil Service, local or central, but to-day they must attend for one or two years at a secondary school or obtain some other assistance apart from that received in the primary schools before they can serve their time as an apprentice in an ordinary shop down the country.  The position is that many of them leaving the primary school cannot read or write; many of them cannot do ordinary arithmetic.  You could almost describe them as semi-illiterate. Considering that these children have been at school from the age of six, five, or sometimes even four, up to the age of 14 years, this is a most serious position.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not indicate to the Minister and to this House what are the views of the people with whom I come in contact and whom I have met over a period of years.  I take a serious view of the present curriculum and of the policy that is being carried out in the national schools.</P>
    <P>It is true that the same interest is not taken in the pupils as was taken when some of us were boys going to school.  It was more than a position in those days.  It was almost, I would say, a very sacred vocation for the teacher.  It was a very high calling and it still is, that he should be responsible and have under his control small boys and girls for four, five or six hours in the day.  Not only must <Col N="1118" /> he impart knowledge to them but he must be a source of example to them in every contact with life from one end of the year to the other, whether it is in the church, in the school, in the street, or wherever else it is.  If they see the teacher doing anything that would not be in keeping with the situation, they can point at him as the example for their own actions.  While we must admit that the average teachers are worthy citizens and worthy of their calling, when we compare the young teacher of to-day with the teacher of 25 years ago there is a very vast difference.  There is also a vast difference between the schoolboy of 25 years ago as compared with the boy of to-day.  When you meet a group of young boys on the road coming from school and have a little conversation with them, you will find they have no manners, no courtesy, no discipline; &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;how do you do&rdquo; and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; are all you hear.  When I was a boy that was not the conduct I was taught.  If we conducted ourselves in that way we would be severely reprimanded.</P>

      <P>I want to state in all seriousness that I have the utmost respect for the teaching profession. Anything I say here is said with one motive, of imparting to those who are in a position to remedy matters information on certain things, which I consider they should know.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not do that. Take the average letter you receive from a boy to-day.  In the curriculum in our national schools how many subjects are there?  How much grammar is taught?  What do the pupils know about writing letters to a friend or applying for a position.  I remember getting a letter a short time ago and <Col N="1119" /> the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; was written &ldquo;ant&rdquo;. That boy left school at 14 years of age. However, even in regard to those leaving the secondary school, we cannot say an awful lot as regards the standard reached.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider the curriculum and the question of Irish.  Are we doing our best to ensure the development and progress of the Irish language or are we unintentionally killing it rather than developing it?  The very fact that it is on the downward trend is an admission in that direction.  The very fact that less Irish is spoken to-day than in previous years is an admission of failure.  It is very significant that I must confess that, whether it is in the dance hall, the cinema, the public-house, the football or hurling field or wherever people meet, I have yet to hear a conversation held in Irish. Children who are taught through the medium of Irish all day rush out of school in their hundreds and revert back to English immediately.  Is not that a clear indication that they have neither interest in nor concern for the language?  What is the answer to this?  I am not going to suggest the answer, but the Minister and his expert advisers know the answer as well as I do.  To be quite frank, it would not be popular to say it.</P>

      <P>You would be the first man to misrepresent me if you thought you would get three votes by so doing. I agreed with Deputy Palmer when he spoke on the subject of the pensions of some retired teachers.  I do not propose to go into details with regard to this matter because, to be quite frank, I do not know a whole lot about it.  However, there are some retired teachers who have been treated unjustly, and the number is very small. Some of these people are very advanced in years, some being over 80 and some others close to that age. We should look up to these teachers; these were the people who took over from the hedge schoolmasters and who carried on Irish conditions and gave a <Col N="1120" /> national outlook in the primary schools when it was not the popular thing to do so.  Because of retiring perhaps a few months in advance of certain considerations which were given by the Department of Education they were denied certain allowances. That should not be the case, and I would ask the Minister to be considerate in this matter and not to be holding it in abeyance as has been the case over a number of years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Palmer told us also that it should not be the duty of the parents of the children to provide for the heating and the cleaning of schools.  It is a long time since I first stated that in this House.  I remember when I was a novice in the political field making that case, in all sincerity, on political platforms in my constituency.  The teaching profession in that constituency then agreed with me in this regard, but a few months afterwards, at the Irish National Teachers' Organisation Convention in the South of Ireland, some of these teachers, in conjunction with their colleagues, supported a resolution that it should be the duty of parents.  That shows the dishonesty of men who are prepared to misrepresent a person in a very insignificant matter in connection with what he was advocating.</P>
      <P>I will quote now from the Minister's introductory statement to his Estimate to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...I believe that the building, maintenance, repair, heating and cleaning of schools are matters in which the local people, acting through their managers, should continue to have a definite measure of responsibility.  The response to that call on the people has not, for various reasons, been adequate in recent years....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managers and the local clergymen are finding it extremely difficult to secure the contribution which I believe is reasonably small from the people towards the repair, reconstruction or building of national schools.  We must know that the people in my own constituency and in rural Ireland feel that they are taxed enough at the present time and for a number of years back <Col N="1121" /> without having to make a contribution towards the cleaning, upkeep and heating of the schools.  I feel a scheme could be inaugurated in which the State would be responsible for the building, upkeep, heating and cleaning of schools without infringing one iota on the authority which managers have in the administration of national schools.  I think it is disgraceful at this stage of our history, bearing in mind that we are a Christian nation where every citizen, with the exception of a few, believe in the Christian teaching, that the parents of the children should be called on to contribute to the upkeep of our national schools.  I fail to see why a scheme such as I have mentioned above could not be provided&mdash;a scheme which would leave full powers with the managers, as at present, and yet provide the full capital sum.</P>
    <P>It is most unnatural, to say the least of it, that children should be asked to bring with them every morning the fuel for the heating of the schools.  Some of these children have to walk two or three miles to school, and if they do not bring the turf with them, their parents must deliver a cart of turf per year to the school.  It is not the cart of turf that matters because there is plenty of bog down the country, but it is the inconvenience and the trouble attached to the whole matter to which the parents object.  Now that we have rural electrification our new, modern national schools should be heated electrically.  I believe, too, that in the schools which are being built at present the rooms should be made much smaller and much more compact so as to keep the heat within a certain specified area.  In most of the schools down the country the rooms are very elongated, with a fire at one end and, except on a very wet day, when the atendance has dwindled very much, it is impossible to get near the fire.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word on the subject of hygiene in national schools. It is extraordinary, after 30 years of native administration, that we should have the present unhygienic conditions in these schools.  To say the least of it, the conditions are unnatural, out of date, primitive, and ones of which we should feel ashamed.  It is no wonder <Col N="1122" /> then that the habits developed by little boys and girls frequenting these schools remain with them in their future life.  What can one expect when these little boys and girls were used to such primitive conditions while attending our national schools?</P>
    <P>Lest it might be imagined that I have any particular grudge against national school teachers, I want to make it clear that I regard them as a fine body of people.  However, as I said above, they compare unfavourably with the teachers of the older generation.  I will leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the vocational schools are essential and are doing a good job of work.  As I said here on other occasions, if a man sends his boy to a vocational school and enters him for woodwork, be it joinery or carpentry, for metal work, for smithy work, or for any other of the trades which we know of, he goes there for two, three or five years, and he becomes a very good woodworker.  Later, when he goes to Dublin or to any other provincial town he finds that he does not qualify to be a member of the trade union.  His time has been wasted except in so far as the knowledge which he has acquired at the vocational school will be of help to him in his own home or on his farm. He can repair a gate or fix a pillar or make a door, and so forth, but he cannot do any of these things if he is not on his own farm.  If it is his intention to earn his living by the trade which he has acquired as a result of his attendance at a vocational school, he is faced with the problem of getting into the union when he comes to this city or elsewhere for employment.  He must go back and serve his apprenticeship for five long years in the case of joinery, and perhaps for even longer in the case of other trades.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of a young man who attends a vocational school for five years and learns a certain trade.  I do not deny that he has acquired very valuable technical knowledge, which is of the utmost importance in that particular trade or in any trade, but the fact of the matter is that little consideration is given by his employer to the years which the young man has <Col N="1123" /> spent acquiring his trade at a technical school.  His wage is not increased as against that of the boy who has no experience.  That, in my opinion, is a set-back.  More young men would be encouraged to go on for either of the trades I have referred to and would spend two years at a vocational school, between 14 and 16 years, during which time they would acquire a knowledge of the names of the tools, how to sharpen them and so forth, if they got some recognition later for the years they spent at the vocational school. There are lots of things which they would learn there which it would take them at least six months to learn in any joiner's shop in this part of the country or in any building trade.  A young man who has acquired that knowledge is an asset to his employer, but I am not aware that the young man gets any consideration in respect of his two years' attendance at the vocational school.  Therefore, the only benefit which the vocational school gives to the person who attends it is the fact that he can work in his own home and on his own farm.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, when Deputy Derrig was the Minister for Education, I suggested that he should consider the opening of schools where plastering and bricklaying would be taught. The various Governments which we have had in this country for the past 30 years have indicated that they are anxious to ease the flow of emigration. Having failed to ease the flow of emigration, which is the regretful fact, notwithstanding that these various Governments have indicated their intention and desire to do so, the least we could do for our young men who have to seek employment abroad would be to equip them with a good sound trade or vocation.</P>
    <P>Emigration is still as great as it was at any time for years past.  If we fail to provide employment at home for these young people we should not fail to equip them with the one thing that the average man or woman cannot pawn, and that is, as I say, a good sound trade or vocation.  In my opinion a good sound trade is much better than wasting the time of a boy or girl by sending them to the university <Col N="1124" /> and giving them some profession which may take many long years to provide them with a sufficient return to maintain themselves&mdash;not to talk of the parents or guardians who have spent hundreds of pounds educating these young people.</P>
    <P>We could open up here&mdash;and in particular in the rural areas from which a lot of our youth emigrate&mdash;schools where bricklaying and plastering would be taught.  I do not think that it would cost a great deal to do so. There would be no waste whatever, particularly so far as bricklaying is concerned.  We could equip our young men and turn them out as first-class plasterers and first-class bricklayers. If these young men emigrate they will be able to work at their trade instead of having to become labourers or to do other types of heavy work.  They could then engage in the lighter trades and in lighter work.  In that way we would at least give them some compensation for our failure to provide them with employment here at home.</P>
    <P>Various scholarships are given for agricultural classes.  I must say that it is regrettable that more boys do not avail of these scholarships and that more farmers' sons do not avail of them.  It should be hammered home to these farmers' sons that when they acquire a scholarship to one or other of these schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that that matter arises under another Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it comes under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.  My interest lies in the primary and the vocational schools. I should like to draw attention, however, to a matter which affects university students, particularly here in Dublin.  These students have to put up with great inconvenience in the matter of securing boarding accommodation. It is most unfair that over the years some provision has not been made for university students who do not live in Dublin.  The average boy or girl who comes here to attend the university has to pay something over £3 a week for boarding accommodation.  That is <Col N="1125" /> a big outlay, apart altogether from books, clothes, pocket-money, university fees, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though they pay £3 or £3 10s. a week they are crammed three or four into a room.  They find it difficult to do any study at home because there is always the boy or the girl who is not interested in study and who will make sure, if at all possible, that the others will not study either.  He tries to distract their attention from their work, asks them to go out for a walk&mdash; anything to avoid studying.  The young students who want to work cannot give the attention to their studies which they would give if they had proper accommodation.  They are paying twice as much as reasonable accommodation would cost if it were available.  Some steps should be taken immediately to provide proper boarding accommodation for the young men and women who attend our universities. Sometimes they are sent at great inconvenience to their parents who have to provide the necessary funds to defray the cost of their education, and they should be enabled to avail of every effort to make a success of their four, five or six years in the university.  I mentioned that matter in this House a number of years ago but nothing has been done about it. I hope that the Minister will give the <Col N="1126" /> matter serious consideration in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he will settle what is a vexed problem in a couple of parts in County Kildare.  New schools have been put up in two places in County Kildare and when they were completed it was found that they were sited without any regard to the matter of a water supply.  I understand that a war is going on at the moment between the manager of the schools, the county council authorities, the Department of Education and the Board of Works. Meanwhile the children have no water to drink.  It would seem that a little forethought by somebody in regard to the siting of a new school would have prevented such an occurrence.  I know of one case in particular in South Kildare where the situation is not merely bad but very bad, because I believe that there will be considerable difficulty in getting water at all near the site in question.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7th May, 1952.</P>
