      <P>The Deputy will be aware from replies to previous questions on this subject that the site was made available to the Rotunda Hospital Authorities as a temporary measure for the purposes of an infant welfare unit.  Work on the Garden of Remembrance cannot be commenced until the temporary user of the site shall have ceased.  Interdepartmental discussions, however, have been taking place to determine how the construction of the garden can be undertaken with the least possible disturbance to the buildings which have been erected on its original site. When a satisfactory solution to this problem has been found work on the memorial will be initiated without any unnecessary delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that tests carried out on milk for domestic consumption in this country showed that a much higher percentage of the samples of pasteurised milk examined had failed to pass the bacteriological plate count test than was the case in regard to the samples of loose, unpasteurised milk taken; and, if so, whether this is the reason he has decided to discourage the continued use of this test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the results of tests of milk samples given in my reply to a question by Deputy Dr. Browne on the 5th March.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant regulations under the Milk and Dairies Act, pasteurised milk is deemed to have failed the plate count test if the bacterial count exceeds 100,000 per cubic centimetre, whereas unpasteurised milk is not deemed to have failed the test unless the bacterial count exceeds 500,000 per cubic centimetre.  Accordingly, there is no validity in the comparison the Deputy suggests between the results of the plate count test as applied to pasteurised milk and as applied to raw, unpasteurised milk.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the Deputy's question, I would point out that, as indicated in my reply to Deputy Hickey's question on the 5th March, the only change made in the use of the plate count test for milk was that local authorities were notified of the undesirability of basing legal proceedings against dairymen on that particular test.  The use of the test otherwise was in no way discouraged and, in fact, local authorities were notified that the test should continue to be used as a guide to the quality of pasteurised milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>West Cork and some other parts of the country have proved difficult to deal with mainly because of the very considerable haulage problem occasioned by the long distance of these areas from the sources of supply. The problem is aggravated by the fact that in many land project cases the quantities to be spread are very small and the splitting of loads is necessary.  It also happens that some farmers refuse to take delivery except at a time to suit their own convenience and consequent rearrangement of deliveries is difficult.  Finally, there is the position that supplying companies are overloaded with orders to meet seasonal cropping requirements and the natural tendency is for the producers to give priority to such orders.  I can assure the Deputy that this matter is being kept constantly under review and that everything possible is being done to improve the position in West Cork and in the other districts similarly circumstanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to hold the House very long in this connection. There is one matter on which I intend to speak and that is the statements made by members of the Government that the inter-Party Government had bankrupted the State, and as to what they had done with Marshall Aid, etc.  I wish to deal first with the statement made in this House last night by Deputy Dr. Browne when speaking on the Vote on Account. According to a report of his speech in to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i>, Deputy Dr. Browne stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless the farmers were prepared to do their duty, it would be the responsibility of the Government to take control of the land and reallocate it to people who would.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that that is the most dangerous statement I have heard here since I had the honour of being elected as a member of this House in 1943.  Let us ask ourselves this question: Is the Deputy who made such a statement a responsible person?  Does he realise what it means, or does he realise its implications?  I wonder is that the view of any other Deputy in this House?  I wonder is it the view of the Minister? I do not believe it is, nor do I believe it to be the view of any responsible Deputy.  I am inclined to believe that if Deputy Dr. Browne realised what that statement meant he would not have expressed it in this House.  I <Col N="35" /> want to assure him and every other Deputy or Minister or Government that the day they attempt anything like that it will spell their downfall in this country.</P>
    <P>I want to warn him and every other member of this House who may think along the lines expressed by him that the tenant farmers in this country own their own piece of land.  Their ownership is sealed by the blood, the sweat and the tears of their ancestors.  Their ancestors fought for the land and, indeed, some of them died while resisting landlordism in this country. They fought and beat down the battering ram and the crowbar brigade and they resisted the army of occupation plus the R.I.C.  I throw out the warning to any other Deputy who may have the same views on this matter as Deputy Dr. Browne as reported in to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i>, and I say to them that if they bring back to this country the R.I.C. or their descendants and attempt anything like that advocated by Deputy Dr. Browne their downfall will be brought about.  I will leave the matter at that.</P>
    <P>At the present time the Ministers are making speeches throughout the country at cross-purposes with each other, so to speak, but they are creating panic.  Some of them are saying to the people: &ldquo;This country is bankrupt. All the money is gone down the drain. The inter-Party Government swallowed up the Marshall Aid money.  They swallowed up the American dollars and left this country bankrupt.&rdquo;  I suppose attack is the best method of defence. I would like to put some matters before the Minister for Finance.  As far as Marshall Aid is concerned, if any one member of this House deserves credit it is Deputy MacBride.  He should be commended for the work he did when he held the office of Minister for External Affairs in connection with getting Marshall Aid for this country. It was well worth getting that money, and I will point out some of the benefits that were derived from it.  We had in this country a fund into which was placed sterling to the value of the Marshall Aid dollars we used.  We <Col N="36" /> could not buy goods outside the sterling area except with dollars.  These dollars were taken from the Marshall Aid fund but their full value in sterling was put back into the special fund I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the notice of the Fianna Fáil Party the machinery which was purchased with the Marshall Aid money.  According to a reply given to me by Deputy Beegan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, £800,000 worth of machinery was purchased between February, 1948, and June, 1951.  That machinery was used during my period of office for the purpose of the Brosna arterial drainage scheme, the Glyde and Dee arterial drainage scheme and the Feale arterial drainage scheme.  Therefore, three arterial drainage schemes were put into operation during the three years in which the inter-Party Government held office, and this machinery was purchased in America through Marshall Aid funds. I wonder do the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represent Laois and Offaly object to the Brosna drainage scheme? I wonder do the present Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Local Government object to the scheme in Cavan and Monaghan?  I wonder do the Fianna Fáil Deputies object to the arterial drainage scheme in Laois and Offaly?  I wonder do Deputy Mrs. Crowley and Deputy John Flynn object to the scheme for the drainage of the River Feale?  Has Deputy Killilea any objection to the provision of machinery for the opening of the Corrib drainage scheme in Galway?  Does Deputy Moran object to the carrying out of that scheme or to the buying of machinery for that scheme through the dollar pool for work in County Mayo or at least in that portion of County Mayo touching on the Corrib?  Nevertheless, it is these very people who are going around the country saying: &ldquo;Oh!  The money was badly spent. It was wasted.  It went down the drain.&rdquo;  Quite a lot of it went down to make drains and to make the rivers which were badly needed, and it has given back to our people thousands of acres of land which for years had been neglected by native and foreign Governments. <Col N="37" /> A number of statements were made here by two-mouthed individuals who blow hot and blow cold when it suits them to do so.  They say one thing with one side of their mouth and when it suits them they say something else with the other side.  Some say: &ldquo;There was no stockpiling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy de Valera made clear the fact that goods were brought into this country and were left here for the benefit of the present Government. Over two and a half years' supply of tobacco was bought through the dollar pool and was a great source of revenue to the present Government and, according to what I hear, it is going to prove to be an even greater source of revenue.  Still they say there was no stockpiling with one side of their mouth and with the other side they say that there was considerable stockpiling.  We are told that there are 20,000 extra unemployed in this country as a result of the goods which the inter-Party Government imported. I wonder what are we to believe?  Was there stockpiling or was there not? The Minister will, I hope, tell us that when he replies.</P>
    <P>When I first went to the Office of Public Works I found that we would have to wait six months before we could purchase one machine from the sterling area.  When that six months had expired the firm from which we proposed to purchase the machine would tell us we would have to wait for a further six months.  The result was there was only one country from which we could get the machinery and that was America.  We got the machinery and it was paid for from Marshall Aid.  However, every dollar we paid out in Marshall Aid was replaced in sterling in the fund provided. The American representatives were told that we could not pay them back in dollars but that we could pay them back in sterling.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out yesterday, they were satisfied with that.  It was their funeral and they accepted it.</P>

      <P>The debates which have taken place in this House during the past six months, and <Col N="38" /> among them this debate, have focussed attention, possibly more so than ever before, on aspects of our national economy which were never considered to come within the ken of the ordinary citizens&mdash;matters such as the balance of payments, excess of imports over exports and other such matters.  These were considered to be the peculiar problems of economists and of higher politicians.  If for no other reason than the fact that public attention has been brought to bear on these subjects, the debates here have served a very useful purpose.  The manner in which they have been discussed has varied from a placid atmosphere to a more volatile atmosphere.  Deputy Dillon's exhibition yesterday was an example of the volatile type.  On the last occasion on which he spoke, when he moved the adjournment of the debate last week, Deputy Dillon sought to discredit not only the American statisticians connected with O.E.E.C. but also our own statisticians in his attempt to justify his three and a half years in charge of the Department of Agriculture.  His exhibition yesterday, an exhibition of ranting and raving, brought to my mind a few words from a poem by the Scottish national poet, Bobbie Burns:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;O wad some power the giftie gie us, To see ourselves as others see us.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that power had been given to Deputy Dillon yesterday, I am sure his next performance in the House would be of a far more placid and possibly of a more reasoned nature.</P>

      <P>I could quote Shakespeare and give a few nursery rhymes, such as &ldquo;Little Jack Horner,&rdquo; which can very readily be applied to many of the occupants of the opposite front bench, because for the past six or eight months we have listened to nothing from each and every one of them, in giving an account of his <Col N="39" /> stewardship of the Department or section over which he had control, but &ldquo;What a good boy am I.&rdquo;  I give Deputy Donnellan no credit for bringing in the necessary machinery for the carrying out of the arterial drainage programme for which plans had been made by the Fianna Fáil Government under the Arterial Drainage Act, nor do I give him any credit for bringing it in as soon as he could get it when he discovered it was not available in England for sterling but was available in America.  It was his duty to do so. He had the machinery in the legislative sense of the word ready for him.  Most of the plans were made and all he had to do was to accompany his Taoiseach to the Brosna site, blow a whistle and off started the works.</P>
      <P>I do not think that he himself would deny that he was not the architect of that scheme, other than having brought over whatever machinery was required with the dollars made available through Marshall Aid&mdash;a fund, incidentally, which Deputy Mulcahy in 1947 described as nothing better than outdoor relief.  I remember reading a statement of the Deputy's to that effect in a provincial paper.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to dispute the fact I am sure I could lay my hands again on it.  It is available in the National Library.  To come back to this debate, it has, like most of the debates over the past few months, revolved largely around national economy, and it is just as well that the attention of the country should be focussed on it in order that the ordinary people can get a true picture of how their national household account is kept.  It is very important that the full implication of what balance of imports over exports means for the average citizen in his everyday life should be realised, and it is necessary that he should get a full and comprehensive picture of how agricultural production is moving, whether increasing or decreasing, and the same applies to industrial production.  I am not <Col N="40" /> going to attempt to set myself up as an agricultural expert.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I never presumed to say I was qualified, but I am satisfied to take my guidance from the figures published by our Central Statistics Office. To become a statistician means undergoing a very severe and prolonged course in mathematics, and even then it is only the top flight of mathematicians who take up careers as statisticians, and until such time as better qualified men can be employed by the State I am prepared to accept the figures the director or whoever works under his control will supply to us. Accepting that, there can be no doubt, to my mind, that there has been a decline in agricultural output.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made an attempt to prove that the overall output from a particular acreage in 1951 increased as compared with the output in 1945 or 1947, but the important thing to remember is that there was a decline in the acreage of almost every cereal and almost every root crop we produce. Similarly, there was a decline in the number of milch cows, in-calf heifers, pigs and poultry.  I do not wish to go through a long litany of them, but, even accepting Deputy Dillon's claim that the gross output of agriculture did increase, he cannot deny that, had the same acreage been kept up, that output would have increased considerably, and if our agricultural economy had been directed along proper lines, I believe that we would not be facing at present the very severe adverse balance of payments we are facing.  So much for the figures published by our Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read recently some figures published by the Statistics Office of O.E.E.C., comparing agricultural recovery amongst European nations between the years 1946-47 and 1949-50. In 1946-47, and comparing that period with the period 1934-38, this country was placed fourth highest among selected European nations in the matter of agricultural recovery.  In the <Col N="41" /> year 1949-50 the place we occupied in the same group of countries fell to 11th which, I think, should also indicate that whatever progress we have made could have been stepped up considerably with proper guidance and encouragement to the farmers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the over-all picture of imports and exports it has been reliably estimated, again by our own statisticians, that by the end of 1951 imports amounted in all to £204,000,000 while our visible exports reached the figure of £81,000,000, a figure which Deputy Dillon claimed in the House yesterday was the highest export figure ever attained in this country.  Again I would remind Deputy Dillon that, although statisticians' figures are generally speaking a good guide, when it comes to putting money value on exports surely he must realise that the value of the £ has so much decreased that £81,000,000 does not represent the value our exports should have had, even though, as he claimed, the figure was higher than in previous years.  Taking the figure £204,000,000 for imports and £81,000,000 for visible exports we are left with a gross deficit of £123,000,000 and, allowing for our invisible exports, it has been reliably estimated that there is a net deficit between imports and exports of £66,000,000.  That, I think, is something very salutary for even the average man to think about in getting the over-all picture of our national economy.</P>
    <P>Taking a general look at Government expenditure, we find that the Supply Services in 1947-48 amounted to £58,000,000 while in 1951-52 it is estimated that they will have reached over £83,000,000.  Our capital liabilities in 1947-48 were £100,000,000 and the same liabilities in 1951-52, after three and a half years of the inter-Party Government, amounted to £192,000,000, increasing the amount for the service of the debt from £3,250,000 to £7,000,000.</P>
    <P>These are figures of a general nature and it was on discovering these figures for themselves that the Fianna Fáil Government, on assuming power, thought the time ripe to make the <Col N="42" /> people of the country properly aware of the true position.  Statements made by some Ministers, the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, have been dubbed forebodings of doom and statements of gloom.  Nevertheless I think that it was their duty and the Government's duty to give an honest picture of the national household accounts as they found them and to call the people from the complacency in which they had been left to a full realisation not only of their position but of their obligations if they wished to maintain their standard of living and, if possible, to improve it.</P>
    <P>One of the first acts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce on assuming office and realising that there was a danger of this country becoming a dumping ground for foreign goods, goods of a nature and description that we were able to make well for ourselves but at a price with which we could not hope to compete, was, as far as he was permitted by existing international trade regulations, to fix quotas as well as tariffs to the highest possible level.  Many people do not agree with the imposition of quotas and tariffs but nevertheless, so long as we have reliable manufacturers able to produce goods of sufficient quality to compete with imported goods even if they cost our own people a little extra, I think that from the point of view of the national economy it is wise and good government.  Without any dilly-dallying the Minister was very quick to realise the position.  Knowing that there was a general recession not only in this country but in Europe and America and realising what the consequences would be he was quick to apply the only remedy at his disposal at the time.  That itself helped to keep down the unemployment figures to which so much reference has been made in the course of this debate.  I hope to return to that again later.</P>
    <P>Realising also the necessity for industrial expansion in the country the Minister, under the aegis of his Department, caused the Undeveloped Areas Act to be passed.  I am just referring to some of the remedial measures the present Government undertook in order <Col N="43" /> to offset the existing trend of relying too much on imported goods and allowing the national accounts to drift.  In order to bring about an industrial revival and to divert industry as far as he could to the West of Ireland the Minister had the Undeveloped Areas Bill passed which gave manufacturers, whether native western manufacturers or manufacturers from Dublin or Cork, the opportunity, if they desired to expand, to do so with the blessing and financial assistance of the Government in areas where industrial expansion and employment are most desirable, and where it is hoped the Act will be fully availed of in order to give that much needed employment.</P>
    <P>Another undesirable trend quickly arrested was the dependence for our electrical expansion on imported fuel. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce assumed office he found plans well advanced for two new electricity generating stations powered on coal and oil.  That was a trend which he felt should be quickly stopped.  He felt that we should return to the trend which he had established: dependence for fuel on our own resources which were cheaper and which we could use certainly with more advantage to ourselves. The Electricity Supply Board were quickly communicated with and told to reorganise their development programme so as to include the generation of electricity from turf and water power which we have in abundance. An outstanding example of what that direction achieved was the initiation of the huge scheme in Bangor Erris which, it is hoped, will provide for our pool of electricity 80,000,000 units per year from 1956 onwards.  As well as that, the Claddy River in Donegal, which has been a bone of contention in that district for a long time, was ordered to be put back on the Electricity Supply Board development programme.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill is at present before the House.  I think this Bill was in the course of preparation during the previous Government's term of office.  Approaching these problems as a good Government should, without <Col N="44" /> jettisoning any of the projects initiated by our predecessors, even though the initiation of the Tourist Traffic Bill was not to any great degree the work of the inter-Party Government, we, nevertheless, accepted the work on that Bill.  We now have before the House at the present time a means of increasing our national income through tourism from the present estimated £26,000,000 to £30,000,000 per annum to at least 50 per cent., or possibly more, in excess of that figure.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural side, the Government, almost immediately on assuming office, gave assistance to the dairy farmer who was in the habit of bringing his milk to the creamery.  There was given to the dairy farmer bringing his milk to the creameries 1d. per gallon extra.  It probably ill-becomes me, as a city Deputy, to laud that as an achievement but, for my part, I prefer to have some butter even at 2d. per lb. extra, which followed on the increase of 1d. per gallon for milk, than no butter at all, which is what would have happened eventually had the farmers been denied an increase of 1d. per gallon which they claim was their due and which, apparently, was accepted as such.</P>
    <P>Increased credit facilities were made available for farmers and in that connection the Minister, only a fortnight ago, gave, in reply to a question, the particulars of what these were.  One was the provision of credit by the Irish Flour Millers' Association for their agents to supply farmers with fertilisers and seed wheat.  The second was a new scheme for loans for the purchase of agricultural implements costing from £40 to £750 each and the third was a new scheme of loans of from £25 to £300 for the purchase of sheep and cattle.</P>
    <P>These, too, were designed to assist the farmers to increase agricultural production.  It represented practical assistance from the Government.  As well as that, they have been exhorted to greater production by the Taoiseach and other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made, during the course of the debate, to the achievements of the inter-Party Government <Col N="45" /> in the capital outlay field, particularly in regard to housing.  I do not think it can be laid at the door of any Fianna Fáil Government that their approach to the housing problem was in any way weak-hearted.  I think it has long been settled in the House that there is no real conflict with regard to the necessity of securing for our people adequate housing facilities.  The inter-Party Government during their period of office frequently said&mdash;and to their credit carried out what they said&mdash;that the lack of money was no deterrent to the provision of houses for the people. The same applies at the present time even though, at first glance, the Estimates for the current year appear to show a reduction in the amount to be found for housing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance has already explained that that arises out of the ending up of the Transition Development Fund and out of the voting of moneys last year for the payment to local authorities of commitments which had been incurred as at November, 1950.  A new method of financing local authority housing schemes has now been evolved and the net result will be that there will certainly be no easing in the provision of finances for housing to any degree.</P>
    <P>There is at the present time some unemployment particularly in Dublin and possibly, to a lesser extent, in Cork City among housing operatives skilled and unskilled.  That is largely due to the fact that the local authorities concerned have not their plans sufficiently well laid in advance.  In Dublin, I gather the state of affairs is that a local authority has not got sanction from the Department in respect of the layout of the plans but I do not think that the fault should be laid at the door of the Minister or his Department.  There are plenty of facilities, plenty of operatives and technical assistance available to all local authorities to have their plans well ordered in advance with the result that the lack of planning is no excuse for a local authority not to employ skilled and unskilled labour at the maximum rate on local authority houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> I might refer to the social side because unless people are reasonably comfortable they will not be in a position to put into the effort to balance the national economy the work that is necessary.  On the social side, apart from housing, we have now, after something like eight months, the Social Welfare Bill providing for a comprehensive scheme.  I do not want to go into the merits or demerits of this scheme but at least within a much shorter period than the predecessor of the Minister for Social Welfare took to bring such a Bill before the House we now have it for discussion and, we hope, for implementation before another term of the Dáil will have passed.</P>
    <P>As well as that, there is the enlightened approach to another contentious subject or rather a subject which had been contentious&mdash;that is the Legal Adoption Bill.  A Legal Adoption Bill is promised and possibly will appear on the Order Paper of the Dáil in a matter of weeks.  That Bill, too, will have its contribution to make in restoring the national, economic balance.  Up to this, many of our young unwanted children have had to be exported because no facilities were given to Irish men and women to adopt children with any degree of certainty that they would be allowed to keep them up to the age of 21.  Records have been produced to show that hundreds of our young people, who would have been adopted by our Irish people if there had been a Legal Adoption Bill on the Statute Book, have been sent to America and other places.</P>
    <P>In time to come the Adoption Bill will have its effect in adding to our wealth of manpower.  It will also make the people, who are aggrieved and affected by the lack of such legislation, feel happy that our Government is providing for a long-felt want.</P>
    <P>I might, in passing, refer to the Vital Statistics Bill.  Among its other provisions, that Bill provides for a short form of birth certificate.  In a sense, that Bill is <i>sub judice</i> but, again, that Bill will help people who often&mdash;and I say this with a full sense of responsibility&mdash;rather than face the degradation of what their birth certificate <Col N="47" /> might show, emigrate to find work abroad.  If that Bill passes, and if it will have its desired effect, those people who now fear to produce their birth certificates will be in a position to use the short form of birth certificate and benefit by it.  They will be able to present that short form of birth certificate for any purposes for which a birth certificate would normally be required.</P>
    <P>It is true that at present there is a very high volume of unemployment. The weekly register shows a figure somewhere in the region of 70,000 unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that.  The weekly register is about the most reliable guide we have.  Nobody on the opposite side of the House attempted to discredit our Statistics Office to the extent of saying that that figure was not accurate or that it was in some degree misrepresented.  The majority of those 74,000 unemployed will appreciate that there is a similar unemployment trend all over the world.  We read in to-day's papers that the Ministers of the Six County Government recently went to Westminster and that, in order to absorb some of the unemployed complement of the North, they succeeded in getting a promise from Westminster that some of the re-armament work would be diverted to Belfast.  In England itself, particularly in the textile and footwear industries, the unemployment figure has increased to an unprecedented degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had some experience myself in regard to a reduction in working hours in so far as it affects America. At present, the Gaeltacht Services Office are negotiating, in so far as they can, to dispose of the surplus stocks that were built up over the latter half of 1951.  They have been canvassing all over the world for markets.  One prospective buyer in America, who was in a similar line of production, recently intimated his intention of coming to this country.  However, within a very short period, his own factory in Boston went into half-production.  I may say that his factory is one of the biggest <Col N="48" /> textile factories in Boston.  Unfortunately for the Gaeltacht Services Office, that man's factory at present works only three days a week.  For that reason there was little chance of inviting that gentleman to Ireland in the hope of successfully negotiating for the sale of any reasonable quantity of Gaeltarra Éireann goods.</P>
    <P>At this point I might say that there is a certain amount of short time in operation in the Gaeltacht Services. That short time was experienced only recently and the decision was taken only after Christmas.  During the latter half of 1951, when most other textile industries were forced to put their workers on half or quarter time or even to dismiss them temporarily, the Gaeltacht Services endeavoured to keep their workers on full production and thus carry out their primary function of providing employment in Gaeltacht areas.  Naturally, their stocks were mounting at a time when other industrial concerns either had to come to a full stop or to go on short time. At the end of last year, Gaeltarra Éireann held stocks to the value of something just under £100,000.  Having regard to the general world recession in trade, there was little likelihood that, at that rate of production, their stocks could soon be disposed of.  That was the reason why the decision had to be taken to put the workers on halftime.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would like to make a suggestion now, or in the course of his own speech, I should be glad to hear it.  It is obvious that there is no point in trying to suggest that we should keep these workers on fulltime merely to keep them continuously employed when, finally, the taxpayer has to pay for it.  It is natural that the taxpayer throughout the country should have some sympathy with the people in the West of Ireland by reason of the conditions which prevail there.  In so far, however, as there is a Government-subsidised undertaking in the West, the taxpayer expects that the Government, and those in charge of these particular undertakings, will <Col N="49" /> endeavour to ensure that these undertakings will operate economically.</P>
      <P>I believe myself that the fact that the 74,000 registered unemployed are content to remain on that register is a good indication that they feel that this world-wide depression is bound to pass.  The fact that they are not hastening to board the emigrant ship is a good sign of their faith and their confidence in the country.</P>

      <P>May I add that the Opposition did not expect that Fianna Fáil would increase its representation in the Dáil as a result of the last election&mdash;despite the wonderful years of Utopia that we experienced during the inter-Party Government régime?  The people showed their confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government by restoring it to power.  They are showing at present that they appreciate that there is a world depression and that the Government is taking all possible steps to relieve that depression in so far as it affects this country.  The people of this country have confidence in the ability of the Government to restore employment within the country and thus help to restore and maintain <Col N="50" /> our standard of living.  The people of this country now realise that they were lulled into a sense of complacency during the term of office of the inter-Party Government.  Can anybody assert that output in every direction was as high as it ought to have been?  It is small wonder that it was not as high as it ought to have been when the people were told that everything in the garden was rosy.</P>
      <P>I am not making any point of the fact that the balance of payments was thrown so dramatically out of gear by whatever stockpiling was considered to be necessary.  Apparently that was deliberately done but nobody can deny that it must have had its effect on employment and unemployment in this country.  Before that decision was taken, the editors of the four daily newspapers were brought in and asked to treat the fact that stockpiling would have to be undertaken as discreetly as they could in order to prevent inflation. Shortly after assuming power, the inter-Party Government examined the balance of payments position which then obtained.  I might remind Deputies opposite what the then Taoiseach had to say about it.  As reported in the Dáil Debates of 5th August, 1948, Volume 112, column 2146, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the 1938 agreement was being negotiated, the adverse trade balance between this country and Great Britain was such as not to cause any anxiety or certainly very little anxiety.  In the intervening period, the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the situation, as the then Taoiseach and his Government discovered, and he, I take it, was speaking authoritatively for the Government. We are faced with a somewhat similar position now and, making all due allowance for whatever stockpiling was done in the way of forestry-wiring, tobacco and certain machinery for land drainage, the Government realised that the situation was just as bad as that which threatened when Deputy <Col N="51" /> Costello was Taoiseach.  They immediately set out to remind the people of what their duties were.  They drew a true picture of what the situation was and prepared to implement by their enactments their advice and assistance to the agricultural and industrial community, showing the way in which economic stability could be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister for Finance in introducing the Vote on Account makes it quite obvious that the Government have been talking about the present economic position, lamenting the situation which they allege was caused by the profligate economic and financial policy of the inter-Party Government, while at the same time, as the Minister's speech makes it quite obvious, they do not intend to take any effective remedial measures.  When the present Government assumed office last July, the Minister for Finance and a number of other Minister were more anxious to criticise the policies that had been operated by the previous Government than to initiate any definite economic policy of their own.  A number of speeches were made, beginning with the speech of the Minister for Finance on 18th July in which he alleged that the economic position of the country was serious.  He suggested in that speech, either directly or by innuendo, that the deterioration had been caused by the previous Government.  He asserted then that it was the intention of the Fianna Fáil Government which had just attained office&mdash;not I may remark as a result of the votes of a majority of the electorate but as a result of a somersault of certain Deputies&mdash;to take measures to rectify the economic position and said that when these measures were taken they would talk of implementing their own economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm for this House to examine what has been achieved in the short space of nine months which has since elapsed, how our economic fortunes have declined and how the economic position of the country has deteriorated in consequence of Fianna Fáil policy, resulting in a substantially <Col N="52" /> higher number of persons unemployed than was the case this time last year or in the preceding year.  There are approximately 10,000 more persons unemployed this year than there were on the unemployment register this time last year.  The measures which the Government have adopted, the plans which they have on a number of occasions said they were implementing, the policy which has been described as a coherent economic policy which has the backing of a coherent united Government, have succeeded in nine months only in increasing the numbers on the unemployment register to a figure of 10,000 more than was the case this time last year.  We have been told that they have a coherent plan for housing, that whatever changes have been adopted in the method of financing are only changes in method and that the same amount of money is still available.  It is no harm for Deputies to reflect on the figures given yesterday by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a parliamentary question.  These figures show that the rate of housing in progress by local authorities in 1951 had not been maintained in January, 1952, and that there were fewer houses being built by local authorities in January this year than was the case in January of last year. Worst of all is the fact that the biggest decline in house construction has taken place in the City of Dublin.  These are two examples of the result of the policy operated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the record which Deputy Lemass, now Tánaiste, stated had been achieved by the inter-Party Government of having the highest cost-of-living figure in the history of any country in Europe has been broken and surpassed by the Fianna Fáil Government in nine months.  The fact is that during the greater part of the three-year period of office of the inter-Party Government, the cost of living was kept stable and only towards the close of that period was there any rise.  It is no harm for the House to know that the rise which occurred in this country in that period of three years was lower than that of any country in Europe with the exception of two.  It was <Col N="53" /> lower than that represented in the cost of living in Britain, where they had a policy of heavy subsidisation of foodstuffs and controls of all kinds and where they had at that time an all-time record for full employment.  It is satisfactory to reflect that during the short period of the administration of the inter-Party Government, it was possible to keep the cost of living stable for the most of the period, while at the same time we had the highest number of persons in insurable employment in the history of the country.</P>
    <P>When this Vote on Account was introduced the Minister for Finance, interspersing his remarks with a whole variety of accusations and allegations against the inter-Party Government, announced one or two steps which it was proposed to take to remedy the balance of payments problem.  I think it right to say that the present Opposition never denied that there was a balance of payments problem.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government showed by his quotation of a few moments ago, the then Taoiseach adverted on more than one occasion to the disequilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>It was announced in a number of speeches that it was the Government's policy to correct, as far as possible, that disequilibrium, but that it was inevitable, when the repatriation of assets took place in order to finance a capital development programme, there would be a temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  This Government, if the speech the Minister for Finance made last July and if a number of speeches which have been made since are to be accepted as Government policy, had a plan to correct that disequilibrium.</P>
    <P>We were led to believe from the announcement made in the British House of Commons by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Minister for Finance would make a statement here outlining what were the steps to be taken.  He mentioned two measures during the course of his introductory speech.  One was that it was proposed to reduce the foreign travel allowance from £50 per person to £25.  Now, in that connection it is <Col N="54" /> reasonable to ask what is the estimated annual saving which will accrue from that reduction, and also why was the decision announced in the way in which it was announced.  Shortly after the decision was taken in Britain, the <i>Independent</i> newspaper announced that it was proposed to effect a similar reduction here.  There was a speedy denial of that from the Government Information Bureau, but, in the short space of a few weeks, the Minister for Finance announced that we were falling into line with the British decision. It is reasonable to ask why was confusion created by the delay if that decision was going to be taken.  Why was it not announced?  It is reasonable to inquire what is the estimated annual saving that is expected to accrue?</P>
    <P>That is the first remedial measure, but anyone who has any knowledge of the balance of payments problem will recognise that that step will achieve nothing.  It is only a gesture and nothing more.  It is probably fair that if travellers in Britain, who are more seriously affected by the dislocation in the balance of payments, should be obliged to forego the allowance which was available until recently we who are much better circumstanced, should also forego it.  At the same time it is only right to inquire what is the estimated annual saving that will be achieved by that decision.</P>
    <P>The other announcement was that it was proposed to achieve a reduction in imports from the dollar area, and a figure was announced for the first six months of this year.  But, while the Minister announced that figure, he did not state what imports were going to be restricted, what commodities were going to be affected or the results that a reduction in imports would have on employment or what information was going to be given to importers and exporters so that they might plan ahead on the knowledge that dollars would or would not be available for particular commodities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, accompanied by the Tánaiste, recently attended talks in London with British Ministers.  When the Ministers returned a vague statement was published.  Since then <Col N="55" /> Deputies have sought in vain to secure information on the results of these talks, to try and ascertain what measures the Government propose to take and what measures they intend to adopt other than the cut in the travel allowance and other than the restriction on imports from the dollar area for six months of this year.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, proper for the House and for the country to recognise that, while there are comparable circumstances in respect of the balance of payments between the disequilibrium here and the disequilibrium in Britain, they are only valid comparisons in certain respects, and that the situation here is vastly different.  In Britain they have fought two world wars.  The second world war absorbed their available financial and other resources, and not merely absorbed all their resources but that all the reserves which were available had to be brought into use. Such a condition of affairs did not exist here, so that the crisis speeches and the pessimistic atmosphere created have only caused disturbance and dislocation and a sense of frustration without any effective remedial measures.</P>
    <P>We have had&mdash;it has been the policy of successive Governments over the years&mdash;appeals for greater production, but appeals are useless unless indications are given as to how that increased production may be achieved and, when it is achieved, what markets will be available for the goods produced. The suggestions which have been made, and the appeals which in some cases have been accompanied by veiled indications that if increased production is not forthcoming there will be or there may be a necessity for the introduction of other measures, all tend to create panic and confusion, and fail to provide that enlightened leadership, that enlightened guidance and that directive in Government policy which is essential if the farmers and other sections of the community are to succeed in achieving the production necessary to correct the disequilibrium that has occurred in the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> Now, it is only right to remember that, while the situation last year was bad as far as the balance of payments position is concerned, it was due, in the main, to a Government direction which had the backing of all sections in the Dáil.  In fact, it was if anything sustained by vociferous clamouring from the Fianna Fáil Benches at the time that stockpiling would inevitably create disequilibrium because there was a world drive to secure supplies, a drive to rearm which accompanied the outbreak of the Korean War in the middle of 1950.  That stimulated the efforts of all countries to acquire goods, and, at the same time, in the main the same type of goods.  Taking all that together it resulted, in the closing months of 1950, in large imports. These imports at a high rate continued right through the greater part of 1951.</P>
    <P>When this year dawned we heard and read of the various steps which the present Government contemplated taking.  We read the speeches which had been made creating panic, confusion and a crisis, the magnitude of which it was impossible to portray in sufficiently gloomy terms.  But when these speeches and the measures that we expected would have been put into operation are examined and where it was anticipated that these measures would be taking effect this year, we find that the imports for the first two months show very little diminution.  It is it true that in January of this year the excess of imports over exports was down by £1,000,000 on January, 1951, but with the stockpiling which I have mentioned it was only to be expected that there would be a reduction.  In relation to last month, February, there was practically no difference between the import excess in February, 1952, and the import excess in February, 1951.</P>

      <P>The Deputy probably does not remember that in 1947, which was one of the worst years of disequilibrium, the then Government imported £2,000,000 worth of chocolate and jam manufactured in Holland and elsewhere <Col N="57" /> although both of these were commodities that could have been and were manufactured here.  Capital goods!</P>
      <P>The position is that there has been no real effort made by the Government to correct the balance of payments problem.  There has been a series of speeches endeavouring to throw the blame on the previous Government. That was all right in the first few months and it was probably good politics in the first few months because it was reasonable enough then to assert that the situation had been caused by the action, or inaction, of the previous Government.  But the Government has now been nine months in office and they have had ample time to employ their own remedies and to implement their own policy.</P>
      <P>What has been the result?  They have reduced the rate of house-building in progress during the inter-Party Government period of office.  They have a higher number of unemployed on the unemployment register, approximately 10,000 more persons unemployed than was the case this time last year.  They have achieved an all-time high in the cost of living.  It is admitted that some of these increases were outside their control.  Nobody expects this Government, any more than any other Government, to avoid the external influences which affect the economy of any country but in the case of some essential commodities, such as butter, milk and eggs the increases that have taken place are the direct consequence of Government action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are familiar with the policy adumbrated over the years during the inter-Party Government period of office.  The Fianna Fáil Party were opposed in the first place to the dual-price system.  They were opposed to the two prices for tea, for sugar, for butter and for white flour.  When they came into office it was anticipated that they would put an end to the dual-price system and shortly after coming into office they were queried as to their policy in that respect.  The present Tánaiste said in reply that they found the system in operation and that they did not like it but it was there.  That <Col N="58" /> was quite a plausible answer in the first few weeks, or first few months, but when the Government introduces the Estimates this year, Estimates prepared by themselves and substantially higher than those presented by their predecessors, although a reduction is shown in respect of some essential capital works, we find they have not abandoned the dual-price system.</P>
    <P>Does the present Government now favour that system?  If they do not favour it why have they not abandoned it?  If they do not favour the dual-price system for tea, for sugar, for butter and for white flour why have they not abandoned it?  Since they have not abandoned it why do they not now admit that they are operating it because it is the correct policy?  If they intend to abandon it why do they not take that decision and honestly admit that it should be abandoned? Remember, that they described this system as the &ldquo;grey market&rdquo; when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>The position is that the Government have taken no effective measures to provide a sound economic policy. Ministers vie with each other in making speeches all over the country. Ministers not merely of the Departments concerned but of other Departments have gone forth explaining the economic position, explaining the crisis which the country is facing, each Minister vying with the other in his gloomy prophecies of disaster round the corner, the decay that is imminent and the stern measures that must be taken to stave off annihilation.  We have had one speech after the other emphasising the stringent steps that will be required if the position does not improve.</P>
    <P>That type of approach was all right in the first few months but the Government now has the responsibility of implementing their own economic policy and of taking effective measures to deal with the situation. However difficult the situation may be, and nobody pretends for a moment that it is not difficult and nobody pretends that there is not a balance of payments problem, everybody on this side of the House is prepared to support effective and sound economic measures to correct the position.  We <Col N="59" /> do, however, object to the Crippsian austerity announcements that have been made by Ministers resulting in panic, dislocation and unemployment and in financial loss at a time when these speeches were not accompanied by effective action.</P>
    <P>We have had during the course of this debate, as in other debates, references to the restriction of banking credit.  Figures have been quoted to show that bank advances are up this year and at the end of last year as is illustrated by the quarterly returns. It is quite true that the bank advances are up.  It is equally true that the banks have notified their customers that they must reduce their overdrafts. The result is that, the banks having advanced credit liberally since the end of the war in 1945 sometimes on what might be considered inadequate security to persons operating building societies, forming themselves into companies of one sort or another and traders in general, these people in recent months have been obliged to liquidate stocks where that was possible, or take whatever other measures were available to them, in order to reduce their overdrafts.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a good thing that there should be criticism of the banking system because it tends to dislocate trade and cause uneasiness.  If there has to be criticism now it is only fair to say that the banks have brought it on themselves.  They had the aftermath of the first World War as a guide. It will be recollected that at the end of that war and in the years immediately succeeding it there was considerable prosperity.  The banks advanced money freely especially to farmers.  The advances made in respect of land were considerable.  In the early part of the 1920s there was a sudden closing down, a reduction in overdrafts and a calling in of the money that had been advanced.  The result was that a great many farmers and business people were put into adverse economic circumstances from which they have never been able to extricate themselves.</P>
    <P>It is true that at the end of the last war money was not advanced as <Col N="60" /> liberally in respect of lands, but money was advanced to builders, traders, business men and commercial concerns, advanced, as I said, in some cases to an excessive extent in the light of experience that had been gained after the first world war.  That was all right until the banks notified their customers that they expected them to reduce their overdrafts.  The result has been that a number of persons have been put into financial difficulties, a number of productive works which were in the course of implementation have been delayed and hampered and some of them completely held up.</P>
    <P>I know of the case of one group of persons who were anxious to avail of the Government housing grant and formed themselves into a company in order to comply with certain statutory requirements.  They secured a site, carried out the necessary preparatory development work and applied to a bank for an overdraft on the security of machinery and whatever finances were available.  An overdraft of £11,000 was sanctioned.  Houses were built and the scheme progressed.  Subsequently they asked for additional financial accommodation and they were granted accommodation up to £13,000. The work proceeded and some houses were finished.  The interest on the amount that had been advanced was paid regularly in accordance with the terms of arrangement with the bank. Subsequently the overdraft was increased to £23,000.  The work progressed and further houses were built. Some of them were sold and arrangements were made to sell others as they were constructed.  Then, in the early part of this year, the bank informed the company that they would have to reduce their overdraft and would have to take action immediately or the bank would foreclose on the mortgages.</P>
    <P>It was wrong for the bank in that case to advance money if it was not prepared to allow the scheme to be completed.  That kind of hasty, panicky action creates confusion, causes considerable economic losses, results in unemployment and generally creates a sense of frustration in the <Col N="61" /> community.  The example I have given I know could be multiplied by other Deputies.  That is the sort of situation which has resulted because of the panicky speeches made by Ministers since the advent of this Government last June.  I do not pretend for a moment that there is not a problem there.  The problem should be and must be solved.  But making panicky speeches, creating an atmosphere of crisis without implementing any effective measures only causes more harm rather than achieving results by taking the steps which Deputies of all Parties recognise should be and must be taken if our economic position is to be improved.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to provide leadership, drive and initiative. They appear to be appalled by the economic problem to such an extent that, instead of effective leadership, initiative and a courageous facing up to the future, whatever it may hold, we have had a whole series of pessimistic speeches by one Minister after another and a deeper atmosphere of gloom and uncertainty added to whatever gloom and uncertainty we had in connection with the existing economic situation not only in this country but in Europe.  That is the type of problem which has been magnified because of lack of leadership on the part of the Government, because of inability to provide a sound, coherent policy.  The whole anxiety of the Government has been to try to discredit the results achieved by their predecessors.</P>
    <P>The Marshall Aid programme has been criticised during the course of this debate.  Ministers have made a number of speeches asserting that the money was misused, that it was wasted and squandered.  They omitted, however, to tell the House and the country that more of the Marshall Aid money was spent during the last nine months by the Fianna Fáil Government than was spent during the whole of the previous two and a half years since Marshall Aid money was first made available.  They have not told us what was the alternative.  They have not told us where our programme was wrong.  Was it wrong to drain the land; was it wrong to spend money on land <Col N="62" /> reclamation; was it wrong to build houses; was it wrong to construct hospitals; was it wrong to provide employment for the greatest number of persons ever employed in the history of the country?  Was it wise to use that money for the purposes for which the American E.C.A. announced it was to be used?  Is it not a far better test of the way in which that money was utilised to reflect on the words of an impartial expert, Mr. Foster, then E.C.A. administrator, who, in May, 1951, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The suspension of E.C.A.A. is the best possible recognition of the strides the Irish people have taken towards economic self-sufficiency under the impetus of the Marshall Plan.  With the dollars and technical assistance provided through E.C.A.A. to help, Ireland has accomplished agricultural and other economic reforms in three years that otherwise would have taken a generation to achieve.  The economic recovery of Ireland and the sterling area as a whole has progressed to a point where Ireland no longer needs outside dollar assistance to maintain a healthy economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Foster is not a member of any of the political Parties which made up the inter-Party Government.  He can be accepted as an impartial expert on the results that have been achieved. He did not make the announcement because he was in any way associated with any of the political Parties.  In fact, his term of office expired shortly afterwards.  As he had no interest in making an announcement of that sort, it is reasonable for the House and the country to accept the impartial and independent verdict of an expert administering the generous aid provided under the E.C.A. rather than that of the pundits who have in recent months held themselves out as experts on the economic position of the country.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, it is pertinent to inquire from the Minister if any discussions have taken place as result of the enactment of the Mutual Security Act.  If so, what are the proposals which have been advanced by the Government <Col N="63" /> for the utilisation of the Marshall Aid moneys in the Grant Counterpart Fund and when is it expected that it will be possible to get a decision so that the work which was in progress may be maintained?</P>
    <P>In yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> there was a report of a statement by an American admiral that it was expected that some help or assistance would be forthcoming from Ireland in the future. I believe it is right that any doubts or confusion created by an announcement of that sort should be quickly corrected and the Government would do well to consider making a statement which will clarify the position.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government mention the list of Fianna Fáil proposals since they assumed office in June.  The list was very interesting.  We from this section of the House welcome the introduction of the Tourist Traffic Bill, as we did the Undeveloped Areas Bill and to a limited extent the other measures which he mentioned.  Whilst those proposals in themselves are interesting and undoubtedly will do some good to the country, they will not counterbalance the harm that has been done by the leaders of the Government since June last.  A period of nine months is a short time in which to judge a new Government, but one could not describe the members of the Front Bench of the present Government as being newcomers to office. They were out of office for a period of a little over three years, but if we are to take seriously their speeches during the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government and during the last general election campaign, it would have been reasonable to assume that we would not find the country now in the bad state in which it undoubtedly is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil supporters and even Fianna Fáil Deputies will admit that things did not go as they expected when they asked for the support of the electorate and are not going as they would like them to go.  For that Fianna Fáil have themselves to blame. <Col N="64" /> The achievement of the inter-Party Government, the record of each of their Ministers was such that it was the envy of Fianna Fáil; and during the election campaign and for their first few months in office Fianna Fáil went out of their way to try to represent to the people that the late Government had left the country in a very bad state.  But they went slightly too far, because with their hysterical speeches, their speeches of gloom and disaster, they killed the initiative of the people and they have been responsible for the abnormal increase in the unemployed over the last eight or nine months.</P>
    <P>Measures like the Tourist Traffic Bill and the Undeveloped Areas Bill are good in themselves, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government has said, but they are going to cost the taxpayers money and they will not counter-balance the harm that has been done.  Undoubtedly as a result of the speeches we have had from the Taoiseach, from the Tánaiste and from Ministers, the key word in business and industry at present is &ldquo;caution.&rdquo; Credit is undoubtedly restricted, as any bank manager will tell any individual Deputy if he cares to ask.  By different methods every Department of State, and in particular to my knowledge the Department of Local Government, has cut down expenditure as far as it can.  I do not think anyone would agree that expenditure should be cut down in the Department of Local Government and more especially in regard to housing.  Might I refer now to a recent allegation of a member of the Fianna Fáil Party that an action of the late Minister has been responsible for the slowing down of housing in the City of Dublin?  No matter what one has to say about the late Minister for Local Government, or his predecessor, the late T.J. Murphy, this will have to be admitted, that as far as red tape and officialdom are concerned the late T.J. Murphy and the present Deputy Keyes did more to expedite house building than any other Minister of State in this country since 1922.  So much did they cut red tape and officialdom that we had screeching complaints from the present Minister for Finance&mdash;Deputy MacEntee, as he <Col N="65" /> was then&mdash;and from Deputy Childers and Deputy Briscoe, who are now complaining that the action of the last Government is responsible for the slowing down of housing in the City of Dublin.  It is extraordinary that the allegation is that Deputy Keyes did this two years ago when he was Minister and yet Deputy Briscoe only sees fit to mention it in the last week or two.</P>
    <P>Not only in respect of Dublin is there a slowing down in housing but all over the country, and I can talk of my own constituency as well.  It is not that the Minister or the Government have said they are going to cut down the amount of money but by other methods, such as by slowing up decisions and by foolish queries, they are delaying the making of plans and the general progress towards building of houses in the rural and provincial town areas.  No member of the Fianna Fáil Party would stand behind a hidden policy like that because it is an effort at economy.  In my constituency there is a definite slow down, as in Dublin. I do not think that should be encouraged.  It is up to each and every one of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to insist that the Minister give the same freedom of planning and the same general freedom as was given during the three years of the inter-Party régime.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there has been an allegation that the last Minister cut down the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act very substantially. That is a fact.  I can tell why that was done and anybody in a turf county knows the reason.  During the year 1949-50 we had difficulty in the Department in getting some counties to spend the money that was allocated to them.  In some cases there were returns and for the year 1950-51 when a turf drive was again organised, the county councils were exhorted to produce two years' turf for their own requirements.  It was felt and agreed then by local officials that they would not be able to spend in the turf counties the normal allocation under the Works Act.  But&mdash;and there is this very important &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;there was a <Col N="66" /> definite understanding last year between the Department and the Department of Finance that if more money was required for the Works Act schemes it would be forthcoming.  If the Minister for Local Government or any other Minister who is concerned about that particular question takes the pains to inquire from the officials of the Department of Local Government, he will find that what I say is true.</P>
    <P>To indicate the desire of the former Minister for Local Government to keep as high a level of employment as he could in the rural areas, may I quote these two examples: For the last two years of the inter-Party Government, when the Counties of Laois, Meath and Wexford found that they had a problem in regard to rural unemployment or when it was visualised that there would be such a problem towards the end of the financial year, and where there were schemes to be executed, money was forthcoming and as much money as these counties asked for was given every time.  I think Deputy O'Reilly will bear me out in respect of County Meath and I think Deputy Davin can say the same as far as Laois is concerned.  Where it meant employment in the rural areas on the important work of drainage, as far as the last Government was concerned, money was no bar.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this particular debate seems to be on stockpiling.  Anybody in the gallery listening to the debate would not know whether Fianna Fáil were for or against stockpiling or whether the members on this side of the House were for or against stockpiling.  I see a lot of snags as far as stockpiling is concerned.  It was admitted last night by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that stockpiling had been done by the last Government.  He tried to infer that stockpiling has been responsible for a lot of the unemployment in the country at the present time.  I will not argue in detail as to whether that is a fact or not but I would like the present Government to have some official control over stockpiling because the stocks that have been piled in the last 12 or 24 months have never been regarded as stockpiling proper.  My idea is that if there is to be stockpiling, <Col N="67" /> whether of clothing, footwear, the raw materials for foundries, or whatever it may be, the stocks should be kept for a period of emergency.</P>
    <P>The position at the present time, as far as I know, is that goods which have been imported for the ostensible purpose of stockpiling are being issued and are being sold.  I think the Government should take steps to see that if goods are imported for the purpose of stockpiling they will be kept aside for a period of emergency when such goods might be in short supply.</P>
    <P>In order to explain away the unemployment figures the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government said that there has been mass importation of various types of goods which it was unnecessary to import and which we could have done without.  I do not want to take sides one way or the other in these arguments about stockpiling. As far as the town of Wexford is concerned, the present Government, by allowing the importation of foreign materials, have been responsible for unemployment.  During the period of office of the inter-Party Government £1,000 worth of springs for motor-cars were allowed in every six months. The Fianna Fáil Government allow £10,000 worth of goods to be imported every six months.  That has caused unemployment in the spring-making industry in Wexford.  If Fianna Fáil accuse the last Government of causing unemployment by stockpiling I suggest that they are every bit as guilty in many respects of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>There is a controversy as to whether or not there is a crisis in the country. We hear from the leaders of the Government that there is a crisis and that the inter-Party Government has been responsible for it.  On the other hand we get a speech from Deputy Costello to the effect that this is one of the best-off countries in the world. I am inclined to agree with Deputy Costello that this is one of the best, or has been one of the best, and one of the happiest countries in the world.</P>
    <P>The present Government got the country in a state where the people had a strong sense of security.  The <Col N="68" /> Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lynch, preferred to describe that as complacency.  I would call it security. Undoubtedly there was security of employment in rural areas.  There was security of employment in industry. We cannot say that there is the same degree of security now.  There is certainly no security of employment in the rural areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that people are not emigrating. They are emigrating from Wexford. They are emigrating from Wexford town.  I know that they are emigrating from other counties.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks it is any consolation to us to know that there is a depression in the Six Counties, he is making a very big mistake. There is no use in my going to the unemployed in Wexford or Deputy Cowan going to the unemployed in County Dublin telling them they are not too badly off; that there are 40,000 unemployed in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Every time Fianna Fáil want to defend a certain line of action or policy they try to represent to the country that they are up against it.  Their excuse for lack of progress from 1932 to the beginning of the second World War was the economic war.  Then they had the emergency from 1939 to 1945. They could not make any progress and we were all supposed to pile in and give them our co-operation and support. From 1945 to 1948 was a difficult period.  Fianna Fáil could not make much progress, so they said.  But, from 1948 to 1951 was the time, according to Deputy Childers and Deputy Lemass, that this country had the best opportunity that ever presented itself to put industry and agriculture on their feet.  Fianna Fáil came back to power in June, 1951, and they are up against it; there is a world depression; there is a shortage of raw materials; there is a shortage of feeding stuffs and we are supposed to pile in again, not to criticise unduly but to give all the co-operation we can.</P>
    <P>Despite the picture that has been painted by the various Ministers, despite the boast of the Minister for Finance that the deficit in the Budget will be £50,000,000, I do not believe that we are going to have a bad <Col N="69" /> Budget.  I believe it is a scare made up by Fianna Fáil.  I believe this whole talk of a crisis is one of the greatest frauds that have ever been attempted or perpetrated on the public because, presto, on the 2nd or 3rd April, we are not going to get such a bad Budget, and probably it will be announced to us by the Minister for Finance that Fianna Fáil once again has come to the rescue of the country.</P>

      <P>The people do not believe that the security of this country was undermined by the inter-Party Government.  There was a feeling of security during that time, and people were beginning to spend. Above all, people were beginning to invest.  Now we are exhorted to pay as we go.  I do not believe in it.  I believe in borrowing for capital expenditure. I do not believe that the people of 1952 should be saddled with expenditure on items that will be of benefit to coming generations.  I do not think that I should be expected to pay for the trees that will be planted in State forests and which will mature in 25 years' time.  I believe that should be financed by borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the development of our harbours, the building of houses, hospitals, schools, roads and many other items of capital development should be paid for by borrowing.  We have the security of this country on which to borrow.  We have the security of the goodwill of the men and women in this country and, above all, we have the security of the richness of our agricultural industry.  Very few countries in the world have such strong items of security as we have. If we pay as we go we will still need 100,000 houses; we will still need schools; we will never have afforestation developed in this country and we will still be scrambling.  Nobody can say we have made the progress we should have made since the State was founded, so to speak, in 1922, when the Provisional Government was set up. We have not made enough strides, and one of the reasons for this is that the political life of this country has been born out of the bitterness of the civil <Col N="70" /> war.  I do not want to introduce the question of the civil war.  Neither have I anything to say to any man who took this or that side.  Without meaning any offence to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal as they were called in the beginning&mdash; let me say this: The members of the Fianna Fáil Party have joined their Party because they were anti-Treaty, and those in the Fine Gael Party find themselves in their Party because they were pro-Treaty.  Fianna Fáil was founded not on a policy.  Their establishment was based on no particular policy, but only on the fact that they were on one side when there was a civil war in progress in this country.</P>

      <P>Possibly it would be a good thing if every Deputy in this House was told to stand on the floor of the Chamber and say: &ldquo;Pick your Party&rdquo;&mdash;let it be Conservative, Labour or Liberal.  I feel if we did so that some new faces would appear in the Labour Party both from the Fianna Fáil Party and from the Fine Gael Party.  I could mention the names of a few in both Parties who have the Labour outlook.  However, they are bound by tradition and bound by their own particular history to stand by a particular Party.  I maintain that until we can get Parties with definitely defined policies very little progress will be made.  I would prefer to describe some of the Front Bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party at the present time as very, very good candidates for the Tory Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I wonder what did the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party think of the speech made by the Minister for Finance and about the speech delivered here last night by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  His complaint was that we were too wealthy.  His was an attack by inference on the mass of the workers of this country.  He told us last night that 5/6d. out of every £ earned in this country was spent on drink, tobacco and amusements.  He tried to give us the impression that the agricultural labourer spends 5/6d. out of every £ he earns on drink and on amusement and that the old age pensioner who received £1 per week had only 14/6d. to spend on food and clothing.  Probably he is perfectly right in saying that 5/6d. out of every £ is the average amount spent on drink and amusement in this country. However, that is not the practice of my constituents or of the people who support me.  Those who frequent the big hotels, cocktail bars, dinners or banquets, may spend 5/6d. out of every £ on drink and on amusement. This amount is not spent in the public-houses of my constituency.  If the average is as high as 5/6d., I suggest that it is not contributed by the manual workers, or those people with incomes below £10 per week.  I suggest it is the aristocratic spiv who frequents the big hotels, the cocktail bars, parties, dinners and banquets who spends this amount.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that a quarter of the week's wages of the workers in this country was contributed towards the cost of the Government. Take a quarter of the £3 7s. 6d. earned by the agricultural worker in my constituency and contribute it towards taxation and one will see what he has got left for himself.  We were told that the way to drag this country out of the crisis which Fianna Fáil say has come upon us is by producing more.  When that admonition is made it is taken by most people as being directed towards the manual worker.  Every time the Minister for <Col N="72" /> Finance, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste say: &ldquo;Produce more&rdquo; everybody immediately thinks of the agricultural labourer or the person who works with his hands.  Some people say: &ldquo;The road worker should work harder.&rdquo;  The ratepayer says: &ldquo;Is not this a scandalous amount of money to be spending on the roads?  Why should I pay rates to keep that particular lazy blackguard in employment?&rdquo;  I, myself, think that the road worker should work harder, but I also feel that these admonitions should not be directed to any particular section of the community.  I feel that civil servants, local government officials, the Minister, university professors, and newspaper men should work harder.  Every single person in the State should work harder.</P>

      <P>If we are going to ask for bigger and better production, let us give encouragement and let us give some incentive.  I said here some time ago that, whilst I did not believe that agriculture was at its peak in this country, it was not proper to say that the standard of living of the farmers in this country, compared to their standard of living in 1939, had increased something like 60 per cent. as against the increase in the standard of living of the agricultural labourer of 25 per cent.  If the agricultural labourer is to work harder, he has got to have incentives, and the incentives we have suggested are these: his weekly half-holiday, his week's holiday and better wages. Every time we talk about those, every single person in Dáil Éireann, whether he be a farmer or businessman, says: &ldquo;I am in favour, but how?&rdquo;  Looking at the figures I have just quoted, I suggest it could be done to some extent.  The farmers in part of my constituency, and in other counties, are growling and grumbling because they cannot get labour.  If the Government has to subsidise the farmer so that he may be able to give the agricultural labourer a proper wage, let it be done, <Col N="73" /> if that is the only solution.  If we want to keep him on the land, let us do so by giving him good wages and by offering him good conditions.  In my opinion, the farmer was treated very well for the three years while Deputy Dillon was in office, and he is doing pretty well under the present Minister's administration.  Of course, the present Minister for Agriculture is going a little further than he ever intended going by trying to outdo Deputy Dillon, but, in any case, that is good for the farmer and for the country.  It does not make much difference to me.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by saying this again.  Fianna Fáil have been responsible for the abnormal increase in the unemployment figures.  There are 73,000 or 74,000 on the unemployed register at the present time.  I would rather imagine that was an abnormal figure for the winter period but now we are coming into the month of April and we still have a gap of 12,000 or 13,000 compared to this time last year. There has been a decrease in Local Authorities (Works) Act moneys.  In my county there has been an increase in road grants but the decrease in money for drainage schemes cuts down the total figure by about £5,000.  It seems to me, therefore, there is going to be a slightly bigger increase in unemployment as far as my constituency is concerned.  Figures were read out for Cork to-day and they showed that, compared with this time last year, there are 700 more unemployed in Cork City.  I rather imagine that Deputy McGrath is concerned about that, as is Deputy Hickey, and the question Deputy Hickey and Deputy McGrath ask themselves is: what is the Government going to do about it? The Tourist Bill will not put them into employment; the Undeveloped Areas Bill will not give employment in my constituency, in Cork or in Dublin. Therefore I, like other Deputies, want to know, and expect to hear, from the Minister how he proposes to bring that figure of 75,000 down to some reasonable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, let me say that this crisis has been artificially created by Fianna Fáil so that when the 2nd April comes and the Budget is presented, we will <Col N="74" /> find Deputy MacEntee will proclaim for the Fianna Fáil Party and for his leader, Deputy de Valera, that Fianna Fáil have once again come to the rescue.</P>

      <P>This debate, like the debate on the motion of no confidence proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in the last session, has largely been concerned with the economic position of the country and I do not propose to follow in any great detail into much that has been said in that connection.  It is, I think, perfectly clear now to the thinking people of the country that, when the Government changed last June, the position of the country appeared to be a sound one.  There was then, or as near to it as we have ever been in this country, a condition of full employment.  There was good employment of a long-term nature, <Col N="77" /> good and rising wages available to our working people, confidence in industry and booming and expanding markets not merely here at home but abroad. In agriculture, there was a condition of prosperity which had not been experienced for many years back and up to June of last year all the signs of prosperity abounded in this country. It was in that situation and completely contrary to the expectations and desires of our people that the present Government found itself in office.</P>
      <P>Having found itself in office in June of last year, as a result of a defeat in the general election, the present Government started a particularly tragic campaign.  They endeavoured to combat the facts of the situation, the fact that the country appeared to be prosperous and the people contented, by looking around to discover some weakness in the financial policy and programme followed by the inter-Party Government.  If the finances of the country were weak, if they were unsound, the present Government saw in that weakness and unsoundness some method by which they could discredit the financial programme and policy followed by that Government. As a result of that particular desire on the part of members of the Government, we have had this tragic compaign conducted for the past nine months&mdash;it was initiated by the Minister for Finance last June&mdash;week after week and month after month, with one design behind it, to discredit, if at all possible, the steps taken by the former Government and the policy which it pursued.</P>
      <P>That policy made phrases such as &ldquo;Frittering away our external assets,&rdquo;&ldquo;Living beyond our means,&rdquo;&ldquo;The critical situation which the country faces&rdquo; and &ldquo;The dark clouds of inflation&rdquo; familiar to the people of the country.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently a very important announcement appeared in the newspapers, an announcement which was of very great significance to fishermen throughout Europe and particularly in Ireland: that after 30 years of discussion, consideration and effort on the part of Norway the International Court at The Hague had decided that that country was entitled to extend its fishery limits beyond the existing three mile boundary which had been in operation for so long.  I think&mdash;and it is felt too by fishermen all around our coasts&mdash;that the authority which is being set up under this Bill should make it one of its principal objectives to win for this country a right similar to that which has been achieved by Norway; in other words, that our fishing limits should be extended by law and recognised internationally up to at least ten miles as is about to be the case in Norway and possibly in other countries.  That principle has been established by the appropriate international authority.  It has this significance for our people: we have been reading over the years of the poaching of our fishing grounds by foreign trawlers and anybody who has journeyed around some of our southern fishing ports such as Bantry and Valentia in Cork and Kerry and who has spoken there with the inshore fishermen is aware of their complaints that these Spanish trawlers which regularly find shelter in these ports have, because of the nature of their operations, been doing a good deal of damage to the fishing grounds off our southern and south-west coasts.  One of the principal reasons for that damage has been the fact that our fishing limits are confined to three miles and that boats which fish slightly outside that limit cannot be interfered with. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether any steps have been taken by the Government to improve the position in that regard; whether any representations have been made to The Hague on behalf of this country to extend our fishery limits because not alone is it a matter of concern to our fishermen but, as will be seen by every Deputy in this House and by most people in the country, also a matter of considerable importance from the <Col N="79" /> point of view of the extension of our national sovereignty, the extension, if you like, of our territory.</P>
      <P>This board, which is proposed to be set up under the Bill, is an organisation with regard to which we should like to have some information.  First of all, is it proposed that the chairman of the board should be, as heretofore, a civil servant?  I do not think that the board should be so constituted.  By reason of their background and occupation civil servants are not adequately equipped from the point of view of outlook for the job which must be tackled: the rejuvenation of our inshore fishing industry.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and recommend very strongly that if he cast about he might possibly find even within the limits of our existing public services some more suitable type of official such as a master mariner.  It is of interest that in Britain the board which controls the fishing industry has as chairman a seaman, a rear admiral, and a man of that type is required in that post in this country, a man who knows the sea and who knows the job as it were from its beginnings to its logical ending.  I do not think that a person who has had no seafaring experience, who has not been a fisherman himself, who has not the hard practical knowledge of the industry, would be a suitable person for the chairmanship of this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I think it right that the board should be organised on as near as possible to a vocational basis.  Why should not the fishermen have the right of nomination, selection or election of their own representatives to the board? Why should not the democratic principle of election apply in this case? Surely, if any good is to be done by this Bill, it is essential that the fishermen around the coasts will have confidence in the board set up to operate its provisions.  I would commend to the Parliamentary Secretary consideration of the point of view that the various interests, at least the interests of the fishermen, would best be safeguarded by giving to them the rights <Col N="80" /> to appoint their own representatives on the board.</P>
    <P>The question of fish prices is of paramount importance.  Last week during the discussion on the Bill I heard some statements about private enterprise and its advantages.  Some Deputies seemed to decry the fact that the Bill proposes, to some extent at least, what could be described as State enterprise and seems to put its main reliance upon the State's ability to provide the wherewithal for the regeneration of this industry.  Anybody who has studied the industry knows that private enterprise has done more damage to the inshore fishermen in this country than any other single force could have done. The real trouble with the inshore men at the present time is that they are completely at the mercy of private enterprise and of certain interests whose only desire is, not that the inshore men should prosper or thrive, but to make the maximum amount of money out of the fish that is landed and pay as little as they possibly can for it to the men who go down to the sea and come back with the catch and who sometimes do not come back.  Private enterprise in this context would, in my view, if given a free hand, reduce the inshore fishing industry to an even lower and worse condition than that in which it now finds itself.  There was a good deal of wishful thinking by Deputies when they addressed their minds to this problem of fish and, as I indicated last week, I think it is just ridiculous to be talking of building up here a fishing industry comparable with that existing in Norway or countries of that kind.  I do not think that we can hope in our generation or possibly for several generations to be able to capture world markets.  For that reason, I fear that if we venture too quickly with the proposition of providing a deep sea fishing fleet we will, in the end, not do very much good, but will succeed in wiping out a great deal of our present inshore fishing fleet, not that it is very large indeed.</P>
    <P>From such information as we can obtain it appears that there are only approximately 181 boats of between 18 feet and 50 feet at present operating off our coasts.  It would seem <Col N="81" /> that, in all, the total number of vessels and boats engaged in fishing is roughly 4,000 and of that number only 710 are equipped with any kind of motor power.  Approximately 3,500 depend on oars and sails.  Roughly 10,000 people try to seek their living by fishing.  If we cannot organise the industry so as to enable these people to get a fair living and a continuous return for their efforts, what is the use in our talking about building up world markets with a deep sea fishing fleet?</P>
    <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he proposed to provide deep sea boats which would fish in distant grounds.  Yet the impression has got abroad that the biggest boat which will be provided will be an 80ft. boat.  Fishermen tell you that an 80ft. boat will not be fit to fish distant grounds.  It will be unable to travel to distant grounds to fish.  It can do an immeasurable amount of economic harm if we have a number of 80ft. boats, allegedly for use as a deep sea fleet, in competition with our inshore fleet.  We can easily see what can happen to our inshore fishermen who are inadequately equipped with smaller boats, boats of considerably less horse-power and considerably less storage space, and so on.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that we should be, first of all, concerned with looking after those who are now engaged in fishing around the coast and putting the industry into some kind of economic condition.  We should take every possible step that is necessary to achieve that end but we should take no steps whatsoever which might even remotely result in harming the men whose generations before them have depended upon this industry and upon fishing for their living.  We are faced again with the eternal question of the difference between the price that is paid to the man who risks his life fishing and the price that is asked of the Dublin housewife, the Cork or Galway housewife, or the housewife in any town or village throughout the country who buys fish.  We can lay the blame and the responsibility at the door of what is euphemistically called private enterprise, which is very often a good cover-up for highway robbery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Catches have been landed at Howth and brought to the Dublin markets, and we have seen the men who have worked hard to get this harvest paid next to nothing for their catches. Fishermen have gone into Dublin shops to buy the fish for which they were so scandalously paid, and were unable to purchase it.  Thereby hangs the tale of private enterprise.  If that problem is to be solved, it can only be solved by control of prices from the time the fish is landed at the quay until it passes over the counter.  Guaranteed and fixed prices should be and must be set down by this board, and there should be heavy penalties imposed in any case where the regulations relating to such prices are contravened.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the question of price fixing is left to the old survival of the fittest idea of competition, whoever may benefit by it there is one thing certain that the primary producer, the fisherman, will not benefit by it.  As in agriculture, the man whose sweat and blood produces the goods to keep this nation alive gets the least possible money for his efforts.  The interests that do the least simply take the goods from him, and hand them across the counter and get the highest possible penny for them.  That which applies to agriculture now applies to the fishing industry, and will continue to apply unless the Parliamentary Secretary and the board which it is proposed to set up under this Bill decide to put an end to that condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the situation which exists in relation to boats which sail from ports within the jurisdiction of the Republic, and sometimes put into Northern Ireland ports. What is the position in regard to the exclusion of our boats from Northern Ireland ports?  Why are our boats being excluded from these ports?  Anybody can go along at any time during the fishing season, when it is at its height, and have a look at Northern Ireland boats lying in Howth Harbour, where they get a céad míle fáilte, and where they are regarded as being entitled to come.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, if you look a bit closer, you might see the set-square and the compass on the wheel-houses of those <Col N="83" /> boats, but nobody minds them, because their crews are fellow-Irishmen of ours. But when our boats put into Kilkeel or some such port in the North, their crews are not allowed to land their catches.  That is something that should be taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary and by this new board. English boats, manned by Grimsby men, which happen to land their catches at Irish ports, do so without any interference, but if, by chance, a Howth or Balbriggan boat is forced to land a catch at a Scottish or English port, it has got to pay a 10 per cent. tax.  These are things which might seem trivial to some people, but they are of very considerable importance to the fishermen who carry out the job.</P>
    <P>I hope that this new board will give consideration to fishermen in respect of the amount of deposit which is being asked in connection with the purchase of new boats.  While 10 per cent. of the total amount of money required to purchase a boat may seem to be a small amount when thought of in percentages, it should be realised and remembered that fishermen find it very hard to come by sums as great as £500, £600 or £700&mdash;and sometimes they are asked to pay as high as £1,000.  In that connection it is of interest to note that a boat is lying at Killybegs and is not in commission.  Why?  It is not because no purchaser can be found for it.  It is because the man to whom it was allocated is unable to put down a sufficient deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite right.  There are other prospective purchasers who would be very anxious to get it, but the fact is that it has been allocated to somebody.  It is the system that is wrong.  If the person to whom it is allocated cannot pay for it, then it should be allocated to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The man for whom it was built must have been considered by the Sea Fisheries Association as being entitled to a boat.  I do not know who the man in question is, but my information is that a boat is lying at Killybegs and that it is not in commission. <Col N="84" /> If the reason why that boat is lying there is, as I am informed, that the man for whom it was built is unable to put down a sufficiently large deposit, surely that indicates that the whole condition of the fishing industry at present is bad and that consideration should be given, in such cases, to a reduction of the deposit that is demanded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the importation of fish should not be permitted except to supplement the requirements of the home market when our native fishermen are not able to fulfil these requirements.  There has been a lot of talk about the potentialities of the home market.  I trust that every effort will be made to exploit to the utmost limit the potentialities of the home market but I think that we should not be over-optimistic. As a nation, we are not too fond of fish&mdash;one of the reasons being, probably, that in many areas the people seldom or ever get an opportunity to consume fish.  A publicity campaign should be initiated by this board to popularise the consumption of fish by our people and steps should also be taken to ensure that the distribution of fish will be on the widest possible basis.  In that connection I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is already in existence practically a ready-made organisation for fish distribution.  We have something like 174 creamery branches and about 460 auxiliary creamery branches.  Extending, as that organisation does, into the most remote rural areas where fish is never seen, does it not occur to the Parliamentary Secretary, as it should to the new board, that arrangements should be made to avail of the cooperation of that organisation for the purpose of ensuring that fish is distributed throughout the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very anxious about, and interested in, the fishing industry, and I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is as anxious as anybody else that the industry should improve. Unless a good start is made it will not improve&mdash;and the start must be made by constituting the board which <Col N="85" /> will control the industry in a proper manner.  I have suggested how that can be done and I hope it will be done in that fashion.  I ask that the question of deep sea fishing be kept in the background until the welfare and future of our inshore fishermen is made secure beyond all question.  I am very doubtful that we can make secure the economic future of our inshore fishermen if we go too much now into the question of deep sea trawling.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Bill becomes an Act it will prove more successful than the Sea Fisheries Association proved.  I realise that a lot of good work was done by that association but, somehow or other, fishermen as a body never seemed to have confidence in it. That was an unhealthy condition and a change was needed.  I sincerely trust that this Bill will mean a change for the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the trouble of reading the Debates on the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries, which is a branch of the Department of Agriculture, for the past seven years and I have listened to, or read, the speeches made on this Bill by Deputies on both sides of the House during the past two weeks. Everything that has been said on this Bill has been said over and over again on those Estimates during the past seven years.  As a result of the speeches made over the period of the past seven years, we should now ask ourselves whether we have improved the fishing industry of this country. Undoubtedly we have fewer fishermen to-day than we had seven years ago. Less fish is being landed in this country now than seven years ago and less fish is consumed by the people of this country now than seven years ago.  I think it is time, therefore, that we carried out some stocktaking.  I do not propose to go over the ground covered by the Deputies who have already spoken.  I do not believe in repetition.  I believe that each and every one of them who spoke from either side of the House was most sincere in what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter to which we must attend is the matter of our fishing <Col N="86" /> grounds.  We must see if we are looking after the fishing grounds and protecting them as they should be protected. In my opinion we have a glorious and a golden opportunity of doing that now.  Quite recently one of the Norse countries decided to bring before the International Court of The Hague the question of its territorial waters.  As a result of the decision reached, the three-mile limit no longer applies and we may if we wish, to-morrow, following the decision of The Hague Court, extend our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>I think that is the first thing we should do&mdash;extend our territorial waters and then, having done so, protect them, but, goodness knows, if we cannot protect the three-mile limit, I do not see how we can protect a ten-mile limit.  We shall have to tackle that job seriously or else give the whole thing up altogether.  I think that to protect our territorial waters better use could be made of our naval services and our air force.  We are all agreed, I think, that our naval forces at the moment are merely engaged in what might be termed periodic man-oeuvres or visits to foreign ports, with an occasional tour of our own ports. These vessels should be used as fishery patrols and our air force should be utilised to assist them.  By doing that, you will make it expensive for foreign poachers to come within our territorial waters to snatch what should be the livelihood of our fishermen from them.  That is object No. 1.</P>
    <P>No. 2 is the training of our fishermen. We must encourage the people to go back to the old vocation of fishing.  Living as I do in a maritime county, I know that we have fewer and fewer fishermen year after year and if the present tendency continues we shall have no fishermen left in Donegal in five years' time.  I understand from Deputies from all sides of the House that the same thing applies along the western seaboard.  It does not apply so much on the eastern coast but on the western and southern seaboard, unless we improve matters, we shall have no fishermen left after the lapse of the next five years.  We must get down to the fact that it is necessary to encourage men to go back <Col N="87" /> to the old avocation of fishing and we must see that the remuneration which they receive as a result of becoming fishermen is sufficient to maintain them in comfort in their avocation.  I was rather surprised to hear my colleague, Deputy Cunningham, suggest by way of interjection that part-time fishermen should be done away with I believe that the farmer fishermen of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry and Cork are the backbone of the fishing industry in this country.  If we do away with part-time fishermen, we are going to do away with fishing on the west coast of Ireland and that would be a very serious matter indeed.</P>
    <P>One of the things which, in my opinion, has contributed to the lack of interest in fishing by part-time fishermen on the western seaboard is the fact that they are deprived of unemployment assistance during the periods in which they are not fishing.  I shall give the House an example of that. Supposing a man is engaged in herring fishing and is fortunate enough to earn £100 for a six or eight-week period of herring fishing.  He usually has to provide one or two nets which cost £15 to £17 each.  The investigating officer, when assessing that man's means, assesses that £100 as profit, which he alleges has been made, against the man's means.  He is automatically disqualified from drawing unemployment assistance on account of that £100 which he earned as a fisherman.</P>
    <P>Then take his neighbour, a migratory labourer, who goes across to Scotland for six or eight months of the year and during his period over there possibly earns £150 to £200.  He brings that money back and probably deposits it in the bank.  That is recognised as earned income and is not assessed against the means of that migratory labourer, whereas the unfortunate fisherman who remains in the country and engages in fishing salmon or herring has his earnings assessed for unemployment assistance purposes. That is to say, he is prevented from drawing this assistance, with the result that he is not encouraged to engage in fishing in the following season or, if he does, he is encouraged to refrain from <Col N="88" /> disclosing his earnings.  I have personal experience of these facts because I speak as a former chairman of a court of referees whose duty it was to assess, as fairly as we possibly could within the meaning of the Act, the means of these unfortunate fishermen. I say the first duty of the Parliamentary Secretary should be to take that matter up with the Minister for Social Welfare and, if necessary, have the Unemployment Assistance Acts amended to enable these unfortunate fishermen to draw unemployment assistance during the lacuna in the fishing industry.  If we do that we shall encourage these men and their sons to fish and possibly we may increase the number of fishermen along our coasts.</P>
    <P>The next important matter we have to consider is the distribution of our fish.  I do not mean distribution in the sense that as fish are landed they should be distributed.  There is no use in distributing all the fish to the inland towns of Ireland on the day they are landed but to develop the market for fish, we must ensure a continuity of supply.  If we want the inland towns of Ireland to take fish on a Friday we must ensure that they are going to get fish every Friday.  To achieve that, the first essential is to provide cold storage.  If we can provide adequate cold storage in this country to store sufficient fish to supply the country, say for a period of three weeks, then we can ensure continuity of supply for the entire season to the entire populace of the State. There would then be no necessity whatever to import any salt, smoked or fresh fish.  In addition to procuring storage, we must also ensure the proper distribution of fish all over the country.  Just as much as it is the duty of the Sea Fisheries Association or the new board to provide boats and gear for the fishermen, it will equally be their duty to provide frigidaire vans for the distribution of fish in the inland towns in the country.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which it is most difficult to criticise.  The objects of the Bill, in my opinion, are very good. They are, first, to ensure imporved outlets, with particular reference to the home market, for landings made by the inshore fishermen.  That is a <Col N="89" /> very good object.  We are not told how we are going to go about it, unless we adopt the methods which I have suggested.  Another object is to introduce by the establishment of a new board, a system of closer supervision and control of sea fishing operations, with greater attention to the needs of the industry at both the production and marketing ends, than had been practicable under the set-up of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, Limited.  This Bill sets up two associations. It establishes, first of all, a board and then it sets up an advisory body to advise that board.  I have no complaint whatever to make as to the constitution of that advisory body.</P>
    <P>It consists of representatives of all that is good in the fishing industry: four representatives of the sea fishermen, two representatives of the retail fish trade and two representatives of the distributive fish trade.</P>
    <P>That, in my opinion, is a proper constitution of the association, but, unfortunately, we are not told what is the constitution of the board.  All we are told is that the Minister has power to set up a board which shall consist of six members, one of whom shall be chairman.  The Minister is the person who will nominate the personnel of that board.  I think it is essential that we should be told who is going to constitute the board.  Is it the representatives of the fishermen, representatives of the retail trade and representatives of the distributive fish trade? What I have to say now about the present Sea Fisheries Association has nothing whatever to do with its personnel. I have been in touch with the civil servants attached to the Sea Fisheries Association and with the civil servants attached to the Department of Fisheries, and I have received nothing from them but courtesy and help.  If I attack them, I am not attacking them individually, but I believe that no matter what responsibility the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary, may take upon himself he is being ruled, and has been ruled, by what may be described as the official view of the civil servant in the Department of Fisheries or in the Irish Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> Let us put this to ourselves: why should we ask a civil servant, who has no experience whatever of fishing or of dealing in fish or of the wholesale or retail fish trade to become chairman of this board?  Is it fair to him?  I do not think it is.  He is an excellent, a first-class civil servant, a gentleman who will do what he is told to do, but why leave the initiative to him, why leave it to him to make or break himself? Surely to goodness, we are all human, we are prepared to take the line of least resistance and let things drift.  I think it is very unfair to civil servants to ask them to become members of this board.  I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary take a bold stand in this matter.  I would like to see a practical seaman appointed chairman of the board and all the branches of sea fishing represented on it.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Parliamentary Secretary advises the Minister to do that, he will be going a long way towards improving the fishing industry in this country.  We are all agreed that thousands and thousands of pounds were squandered by the old Sea Fisheries Association in building boats of 32 and 35 feet.  They are lying rotten on the coasts of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Cork, boats which were never used except for long line or herring fishing during the herring fishing season.  We all know these boats lost thousands of pounds to the old Sea Fisheries Association, and that it took the association practically 20 years to realise that a boat of 38, 55 and 60 feet is the ideal boat for our coast.  Think of the sums of public money that have been squandered in the meantime, and of all the good work that could have been done if practical fishermen and of men of experience associated with the trade, had been in charge, instead of what I may again describe as excellent civil servants, who, in my opinion, lacked initiative in so far as the direction of the Sea Fisheries Association was concerned.</P>
    <P>If we are going to encourage our fishermen to continue fishing, the first thing we must do is to subsidise the gear and the other materials used by them in fishing.  I had a case last <Col N="91" /> December of a man who purchased four nets, which cost him £16 10s., unmounted.  On his first night at sea he lost his entire train of nets.  He was a poor man.  He applied to the Sea Fisheries Association for replacement, but he could not get it, because he was not a member of the association. I question very much whether, even if he were a member, he would have got it, for the simple reason that he probably had not paid an old debt. I would like to see the nets and gear subsidised.  If that could be done, then we would be doing a lot of good for the fishermen of the country.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters arising on sections of the Bill which I propose to raise when we reach the Committee Stage.  There is, however, one matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It arises on Section 36.  Under that section, men who are going to sell fish are required to take out a licence.  Under the Auctioneers Act, which was passed, I think, in 1947, any person who becomes an auctioneer must satisfy the court as to the requirements contained in Section 32 (1) of this Bill.  To obtain an ordinary auctioneer's licence he must pay a premium on a bond to an insurance company, which amounts to £10 or £12.  He must also pay £10 in stamp duty on the licence, and he must employ a solicitor to make the application to the District Court for such licence.  Surely he is one of the gentlemen who should be exempt from the provisions of this section in the Bill.  If a district justice has already inquired into his character and granted him a licence, it should not be necessary for him to go back and satisfy the Minister that a licence is again necessary for him.  I propose asking the Minister on the Committee Stage to accept an amendment which would exclude people who already hold a licence under the Auctioneers Act of 1947 from the provision in this section. That, in my opinion, would be a fit and proper amendment to the section.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another matter which I think is really obnoxious.  It is paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 15, whereby the board is empowered <Col N="92" /> to purchase, store or sell fuel and lubricating and other oils for use in the running of sea fishing boats.  We have had sea fishing boats in this country since away back in 1920. Certain people have gone to the trouble of establishing the business of providing these sea fishing boats with fuel and lubricating oils, particularly off the islands on our coasts.  Under this paragraph their business is going to be wiped out overnight by this board, which is setting up a business in opposition to them.  These men have put capital and years of work into the trade of catering for the sea fishing boats of the country.  I think that the proposal in this section is obnoxious.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider, on the Committee Stage, the wiping out of that particular paragraph. I would also ask him seriously to consider a limitation of the keel length of the boats which may fish off our coasts.  One can visualise again private enterprise, or otherwise, chartering trawlers and glutting the Dublin market.  I think that a maximum length of a boat should be 70 feet.  I am sure that if the Minister consults with the officials who advise him in the drafting of Bills he may find a very good reason for a limitation of the keel length of boats to, say, 70 feet.  I think that this Bill would be acceptable were we informed on the point and received a reply to the question we are asking now and the question that we asked on the Foyle Fisheries Bill: Who will constitute this board? I can assure the Minister that were I aware of the personnel and aware of the fact that the proposed board would not be dominated by civil servants I would be the first to endorse this measure and give my approval to the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about the fishing industry because I come from an inland area, but for the past 30 years I have been listening to talk about the fishing industry and I have seen very little result.  I even heard Arthur Griffith talk about the fishing industry.  I heard Fionán Lynch talk about it; I heard him say, almost 30 years ago, that it was one of our <Col N="93" /> most important industries.  I heard the last Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, say that he was bringing in a Bill to put the industry on its feet. Now we have another Bill to put the industry on its feet.  I think the whole thing is a cod.</P>
      <P>Why has the fishing industry not been developed?  I believe that what is really needed is proper organisation. Our people are not fish-minded but they can be made fish-minded.  We in the Midlands want fish.  We would like to have it at least twice a week.  What are the facts?  Perhaps once in three, four or five months an old hawker arrives with a load of stale herrings&mdash; a dirty man with a dirty van and dirty hands and stinking fish.  He goes from house to house expecting the people to buy that fish.  Unfortunately, because they see fish so seldom, some of them buy it, but it is generally the first and the last time they do buy it.</P>
      <P>I want to see proper organisation behind this industry.  The seas around our coast abound in fish.  Fish are brought into our ports by our fishermen, but there is no proper organisation to send that fish into the Midland areas.  When there is a glut, the fishermen find themselves with a rotten mess left on their hands.  I want a publicity campaign, first and foremost, to make our people fish-minded.  I want properly equipped fish depots all over the country.  If that is done, we will put the industry on its feet in a very short time.</P>
      <P>Heretofore we have never had that drive.  All we hear is that the fishermen want more money, their nets are lost, their boats are rotten.  We are sick listening to that.  We want good clean fish as cheap as we can get it. We want a variety of fish.  I am satisfied the people will eat fish if they get the right kind of fish.  Now we get nothing but the tail-end of the Dublin fish market, the leavings.  That is hawked around the country by the small fish vendor and that is what is dished up to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could the fishing industry possibly develop on those lines?  We must have cleanliness.  We must have proper organisation.  We must have <Col N="94" /> central depots and co-ordination.  If those things are not present, then it is no use talking about the fishing industry.  We see very little fish in the country except for the old stale herring.  Before Bills are introduced, steps should be taken to establish a proper organisation.  There should be a drive, accompanied by a publicity campaign, to make the people fish-minded. No fish should be sold unless it is good, clean fish, and in abundant variety.  The fish vendors should have clean vans, clean hands and wear white coats, so that the people who purchase their goods will know that they are getting a commodity that can be eaten. The people will eat fish if we only make an effort here to give them the kind of fish they want.  I say, stop all this legislation year after year.  Act after Act is passed, and nothing ever happens.  A new Government comes in, and we have the tedious business all over again.  We have had 30 years of that.  God knows, it is enough. Give us good fish.  Give us clean fish as often as you can give it to us.  That is all we want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Giles of the old saying that you must first catch your hare.  We must catch the fish before we can distribute it around the country.  There is something more to the fishing industry than just eating fish. Naturally, any attempt to improve the industry must be of paramount interest in this island country.  There is around our shores a potential source of wealth that other maritime countries have exploited to their hearts' content.</P>
      <P>It is a very poor record that we have made so little use of the riches in the waters round our coast.  I think, however, that there has been a gradual improvement in the fishing industry during the past 15 or 16 years.  Much of the credit for that must go to the Sea Fisheries Association, though it is also due in some measure to the improvement in the catch resulting from improved methods of fishing. Whatever the improvement is due to it is yet clear to all that we are not making even 50 per cent. of the advance that we should make in sea fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> The fact that we have now a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries is to me a welcome sign of the interest taken in fishing.  I think that appointment is a good one.  I think it is an appointment that should have been made long years ago. Fisheries, while under the control of the Department of Agriculture, became the Cinderella of the Service.  Very little attention was paid to the industry.  Its importance was overlooked. Fishing was neglected and those who hitherto engaged in it were compelled to emigrate in order to find a livelihood elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, we have fishermen left capable of carrying on that highly skilled work provided they get the necessary financial help and encouragement. It is well known that in our fishing centres, and mainly in the Gaeltacht, money is not plentiful and those who would engage in fishing are not in a position to put down the additional payments required to replace boats and gear, worn out or lost in the storms that come each year.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, the type of boat provided has been a source of loss both to the association and to the fisherman themselves.  It is now admitted that these boats are incapable of travelling to the grounds where the fish can be found.  In my constituency a number of Scotch fishing boats have been engaged during the past two or three years.  As compared with the boats of the local fishermen, these boats can be termed luxury craft.  They are equipped with every modern device, including a radio-telephone by which they keep in constant touch, not only with one another, but with the markets so that they can be directed and redirected if necessary to the ports where there is the biggest demand for fish and where they will get the highest prices.  They are equipped with radar by which they can find their fishing grounds even on foggy nights.  They have an echo-sounding apparatus which enables them to locate the shoals of fish.</P>
    <P>These boats are in competition with our fishermen who, very often, have a <Col N="96" /> boat which has not even an engine or, if it has an engine, it is one of a very inferior type.  I welcome the provision in the Bill under which that sort of competition will not be allowed to continue.  These fishermen have been of advantage to us in so far as they have indicated to us what modern science can do to help us and the best system for the use of modern equipment. They have introduced a new system of ring net fishing as compared with the old style used by Irish fishermen and I understand that since that system was adopted by the Irish fishermen it has paid big dividends. The time has come when this competition from outside sources must stop and the new board should try to model their new boats on the boats used by these Scotsmen.  They should endeavour to provide the new boats with similar equipment so that our fishermen may have all the advantages that these Scotsmen have.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a need for a combination of offshore and inshore fishing because of the necessity for a steady supply of fish for the home market.  It is desirable that a certain amount of offshore fishing should be indulged in during periods when inshore fishing is not possible.  We can get a guaranteed market for fish amongst the rural community because I believe that it is amongst the rural community that a market can be built up.</P>
    <P>On the question of inducing our people to eat fish, the board should go in for a good deal of propaganda. The radio, newspapers, magazines and the films should be used in this propaganda drive.  We have been told that fish is the best food for the brain. That has very often induced people to make a choice of fish for their meals. I suggest that there should be a publication of the vitamin content of different types of fish and also a stressing, where it can be shown, of the saving that can be made by buying fish as compared with other foods.  In that way the rural community can be induced to use more fish than they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>If we are to induce the people in the rural districts to use fish we must first get the fish from the ports to these <Col N="97" /> districts.  It is well known that in practically every country town the only fish available is dried lander, red herrings, or something of that sort.  On an occasional Friday you may get iced cod or whiting, slightly gone off, which arrives from Dublin.  I live in a seaport town within five miles of some of the best fishing grounds in the world and I have seen more Fridays on which fish was not available than Fridays on which it was available.  Therefore there must be something wrong with the method of distribution of fish.</P>
    <P>The extension of rural electrification provides an opportunity for establishing centres where fish can be kept in a fresh state in a much better way than has been possible in the past.  There should be an extension of the frigidaire system in the co-operative stores throughout the country.  If that were linked up with a fleet of lorries from the ports at which the fish is landed we could assure the rural community of a supply of fresh fish, not the rotten fish described by Deputy Giles but a food that would be suitable for any people. If the rural community could get such fish I am satisfied that they would use it and be anxious to get it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the fact that unemployment benefit and national health insurance do not extend to the fisherman is something of which this country cannot be proud.  On a wet day, a builder's labourer who, because of that act of God, is unable to earn his bread, receives under the heading of wet time some compensation for the fact that during that time he was unable to earn his living.  A fisherman deprived of his employment because a storm rages around our coasts or because of some other act of God, is expected to suffer on and to remain unemployed until such time as the storm abates.  He receives no compensation of any sort for his loss of time.  Is it any wonder that people will not be over-eager to engage in the fishing industry except as part-time employment?</P>
    <P>There is a question on which I am not quite clear and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with it when replying, that is, as to whether we have any ships carrying out research <Col N="98" /> work into the merits and habits of the fish and the best methods of catching them.  In reading an agricultural report of the year 1902 I noticed that the then <i>Helga</i> was so equipped, and made, I understand, reports to the Department of Agriculture at specified times.  In these reports were indicated all the changes of habits of the fish; maps were prepared by the officials or officers in charge of that boat, indicating the particular waters where fish appeared and the approximate dates; particular fishing grounds were laid out and any alterations noted.  It would be well, if we have not that service continued, that it be re-established.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the composition of the new board is vitally important to the success of this Bill.  Unless men of practical seagoing experience or experienced in the marketing and handling of fish are chosen, it will be very little use expecting that the industry can flourish.  We wish, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary success with any attempt to improve the industry but we trust that the importance of the industry and its success will come before any political expediency in the formation of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my brief comment on this Bill but I do so between two minds, wondering whether I should welcome it or otherwise. Under this Bill it is intended to end the activities of the Sea Fisheries Association, an organisation which has during its time done very valuable work within the limits in which it was permitted to operate.  As one who has had some very considerable association with and experience of the life of the fishermen, I consider that this Bill will not go far enough to achieve the objects which I had hoped it would. Looking through the Bill, I find that the amount of £500,000 is to be made available.  In my opinion, it should be at least £3,000,000 spread over a period of five years, which would make it £600,000 a year.  If we are going to improve the sea fishery business and make it what it ought to be, the most important industry next to agriculture, I am very much afraid that this Bill will not achieve that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> I notice that there are four centres to be set up which, I take it, will operate within and be controlled within these centres.  I do suggest seriously to the Parliamentary Secretary that unless steps are taken to establish at least four curing stations around the coasts, we will not be able to make the success of this Bill for the fishing industry which we would all like so much to see.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have some experience of the fisherman's life.  I experienced it with him on a few occasions perforce, on hard cold winter nights; that was in the days when they used their muscles for power, not an engine in a boat.  I believe it is only right that some endeavour should be made to supply each and every crew in all our fishing villages who are able to man a boat with such boats which they can call their own.  I can see very little hope of the potential crews of the future in our fishing villages being able to put down 10 per cent.  of the cost of a boat plus 10 per cent. deducted from the earnings.  That, to my mind, is rather drastic and if we want to help the young men, the sons of the fishermen and the families of the fishermen of the future, some provision ought to be made whereby solvent sureties should be accepted in order to encourage those young fishermen to provide for their future and to supply the Irish market with fresh fish.</P>
    <P>I have a distinct recollection of the period when the Sea Fisheries Association was set up, when we were told that there were to be fleets of fast vans which would carry the catch when landed on the quays of our fishing villages to the inland towns throughout the State.  That never materialised. If it is envisaged now I hope it will not be allowed to slip as it did in the past.  It goes without saying that the people of this country have become fish unconscious.  I remember in my younger days seeing fleets of vans laden with fish going off to the various inland towns in my district.  I am sure that that was so in and around the coasts, north, south, east and west. We have at the present time a few who <Col N="100" /> use the modern motor vehicle but they are very few.  If we had more fish landed, there would be a greater sale for fish; the only way to have more fish landed and supplied to the Irish market is to accommodate fishermen with boats, and I would suggest very modern ones at that.  I understand that in the English and Scottish fishing fleets there are boats equipped with radar enabling them to detect where the shoals of fish lie.  If this Government intends to sponsor a fishing fleet, they should see to it that it will be the most modern that plies on the seas.</P>
    <P>I suggest seriously to the Parliamentary Secretary that at least four modern up-to-date curing stations should be erected around our coastline. Those four divisions, I suggest, are the most likely centres for the setting up of modern curing fishing stations.  If their erection should come to pass there will always be a ready market for what the fishing fleets have to offer.  This struck me very forcibly not later than 2 o'clock yesterday evening when there were nine fishing trawlers lying off the port of Skerries waiting for the tide so that they could enter.  I could see that at least nine of them seemed to be loaded.  On occasions like that it would not be possible to deal with the vast shoal of fish landed in that manner or to supply the market on a Wednesday, even in Lent. For that reason I suggest that, in order to deal with surplus supplies of fish, there should be some means of dispatching them from the various fishing villages to the packing centres. If other countries can secure tin for canning, there is no reason in the world why this committee should not be able to get their share of tin for that purpose.  If we can even adopt these few suggestions I feel, at all events, that something good will come from this particular Bill.  In my opinion, we are simply replacing the Sea Fisheries Association unless we go out in a big way to achieve something substantial and beneficial for the fishing industry in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said in his address, inland fisheries have reached the end of a <Col N="101" /> stage in their development.  In this House this evening and all through this debate members coming from the north, the south, the east and the west coastal areas of the Twenty-Six Counties were all interested in the question of the fishing industry and its vital importance both to the fishermen and to the country as a whole.  As many speakers have already said, we are practically as far away to-day from making the fishing industry the success it ought to be as we were in the early years of the foundation of this State. I agree with the other speakers that, at any rate, the Sea Fisheries Association did some good.  In 1931, when this organisation was formed, the fishing industry was, unfortunately, in very bad shape.</P>
      <P>In the intervening years, though the progress has not been anything like what we would have wished it to be, taking 1938 as against 1945, figures can prove that the co-operation given to the fishermen and others through the Sea Fisheries Association did at least justify its existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps one of the greatest handicaps with which the Sea Fisheries Association had to deal was the fact that, from the beginning, the fishing industry was never looked upon by the members of this House as the important industry it, in fact, is.  Some Deputies, during the course of the debates here during the last few days, complained about the few members who were present to hear the discussion on the fishing industry.  I noticed that those who lodged the complaint did not come from the seaboard areas. Undoubtedly, there is a tendency for people to speak on subjects on which they have a particular interest.  I suppose it is only human, when one realises that the same remarks are being made in this House year after year, the same plans and suggestions brought forward, and very little interest taken in them, that one would come to the stage of saying: &ldquo;It is a waste of time to even contribute towards such a debate.&rdquo;  For the last 25 or 30 years there have been members in this House who offered contributions which some of us younger Deputies would profit by reading.  I am sure such contributions were well <Col N="102" /> worth listening to.  Unfortunately, the fact that fisheries are considered only as a section of another Department has from the outset been the biggest weakness of the whole industry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the present Parliamentary Secretary is not a Minister for Fisheries.  However, it is a step in the right direction to have a Parliamentary Secretary for Fisheries.  When reading through this Bill reference is continually made to &ldquo;the Minister,&rdquo; and yet we know very well that the Minister concerned has another industry in his charge&mdash;agriculture.  I believe that, until we go so far as to have a Minister for Fisheries with a Department for Fisheries under his control, we will not be making a genuine attempt towards making the fishing industry the important one it ought to be, and the important industry we wish it to be.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the fact that, while there may be a Minister for Fisheries in the future, there will always be the overriding individual, namely, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is all right in his own place, but I feel that we should keep him out of the fishing industry as far as possible.  We will have to admit that very little money has been allocated to that industry in the past and that the industry has made very little progress.  We must be prepared to spend a large sum in seeing that the inshore fishermen&mdash;the backbone of the industry even at the present time&mdash;are well provided for and well protected.  Our future plans for deep sea fishing must also be put on a proper plane, through the provision of adequate finance at the outset, so as to make it the success we wish it to be.  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated, the catches landed in this country from 1938 to 1945 were very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before the debate was adjourned, the country did experience this campaign launched by the Minister for Finance <Col N="103" /> and carried on for the last nine months by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and other Ministers of the present Government.  That campaign, presumably, was a concerted, decided, intentional one.  It was not a campaign that just happened accidentally.  It was a deliberate, political move by the present Government, discounting completely the interests of the country, aimed at discrediting the policy of the former Government and taking no account whatsoever of whatever harm and damage might be done to Ireland's credit and to the fortunes of our people.</P>
      <P>Of course, the present Minister for Finance and his allies in this particular campaign had a dual purpose behind what they were doing.  Not only had they to discredit the good work done by the former Government, but they had also to justify their own attitude while in opposition.  The House will remember here in the last three and a half years the consistent opposition indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Party against the former Government's policy of capital investment.  Every effort was made by them to teach the country and the people of the country that there was something unsound, something harmful in the idea of any Irish Government endeavouring to put the savings of our people into houses, land reclamation, drainage, hospitalisation and into all the other projects which constitute the lustre to which the former Government is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That opposition was indulged in and it was useless for members of the former Government to point to the fact that we had, in the years from 1948 to 1951, the greatest housing drive that any country of comparable size in the world had ever experienced by reason of the policy of the former Government. It was useless to say that.  It was useless to point to the land project and to point to the fact that Ireland, for the first time, was winning back from the neglect of centuries thousands of idle acres.  That counted for nothing. It was useless to point to the various minor drainage schemes and capital work, such as rural electrification and <Col N="104" /> various schemes of that kind.  None of that was good enough for Fianna Fáil. They kept on saying that it was wrong, harmful and dangerous to ask the people of this country to invest their money at home in work of that kind and that all that kind of work should be limited by the national burden of taxation raised and levied in each year.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance, as Deputy MacEntee, indulged in that kind of speech here in this House there was no one who believed in it less than Deputy MacEntee.  The same could be said of the present Tánaiste as Deputy Lemass.  They were just playing a political game.  They were just pushing a few pawns in the political game of chess, but unfortunately their poor dumb followers throughout the country and the unfortunate Deputies who sat behind them accepted some of this propaganda, and when the change of Government, by some strange happening, took place on the 13th June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well may the Deputy laugh because certainly it was not the will of the Irish people to change the Government last June and if the Deputies opposite doubt that let them dissolve the Dáil and try to find out.  When the change of Government took place on the 13th June, one can well understand the dismay of the present Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the rest of them when they had to act now as a Government as they had spoken and prated while in opposition. Inevitably, they found themselves drowning in the river of their own words.  To try to appear consistent they had to speak much as they had spoken two or three months before. Accordingly, the country was told that under this big, bad inter-Party Government our external assets had been frittered away, that our people were living beyond their means, that there was a serious crisis around the corner and that all of us would have to tighten our belts, take a deep breath and prepare for the very serious fate that faced each and every one of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the propaganda that was indulged in.  What was the first effect <Col N="105" /> of it?  The first effect&mdash;and the brainy gentlemen behind on the opposite benches should listen carefully to this &mdash;undoubtedly was that those who controlled credit in this country began to say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, Deputy MacEntee is Minister for Finance and his words will have to be listened to and, thank heavens, we have now a Minister for Finance who is not going to force us to give £5,000,000 to the people of Dublin for housing.  He will not prevent us from restricting the amount of credit in circulation, thus preventing the Irish people maintaining a decent standard of living and preventing the people of this country from having money in circulation, having business go ahead and enjoying the things that they have been enjoying for the last three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Immediately after the first shot was fired in this vile campaign by the Minister for Finance last June credit was restricted.  There was not a single person in this country since last June who was entitled to or found himself able to get from Irish banks the assistance his status and stake in the country entitled him to.</P>
    <P>It is little use for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to come in here, as he did last night, to try to convince us that there has been no restriction in bank credit.  It is little use for that kind of denial to come from the Government Front Bench.  There is not a Deputy who is prepared to keep an open mind and who keeps in touch with his constituents who does not appreciate the fact that in the last nine months business has been brought almost to a standstill as a result of the fact that no man can get an advance from a bank unless his financial position is such that he does not require it.</P>
    <P>You have only to look at this city to-day to see that building has slumped.  Men who 18 months ago accepted the call of an Irish Minister for Local Government to return from England to find employment here are now drawing the dole.  There is no builder in this country to-day who can obtain from his bank the credit which his trade requires.  The building trade is a trade in which there is a large expenditure of money in wages, purchasing <Col N="106" /> material and all the rest of it.  If a builder does not get from job to job the necessary accommodation at the bank there will be no building.  Many builders in this country to-day are eating the first fruits of the campaign indulged in by the present Minister for Finance and deliberately initiated by the present Government.</P>
    <P>In speaking like this, I am merely informing the House of what is common knowledge to all Deputies and the people outside.  It is time that some stop should be put to that kind of campaign.  It is time that some protest should be made against the spectacle of Irish Ministers here at home parading the alleged insolvency of their country to provide ammunition for Sir Basil Brooke in the North.</P>
    <P>It is time that a halt were called to this campaign, particularly when those who indulge in it know very well that it is a false and a fraudulent one.  I do not want to cover again the ground that has been covered so ably in recent months by the Leader of the Opposition. Were it not that Irish political life has to-day a man such as Deputy J.A. Costello much more harm would have been done to the credit and financial standing of this country than has, in fact, been done by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a tribute to the Leader of the Opposition that four or five months ago, single-handed, he fought to a standstill the campaign indulged in by the present Government. He halted them.  He forced them to examine the facts and he set the country thinking.  Eventually the truth began to emerge.  Despite all the talk and all the propaganda to the contrary, we are a sound, credit-worthy country, and not all the efforts of Fianna Fáil can prevent that fact from becoming known.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government talk about the frittering away of our sterling assets.  Last night we saw the very disedifying spectacle of the little man behind a pile of documents&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; spewing out figures in a frantic effort to justify the discreditable campaign that is being waged by his Government in this country.  He wept bitter tears because our sterling credits in London <Col N="107" /> were reduced in the past three and a half years.  According to him that was something which should not continue if Ireland was to progress.  He ignored the fact that some of those sterling assets, which he says were frittered away, were converted into dwelling-houses for his own constituents in Longford-Westmeath.  He counts that as nothing.  He regards as wrong, if we are to take his lecture on economics as being a serious one, any kind of repatriation of sterling assets for purposes which do not come within the definition of &ldquo;a capital commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will scrutinise the reports published in respect of the years 1949 and 1950, and contained in the famous document No. 2&mdash;the White Paper issued by the Minister for Finance&mdash; he will find records of many imports which could not strictly be regarded as goods of a capital nature&mdash;goods such as building materials and medical supplies. These are goods which were required to provide houses and homes, hospital services, and so forth, for our people.  These are the types of imports which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does not want for this country. He wants to see Ireland peopled by a nation who live in the trees.  He wants to see our people requiring 100,000 houses for the next ten or 15 years. Any policy which puts our sterling assets to work to buy building materials, iron and steel, and goods of that nature for the erection of houses in this country is, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in his smug complacency, a wrong and a disastrous policy.  I am surprised that a speech of that kind should have been made by an Irish Minister in this Parliament in the year 1952.  That he was able to leave the House, in which he uttered that speech, with a whole skin is a tribute to the respect which Deputies of this House have for the Rules of Order.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs sincerely believes in that kind of nonsense I trust that he will get his answer very quickly from the constituents who so very nearly removed him from the <Col N="108" /> membership of this House nine months ago.</P>
    <P>I remember well that in February, 1948, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce advised the former Government not to regard our sterling assets as sacrosanct.  However, if they are to be regarded as something sacred and something to be held for all time, let us, at any rate, examine the figures.  In 1938, before the outbreak of the second world war, our sterling assets stood at £250,000,000. During the war years we could not expend any of that money because we could not import the goods.  Britain could give us only a limited amount of coal, a ration of tea and a ration of the various other essential commodities which this country required&mdash;but she could give us no iron and no steel. On the other hand, we were able to continue to send to Britain our cattle and agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Of course, the normal accounting between the two countries could not take place and our sterling assets, accordingly, increased.  It was only proper and prudent and natural that once commerce was resumed between our two countries, in 1947, 1948 and 1949, we should take steps to obtain for our industries and for our people many of the commodities which could not be imported during the war years. No Government could fail to see the sense and the wisdom of doing that. During the past four years&mdash;under the Fianna Fáil Government as well as under the inter-Party Government&mdash;we began to import coal again from Britain.  When coal began to be imported freely again, it was taken off the ration, not under the inter-Party Government but under the Fianna Fáil Government, in October of 1947.  It was only right and proper that during the past four years we should import certain commodities which could not be imported prior to that.</P>
    <P>Our sterling assets to-day are £150,000,000 greater than they were in 1938.  They now stand at about £400,000,000.  The Minister for Finance will, I am sure, bear out these facts when he comes to conclude this debate. Accordingly, the people of the country are entitled to know whether they have <Col N="109" /> been led by a Government of madmen or a Government of knaves during the past nine months.  What is the sense behind the Fianna Fáil campaign to impress on the people of this country that, during the past four years, we have been throwing our sterling credits into the Irish Sea when, in fact, we have more sterling credits now than we have ever had before?  What is the sense behind it unless it be knavery or madness?  I do not think there can be any other choice.  I know the answer I would give to that particular question because I regard the Minister for Finance as being a sane man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister doubts my figures he can check them and deal with them when he replies, but I challenge him to deny that our external assets to-day stand round about £400,000,000.  I challenge him to deny that our external assets in 1938 stood at £250,000,000.  If he is a man, I take it he will accept that challenge. Secondly, now that issue has been joined in this matter, apart from the question of frittering away our external assets, it is proper that we should examine what, if any, benefit has accrued of a domestic capital nature to this country from the settled agreed policy of repatriating our external assets in the last three years.  I do not want to bore the House with figures in the manner in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs did last night, but I should like to give these figures. Since this policy was initiated in the beginning of 1949, this country has increased its sterling holdings domestically by £24,000,000.  In addition, here at home, and standing now, there has been an increased domestic capital formation of £84,500,000.  The benefits can be found in rural electrification, in houses and hospitals, in all the things <Col N="110" /> that were done in the last three years, all the things that used to be the proud boast of most right-thinking Deputies in this House.  Those figures mean that in the last three years we increased domestic capital by £108,000,000. Against that we incurred a dollar debt and, of course, a sterling debt which together amounted roughly to £68,000,000.  Now, it only requires a little bit of subtraction to convince even the gentlemen who sit behind the Minister for Finance that we have a net credit of new domestic capital here at home of some £45,000,000.</P>

In the years 1949 and 1950, the years about which we had all this rampage, Ireland found itself worth from the point of view of actual capital here at home, £45,000,000 more. There is fact No. 2.  I want to know how that large sum, £45,000,000, happened to escape the attention of the Minister for Finance?  Was this record expenditure on housing, hospitals, drainage, rural electrification, telephones and all the rest of it, a waste of money?  Is it a loss to the country to provide decent houses for our people in each town and village in Longford-Westmeath, which Deputy Carter represents temporarily, in Dublin and Cork, and in other parts of the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the speeches we have had from the Minister in relation to the policy contained in these Estimates.  I do not think I know of any public man who is less consistent in his political outlook, or in relation to his conduct as Minister for Finance, than the present Minister, and in the last nine months that inconsistency has been more and more marked.  There is only one thing in which he is consistent and it would not be in accordance with the Rules of Order to mention that.  This is the position which the Minister was so very anxious to prevent me stating.  We are owed more money to-day by Britain, if that is a good thing, than we were prior to the war.  We have succeeded in shifting over here almost £50,000,000 worth more of capital goods.  We have those two credits and it is in face of these facts that the present group of people, who call themselves the Government, have been trying to convince the people that the country is insolvent and heading for destruction.  We reject these sentiments.  We reject the policy behind that kind of campaign and I think that the people of the country accept the Opposition view in that regard.  The people know well that this country, in the last three or four years, has been a very good country to live in.  They have not accepted the Government's policy.  I am talking about the people generally, and if there is anyone over there who doubts that there is a way of finding out.  But, unfortunately, there have been sections of our people who have accepted the Government's policy. <Col N="113" /> Those sections, unfortunately, have been in a position, by their acceptance of the creed of despair preached by the Minister for Finance and the rest of them, to cause considerable harm to the people of the country.  Certain influential business circles, on being informed, as they were, that they were spending too much, said: &ldquo;Well, we had better cut down on expenditure.&rdquo; They looked at their pay-rolls; they looked at the list of those they had to pay each week and then took out a red pencil and somebody walked the plank.</P>
      <P>It was not merely in the clothing trade that that took place.  It was in relation to other large employment concerns in the country, and men were dismissed because the Minister for Finance said that everyone was spending too much.  In the case of the employer with a long pay-roll, his workers were spending too much, according to the creed of despair preached by the Minister for Finance.  Every industrialist with 200 or 300 men employed in a factory was, according to the Minister for Finance, spending too much.  He must and will cut down on the most vulnerable section and will reduce the number of people he has in employment.  Accordingly, one of the first and earliest results of the policy indulged in by the present Minister was the creation of unnecessary unemployment in the country.  In my own constituency, there are 2,000 or 3,000 extra unemployed to-day.  They are drawing the dole and are walking around without any chance of a job. They are unemployed because this country has as Minister for Finance Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been one of the first and earliest results of the campaign indulged in by the present Government.  We all know, no matter what part of the House we sit in or what Party we belong to, that the workers, the less well-off sections of <Col N="114" /> the people, will always be the first hostages and victims of a campaign of this kind.  Of course, there will be unfortunate and uncomfortably minded Fianna Fáil back bench Deputies who, being the true soldiers that they are, will have to try and put a face on the policy which is being pursued by the present Minister.  They will say: &ldquo;Oh, this is because of stockpiling.&rdquo;  That is the sort of lame excuse that they have to trot out.  Nobody objects to their doing it.  Of course, when Deputy Carter mentions Salts of Tullamore he dare not make a remark of that kind to the workers who are unemployed. He knows that in 1947 far more goods and yarn were imported than have ever been imported since, and these imports did not cause unemployment in 1947.</P>
      <P>Why should imports cause unemployment in 1951?  There is no reason why they should unless people feel that they cannot buy the goods produced by Salts.  Who is going to buy the goods produced by Salts except the people who might purchase them, but they are told that they are spending too much. Of course, if they think they are spending too much they are not going to buy as much as they used to buy.  Who tells them that they are spending too much?  It is not Deputy Carter; it is Deputy Seán MacEntee, Johnny the Bounce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, and I withdraw it.  Now, that is the position in relation to unemployment.  If those on the Government side of the House have any doubt as to the correctness of what I am saying they should go back to their constituencies and examine the position carefully.  There is unemployment.  It may be that some of it could not have been avoided, but most of it is due to the uneasiness and the panic caused by the campaign <Col N="115" /> of the present Government.  Once there is interference with any of these things, with the credit or with the economy of the country, the results are incalculable.  Deputies can appreciate this, that if anyone says of a neighbour or friend that that man cannot pay his way, that he is insolvent, then everyone will begin to clamour for payment of their debts.  No one will lend that man money.  The result is that he becomes a bankrupt.  That can be applied to a country also.  Once you start a campaign of that kind, it is no good running around the week after saying: &ldquo;What I said about John Jones is not true; I find now that he is able to pay his way.&rdquo;  That will not do any good.  From the moment that is said of John Jones, he cannot borrow money and will not be able to pay his way.  Now, apply that to the country.  Fianna Fáil Ministers, three of them, started that campaign deliberately. They did not believe in it, but they did it for a political purpose when they started it.  The first result of it was unemployment.  The second was restriction of credit, which was followed by less business activity, and less business activity meant less jobs for those who were in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies can look at the figures if they wish.  Up to June of last year, more jobs were being made available to our people in insurable employment at the rate of 1,000 a month.  That was up to June, 1951.  That particular type of employment has now become less at the rate of 1,000 per month.  That is a serious situation.  It has meant a considerable dislocation for the country. All this meant a considerable retarding of this country's aims and policy in relation to the reunion of our country. When Sir Basil Brooke, in the North, had to face difficulties in recent months he was glad to quote the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He was glad to try and convince the dockers in Belfast with this: &ldquo;Look, you do not know how well off you are; look at the rate at which they are heading for a financial crash.&rdquo;  Sir Basil Brooke did not examine into the facts very carefully. He does not know that that is the view <Col N="116" /> of only the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and a few others who constitute the present Government.  He does not examine to find the truth, or otherwise, of that particular propaganda campaign. He is simply very glad to have handed to him by Irish Ministers an argument which will help to make the division of our country more permanent still.</P>
    <P>There are many points on which the present Government could be taken to task because of their failure to act in the interests of the country as a whole during the past nine months.  It is inevitable that their financial policy should be discussed in some detail.  A review of the past nine months shows that both the financial and economic policy of the Government have failed. The Government has failed to pursue a coherent policy.  That is so obvious that it is unnecessary to dwell on it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Government has failed to do what the former Government would undoubtedly have done&mdash;gone to the country last June to raise a loan. They failed to do that at a time when the money market was favourable and the credit of the country was high. They failed to raise a loan when the people had confidence in the credit of the country.  They let the opportune moment pass.  Now the market is unfavourable and the country has lost an opportunity it would not have lost had the inter-Party Government remained in power.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Government has proved criminally negligent in relation to a savings campaign.  The inter-Party Government recognised the importance to the country and to the capital investment programme of the people's savings.  They increased the rate of interest which had been reduced by Fianna Fáil in 1947.  Had the inter-Party Government remained in power they would have launched a national savings campaign in the last nine months.  That should have been done by any Government which had considered the need for capital investment here.  We know that Fianna Fáil does not agree with that policy.  Possibly that is why they did not indulge in such a campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> Fourthly, the present Government and the Minister for Finance have in the last nine months, or less, completely exhausted the American Counterpart Fund.  The present Minister for Finance, as Deputy MacEntee, worked himself into a dangerously excitable condition in relation to American loans and their expenditure here.  Yet, when he became Minister for Finance he spent the American Counterpart Fund at six times the rate of his predecessor; he spent it not on capital investment programmes but in paying for New Zealand butter to be eaten by the Irish people.  That fund has gone now.  Nine months ago it stood at £25,000,000 and it was the intention of the inter-Party Government to maintain that fund intact as a shelter belt for the investment programme.</P>

      <P>I would hate to assign a reason.  In the last nine months the Minister for Finance has appropriated certain moneys that were made available for capital development purposes by the former Government. He was thereby saved and there is to-day less land reclamation and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> The present Minister for Finance and the Government have taken no steps whatsoever to deal with the restriction of credit.  Not only have they taken no steps but they have tried to deny that it exists.  Only two years ago the inter-Party Government was able to get for the Dublin Corporation, for the benefit of the Dublin people, a loan of £5,000,000 at a time when the banks had refused to make money available. That effort to restrict credit 18 months ago was fought by the inter-Party Government.  What has the present Minister done about the far more serious restriction which faces the country now?  He has done nothing except to act as the mouthpiece here of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  That is all I shall say with regard to the financial position.  I am sure Deputy Killilea is relieved.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Book of Estimates. Over the last few years we have listened to many speeches from Fianna Fáil Deputies about road grants.  They were the subject of debate on many occasions here after 1948.  In fact, a motion of no confidence in the inter-Party Government was tabled by the then Deputy Walsh, now Minister for Agriculture.  When road grants were reduced in 1947 the Government of the day put into operation the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A certain sum was made available for roads&mdash;a smaller sum than in 1948&mdash;and, in addition, money was made available for drainage works and other works of that kind up and down the country.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the grants made under the Local Authorities (Works) Act were supplementary to the road grants.  Despite that, in the last three years every country Deputy supporting the inter-Party Government had to listen to Fianna Fáil Deputies saying: &ldquo;If we were in power, the road grant would be the same as in 1948.&rdquo;  Last year they changed their tune slightly because the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs became critical as the Local Authorities (Works) Act grant had been slightly reduced.  What is the position this year?  Fianna Fáil have not faced up to their implied promise to the electorate to restore the road grant given in 1948&mdash;not by any means. Not only have they not done that, but they have reduced the £1,250,000 made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act grant last year to a mere £600,000.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about raiding and plundering. That is the kind of remark we had to listen to during the last three years&mdash; who raided and plundered the Road Fund?  The electorate were left under the impression that if they wanted more road grants and better roads they should vote for Deputy Killilea and his merry friends.  What is the position now?  The cuts have not been restored and there will be less work done in the coming year in draining land, in reclaiming land, and in dealing with the minor drainage problems that were dealt with under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I should like to know the reason.  I can recall that when the Act was introduced it was vehemently opposed by the present Minister for Finance.  Is it because the Minister for Finance has carried into these Estimates his opposition to that Act in 1949 that the grant has been reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> A similar reduction has taken place in relation to housing.  As far as we can see, there is less money being made available for the provision of houses this year for our people than was made available last year by the inter-Party Government.  These are serious matters.  Of course, we can understand the desire of the Minister for Finance, in accordance with his policy and the policy of Fianna Fáil, to restrict spending.  But why should they do so at the cost of housing?  Why should Deputy Cogan support them in doing so at the cost of farmers who require drainage?  Why should they pick out the worth-while capital schemes of that kind and cut them and keep on a lot of less worth-while expenditure?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government who have asked the House to vote this sum of money and support the policy contained in these Estimates will be long in office.  It may be that the year 1952-53 will see a change of Government.  I am not a political prophet, but I do know that the sooner a general election comes the better. The sooner the people get an opportunity of deciding the kind of Government they want the better for all of us. I have no doubt that a huge confidence trick was played on the people last June and the sooner that is remedied the better.</P>
    <P>I challenge this Government, if they have any doubts about it, that their duty dictates that they should take steps to consult the people.  They do not represent the Irish people.  The policy contained in these Estimates is not the policy that the Irish people desired or sought.  It is a policy born of an intrigue by a minority Government, and the sooner the present air of indecision, doubt and uncertainty is eased the better, and it can only be eased by giving the people an opportunity freely to decide the type of policy they want enforced and the type of Government they want in office.</P>

      <P>In making a speech in my constituency recently I compared the attitude of the coalition Opposition to a badly tuned band, and they seem to be out of tune in this House this evening in discussing this Vote on <Col N="121" /> Account.  We were advised from the left hand side of the House that we were restricting credit, and we were chastised yesterday by Deputy Dillon for making credit available.  In the circumstances, whom are we to believe? Can the Opposition offer a solution to this problem?  Can they make up their minds, or have they any concrete proposals to put forward to solve the problem that faces the country at present?  Deputy O'Higgins referred to unemployment in his constituency, and said that the same quantity of yarn was imported in 1947 as was imported during the time they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that there is a difference between the importation of yarn and the importation of finished wearing apparel from England.  I challenge the Opposition to deny that they brought in £16,000,000 of finished wearing apparel from England during their term of office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why &ldquo;fearless Frazer&rdquo; had to go down to Tullamore to castigate the Fianna Fáil Party for the unemployment that arose there.  I should like to see the Opposition adopt a consistent attitude in their approach to the problem with which we are faced.  Deputy Dillon chastised the Fianna Fáil Party for their industrial programme from 1932 onwards. As reported in column 2161, Volume 129, of the Official Report, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is time this House and country faced the fact that 90 per cent. of the tariffed industries in this country are badly-run relief works charged on the agricultural industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to tell the story of a man making a pair of shoes.  I would draw Deputy Dillon's notice to the fact that we exported boots and shoes in 1951 valued at £66,000.  I would also like to draw his attention to the fact that we were able to go into the English market and beat the <Col N="122" /> British at their own game of providing footwear for their people.  I think that is no mean achievement for a country that has only entered into industrial production in a large way from 1932 onwards.  I feel it is also a tribute to the Tanáiste, who, more than any other man in this country, is responsible for the building up of our industries.  The people engaged in the production of footwear in this country number over 6,000.  The number of people engaged in fellmongery and hide finishing constitute nearly 2,000.  If Deputy Dillon's attitude is the attitude of the entire Opposition they are badly out of tune again in this respect.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said this evening with regard to the restriction of credit. The solutions offered by the Deputies opposite to the problem that affects us with regard to production and trade are both novel and entertaining.  We had the spectacle of one section&mdash;the Labour Party&mdash;chastising the Government for restricting credit, and then we had the Fine Gael Party chastising the Government for providing credit. As I understand the banking system in this country, it is free.  No Government has any authority to interfere with the running of the banks as a whole.  The best answer, I feel, to the charge that there has been credit restriction is the substantial improvement that has taken place in bank advances during the period 31st December, 1950, to date.  In so far as I am aware the banks' resources are the deposits of the farmers, both big and small, of the large shopkeeper, of the small shopkeeper, of the would-be shopkeeper, of the shop assistant who is saving to be a shopkeeper at some future date, of the people providing for old age, and of the worker who puts away a nest egg.  When the bank makes an advance this is the money it uses.  Ordinary common sense suggests that to provide for all ordinary and extraordinary drawings on deposits a certain proportion only of those savings could be advanced by way of loans to the public.  It is believed that the banks have advanced much more than what has always been considered a safe proportion.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is because of the rise in the price of the goods and services <Col N="123" /> which people require.  Do our so-called economists wish the banks to go on lending their depositors' savings without putting on a limit?  If that were the case the day would come, as it came in America in the 1930s, when depositors would find the bank doors shut in their faces.  That has never happened in this country so far as I am aware.  However, it could be brought about by tactics such as those adopted by the Coalition Government who, through political cowardice and failure to face their duties and responsibilities, persisted in the attitude that we could continue to spend more than we earned and at the same time prosper. A large proportion of the goods we received were got from America through Marshall Aid and later on through E.C.A. at a time when the £ could purchase $4.  This money is now about to be repaid when, in fact, the £ will purchase less than $3.  I feel sure that we could probably have done very well without a goodly proportion of these goods.  However, America, in order to bolster up its own economic set-up, insisted on selling us the finished article on credit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people on the Opposition Benches have the welfare of the country at heart and wish to take the banks to task, let them examine what better service the banks could give the community rather than criticise the Fianna Fáil Government for the so-called restrictions of credit.  Let them look into the cost of the number of banks that are in the country and <Col N="124" /> the cost of their administration in general.  Work is not created in any country by banks vying with one another as to which will advance the most money to purchase a public-house. That is not creating wealth.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Opposition have a remedy for our financial problems. It does not matter what the form of society is, capitalist or communist; it does not matter what particular shade the Government may be; the law is immutable and operates infallibly.  The plain fact is that we are all seeking to take more out of the national wealth pool than there is to take.  The shareholder wants a higher dividend; the worker wants higher wages, and the citizen wants increased social benefits.  As W.J. Brown said not long ago&mdash;and I admire him for saying it; he said it at a very unpopular time in England, during the general election &mdash;&ldquo;unless we are deaf, dumb, blind and silly, we must realise that if we do not produce this wealth we cannot share a slice of it.&rdquo;  We can have all these things but only on one condition, and that is if we increase the national wealth pool to a point where all payments can be met.  If we do not we cannot have those advantages and the value of our £ will sink lower and lower until we do awake from the fool's paradise in which the Opposition would have us live.  If we cannot create industry in the form of real wealth in order to exploit the labour of our people, we cannot live on borrowed dollars.  If we do borrow money let us provide that it be for a sound principle and a sound project.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I very much dislike the attitude of Deputy Dillon on the Opposition Benches&mdash;a man who, to my mind, has been dodging the law of libel for years&mdash;standing up there yesterday evening and trying to blacken the manufacturers of the footwear industry in this country, the wholesalers and the retailers, and there are retailers on the Opposition Benches.  I deny and I challenge some of his figures.  In his reference, he said that the wholesaler was entitled to 15 per cent.  He is not; it never works out that way.  He never gets it, and if you go down to any wholesaler's premises in the City of <Col N="125" /> Dublin, in the provinces, or down the country, you will find from audited returns that if he gets 11 or 12 per cent. on his turnover he is a very lucky man. I can assure Deputy Dillon that there will always be a place for a wholesaler as long as we have private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I may as well enlighten him with the facts in regard to the retailers.  He said in his reference here that the retailer of footwear was entitled to 30 per cent.  He is entitled to no such margin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the time he was allowed 50 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the retailer of footwear in this country succeeds in obtaining 18 to 20 per cent. on his total turnover, he is a very lucky man. I suggest, therefore, to the Opposition that they should not try to whistle with the two sides of their mouth when they come to talk on matters of industry, or agriculture for that matter.</P>
      <P>Lastly, Deputy O'Higgins, in his speech a moment ago, referred to stockpiling.  I will tell him how the stockpiling was done during the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government's term of office.  It was done in the shape of £21,000,000 worth of imported wheat; £22,000,000 worth of imported maize; £16,000,000 worth of wearing apparel; and, as a personal favour to Deputy Dillon, £2,000,000 worth of tomatoes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are from the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  As I said at the outset, I have not heard one sensible suggestion this evening from the Opposition Benches.  There has been a chorus in the manner of the Pharisee striking his breast and saying: &ldquo;Look what I did during my three-year term of office.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins drew my attention to the housing programme in Longford. My answer to Deputy O'Higgins is this: there is not a single house in Longford that was not planned in 1948 before the Fianna Fáil Government left office and the 150 houses that <Col N="126" /> we built in the town of Longford are the work of Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, the Opposition should not seek to take credit from that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow my young colleague from Longford on the lines he has adopted in that very able speech that he has delivered. I want to compliment him upon reading his brief fairly well.  Still the errors are very pronounced and I leave it to himself to find them out when he sees the Official Report.  This Vote on Account, as the Minister very properly pointed out, is a very important matter not only for the people of the country for this year but for the year to come.  It is customary for a survey of the past year and a survey of the year to come to be made in order to enable us to answer the questions as to where we are going and what progress we are making in our economic development.</P>
      <P>A speaker in the Opposition here to-day requires considerable courage because it is subject to attack, whether from the Government Front Bench or from the back benches or from the Party press.  When a member of the Opposition makes some assertion it is classed or described as nonsense, as having no merit whatever, no thought and no ability.  As a matter of fact, we are back again where we were before Fianna Fáil took office, that every person from the Opposition is anti-national and that they have no merit whatever.  If that is the way the Fianna Fáil Party, as a Government, are going to approach matters of serious importance for the people of this country, then we will make no headway.</P>
      <P>It has been said to-night and said well that it was of very great importance to the people of this country, even when we were out of office, that we had, as Leader of the Opposition, a person of the ability of Deputy Costello to meet this attack that was made by the Government upon the economy of the country.  I assert, Sir, that when Fianna Fáil came into office, they set out deliberately to discredit any action or any work carried out by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> I do not think they expected to do as much damage as they did when they undertook that task.  They started off talking about a crisis of the gravest magnitude.  The Tánaiste declared that this country was up against a crisis of the greatest magnitude, a crisis that it would be very hard to get over.  He did, indeed, by inference give the impression that the crisis was brought about by the previous Government and that if the previous Government had taken any reasonable precautions that crisis would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>Of course, I pity a poor Deputy like Deputy Carter when he says that people are talking with two voices. The action of Deputy Costello forced the Government to run away from the crisis and they found a problem instead.  The Tánaiste dropped the Central Bank Report and he repudiated the White Paper of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  He admitted in this House that it was true that we had a problem but that the crisis was not yet there but was round the corner.</P>
    <P>To my pleasant surprise, yesterday evening the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that we had a world crisis.  That is reported here in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I do not suppose that they have misreported him.  I expect they have reported him correctly.  According to the <i>Irish Press,</i> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said: &ldquo;To the extent that there was a world crisis, a crisis existed here in some degree.&rdquo; Therefore, Sir, the inter-Party Government is hardly responsible for the world crisis, but the Opposition would nearly have you believe that the inter-Party Government was responsible for the whole world crisis that now exists.</P>
    <P>What is the world crisis that we are affected by here?  A world crisis of rearmament, a mad rearmament race for domination by powerful nations, and we plan here for munitions building. I would ask Fianna Fáil Deputies to take well into mind that if the whole of the Marshall Aid money was spent on the purchase of munitions instead of on housing, on afforestation and on drainage, it would be considered <Col N="128" /> money well spent.  Is it not rather strange and significant that if a real crisis arose to-morrow in which a conflict took place in the world, we could have immediately all the capital that we want in order to find arms to fight that battle?  There would be no restriction of credit whatever.  If the Government to-morrow could purchase £20,000,000, £50,000,000 or £100,000,000 worth of tanks, armament, and planes from any country in the world, even a dollar country, we could get the money.  But yet apparently we cannot get money and there must be restrictions on the building of houses and on the raising of the fertility of the soil in order to build up a real defence for this nation.</P>
    <P>There is one point asserted by the Government with which I agree, and that is that hunger could do more to damage the independence of this country than anything else.  In office and out of office, I agree with the programme that this country should produce as far as is humanly possible the full requirements of the nation.  I have always contributed to that policy because it is of the greatest importance to our people that they should have sufficient food and clothing.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that some people do not favour that in this inter-Party group or, perhaps, in the Fine Gael Party, but the Fine Gael Party at least has this quality that it always had people of an independent turn of mind to express their views freely without let or hindrance.  They expressed their view whether it was personal or otherwise once they believed in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs having asserted that the crisis was only here in some degree, went on to say that as regards unemployment one could not escape from the predicament in which Great Britain found herself.  Therefore, our unemployment problem is due to the fact that England wants men to make munitions, and that because they have this problem we must become unemployed also to fulfil their requirements.  It is impossible to understand exactly what the Minister meant by that.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, being the expert that he is upon agriculture, he started <Col N="129" /> off to tell us how agriculture must fill the bill.  He was backed and criticised by Deputy Dr. Browne.  What two marvellous experts in agriculture!  I know perfectly well that if either of them were given the task of growing enough food to feed themselves they would both starve.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to a long-term plan for agriculture.  Would it not be better if he left it to the Minister for Agriculture to tell us what his long-term plan might be?  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs once expressed the view in this House that the small farms were too small for economic development and that there must be larger farms.  It is rather peculiar that both he and Deputy Dr. Browne were more or less on the one line yesterday evening&mdash;that if the farmer failed to fulfil his responsibility, as they looked on it, to the nation, certain steps should be taken.  The exact words used by Deputy Dr. Browne were that the farmers hold their land in trust for the community and that, if they fail, the Government should step in and take it over.  Who is teaching that sort of doctrine to poor Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;because that is what Uncle Joe Stalin taught?  That is the way Uncle Joe would handle the matter.</P>

      <P>To come back to what I was saying, that philosophy is not acceptable to the people of this country nor, I think, to any person in this House.  I trust that there will be an end to that type of speech here from either Deputy Dr. Browne or from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has changed his tune considerably. At one stage, the crisis was so hard upon us that he did not know how the Minister for Finance, or the Government of which he had the honour to be a member, was going to surmount it.  Then he watered down the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; considerably.  I am glad to say that it is apparent from his speech last night that he now thinks that the Government will be able to surmount this difficulty without any great effort.</P>
      <P>In a reply to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I said, down the country, that he reminded me of a colleague of mine who was a blacksmith. This colleague of mine always found, when a horse had a stone bruise, that the animal was suffering from a very serious disease&mdash;which proved, when the animal recovered, that my colleague was the great doctor who cured it.  Fianna Fáil have created a scare, and when the &ldquo;scare&rdquo; that was not a scare at all has passed they inform us that they found the remedy for the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that, with the collection of £10,000,000 more in revenue than was budgeted for by the Minister for Finance, there is no need for extra taxation and that the country is sound financially.  There is no doubt that, with the reductions which the Government have made in respect of capital expenditure and in respect of the ordinary housekeeping accounts, it will be possible to get through this <Col N="131" /> year, and get through it well, without the imposition of extra taxation. Food, clothing and the housing of our people are matters of the utmost importance. No attempt should be made by the Government to limit land reclamation, land rehabilitation, drainage and the housing of our people.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that increased agricultural production will go a long way towards increasing our prosperity.  It has been asserted that the farmers were never as well off as they are to-day. That is only relatively true.  It only means that they are better off than they were yesterday.  How well off were they yesterday?  I heard it stated here that the income of the farmers has gone up by 70 per cent.  That may be true but what was the income that went up by 70 per cent?  If I have 5s. a week and my wages are increased by 100 per cent.  I have only got 10s. a week.  It is essential to take the standard first and to see what you are comparing.  It is well known that in 1939, the standard year, the income of the agricultural community was the lowest in our history and that if they are better off to-day, by 70 per cent., it still means that they are the worst compensated people in the State.  The proof of that is that if a vacancy occurred for even a caretaker of a golf club and that the post would be worth about £5 or £6 a week a farmer or a farmer's son would run from the farm to get a job like that. It stands to reason that if they had a decent livelihood on the farm or on the land they would stay on it.  It is obvious that the farmer's son and the farmer's daughter and even the agricultural worker, are not receiving adequate compensation for their labour and that unless we increase the compensation which they receive for their labour that section of our people will continue to leave the land.</P>
    <P>If food and clothing play such an important part in the defence of our country and in its economic development there is no reason why these people should not be the best-paid section of our community.  I suggest that the farmers and the agricultural community are not yet adequately compensated <Col N="132" /> for their labour and that unless the Government embark on a policy to increase the productivity of the soil and to improve the financial position of the farming community in this country&mdash;such as the inter-Party Government had&mdash;the rural population will continue to decrease.  That would be a great pity and a great danger.  If we have large concentrations of people in our towns and cities and if, at the same time, there is a flight from the land, then we have a problem and a crisis of the first magnitude.  I suggest that the Government should consider carefully the capital investment plans of the inter-Party Government and give effect to them.  I suggest, with all sincerity, that it would be good political tactics on their part to take the things that were good, which we were doing, and to continue to do them and not be afraid to say that they were initiated by the inter-Party Government and had a certain merit.  We did not hesitate to say that we adopted some of the schemes which the Fianna Fáil Government were carrying out.</P>

      <P>We abandoned those of which we did not approve and we mentioned what they were, but the Minister has not the courage yet to say what he is going to abandon.  He is doing the thing in an oblique way, which is even more dishonourable than doing it in the direct way, because we could then challenge it directly.  I am not going to cover the ground that has been covered by my colleagues; there are other speakers who will deal with other aspects of the matter which require attention but I do assert, as I asserted as early as July last when the Minister for Finance talked of deficits in the Budget, that the Government will have collected on the 31st March at least £8,000,000, if not £10,000,000, more than the sum for which Deputy McGilligan budgeted as Minister for Finance in the last Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert that when they have that much to play with they are in a sound financial position and that they should not campaign against the economic interests of the country in order to gain <Col N="133" /> political kudos&mdash;which I think they will not get in any event&mdash;by criticising the actions of the inter-Party Government, who in three short years did more for the industrial and agricultural development of this country than had been done since the State was established.</P>
    <P>It is a sad commentary that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should say that, notwithstanding 16 years of government by Fianna Fáil, agricultural productivity has not increased one ounce&mdash;perhaps an ounce is too narrow, but that it did not increase to any extent, although at several periods during that time there were thousands of acres of wheat and thousands of acres of other crops sown. Yet, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, there was no appreciable increase in production and he contended, when Deputy Dillon stated that when there had been an increase, that that statement was not correct.  The fact of the matter is that production increased by 40 per cent. during our term of office.  Forty per cent. may not be enough; it could, in my opinion, be added to considerably but at least it is something of which we should be all proud.  Let us thank those who did that work, and in doing so perhaps we will be able to contribute something to building up the nation to the standard which we should all like to see it attain.  Whether we call certain individuals Daddy this or Daddy that, this is our country and we have to support and maintain it.</P>

      <P>The jingle bells of criticism from the Opposition Benches have been knocked from so many sides that they are now cracked and have a hollow sound.  One of the first criticisms from the Opposition Benches was on the question of credit.  A few moments ago Deputy O'Higgins criticised Ministers of the present Government for restricting credit, although we all understand that it is the fixed idea of the Opposition that we do not control any credit in this country and that it is controlled by forces outside the country.  That hardly works in with the general ideas that have been expressed all along.  Again, in the past we had our Ministers criticised for not meeting Ministers of a neighbouring <Col N="134" /> Government and at ministerial level; it was frequently alleged that they were sending departmental officers to discuss important matters of State.</P>
      <P>Now when Ministers go and meet Ministers of another Government on matters of general concern that does not satisfy the Opposition either.  They oppose just for opposition's sake, and not a single constructive idea of any kind comes from the whole lot of talk that goes on here all day long.  We begin with prayer, but after a while we find ourselves embroiled in some kind of an inferno, with all kinds of innuendoes and names being thrown across the floor of the House.  We had Deputy Dillon yesterday saying that the day had not yet come when a de Valera or a Childers could tell him how to behave in an Irish Parliament but, before Deputy Dillon had any part in an Irish Parliament, those names were associated with a Parliament established in this country while the forces of occupation were still very firmly here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is, and I am sorry, but how do you think any Irishman could listen in this House to statements of the kind to which I refer without expressing disagreement? But of course we are used to Deputy Dillon and to Deputy O'Higgins, and perhaps I should pass from them and not worry myself or worry the House with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins told us that if the Government had any confidence in themselves they should have issued another national loan last June, so as to increase further interest charges from the £3,500,000 which they were then, and the £7,000,000 they are now, to a still higher figure.  If there was so much confidence in the previous Government and in the programmes which they put before the country, how is it that a small loan for housing of only £300,000 could not fill to the extent of even one-third during the régime of the previous Government? Housing was one of the best parts of their programme; still when they asked the people to take up that loan, <Col N="135" /> the people absolutely refused, and the Government had to underwrite it.  Yet they talk about the people's confidence in them and in their programme, and about raising national loans to carry on the business of the country.  It all sounds very hollow to me, indeed, because, as I say, housing was one of the best programmes of the previous Government, due in a great measure to the interest which the Minister in charge of the Department took in it. At the same time we see the difficulties they experienced in financing it during that period.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about unemployment, and no doubt much of it is true.  The causes for that unemployment have been stressed so often that I think there is very little need to deal with them again except to say this, that Deputy Morrissey was surely hard driven for an argument to support his case when he had to go back and make comparisons with the days before the rural community were allowed to go on the unemployment register.  He had to go back that distance in order to try to establish a case for himself.</P>
    <P>We had a reference a while ago to the textile industry.  We were told by Deputy O'Higgins of what happened in 1947.  The point is that whatever was bought in 1947 was bought on a level market, but at the time Deputy O'Higgins referred to wool was bought at sky high prices.  The thousands and thousands of pounds which were lost on that transaction would have to pass down through the trade, the manufacturers, the retailers and the country itself.  The manufacturers were not prepared to face that, nor is the country prepared to stand those losses at the present time.  People are surely foolish to make comparisons with things which are entirely different.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the fuel situation in Cork during recent years.  This is to be said, that if it is true that turf was to be made available to the St. Vincent de Paul Society nobody in Cork knew anything about it&mdash;that is if Deputy Morrissey gave such an instruction to anybody.  It was said, too, that 9,000 tons of coal <Col N="136" /> were put in the barracks or somewhere else.  The point about that is that it was not made available to the citizens, whatever the cause and whoever had control over it.  The citizens were left without it.  As regards the turf which Deputy Morrissey said the St. Vincent de Paul Society refused, if that turf has been dumped somewhere the people of Cork are asking for it to be delivered to their homes and are prepared to burn it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a detail, but as the matter got such prominence yesterday I just want to say that I back up what Deputy McGrath said regarding it.  Deputy Morrissey said that Deputy McGrath was speaking untruths.  Well, I think I have a fair knowledge of that particular period and I know that Deputy McGrath was speaking what was absolutely true.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot said about the question of external assets.  We have been told that the Ministers made statements which have panicked the country.  Gracious me, are we ever going to grow up?  Surely we must have regard to the fact that the people of the country are not children but are very intelligent citizens.  They did not panic when far greater issues were before them.  Would any man tell me what is the difference between the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in Cork some months ago when he said that the country was facing grave problems and approaching a crisis, and what the Ministers said about that?  The Ministers stated that, unless we tackle these financial problems, national and international, there was the danger that in four or five years' time we, perhaps, would be in the same position as that in which some other countries which had not a proper regard for their finances find themselves this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were French Ministers afraid to tell the people of France the position that faced their country?  France is a country with vast resources and yet, in view of events there, France had to look for a loan from a little country <Col N="137" /> like Belgium.  If French Ministers were not afraid to tell the people of France about the position in their country, why should Ministers here be afraid to tell our people, thereby taking them into their confidence?  Is not that the way in which a Government should run a country?  The members of it should take the people into their confidence, tell them what the position is and give them all the facts and figures.  That is the position here. We have a Government able to deal with the position and one that will be with it.</P>
    <P>The question of unemployment is, perhaps, a harassing one.  Reference has already been made to the circumstances which have brought the present position about.  We know quite well that things are not progressing as perhaps they should in the building industry.  The industry is one that has had phases of that kind in the past. At times, skilled operatives go away and perhaps come back again to find certain disappointments caused by a certain turn of events.  Undoubtedly these things will be got over.  The question of a building programme, so that operatives could look forward to employment for some years ahead, with some sort of confidence, is a matter to be tackled by the Government of the day, by local authorities, by private builders and those who want to build houses for themselves.  The point is that that position has not yet been established on a sufficiently progressive basis to give the confidence that we would all like to see for those engaged in the industry.  I, for my part, am quite prepared to make whatever contribution I can to have that position solved.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial development, we saw what happened at the last change of Government.  We had skilled operatives in the aeroplane industry at Shannon.  We know that the whole thing was scrapped and that 200 or 300 men had to go to Bristol or some other centre.  The pilots had to go to Pakistan or to Holland.  All that was burst up when the change of Government took place.  Whatever Government is in power in any well-developed <Col N="138" /> country should have a right sense of national development so that a scheme like that would not be upset as it was here at the time of the last change of Government.</P>
    <P>There were other matters referred to yesterday.  I will not refer to them again because they are too painfully obvious for any further criticism.  To-night, Deputy O'Higgins said that the statements of Ministers here had given Sir Basil Brooke a lot of material with which to criticise this country.  We know quite well that, in the past, the chief campaign of the North against the South was due to statements made by people who now sit on the Opposition Benches, statements concerning social welfare schemes, etc.  Yet, those on the opposite benches were three and a half years in office, and they did nothing themselves about their social welfare schemes.  Sometimes one almost despairs of any kind of constructive idea ever emanating from the Opposition Benches or that, if there are such ideas, they will pursue them.</P>
    <P>That is particularly true in relation to agriculture.  Agriculture is our staple industry and, irrespective of whatever Government is in office, there should always be a progressive policy in relation to that industry.  The idea is generally held that we should produce ourselves, in so far as we can, sufficient to meet the needs of our own people.  At one time it was the policy to produce wheat and beet and the other essentials our people required. Another Government comes into office and that policy of self-sufficiency is immediately knocked on the head by a Minister who openly says he would not be seen dead in a field of wheat, or in a field of beet, and who reverts to a grassland policy.</P>
    <P>With all these upsets, how can the country progress?  How can the people have any confidence?  Fortunately our people are fairly sensible.  They have passed through enough vicissitudes to appreciate when they are well off and they know now that they have a Government that will give them a lead which they will be prepared to follow. In that way they will play their part in national development.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about <Col N="139" /> unemployment.  Yet, the farmers in certain parts of the country cannot get labour.  They cannot get labour because agricultural policy has suffered so many upsets the confidence of the people has been undermined and those who might be prospective agricultural labourers seek employment elsewhere. If farmers go into grass one year, into tillage the next and back into grass again their workers will not have any great confidence in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is at present building cottages for its workers.  Something on the same lines should be done for agricultural workers and their cottages should not be built on the worst acre of land on an isolated part of the farm. They should be built in groups and not too far away from villages, bus routes and avenues of transport so that these people may get some of the amenities they deserve after all their hard work, work which is governed to a large extent by weather and other conditions.</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with finance because finance is something very few people understand.  Financial problems are something with which those responsible for the national purse must grapple when the necessity arises.  In regard to credit for national development, I think this Government has always shown itself in the past and will continue to show itself in the future as being in no way in favour of any restriction in that respect.  We have our reafforestation scheme and the Minister told us the other day that it was not sufficient merely to erect barbed wire and call that afforestation.</P>
    <P>During the emergency forests were cut down.  They have never been replanted. During the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government's régime nothing was done to ensure replanting. They made a pretence of putting a spade under a sod, sticking in some kind of plant and saying that was replanting.  Nobody worried as to whether or not they were replanting the forests that had been denuded of timber.  Something more than big State forests is necessary.  There is good land in the glens throughout the country which would be very suitable <Col N="140" /> for afforestation, but I think we should have smaller units dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Our provinces are provinces in name only.  We have Munster and Leinster and Connacht and Ulster, but there is no attempt at decentralisation in working the affairs of these provinces in the way they should be worked if smaller units were dealing with them.  The Electricity Supply Board does that in some degree and so does Bord na Móna.  I think small units should be established in each of the provinces for the proper development of afforestation and other national works of that character, because decentralisation of that kind would bring about more stable progress.</P>
    <P>Our people look around them and they see the state of the world.  They see the state of their own country, and they consider what they can do to make the future safe for themselves and for their families by building up a sound economy.  So-called panic speeches have very little effect on them; indeed the panic is, I believe, so much wishful thinking.  Our people will face their difficulties in the future as they have faced them in the past and, wisely led, they will resolve them.</P>

      <P>For the past two days a tug-of-war has been waged here on the floor of the House between the main Opposition speakers and those on the Government Benches as to which of them understands the financial position, and which of them is best capable of solving it.  All of them are agreed that a problem exists, and in turn, they accuse one another of not facing up to the best way of solving that problem.  We have been treated to quotations about our sterling assets and our financial stability.  The Government speakers have treated us to the reverse of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from the West of Ireland and representing a constituency comprised of small farmers ranging from £3 10s. to £15 valuation and taking note that during the discussion here every Deputy from Deputy Byrne, representing the City of Dublin, to the humblest Deputy representing rural constituencies, has emphasised the importance of the farmer and the part he is expected to pay in bringing about <Col N="141" /> a solution to the problem that confronts us in relation to our balance of payments, I feel compelled to enter the arena on his behalf.  While these Deputies appreciate that the solution of the problem rests with the farming community, many of them convey the impression at the same time that the farming community is the best off section of our community at the present time.  Some of them were even anxious to castigate the farming community and they emphasised in the course of their speeches that, if consideration is to be given to the various sections of our community, the farmers should be the last to be considered although the solution to our problem, namely, increased production, is supposed to lie with them.</P>
    <P>If this problem we hear so much about is so great and if a solution is essential in order to ensure stability and development and the preservation of this nation, the kind of debate that has taken place in the last few days and that we have had since the change of Government and, indeed, since the establishment of this State over 30 years ago, will not tend towards the securing of that solution.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if we are anxious to serve the people who sent us here the time is ripe for the establishment of a national Government with all Parties playing their part in trying to solve this problem and trying to do the best for the nation.  If we are frank and truthful, we must admit that the difference that exists between all Parties is very negligible and hardly noticeable.  We do our best from time to time to make believe that a difference does exist by exploiting little points and trying to create propaganda with only one objective in view, namely, trying to secure office as the Government of the country.  When the Government on that side of the House comes over to this side they play the same part, hoping to get back to the other side of the House again. Their main objective is office and not service to the people who sent them here.  The people are beginning slowly but surely to realise that.  Little notice is taken by the ordinary individual in the street or in the country of what is done or said in this House, <Col N="142" /> because they believe that we are insincere, that we are merely castigating one another for the sake of doing so or with the desire, by fair or foul means, to get to the Government side of the House.  That goes for all Parties in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account covers a wide field.  I understand that we cannot go into the details of the Estimates, but only deal with them generally, and I intend to do that.  As I said, the solution of this financial problem depends wholly and solely on the agricultural community.  I do not wish to minimise the part which industry plays in the life of the nation. I only wish that we had a more evenly balanced economy.  That is essential and should be one of the main planks in the platform of any Government responsible for the administration of this country.  We should have a more evenly balanced economy, with a view to securing employment for the young men and women who are unable to secure employment on the land and keeping them at home.  For that reason, I would support any Government or Minister in promoting and encouraging the development of industry. For the time being we must appreciate that agriculture is the principle industry.  That being so, every attention should be given to that industry with a view to aiding and helping it.  That aid and that help have not been forthcoming from any Government in this country over a period of years.  During their three years of office, the inter-Party Government tried to lead this House to believe that they had provided full employment and that they were interested in the farming community.  I admit that they did a certain amount, but I do not agree that they did all that they should have done or could have done.  I am, therefore, appealing to the Minister for Agriculture to continue the aid that was given by his predecessor in the inter-Party Government to the agricultural industry.  If I have anything against the inter-Party <Col N="143" /> Government, it is that they did not do more in that direction.  I am disappointed with what has happened in connection with one of the principal Acts passed by the inter-Party Government, namely, the Local Authorities (Works) Act initiated by the then Minister for Local Government which brought such benefit to the small farmers.  We must remember that the small farmer is the mainstay of the country&mdash;the man with a valuation of from £5 to £25.  He does not need any inspector to force him to work or to cultivate his land.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act helped to bring up his little holding to a more economic standard by removing the surplus water from the land. I am more than surprised that the Minister for Local Government. Deputy Smith, permitted as conservative a Minister for Finance as was ever in the British House of Commons in the diehard Tory days to cut down the money provided under that Act yearly, thus depriving the small farmer of one of the means whereby he could increase production by removing the water from his waterlogged land.  The Minister for Local Government represents County Cavan, where 90 per cent. of the farmers have valuations such as I have mentioned, and he will be appealing to these farmers for increased production. How does he expect them to increase production when the only assistance they got over a period of years from any Government is now being reduced considerably, and they will have to continue to live on their flooded land?  I cannot understand why the Minister for Local Government should permit the Minister for Finance to dictate to him what sum was to be allocated for that particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That scheme was a boon in my county.  It provided employment and wages for the workers, and it brought the little holdings up to a better standard of production.  To-day in my county we have complete stagnation. In every single labour exchange in North and South Mayo the number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance has risen to more than double, and in some cases it has <Col N="144" /> trebled.  Is it not a reflection on present administration and on the present Minister for Finance to produce a book of this type here?  It is a very conservative book of Estimates which has hit the poorer section of the community by depriving them of more than £500,000 for the relief of flooding on their land.</P>
    <P>Let us come to reafforestation, about which Deputy MacGrath, of Cork, seemed to be shedding some tears a few minutes ago.  We find a cut of over £200,000 in that section of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into the matter in detail.  I am reserving that for the Estimate when it comes before the House.  I am pointing to the fact that you have a considerable reduction in the forestry section and, taking into account the huge increase in unemployment that there is in housing, afforestation and drainage, I cannot understand a reduction in the 1952-53 Estimates as compared with those for 1950-51.</P>
      <P>In the field of housing throughout the whole of County Mayo during the inter-Party Government's administration there was not a town or parish but had a large number of houses being erected.  In the town nearest to where I live, Swinford, we had 28 beautiful cottages in the course of erection during the inter-Party Government's term of administration.  For more than 60 years, since the days when there was an old district union in the town of Swinford, many of the poor, humble people of that particular town were living in houses which were condemned, and some of them are still living there.  It took the enterprise of a Labour Minister to initiate a housing drive that had not been experienced in this country since the establishment of this House.  The result is that we have had more houses erected in County Mayo than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the scheme which the present Minister for Local Government has in mind is to continue as it has continued over the past seven or eight months, <Col N="145" /> we will have very few houses built. The stagnation which is taking place in Mayo as regards housing is negligible in comparison with what is happening throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  In Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and elsewhere we have similar circumstances with greater hardship accuring.</P>
    <P>During the inter-Party Government's administration, that Government invited young men to come back to Ireland as carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, plasterers, plumbers&mdash;all kinds of artisans connected with housing construction.  Many of those men broke up their homes and brought their wives and families back to this country in the belief and on the guarantee that they would have full employment, decent wages and housing conditions for a period of years.  These men are on the dole to-day in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda and elsewhere.  They have no alternative but to face the emigrant ship again, and in facing the emigrant ship they must leave their wives and families behind because they cannot provide homes for them in England.  Is not that a terrible state of affairs?  What does the Department of Local Government intend to do to ease the situation?  What is Government policy in regard to this matter?  Have they investigated the causes which have brought about such stagnation in that particular industry?</P>
    <P>We must accept that that stagnation, that austerity, that has taken place over the past eight or nine months has come about solely as a result of the speeches delivered by Ministers on the Government Benches. The humblest and simplest citizens in the land could not but believe and accept that there is something the matter in this country when they read those speeches by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and their other colleagues, assisted very ably by some of the back benchers.  Those speeches have resulted in mass unemployment, mass poverty, mass suffering, with no hope being held out&mdash;except the hope that Fianna Fáil cherished of some political <Col N="146" /> gain by trying to put across on their predecessors the responsibility for some crisis which they wanted to convince people was away in the background and coming shortly to a head.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Finance appreciate the seriousness of the situation? On whom is he prepared to place the responsibility for this situation? Does he not acknowledge that there are over 74,000 registered insured workers on the unemployment list at the present moment?  Does he not recognise that in a short period of six or seven months an increase of over 10,000 in the numbers of unemployed has taken place?  To whom is he prepared to attribute the blame for this situation?  If he is fair to this House and to himself he must accept that blame arising out of his irresponsible speeches throughout the country, as also must his colleagues, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It was most remarkable that when this Government took over control, the Taoiseach visited the City of Galway and made there startling revelations as regards conditions across the water; he then went on to enlarge on that by telling us that he could not understand why Irish boys and girls went away to seek employment where conditions, wages and so one, were inferior to those prevailing here; that they should come back as conditions were much better here.  Seemingly he was chastised by his colleagues when he returned to Dublin, and then helter skelter through the country they went making speeches totally opposite to that of the Taoiseach.  Instead of asking those boys and girls to come back to Ireland they proceeded to tell them and to tell the world that we were a bankrupt nation, that we were in financial difficulties, that there was no money available for any enterprising work, and to inform the banks that we must restrict credit.  Further, they agreed with the conservative report of the Central Bank, the report which indicated that the numbers in employment were so satisfactory and the wages and conditions were so secure and so comfortable, that a restriction of credit would not do any injury; that a few more unemployed, a little more poverty and less houses <Col N="147" /> for the poor would not do any harm. I remember interjecting a question to the Taoiseach when he was speaking in the House, and he said that these gentlement were not aware that unemployment was so grave or emigration so great.  Imagine the chairman and the directors of the Central Bank compiling a report of this kind and being unaware that unemployment is so great and the incidence of emigration so large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jack Lynch spoke in this House this evening and I must confess that I felt a certain amount of pity for him.  He was most embarrassed and most apologetic because of the manner in which his Government was carrying on.  Admittedly, he appears to be a rather shy man, but on this occasion he appeared more shy and more embarrassed than usual.  I can well understand that, seeing that he has to defend the policy and the conduct of his colleagues over a period of nine months.  That would embarrass any Deputy.</P>
    <P>We can see nothing in the Book of Estimates which indicates that unemployment will cease during the next 12 months, that housing will increase or that work generally will be provided for the young men and young women of this country.  We are entitled to assume, therefore, that there will be a further increase in the number registered at the labour exchanges and also a further increase in the number of emigrants.</P>
    <P>During the three years of the inter-Party Government's administration I had the privilege of sitting on the fence outside and of endeavouring to be capable of reading between the lines.  It was most interesting to note the pictures that appeared in the Press during that period.  One particular picture comes to my mind, which showed the then Minister for External Affairs boarding a tender in Cobh with a group of Irish emigrants.  How they tried to capitalise that incident and how they tried to make out the failure of the inter-Party Government to stop emigration!  That was only one of the many pictures that appeared showing boys and girls leaving this country in <Col N="148" /> their thousands.  Then they tried to compare the figures during the first year and during the second half of the inter-Party Government's administration with the figures for 1945 and 1946, when emigration was restricted.  When I became a member of this House I remember 200 people meeting outside the Dáil seeking travel permits.</P>
    <P>If there was no restriction on emigration during the war years, nobody would have remained in this country.  Immediately the restriction was removed, there was an increase in emigration.  In the first and second years of the inter-Party Government's administration people were seeking permits to emigrate, but during the third year of that administration emigration was considerably reduced. During that period also the census returns showed that there had been an increase in the population.  In my constituency during that period, it was very difficult to find a man in need of employment.  Every man anxious to work or capable of working was engaged on road work, on drainage work, or on afforestation.  An abundance of labour was available.  Let one go to any town in County Mayo at the present time which has a labour exchange, or a post office which pays out unemployment assistance, and one will find there on a certain day of the week a large number of young men drawing such assistance&mdash;men who, heretofore, were engaged in remunerative employment on the bogs, on road work, or on afforestation.  On the 29th September, 1951, 303 males were in receipt of unemployment assistance in Ballina.</P>

In Ballinrobe on the 29th September, 1951, 221 males were receiving such assistance, but by November of that year the figure had risen to 426.</P>

      <P>In September, 1951, the male recipients of unemployment assistance in Belmullet numbered 854 and by November, 1951, the figure had reached 1,150.  Similar circumstances prevail in Swinford, Claremorris, Sligo, Westport, etc.  In fact in these towns the figures have trebled arising out of the fact that the rural improvements schemes, the minor employment schemes, the turf development schemes and the Local Authorities (Works) Act are not in operation.  There is no employment of any type in these towns, only complete stagnation.  No matter what the Minister may say about the Employment Period Order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or whether the Minister agrees or disagrees with the figures I have given, let him go down to my county and he will see that the figures given by me are correct.  The numbers of unemployed have increased by over 10,000.  Is that not correct? That increase is not confined to any particular city or town but is spread out over the whole Twenty-Six Counties. I am sure Mayo is not an exception as far as unemployment is concerned because it is the least concern of any Government in this House.  I fail to understand the mentality of a Government who are prepared to close their eyes to a situation such as I have outlined.  This is the Government which got into power by misrepresentation, to say the least of it and by misrepresenting circumstances to the electorate.  I recall that, during the election campaign, Deputy Moran, who sits on the opposite side of the House, accused the inter-Party Government of being the only Government outside the Iron Curtain who engaged in the black marketing of flour, butter, tea, sugar and other essential commodities.  The inter-Party Government were accused of this on every platform in my constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that it is scarcely relevant.  My reason for mentioning it is that the Fianna Fáil Party objected to the dual price system.  However, they did not do away with the system when they came into office, although, heretofore, they had deplored it.  We were led to believe that the dual price system was introduced to facilitate the rich rather than the poor.  Being a rich man's Government, this Government was anxious to facilitate the rich, but the poor had to do with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Seemingly, on the assumption of office, the Tánaiste and his colleagues had to acknowledge the wisdom of the dual price system, and they kept it in being.  We do not hear a word about its abolition to-day, and neither do we hear anything to the effect that the Government is engaging in the black marketing of essential commodities. Seemingly he thought that there are no poor now; they are all rich, and it does not matter.  That is what Deputy Moran and his colleagues will be telling us when they go down to Mayo during the next election campaign.</P>
      <P>It is not essential to start looking up statistics, nor is it essential to start arguing about our external assets or our balance of payments in order to discover how this country stands.  Let any Minister of State, if he feels embarrassed&mdash;and I can well imagine him feeling so&mdash;go in disguise to Westland Row, Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall and see for himself the hundreds of young men and women who are emigrating.  Let him look at the large number of unemployed in receipt of all kinds of assistance.  And remember, the number of unemployed does not represent the number who are workless.  There are thousands and thousands of able-bodied men in rural Ireland who would not go to the labour exchange to receive the miserable pittance offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their self-respect would not permit <Col N="151" /> them to do so.  Sons of small farmers could not get a day's work if they went on their knees and begged it.  They have to go to America and elsewhere. Then we hear so much baloney in this House about this nation's future, its economic make-up, and what is in store for the country.  That &ldquo;future&rdquo; was in store for this nation long before I was born, but it has not arrived yet. I am convinced that so long as you have this kind of debate between ex-Ministers and Ministers of State the conditions that have existed over the last 30 years will continue to exist.</P>
    <P>I confidently believe that the Opposition are not seeking to discover a solution, because they would have nothing to talk about if a solution were discovered.  They try to make a comparison between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six Counties.  Are not they the men who tell us that the Six Counties are in bondage, and not free to develop their own country?  Are not the members of the Government the people who tell us that a big percentage of their revenue has got to be given to the British Government?  It is time enough to make a comparison with the Six Counties when the Six Counties have complete autonomy.  We should not make comparisons with any nation.  We have been spared the havoc of war, and we have been left, through the mercy of Providence, to develop and prepare post-war plans.</P>
    <P>A great deal was talked about post-war plans during the four or five years the war was on, but we see no result of these post-war plans.  They are pigeon-holed like the Drainage Bill and many other Bills the Taoiseach introduced.  They have produced no fruit.  All the Taoiseach needed was something to carry him along in the field of propaganda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jack Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, tried to convince us in regard to all the plans that were undertaken, plans such as the Tourist Bill and the Undeveloped Areas Bill and all these other Bills about which we have heard so much for the past nine months.  If the Parliamentary Secretary travels down with me on the train to Mayo on Friday he will hear what the young men and women, who <Col N="152" /> crossed over to Ireland on the <i>Princess Maud</i> and who were stranded in Dublin over St. Patrick's Day, thought about him and his Government.  On leaving the boat, these young men and women were pitched into the train like cattle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to go into detail now but I can assure the Chair, with all respect, that I intend to deal with all these matters in more detail when the opportunity presents itself.  I must, however, refer to what Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, said here this afternoon, when he tried to convince us that the Government were really serious about solving the problem and meeting the situation as it exists.  To support his case he mentioned the Tourist Bill and the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I was surprised and amazed when he did not launch out and tell us what has happened since the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I see no change in Mayo, and I prophesy that there will not be any.</P>
      <P>If we are to narrow the gap that exists in our balance of payments and if this is supposed to be as serious as we are told it is by our financial experts and by our Minister for Finance who, I suppose, must be a financial expert, I believe there is only one way of closing that gap and that is by aiding the farming community to increase production to provide not only for our home requirements but also for export.  You cannot have that increased production unless and until you come to the aid of the farming community.  As I have said, I see nothing in the Book of Estimates that will come to the aid of the farming community from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have got from the opposite side of the House as regards the farming community is a threat from Deputy Dr. Browne that if the farmers do not cultivate their land he will have it confiscated. I do not think that the Russian iron heel has come here yet, nor do I think that the farmers would tolerate the Russian iron heel.  If <Col N="153" /> Deputy Dr. Browne wishes to introduce that philosophy into Dáil Éireann, he is making an awful mistake.  He does not know the peasant farmer yet.  That is one of the methods which the Government&mdash;and Deputy Dr. Browne is a member of the Government side of the House&mdash;has as a solution to the problem, the confiscation of the farmer's land if they do not do as the Government like.</P>
    <P>The second method of solving the problem came from the Tánaiste, that if the farmers did not do their duty on this occasion it would be the last chance they would get, and that other methods and means would be found to force them to do it.  The Opposition endeavoured to discover what the Tánaiste meant by the other methods and means, but he sidetracked the reply and refused to give it some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>If these are the only things the Government have to offer the farming community, the sooner they shed the responsibility of Government the better.  If there was an election to morrow, I and other Deputies might not come back, but it is absolutely certain that the Government in office would not come back.  That is certain. You would have a change of Government no matter what change that would be.  That is as clear as a pikestaff to everybody.  There is complete dissatisfaction in the cities, towns and villages throughout the country with the conduct of the Government in every single sphere of administration. There is no point in repeating what they have already said.</P>
    <P>We, in the Clann na Talmhan Party, claim to represent, to the best of our ability, the farming community. We have a keen interest in their welfare and in the development of the agricultural industry.  The people engaged in that industry comprise the principal section of the community. They have been, heretofore, and I expect that they will be for many a long day in the future, in the front line of the trenches.  We have always found them reasonable and patriotic, and they have responded to every emergency.  They have stood by the nation in the darkest as well as the <Col N="154" /> brightest days.  In recognition of their response and good citizenship, the least an Irish Government could do would be to give them first consideration. The increase given to the dairy farmers by the Minister for Agriculture has not produced the result that the Minister anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, Sir.  We are still importing butter.  That butter has to be paid for with dollars and dollars are scarce.  I do not believe that we will get increased production in that respect until other methods are adopted and until more favourable consideration is given to the dairy farmer.</P>
      <P>We are here to represent all sections of the farming community&mdash;the mixed tillage farmer and the dairy farmer. Any Government that claims to have the interests of Ireland at heart and is anxious to develop this country so as to ensure that we will be able to meet our commitments at home and abroad should take full cognisance of the importance of that industry.  I regret that neither I nor any member of the Party of which I am a member can say that the change of Government has meant any more favourable consideration for the farming community. The farming community are as dissatisfied to-day as they were under the inter-Party Government&mdash; although I am convinced that, in Deputy Dillon, they had one of the best Ministers for Agriculture since the establishment of this State.  I may not agree with Deputy Dillon in every respect but, whatever else may be said about him, as head of the Department of Agriculture he had his heart and soul in his work.  He did not work for the miserable salary which he drew as a Minister but because he was anxious to give honest and untiring service in the cause of the Irish farming community.  They appreciate the service which he rendered and the aid and assistance which he gave to them.  The land rehabilitation scheme will be a monument to Deputy Dillon long after he is dead.</P>

I do not believe <Col N="156" /> that there is any need for extra taxation.

He will inform us that, once again, Fianna Fáil have taken the affairs of this nation out of the fire and that only Fianna Fáil could have done that.  The reason for the contents of this Book of Estimates is that the Fianna Fáil Government want to increase taxation.  However, the people of this country will not be deceived.  They are well aware of the situation.  They are as capable of going into matters of this kind as any Deputy in this House.  It is sometimes most amusing to hear some of these enlightened citizens give their views on the speeches made by various politicians, and especially on the views expressed by the present Minister for Finance in regard to taxation, deflation, the depletion of our sterling assets, the balance of payments and all the other subjects which have been referred to by him in the course of the past eight or nine months.
