    <Title>Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has generally been accepted as the forum <Col N="657" /> from which each Deputy can air not only his grievances against the general implementation of Government policy, the nature of that policy, but also air in a specific way the many difficulties he may encounter locally in his constituency. While at stages of my contribution to-day I may refer to specific problems, my approach, in the main, will be to the broad general issue of the consequences of a Government policy which initially was based on false premises.  The conclusions arrived at were erroneous.  The method adopted to remedy the difficulties that might have existed in the economic system was, in fact, in its ultimate effect a chaotic effort, an effort which has led to complete unrest in business, insecurity in employment and a general weakness manifesting itself in unrest and uncertainty in the community.  I hope to demonstrate clearly that all this has been the inevitable consequence of Government stupidity.</P>
      <P>One must start with the general over-all picture that is covered by the various Orders and the various enactments which this Bill seeks to continue. One must inevitably go back to the general structure of Government control which, unfortunately, has the tendency to encroach further and further on individual liberty and freedom, and it is in that situation that we get an opportunity here in Parliament to raise a wide range of topics because I cannot conceive any subject which can be raised on this measure that is not in some way related to some Order continued under this Bill, Orders of which I do not believe the Minister has any knowledge or of which any Department of State can give you full details and certainly Orders many of which I know the Stationery Office cannot supply.  So you have the general position of re-enactment by this Bill for a period of a year of a good many Orders, the nature of which is abstruse but the effect of which can be very serious on the general economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of my discourse to-day, I propose to try, without any heat, to bring into a deliberate pattern the contribution I have to make and where I offer criticism of Government <Col N="658" /> activity, I trust that I shall be able to offer an alternative constructive idea.  My approach to this problem is not so much an approach on the basis of politics as on the basis of economics. I propose to take the view which is now generally accepted, even by the most diehard supporter of the Government, that the Government have been a catastrophic failure, that they are living on borrowed time and that their notice to quit has expired.  We have to demonstrate here in a responsible way the consequences which will ensue if this Government does not take into consideration the present temper of the people and do either of two things: drastically amend its approach to the economy of the country, or get out and make way for a Government who will.</P>
    <P>The situation has been reached politically where a succession of bludgeoning and butchering taxation imposts, rising unemployment, with uncertainty in unemployment, short time and half-time, have so aggravated the mood of the people that they now realise in the fullest possible way, with the impact of Government activity being felt in their very larders and falling on the very smallest of their essential commodities, how true indeed is what we believe, that this Government is on a taxation rampage, completely indifferent to the distress or trouble that such a campaign may cause.  That is the present general situation.  The country is thoroughly and unequivocably tired of this Government, of its ineptitude and its inability to tackle the situation.  I propose to contrast the present operations of the Government with what I believe could and should be the approach of any Government in present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, we must place responsibility as the creator of this atmosphere of gloom and discontent not on the present Minister, who, I may say, I do not believe had any convictions which would compel him to align himself with the harsh and doleful utterances of the Minister for Finance.  The chief architect of this policy is the Minister for Finance.  We shall have to analyse the premises on which he built his policy and show how erroneous <Col N="659" /> was his conception; we shall have to analyse how incalculably stupid were his suggested remedies and show in a realistic way how disastrous is the effect not only on industry, business and trade but&mdash;and this is where it has its toughest and hardest impact&mdash; on what I describe as the limited earning group, whether tradesmen, labourers or small salary earners.</P>
    <P>We have to take responsibility in this House for demonstrating to the country not only the weaknesses in the Government but the real solution which we offer and I suggest that our effort must fail, unless we offer such a solution.  I feel it my responsibility to do that, so far as I am able, because I think it is our bounden duty, in our representative character, to give the Government, in their present muddle, what help and assistance we can, not that they may preserve their being, but that they may at least ease the strain on the people whom they purport to lead and whom, in recent months, they seem to wish to bludgeon and grind down.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast the situation with the situation when, two short years ago, my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced this measure. The Fianna Fáil wails and bleats would have torn the heart of the loneliest and wildest banshee ever conceived in our traditional literature.  From all quarters and areas of the country came tremendous remonstration about the cost of living and a particular Deputy excelled himself in a way which was consistent with his mathematical training. Deputy Vivion de Valera came in here, and, in a tremendously long discourse, referred to no fewer than 170 odd commodities which had gone up. They had gone up then, but there is not one of these commodities that does not show a far greater increase since. He now, however, is in the dumb servitude of the Whip, a silent Deputy no longer interested in the fact that the housewife in Dublin whom he represents has to pay more for tea, sugar, bread, butter, flour and a wide range of tinned and packet goods normally used in the house, as well as an inordinately increased price for <Col N="660" /> many of the other semi-essential commodities&mdash;such items as various items of scullery and kitchen equipment, different types of articles like blankets and sheets and other requirements of that nature which inevitably must be replaced from time to time to keep a normal standard of life in the home.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not think for a moment that I am going to try and lay the responsibility for the inordinate increases in wool prices or the external difficulties which affected us at his door&mdash;I do not believe that serves any purpose&mdash;but I do think that there are a tremendous number of increases in essential commodities which, although they were consistently and persistently resisted by the previous Government, have now been given with gay abandon, without the necessary investigation, without indeed a proper approach to the problem of basic costings or any consideration of the effect of their impact on the general community. We had a situation when Fianna Fáil took office that we had a country geared for expansion, a country that had been taught a new faith. It had been taught, first of all, a new political doctrine, one that was, of course, sneered at and jeered at, for with various types of gavottes and cavorts, the Fianna Fáil Party tried to discredit the inter-Party Government. They found, apparently, something obnoxious in the capacity of Irishmen with different political creeds being able to sink those parts of their policy which may have been non-essential or impracticable of implementation into a common basis from which they could work together for the common interests of the Irish people to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>It does not really seem extraordinary to me that the Fianna Fáil Party should be so loud and virulent and persistent in its denunciation of that spirit of unity which we were able to bring into a concerted effort in order to give all groups of the Irish people full representative Government, a Government in which the lowest industrial worker could sit down with the farmer and the businessman and iron out problems of mutual importance to them all.  That fundamental spirit <Col N="661" /> of co-operation was completely condemned by the Party which was then in opposition.  The bleats that arose on the Supplies and Services Bill were directed at the impossibility of this and the impracticability of that.  The Fianna Fáil Party do not want any portents of unity in the remaining sections of this country for that unity spells inevitably and irretrievably the ultimate elimination of their very effective political machine and political Party.  But in the light of all that, they still come here to-day, masters of a Government policy by virtue of another unity, another Coalition&mdash;by virtue of the Four Doubtfuls.  I do not believe that anybody, not even as brilliant a political manoeuvrer as the Tánaiste himself, would have the capacity to gauge what is the basic approach to Irish life of Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, Deputy Peader Cowan or Deputy Cogan.  We have a kind of pseudo-socialist-communist approach by the young doctor who allows everything to be coloured by a personal viciousness against his former colleagues.  Deputy Peadar Cowan has been able to succeed in political gymnastics that do not involve merely a one and a half somersault but a kind of concentrated gymnastic effort by which he can do one and a half somersaults forward and at the same time two somersaults backwards. Deputy Cogan is again actuated in the main by his belief that Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture had not bowed to what he considered his superior wisdom.</P>
    <P>It is hard to know whether that concentrated wisdom is not now the guiding inspiration of a Government that cannot control a country in any reasonable way.  But let us start in this discussion by impressing on the Government, as has been impressed on them before, that they are, in fact, a minority Government supported by four Independents who fear a general election more than the devil fears holy water.  They are holding office in a situation where the country's general economic position is worsening while the people have clearly demonstrated their anxiety by a vote to see whether or not they condone and confirm the Government's idea of policy.  There <Col N="662" /> has been a change, as I explained, from a country geared up to expansion with a tremendous impetus in its housing drive.  The situation before that change was that Deputy Keyes, then Minister for Local Government, was able to invite and encourage home to this country our skilled tradesmen who had to go abroad.  In the building trade here there was at that time good employment and an expanding effort.  Everybody knows what the situation is now even though Deputy Briscoe will glibly say that more houses were constructed last year, neglecting, of course, to say anything about the period of office when those plans were made.  But face the reality: there are infinitely less people in employment in the building trade in Dublin to-day, there is growing unrest in the building trade and the threat of further disemployment.  There is, as the result of Government activity, a serious slowing-up and a tremendous impact on the psychology that was growing up among our people to build their own homes where the local authority was not able to supply them. It took a while of deliberate and constructive Government effort to develop that psychological approach among so many boys and girls who were about to be married, to encourage them to get together, by each couple's joint effort, the necessary deposits and to go ahead with the building of their own homes.</P>
    <P>That psychology has been disrupted and bludgeoned by the savage impositions which are a result of the effort of the Minister for Finance in his recent loan.  He glibly told us in the House that he paid £75,000 to the banks to underwrite a £20,000,000 national loan that was offered at 5 per cent. when even the least financially wise of us knew that a loan issued at such an amazingly attractive rate was bound to be over-subscribed.  A Government that can do that, that can give £140,000 to dance-hall proprietors because they are unable to collect it, that can increase the burden on people who are contemplating building houses of their own, are killing the initiative and effort that was making for a better social standard in that class of the community <Col N="663" /> and was ensuring the continuation of employment in the building trade.</P>
    <P>During the period of office of the previous Government there was an impetus to expand industrial employment. I have always given unqualified credit to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce for efforts he has made in the establishment, propagation and development of Irish industry and he will recognise that during the period of office of his predecessor there was a considerable expansion of employment in industry that ran into figures of 1,000 per month.  That was the situation.  There was a flow of capital into Irish industry, a general impetus in trade, a general higher standard of living.  The people were cheerful, which was evident proof of expanding economy, of permanence of employment and of the forward march of the country.  That was the picture in industry.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, after the spearhead and concerted attack on the personality of one individual had fallen to the ground, the constructive effort of a Minister for Agriculture who had returned to the basic principle of one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough, and who had pursued a policy of directing and encouraging and leading the Irish farmer as distinct from the policy of compelling and controlling of a previous Government, had begun to show dividends.  The Irish farmer was re-established in his self-respect and as master of his farm and was trying in every way, as he always had done, to do his part in stabilising the economy. There was the scheme of land rehabilitation in full operation and subsidiary schemes such as the ground limestone scheme, drainage schemes.  As a monument to the memory of the late Mr. T.J. Murphy, throughout rural Ireland there was productive employment being given under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, on roads, for the benefit of people who, with patience and fortitude, had struggled for a living on isolated holdings and who had made their contribution to <Col N="664" /> the Irish economy.  By that legislation, and in giving money from the Exchequer without cost to the local authority for that type of work, the previous Government showed its consciousness of and interest in the problem of the person living in isolated or inaccessible farms and their anxiety to improve his lot.</P>
    <P>There is a picture that is reflected in facts and figures.  During our period of office as an inter-Party Government we had been able to give a substantial measure of justice to people who had been subjected to the barrier of a wage freeze Order by the previous Government. We were told that the heads and, indeed, the skeleton of a Bill were there in fact in 1948 to continue that policy.  That has been a matter of discourse in the House.  I shall not put it any further than that it was evidence of the approach of the Fianna Fáil Government to the wage earner and the wage problem.</P>
    <P>The fact that it wants such a ceiling typifies the ineptitude of a Government. What did we do?  We succeeded in our period of office in giving substantial rises, not only once, but twice and in some cases three times, to sections of workers whose claims had been too long denied and at the same time we were able to keep stability in the cost of living.  We were not able to keep it completely stable after the outbreak of the Korean conflict, but prior to that we were able to maintain a stability in the cost of living.  We were not able to reduce it but we were able to maintain a reasonable stability and at the same time we were able to increase the earnings of the people who endured the severest impact of the cost of living and to put them in a better position to meet it.</P>
    <P>In other words, in succinct language, the position was simply this&mdash;that the cost of living remained virtually stable for a long period while the pay packet going to the housewife became fatter by at least two increases and in some cases by three increases.  She had more money with which to meet the impact of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>What is the contrast to-day?  We <Col N="665" /> have the absolutely diametrically opposite case; the pay packet is virtually the same while the cost of living has soared astronomically.  I shall be fair to the Minister and, instead of taking the optimum figure, I will put the increase in the cost of living at about 15 per cent.  There has been no commensurate increase in the earning capacity of the people who are hardest hit by the cost of living. Instead, there has been rising unemployment, half-time and insecurity in employment.  That is the Government's contribution in the general economy to the pattern that they raved about, that they howled about with the penetrating howl of the lone coyote, when they were here in opposition.  When they set their hand to the task of the control and management of the country, overnight, over a week, in the first month, we had a catastrophic increase in the price of certain commodities that are consumed by the general householder.</P>
    <P>Then we had the evidence of their approach to the Irish people.  First of all there was a wail of gloom, a false, hysterical atmosphere created by speeches of the Minister for Finance and his chorus, the deep voice of the Tánaiste trying to temper his intemperance, and the banshee wails of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs talking about standing armies of pound notes in England that we must preserve at any price.  Out of that summer madness&mdash;as one may describe it, with the Dáil in recess&mdash;came this time last year the reopening of Parliament and the complete scattering of this gloom that had been disseminated throughout the country.  We had the Tánaiste, in his succinct characteristic way, saying there was no crisis now, only a problem.  Here was the first bit of realism coming into the approach of the Government when it had got over what I describe as the midsummer night's madness.  Then, emerging in its wake and apparently as the result&mdash;we must inevitably take it as the result&mdash;of close association between this Government and the Tory Government in England, we had a Budget designed on British pattern, a Budget designed for a debtor nation imposed on an Irish people who are a <Col N="666" /> creditor nation.  That is the broad final analysis of the financial situation.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to comment here&mdash; and this is the opportunity we get&mdash;on the tie-ups in general governmental approach with the Chancellor of another Exchequer.  Two responsible Ministers&mdash;at least, two Deputies of the House holding responsible positions; one I will describe as a responsible Minister, the Tánaiste as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Finance&mdash;take off for London.  They have a series of talks with the Chancellor of the British Exchequer, Mr. Butler.  We have no revelation to the Dáil of the nature, the scope or the effect of these talks. We are told in a most pugnacious way, in a most dogmatic way, that we will get no information.  And then, in the light of all that, we get a Budget that has the same tracings, the same financial impact and the same effect as that of a Chancellor of a British Government.</P>
    <P>No matter how vehemently the Tánaiste may interject to say that there was nothing but an exchange of views, we are entitled to say to the Irish people: &ldquo;Here are the facts; as the result of an observation made by the Chancellor of the British Exchequer in the British House of Commons, that Mr. MacEntee was going to come over to see him, there is a flight over to London, there is a series of conversations, there is no disclosure in this House, as the final seat of authority in this country, as to the nature or scope of those conversations; but there is after that, first of all, an early Budget conforming as to time with the effort of a Tory Chancellor and then we find that that Budget is conceived and designed in pattern on the Budget of a Conservative Chancellor in England who is dealing with a highly debtor nation, a very heavily involved debtor nation, and that kind of Budget is imposed on this country, which we all know is a highly creditor nation.&rdquo;  We are entitled to say until the Government can controvert that impression by laying bare what did transpire, that the directions and suggestions of a foreign Chancellor did, in fact, influence Government <Col N="667" /> policy, the result of which we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>In the Budget we had an approach that was tantamount to this: &ldquo;I will take the maximum I can off the Irish people by way of taxation&rdquo;&mdash;and the one gleam of relief is the now too-vaunted remission of the dance tax. We have a Budget that deliberately sets itself out to do one thing only, to depress consumption at home&mdash;and how successful it has been is only too bitter a reality.  More money is extracted from the people; less money is available to them for the necessary purchases for the home; infinitely less surplus is there for the purchase of various articles of clothing and footwear; less money is there for the purchase of many of the small items that tend to ease in the domestic situation. The main buying bulk of the Irish people and the mainstay of trade, commerce and industry is the wage earner and the small salary earner and those people are not now in a position to buy.  That is due, let me remind Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;they voted for this and this is their contribution to Irish economy&mdash;to the increased prices for bread, butter, tea, sugar, milk and every possible commodity going in by way of essentials to the home.  That has to be met out of the same pay packet.</P>
    <P>The impact comes most severely on the man with the large family.  I know that some people on the Government Benches will endeavour to offset that by entering into hyperbolic exuberance of language in relation to increased social services, increased children's allowances and increased pensions.  I would like some practical financier to explain to me how the old age pensioner or the parent in receipt of increased children's allowances can be better off when, through the impact of taxation, he will lose from 2/8 to 3/-per week while through the medium of increased social allowances he cannot get more than 1/- or 1/6 per week.  How can a man who pays out 3/- and gets back 1/6 be better off?</P>
    <P>In the main that hyperbolic exaggeration is the defence of the Government when it comes to an analysis of <Col N="668" /> our economic problem; things may be tough but we were living beyond our means.  Is the man on the dole to-day, the man in receipt of unemployment assistance and the man who has had to fly the land of his birth because there was no work available for him better off?  Is he the man who is living beyond his means?  We suffer from three haemorrhages which must lead us to national disaster, namely, unemployment, emigration and a rising sense of insecurity, all attributable to the policy of a Government which, either because of advancing years or spite, is incapable of implementing an expansionist policy for the salvation of our people and which has bludgeoned an expanding economy into a depression. It is the duty of the Government now to take immediate steps to alleviate that depression or get out and let in a Government that has the courage and the foresight to take such steps.</P>
    <P>This Government pays lip-service in one sentence to capital investment and an expansionist economy.  In the next sentence, with an almost sinister efficiency it slows down all effort.  When one presses, as I have pressed, for land rehabilitation, for farm improvement schemes and for all the various schemes subject to Government grant one is told that the matter will be examined. There is an inspection and six months after the inspection one is pressing all over again and then there is a reinspection. It is in that way that this Government is closing down on expansionist effort.</P>
    <P>The situation here was crystal clear. The inter-Party Government had conceived a policy that I am proud to stand over and it is a policy that I will stand over as long as I remain in public life.  I believe that the proper place for every Irish £ available for investment is in the improvement of Irish land and the social conditions of the Irish people and not in low interest loan for the improvement and betterment of the lot of a foreign people and a foreign country.  The inter-Party Government set itself to the task of creating a flow of Irish capital into the improvement of Irish farm land.  There is a wonderful field there for continued effort because the output of every Irish <Col N="669" /> farm can be and should be increased by progressive effort under an expansionist policy.  With proper nutrition of the soil the output of every farm can be increased by 200 to 300 per cent. and where one blade of grass grows to-day it should be possible to have three, four and five blades growing in the future. The cereals most suitable in our climatic condition should be developed so that we can walk off the land our mixed agricultural produce in the way of beef, pork, poultry and pigs.</P>
    <P>That increased production potential can only be brought about under a Government prepared to adopt a realistic approach to agricultural expansion.  If that is done our best economic theorists will be startled at the results in a period of three or four years.  That should be the keystone of our policy.  The inter-Party Government sought to improve every Irish acre and to get from it its maximum productivity by sinking in it all the capital we could put into it.  We conceived it to be our duty to make Irish capital available for Irish agricultural production.  We conceived it to be our duty to make Irish capital available to solve the housing problems of our people and to improve health services and hospitalisation while alleviating the distress and sufferings of those sections of the community least able to bear the burdens cast upon them.</P>
    <P>We believe in remitting ill-conceived taxation on certain so-called luxuries. We believe in the policy of imposing a tax or an excise duty on beer, spirits and tobacco which will yield a satisfactory revenue return as distinct from imposing a tax which fails to achieve buoyancy in revenue while denying to our people the small luxuries to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>It was our experience in the inter-Party Government that having improved conditions for the aged, the infirm, the widow and the orphan we were able to give a forward impetus to Irish economy.  What replaced that policy?  It was replaced, as we now know, by an almost senile repressiveness, by Government ineptitude, by Government lack of foresight.  We had an unnatural despondency as the forerunner <Col N="670" /> of an economic stupidity.  We had a Minister for Finance deliberately deciding to teach the Irish people a lesson for what they had done to the &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil.  He would teach them the lesson that there was no alternative Government to those who had abrogated unto themselves some peculiarly divine right to continue to be the masters of the destinies of the Irish people.  We saw rapidly accumulating all the evils that had been the cause of the downfall of the &ldquo;Empire.&rdquo;  We are encouraged and emboldened to-day in our belief in the Irish people and in the salutary and no doubt alarming warning that has been given by the working-class people of our capital city&mdash;a city which has always jealously guarded Governments of this country and jealously guarded its right to have its say in the formation of Governments of this country.</P>
    <P>Why does the Government not face up to the problem by getting as quickly and as rapidly as possible such sums of money as it may need?  They will get it with our complete support as they got the last loan.  All criticism of that loan and the method of its flotation was reserved until the loan was, in fact, fully subscribed&mdash;a courtesy and the political integrity that we never got from Fianna Fáil when we were endeavouring to get loans.  I am giving you this assurance.  What this country needs at the moment is a transfusion of vast sums of money into a return of impetus, into schemes such as those under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts, into schemes like the land rehabilitation scheme, into increased effort and impetus, into afforestation, into the completion of the drive to give every family its own house, into hospitalisation, into the completion and expansion of the drive towards electrifying the country.  Into all those channels can be poured more Irish money that is available for investment. Into all those channels can be poured further people into employment to halt the growing unrest, to dispel the disquiet and the lack of confidence that is in the people.  Into this country and into this country's development can be poured these things by any Government. <Col N="671" /> Do not mind what State economists may say.  Do not mind what conservative theorists may say.  Any Irish Parliament, supreme in its power, exercising its supreme judgment, can gather together Irish money and use it to put back into employment in this country people at home&mdash;to put into this country the effort of the strong right arm of Irishmen and Irishwomen that it may build up at home something enduring and lasting&mdash;rather than that they should be forced into foreign lands whether England, Scotland, Wales, America or any of the dominions of the late British Empire. Their effort would be better here at home.  We need a constructive effort to improve the land, the forests, housing, and all the various things which are crying out to be done in an under-developed, under-capitalised and capital starved nation.  Far better that the Government, even to the extent of imprudence, should pour money into that effort than to allow a continuation of expanding emigration, decreasing employment and rising insecurity.</P>
    <P>I believe, no matter what economic theorists may say or what people claiming financial rectitude may say, that we are entitled to pledge in this House and in this country the earnings of posterity for posterity's gain.  I believe that it is the bounden duty of this Government to cushion its people against the economic shocks of depression when it can put its hand on the money to do so.  I believe that any Government with a sane and broad approach&mdash;one that allows for the political march of a nation and not one that arrests a depressed nation&mdash; can get the money to alleviate the temporary distress and depression that has hit all sections, classes and types in this country.  I firmly believe that if the Government has the courage to say that they will face this task and if they have the courage to come and seek the money that will preserve the essentials necessary to any development in this country it will get the complete and unanimous support of this House.  We can never hope to build a strong and a better Ireland if our manpower is allowed to be too <Col N="672" /> sadly depleted.  We can never hope to rehabilitate industry in this country if the human element is allowed to fly from our shores at the time of its formative development.  I have in mind the young man or the young boy from 18 to 21 years when all the strength of his development and all the dynamic impetus is there to be harnessed. Once that effort has gone no money can replace it.  That is why I say to this Government, not in the sense of political antipathy but that of appeal, that the nation must preserve its right to survival by the maintenance of its young boys and girls at home so that they, in the fullness of their time, may marry and settle down and bring up families at home.  This country is too rapidly becoming the playground of too many old people and of the terribly young.</P>
    <P>I see a Deputy from Galway over there on the Government Benches.  He represents the same type of constituency as I represent.  We see only too well the denudation that has taken place.  We see only too well that it is not the people that might best be afforded who go.  We find that the people who go are the young in mind, the young in heart and the young in sinew.  They are the people who are fleeing the land.  All over our constituencies we see farms on which there is only an old couple and on which none of the children was prepared to stay&mdash;farms which none of the children will accept because of the economic hardship that has been their stigma in recent months.  We see that emigration is increasing.  I say to the Government, in this particular case, to blazes with politics and to blazes with Parties: we have a bigger problem to deal with.  We have to preserve here at home in this country the very nucleus and the very life-stream of our own nationhood.  We can do that only if the Government has the courage to approach the problem, irrespective of the cost, of ensuring those people a livelihood at home.  I do not care what way you argue.  I do not care whether we build hospitals, houses and enduring capital assets in this country, there is nothing either unethically wrong with it financially or anything <Col N="673" /> in any way dangerous to a financial credit to commit posterity to carry in each successive year its share of the burden because it will get its full facet of the asset.</P>
    <P>We have members of the Government Party here &ldquo;meowing,&rdquo; particularly in the person of Deputy Briscoe, about putting the country in pawn.  This is a Government that has become the dream of the big investor, the wealthy corporation, by floating a loan at a rate of interest well beyond the wildest hopes of these investors. I believe that a Government facing in a responsible way the task of eradicating the cancers in our economic system and eradicating the unrest caused by rising unemployment and the general economic depression, will get the wholehearted support of the Irish people.  Mind you, I go this far and you can describe me as anything you like afterwards.  If it is necessary for the preservation of the Irish people at home, to raise money to enable them to keep these people at home, I will support any Government that needs authority to deal with the banks because I say without fear of contradiction that no section has battened so successfully or so well on Irish economy as that particular section and if the necessities of our economic ills call for a remedy that involves our being allowed to use all our available resources for development here at home, resources that are otherwise invested in various types of foreign securities, I would not raise a whimper of protest against any Government taking that line.</P>
    <P>I stand here to make an appeal to the Government, not in any narrow political sense because many of the people who were forced to leave our country have no formulated idea of politics at all.  They are pressed and depressed by the one reality that, born and reared in this little island of ours, once they reach budding maturity, they have to flee the land and the homes they love so well.  That is a tragedy, a tragedy that becomes a reality to a person as young as myself who has seen his friends, his school contemporaries and his contemporaries in various efforts from boyhood to early <Col N="674" /> manhood, dispersed and scattered over the world.  Indeed can I not bitterly recall how many of them in the exigencies of the war situation, had to lay down their gallant young lives in that effort, not because of any desire on their part to defend any other country but because of the sheer economic necessity that drove them from this nation into these other countries, there to suffer premature death because we did not face up to or are not facing up to the task that is the Government's first duty?</P>
    <P>The Government, by the judicious exercise of its power over the finances and the economy of this country, could cushion the people against depression, against the illnesses that are now so manifest in our economic system.  It is their duty to do it as rapidly and as quickly as they can, no matter what the ultimate result may be, because I say in a positive and deliberate way that the denudation of rural Ireland, the flight of skilled tradesmen and competent workers in various avocations of life, in their early manhood represents a loss to this country that no money can repay.  It is a loss of something so vital, such an integral part of the fundamental basis of expansion, a loss of what one might describe as the right human digit for economic development, that no money can replace it.  I am talking from my heart out when I say it is indeed a tragedy to find that we have a situation in this country where there is growing specialised employment for non-Irish people while there is this tremendous flight of Irish people from their own land.  That is a sign of an economic cancer, for the removal of which I demand Government action.</P>
    <P>I am here as the representative of people who, generation after generation, played their part in every organisation and in every effort that was made to win us the right to a Parliament in this country.  As the representative of these people, and proud of their representative trust, I come here to demand of the Government that they do either of two things: that they leave the way for a Government that will tackle this problem or <Col N="675" /> get down to the task of putting into rural Ireland the means of employment and the life-stream of money necessary for investment if we are to keep Irish boys and girls in their proud and lordly fastnesses of West Cork.  These people are entitled to some action of that kind.  We have seen what is happening.  We have seen the Beara peninsula denuded of its young people. I asked in a series of parliamentary questions what was the real situation in Beara and whether the Government was going to take any action in regard to it.  We have the situation painted by the Minister for Education that in Beara peninsula there are fewer than 20 per cent. of the number of children attending school that were attending there 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>We have the situation in the peninsula and in Beara Island where the doors of houses are sealed and a name left on them so that, perhaps, some returning emigrant having made a successful career for himself in some other country can come at some future period and say with sentimental and tragic reality: &ldquo;That was my home from which I had to flee because there was no sustenance or livelihood for me at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No matter who forms the Government, in the present situation that faces rural Ireland, I would be fearless in my demand that they take immediate and speedy action to arrest these ills.  We are now approaching the festive period and we shall very shortly go on holidays.  Before doing so, let us shock ourselves and ask ourselves the question: what is the situation that is facing so many people in this country, a situation that is so different from that of Christmas two years ago, despite all the wails and bleats that we had then?  We should ask ourselves why has this cancer come so suddenly into our economic life.  I believe, no matter what central banks may say, what the trends of foreign trade may be, no matter what interpretation the Minister for Finance may try to put on it, in the fundamental strength and will of the Irish people. I believe in their capacity for work <Col N="676" /> and in their capacity to develop the land with homes worthy of its people. I believe their production will be worthy of the Irish farmer and that their industry will be of a standard that will be worthy of a proud race. They will do that if given the least bit of encouragement, of hope and financial support by an Irish Government.  That is the minimum that might be expected by a people who, in the final analysis, have made it possible for all of us to be Deputies or part of any Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins assures us that he has been speaking from his heart.  I think this is a place where, preferably, we might speak from our heads.  The Deputy wandered from the beginning to the end of his speech over a whole series of theories and promises as to how the job was to be done.  I would recommend him to read his speech when he gets home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy full marks as a debater and for making a very eloquent electioneering speech, something that would appeal mainly to people who were gathering up excitement in preparation for polling day. But from the point of view of what he promised to do, he did not do anything. He was going to show us that our whole system, our financial structure and Government policy were wrong.  He was going to criticise it and then give us his alternative to make it workable.  I will sum up his speech not exactly in his own words but by giving the sense of them.  It amounted to this: build now for the benefit of posterity and posterity will pay for it. That reminds me of the gentleman who used to say: &ldquo;Let posterity pay for it because posterity has done nothing for us.&rdquo; That was the approach that we got from Deputy Collins.</P>
      <P>In Volume 72, column 831 of the Dáil Debates for the 14th July, 1948, these very wise words spoken by Deputy Costello appear:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The more experience I have of political life the more I am convinced <Col N="677" /> that the people will believe anything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently that experience is now shared by most of the members opposite.  It does not matter any more whether what you say is sound sense or is practicable.  &ldquo;The more experience I have of political life the more I am convinced that the people will believe anything.&rdquo; It is very strange that the Deputies on that side of the House can so easily and rapidly change policy not by reason of the position which they may occupy in the House but from day to day as the situation appears to them.  I am reminded, when I read some of the speeches made some days ago or some years ago by leaders on the Opposition Benches, of the actor who was familiar to us in the old days. He was known as the quick-change artist.  He would first appear on the stage as Napoleon; he would then turn around and, in a matter of seconds, he was Frederick the Great.  That is what we have here.  We have a most extraordinary situation.  There appears this morning in the <i>Irish Press</i> in a letter from the Minister for Finance, a quotation from a speech made to the Institute of Bankers in Ireland on the 19th November, 1949, by Deputy Costello when he was Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a copy of the <i>Irish Press</i> you have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a copy of the statement.  If the Deputy has the <i>Irish Press</i> with him he can check this quotation word for word as I deal with it.  I am going to relate this quotation to the speech which Deputy Costello made yesterday.  Yesterday, he had quite a new approach to the banking system and to our behaviour <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banks, as suggested by Deputy Collins a few minutes ago, that the time had come when we must direct the banks how to deal with their depositors' money.  I do not know whether everybody has read this quotation in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning, or whether is has appeared in the other newspapers or not, but Deputy Costello, speaking on that occasion, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;While recognising the defects in <Col N="678" /> our economy and sparing no effort to remedy them, we must, of course, beware of making a fetish of capital investment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have just had a speech which amounted to this: take the money and invest it; it does not matter how or where you invest it, and increase your output by 200 or 300 per cent.  How that figure was reached I do not know. The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is both good domestic investment and bad domestic investment, justifiable neither by its economic return nor by its social fruits.  We must turn our faces sharply against anything that savours of the mere visionary.  Even foreign investment is better than bad domestic investment, and certainly better than anything remotely approaching dissipative expenditure The more our social necessities compel us into forms of capital investment showing a social return alone, the more carefully must we select schemes which can survive vigorous financial examination.  I we build houses which are a necessity, we must so augment agricultural and industrial productivity that the people who live in those house have real incomes to maintain them We must tilt the balance on outlay in a genuinely productive direction.</P>
    <P>The more we invest, the more we must save.  If the evil of inflation and all its consequent waste, on the one hand, is to be avoided and an unnecessary deficit in the balance of payments on the other, it is essential that savings be increased. The degree of expansion possible is limited by the availability for expenditure of current savings and accumulated resources.  There is a connection between those extra glasses of whiskey you may have taken and the house you don't get built!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what we had coming from the Taoiseach as he was then.  It is to be compared with the speech which we have just heard.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A new Jerusalem cannot be built overnight&mdash;not even on after-dinner optimism.  If we attempt to do too <Col N="679" /> much at any one time, our schemes may jam each other and all may fail. The problem must be approached with good sense, and the Government are aware that if proper priorities are not established nothing will be done.  Poverty cannot be solved by hysteria&mdash;not even by hysteria in the right direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now what in the name of goodness that means I do not know.  &ldquo;Hysteria in the right direction&rdquo;.  I suppose I shall have to go to some psychiatrist and ask him to explain to me what is hysteria when it flows in the right direction.  When I say that people change their outlook and their views, when we are abused and accused of complete neglect of the interest of the people as a whole, and when the whole history of the operations of this Government for the 16 years they were in office is forgotten, it is only fair to remind the House of how people thought yesterday and how they think to-day.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Costello as Taoiseach, more conservative than we are to-day, expressing more conservative views.  Now we have him advocating a type of action which would certainly make him less conservative than we are.  We had an alliance in the Coalition Government, as was demonstrated in most picturesque language by Deputy Collins, which put into abeyance policies of the different groups which were in conflict with the general set-up.  What he did not tell us was that in the formation of that Coalition Government these groups had to put into abeyance fundamental principles for which they stood and for which they sought the support of the people when they went to the country in the election of 1948.  There is a big difference between what is done and what is said if you demand support for a certain policy and if, when you join with other groups and do not get sufficient support for that policy, you abandon all the fundamental principles which you had advocated.</P>
    <P>Before this marriage, or whatever it was, took place, we had, for instance, <Col N="680" /> the opinion expressed in this House by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Norton, with regard to Deputy McGilligan.  We are talking about industry, employment and taxation.  As reported in Volume 49, column 1685, of the Official Reports for the 27th September, 1933, this is what Deputy Norton said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If one did not know Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, one would be inclined to be deceived by the debating points and the welter of dialectics to which he has treated the House this evening.  Some of us who know Deputy McGilligan longer than some of his new-found friends can remember that he was almost an industrial tank in this country during his period as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;levelling one industry after the other; and coming back fresh from the victory of having closed a distillery here, a brewery there or some other industry which had survived many generations.  If we did not know that Deputy McGilligan was engaged in that campaign; if we did not know he was cheered on at the time by the disciple of low wages, the colleague who sits on his left, we would be inclined to believe that some of the speeches delivered from those benches were really intended to be a definite profession of sympathy for the poor and needy in this country; but we all know Deputy McGilligan's attitude and his record as Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we should get a clear picture.  We are either genuinely concerned with the welfare of the people and the future prosperity of the country as a whole or we are only concerned with playing politics and trying to find out by what means we can get the people during an election to put a particular group here or over there and the sooner we realise what is happening, the sooner we will be able to understand that it is not from our hearts we are speaking here but from our heads.</P>
    <P>Deputies on the Opposition Benches have been talking about the banking system and the lack of concern on the <Col N="681" /> part of this Government about bringing the banks to heel and forcing them to do with the savings of the people what they should do, namely, invest them for the welfare and benefit of the nation.  I do not know whether most Deputies remember or even knew that in the time of Sinn Fein this State had a bank known as the Sinn Fein Bank.  After the Treaty the name of that bank was changed to the National Land Bank.  It was owned by this nation and had certain branches.  If the Deputies who are now asking for a change in our banking system and the taking over by the State of part, if not the whole, of the banking system want to convince me that they are sincere, I want to ask them why, in 1926, they sold the bank owned by the State to the Bank of Ireland for a measly £190,000.  We had a bank before the establishment of the Currency Commission or the Central Bank which could have been the nucleus of what they are now shouting about.  But what happened?  The Minister for Finance of the day, Mr. Ernest Blythe, came into this House and said: &ldquo;I have an announcement to make.&rdquo; This is what he said, as reported in the Official Report of the 20th July, 1926, column 2214:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to make an announcement to the Dáil with reference to the National Land Bank.  The Executive Council have decided to dispose of the interest of the Minister for Finance in the National Land Bank.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was all; the job was done.  There was a big discussion on it, and I must say to the credit of the Labour Party, under the leadership of the then Deputy Johnson, that they did their best, with some other former Deputies, to try and stop this change taking place in national policy and to prevent its being dealt with in the way it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins used so many beautiful words in his oratorical effort to-day that I could not possibly rise to his level.  But he actually stated recently that our Minister for Finance went across to meet Mr. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, and made an arrangement with him that our Budget should be on the lines of <Col N="682" /> the British Budget, notwithstanding the fact that the British Budget was for a debtor nation and that we were a creditor nation.  In other words, he was supposed to be disclosing a secret arrangement between our Minister for Finance and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  That was said by a Deputy who is a member of a Party that concluded the well-known secret financial agreement in order to get rid of which we had to have an economic war between this country and Great Britain.  Now we are accused of making a secret financial agreement.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the cheek of people who make these accusations against people on this side of the House when they themselves were responsible for this kind of act and we had to undo it.  We are making no secret financial agreements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins spoke here only ten minutes ago.  I would not accuse Deputy MacEoin nor will he accuse me of misquoting anybody deliberately.  Deputy MacEoin was not here when Deputy Collins was speaking.  That is what he was talking about.  To revert to Deputy McGilligan's speech which I was quoting:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When it comes to Government funds, the Government may have other considerations to bear in mind, such as the increase of productivity in the long run.  There is also the social consideration which the Government are always bound to bear in mind.  Any preference investors may have for British picture houses rather than home investments is a consideration, with other considerations, that has to be taken into account by the Government in approaching investment policy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in the Seanad on October 26th, 1949, Deputy McGilligan said in relation to the banks: &ldquo;They have their own standards and we cannot object to their having them in regard to particular proposals which come before them from time to time.&rdquo; When we are talking about the wealth of the people of this nation we must have some reasonable perspective.  It is no use abusing the banks, because they are set up under charter and they have to operate under specific rules and regulations and Acts of Parliament. What we must recognise is this, that if you take the amount of money invested <Col N="684" /> in the banks by the banks' shareholders, in other words, the owners of the banks, and add them up to whatever sum they may be and relate them to the amount of money in the coffers of the banks, held by the banks as trustees for their depositors, then you will realise that the banks have no business to do other than they are doing to preserve the liquidity of this money which does not belong to them.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House.  I understand that we want to get this matter finished.  I will get an opportunity of talking at great length on the balance of payments on a more suitable occasion than this.  Let us be quite clear.  What is suggested?  When the Fianna Fáil Party advocated tariffs and protection, it was Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal as it was then called, who objected to that policy.  We were definitely a protectionist Party for the purpose of the building up of our industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins to-day talked about the tremendous expansion that took place during the three years of Coalition administration.  He said it increased investment and the flow of money into capital investment during those three years, but Deputy Collins could not point to a single industry established during those years.  I have <Col N="687" /> yet to hear what industries were established in those three years.  What flow of capital was there for capital investment? Nothing was done other than what had been done by the Fianna Fáil Party before they left office in 1948. The Coalition Government did nothing, but certain industries closed down during the three years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins bemoaned and bewailed our young people having to flee the shores of this country to find an early grave in some other clime.  How many people had to leave our shores when the transatlantic air service was closed down?  Not only had the personnel and the crews to leave but also those who would have found employment in the repair shop at Limerick.  What about those?  Do they not count at all?  They do not count because they did not flee the country during our period of office.  If something happens while we are in office it is a crime and tragedy but if the same thing happens when other people are in office then it is no longer a crime or a tragedy but a virtue.</P>

      <P>I do not mind the interruptions.  They are sometimes helpful.  They help me to follow the line of thought of those listening and to discover whether my remarks are registering.  Sometimes a Deputy may speak for an hour but his remarks may register on nobody.  I hope my remarks are registering on somebody.  Capital investment was talked about.  Some people&mdash;I think Deputy Collins is one of them&mdash;seem to think that if this State, through its citizens, has a credit balance invested abroad of £400,000,000 you can take that home and put it immediately to work.  It is not so easy as all that.</P>
      <P>There was some reference to those employed in the building of houses. We are conducting a very big campaign in the City of Dublin in the building of houses.  We are building 5,000 houses a year.  We hope that after the passage of three, four or five years we will have reached finality, made provisions for all the houses we need and, except for normal expansion, the building of houses will no longer be necessary at the rate of 5,000 per year.  We believe that when we have built 50,000 corporation houses in the City of Dublin we will have provided for the housing needs. But what will happen when we stop building houses?  All those people at present engaged and who will be engaged on that work for the next few years will then become disemployed.</P>

As far as the City of Dublin is concerned, I can tell the Deputy that we are not building less houses this year than we were last year.  We are not employing less people on the building of houses in the City of Dublin than we employed last year.  I do not know whether Deputy Keyes believes that or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are building over 5,000 houses at the moment, and we will need another 20,000 odd houses to complete our schemes.  I say we are hoping that will be done in five years.  It may be six years or four years, but it will be done within a reasonable time, within what we can now call foreseeable time.  At the end of that period what will happen to the workers?  Will it be suggested from Deputies opposite that we should continue building houses even though they are not needed?  The Government has the responsibility of trying to find in advance ways and means <Col N="690" /> whereby these people can be transferred from their employment to other gainful employment.  Is not that the way you have to think of it?</P>
      <P>We cannot use the £400,000,000 in a limited period of a few years and then say, having spent the money: &ldquo;Now we stop.&rdquo; What happens then?  What is more important is that whatever money is invested here in so far as it concerns capital or industrial development schemes should result in continuous employment and not part-time employment or employment for a period of years to satisfy some outstanding need.  Is it not obvious that that is the way in which the problem has to be approached?  Therefore, if you want to employ money where it will give continuous employment you must also allow, if it is used for private industrial development, for a margin of profit for the person or persons who will make the investment.  If money is to be invested in the Government securities for Government or local authority spending, so also must it show some return to the people who own it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where Deputy Hickey and I come to the cross-roads.  Deputy Hickey has an idea that it would be quite justifiable and right for the Government, by some means or other, to get money and make it available at the barest minimum interest rate.  I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that that is what Deputy Hickey more or less wishes.  He has it in mind mainly in relation to taking off the backs of the working people the additional cost of living, arising from interest charges, where interest becomes payable in connection with capital spent on their behalf.  If that is all, it can be dealt with by some form of subsidy to relieve it, without killing the source of supply of the money; but when we go on from there to industry, does Deputy Hickey not agree that the workman should be as free to sell or to give his labour wherever and whenever he likes as the person is to engage in it?  Is it not obvious that you cannot just go from the interest charge in relation to requirements&mdash;living accommodation and so forth&mdash;into industry and say <Col N="691" /> that you will not allow any benefit to the owners of capital put into industry, and that in that connection also there should be a reduction of interest charge, or, as it is usually known, a reduction in the profits accruing to the people who invest?</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk about industrialists and about their contribution, by their profiteering, to the high cost of living.  When Deputy Norton was on this side, he was going to have investigations made, and was going to put behind bars these profiteers who deserved to be there.  Not one person was put behind a jail wall or prison bars on the criminal charge of abuse to the extent of profiteering. Everything is controlled and everything should be controlled, but controlled only to the extent of being reasonable, and when Deputy Hickey talks on this, I should like him to tell the House in what form he feels it would be possible to do what he says without completely nationalising the State.  If he says that that is the only way to do it, I can understand it, but that is where he and I will part finally, because I do not want to see everything in the State nationalised.  I want to see a preservation of the private rights of the individual, whether he be a worker, a farmer or an industrialist.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy McGilligan here attacking our recent loan.  That loan was issued at 5 per cent. which, in the opinion of those who criticised it, was much too high a rate to give to get the money.  It was criticised on the ground that, because it was issued at that high rate, it commanded a premium, and that was putting money into the pockets of people at the expense of the community.  The Deputy stated that when he left office all the securities raised by the Coalition Government were at par.  We all know that that was not so.  Let me remind the House that Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, raised a 3 per cent. loan, the first loan after coming into office.  That loan was issued at a figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the <Col N="692" /> first loan issued at 3 per cent.  People invested their money in that loan. They paid £100 for £100 worth of stock and they got 3 per cent.  Shortly after, the same Minister issued another loan, but this time at 3½ per cent.  What happened to the investments of the people who had subscribed to the 3 per cent loan?  It immediately fell below par.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a different thing.  It fell below par. Why did Deputy McGilligan, when he found that in order to get more money he had to pay more, not protect these subscribers to the 3 per cent. stock and convert that for them into 3½ per cent. stock, instead of forcing on them within a very short time a heavy loss in capital?</P>

The first thing we look for is security for our money and then the dividend we will get.  If we see side by side stocks of equal security but one giving 4 per cent. as against 3 per cent., which do we take?  We take the 4 per cent. Therefore, the person who holds 3 per cent. stock, if he wants to sell it, has to sell it for less than Deputy Hickey or I pay for the 4 per cent. investment. The stock exchange has nothing to do with it&mdash;it is the matter of the supply of and the demand for money.</P>

I have read about places where the system was changed, and, apart from complete collapse, there was no ultimate and final result, and I know of no place, except some dream place, where the system Deputy Hickey talks about exists.  Perhaps he can tell us where it has happened.</P>

      <P>They have not abolished the right of private enterprise and they have not gone out of the system. There was a Labour Government in England which went a good distance but did not go all the way.

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I misunderstand the Deputy.  Let me put to the House, Sir, what happened.  I hear Deputies over there accusing us of bad management in State affairs.  Let me give the House an illustration of what I would call damn bad management&mdash;and I think I can use that adjective in connection with the transaction because it is not concerned with an individual. Under the Marshall Aid loan scheme this country was accorded £40,000,000 worth of dollars as a loan.  Now if I had been Minister for Finance with the outlook I always held and if I had taken that loan I would have held it in dollars.  I would have invested the unspent portion of it in dollars and I would have had the dollars at my disposal and would have relinquished them or sold them for sterling only when it was most vitally necessary.  But our predecessors got this £40,000,000 worth of dollars and within a matter of days after its receipt it was sold to the British Treasury for sterling.  The <Col N="694" /> proceeds were invested in the Central Bank about which we now hear all this hypocrisy about bad management and invested by the Bank at 12/6 per £ per annum.  Yet Deputy MacBride and Deputy McGilligan, members of the Cabinet that conducted that transaction, are now asking us here what are we doing in not forcing the Central Bank to invest our money better than they are doing.  Does Deputy Hickey follow what I am saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>£40,000,000 worth of dollars was sold immediately after receipt or very shortly afterwards and the dollars transferred to the British Government.  They held them, and we got sterling, which was put in the Central Bank by the then Minister for Finance, and invested in short-term loan on his behalf by the bank at 12/6 per £ per annum.  Then came devaluation, and I venture to suggest that, if we had held the dollars, as I believe the prudent Administration on this side of the House would have done, we would have had 30/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>12/6 per cent.  You said 12/6 per £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the correction; 12/6 per cent. for every £100.  When devaluation did come we would have had 30/- for every £ we got for those £40,000,000 worth of dollars.  Yet the people who conducted that transaction have the temerity to get up here and abuse this side of the House for doing the things they are doing which cannot compare in absurdity with the handling of that transaction.  I do not know whether the Deputies realise the seriousness of this.  Could one imagine, Sir, what would have happened if our Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, had received £40,000,000 worth of dollars and it was now disclosed that he had sold them immediately on receipt to the British Treasury for sterling, that subsequent to that sterling had become devalued, with a loss of millions of pounds both on capital repayment and on interest?  Could one not imagine the violent motions from <Col N="695" /> the other side of the House, the persistent calls for his head?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a good case for a changing of Government and I hope it will be perpetuated. Could you not imagine, Sir, how many days we would have spent on investigation about that transaction, how many motions would have been put down, possibly tribunals set up to investigate why and how?  And now we are told, notwithstanding that transaction, that Deputy MacEntee went across to the Chancellor of the British Exchequer, Mr. Butler, to take instructions from him on how to frame our Budget.  Is it not obvious that in framing the Budget the Minister has to do it in conformity with the conditions existing and with the results he hopes to bring about and is it not also clear that what Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance wanted to accomplish was a closing of the gap in our balance of payments in order that our reserves invested abroad, whatever they may be&mdash; £300,000,000 or £400,000,000&mdash;shall remain as reserves?  Before I conclude, may I give the Dáil my authority, which I am sure they will agree with, for believing that is a good thing to do? I read the other night in the House Deputy Costello's reference to this matter in 1948 and I am not going to bore the House with it now.  But I am sure Deputy Hickey will accept this as authoritative.  Speaking in the Seanad on July 29th, 1948, Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, said at column 546, Volume 35, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are living beyond our means as far as the difference between the balance of payments shows and, unless we can correct that, we will soon come to the point where these reserves will be dissipated and weakened to the point that they <Col N="696" /> will not give us the old reserve.  In that position, two things have to be done.  We will have to make a tremendous effort to get extra exports from the country or else we definitely lower our standard of living in so far as that depends upon these importations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again in his Budget speech, May 2nd, 1951, speaking at column 1884, Volume 125, of the Dáil Report, Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While he was Minister, Deputy McGilligan, addressing the north city constituency of Fine Gael, was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of October 25th, 1949, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even though they could now achieve the object of closing the gap immediately, it could not be postponed for longer than half-way through 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, speaking in Dáil Éireann on October 15th, 1947, as reported in Volume 108, column 427, Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will reach the happy condition then in which we will have nothing more to play with and in which we will have to turn attention to the home front.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That meant that the external resources would have been gone.  Obviously we must not dissipate those funds, those assets, that wealth of our people.  We must recognise that the real wealth of this nation is what we can save over and above what is needed from year to year.  Out of the productivity comes the saving.  Out of the saving wealth is created and, if that is going to be of any value at all, out of that wealth some advantage must accrue to the people who create it.  They must get something for it.  They must get the benefit of their thrift in the shape of an income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> If a person has too much money invested and his income is consequently very high, instead of reducing the rate of interest that he gets we tax him.  From the other side of the House taxation has been referred to as a bludgeoning attitude of the Government. So that, Fine Gael, if they ever get back and lead the Coalition group again, are going to reduce taxation; they are going to reduce the cost of living or, if they are not going to reduce the cost of living, they are going to increase wages so that the increased cost of living will not be felt; and they are going to reduce incomes as well.  It is a very simple proposition; I think you can do it by algebra: If X produces Y, you get so much, and if you put your values on your Xs and Ys and reduce them, what will be the final result?  How is a person to get food, clothing and shelter if the means to get them are destroyed, if the means to produce them are destroyed?  That is what Fine Gael are talking about now.  They talked about our attitude when we were speaking on the Vote for Supplies and Services when we were in opposition, but Deputy Collins cannot remember the facts.</P>
    <P>Pre-1948, Fine Gael, and Clann na Poblachta in particular, promised, if returned to office, to reduce the cost of living.  After they took office the cost of living increased.  Our criticism was of their breach of promise, not of the fact that the cost of living had increased.  We have enough sense to know that if goods which we import are higher in price one year following another, the cost of living will increase. We did not criticise the then Government because of the increase in the cost of living.  We did criticise them for having successfully misled a great number of people by a promise to reduce the cost of living.  Clann na Poblachta had literature specifying that they would reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent.  The others were wiser and did not say by how much it would be reduced.  The facts are as I say and not as Deputy Collins would have the House believe, that we criticised the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also quite at sea in <Col N="698" /> his dates and, consequently, in his facts about increases in wages and the time when the Standstill Order with regard to wages was removed.  He is also quite wrong when he says that there have been no increases in wages since the present Government came into being some 20 months ago.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to make election cross-road speeches here.  People who do not understand may sometimes believe what is said.  It is all very well to make promises that cannot be carried out.  I would again like to remind Deputy Collins and any others who speak here that in this House we have to speak from our heads and not from our hearts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has travelled over a wide sphere although the introductory remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not indicate that the Government had any conception of the gravity of the economic position which at present prevails in the country.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister referred briefly to the fact that certain Orders required to be continued and he dealt with only one specific matter, the reason why the price of bread had been increased by ministerial Order without the necessity for an inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body.  It is obvious, however, from the trend of the discussion, from the speeches that have been made by Deputies from different parts of the House and different parts of the country, that the present economic position is serious and that the country is looking for a lead that so far has not been forthcoming from the Government. It is unnecessary to quote extensively from statistics or figures to prove the contention that the present economic conditions are worse than those that prevailed 18 months ago or two years ago but it may be necessary to refresh the memory of some Deputies by reiterating certain figures that have been given already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by members on the opposite side of the House that conditions are worse, that, comparatively speaking, our standards of life are better than in other countries, although those countries have not been specified and no particular standard <Col N="699" /> has been indicated which would provide a basis on which to judge the accuracy or otherwise of their assertions.</P>
    <P>Since this time two years, the numbers on the unemployment register show an increase of over 11,000 persons.  That does not take into account the number of factories, businesses and workshops that are operating part-time or half-time.  It does not take into account the numbers who have since emigrated. The figures that are available appear to indicate that emigration has tended to increase.  No entirely accurate figure is available and, so far, no new system has been devised which would allow of accurate assessment or compilation of the present rate of emigration.  It is obvious from whatever figures are available that emigration and unemployment have increased, that the substantial reduction in industrial production has been followed by a slackening in the general industrial drive and by a reduction in the numbers engaged full-time.  It is significant that, although the figures for the first two quarters of this year show a fall in industrial production of 15 points, there has been no reference by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in introducing this measure to the causes of that fall.  Whatever the causes are, no examination has been conducted, apparently, no investigation has taken place, and no reasons have been given to the House for that substantial drop, for the first time since the end of the war, in industrial output.</P>
    <P>At the same time, since May, 1951, there has been an increase of 13 points &mdash;equivalent to a rise of 12 or 13 per cent.&mdash;in the cost of living as shown in the figures published for August of this year.  In other words, between May, 1951, and August of this year&mdash; and that does not take into account any rise that has occurred since, as the figures are not yet available&mdash; there has been a rise of a minimum of 13 points, equivalent to 12 or 13 per cent.  That rise in the cost-of-living index figure does not take into account the increases in respect of beer and tobacco.  Those two items <Col N="700" /> were excluded from the index figure compiled at the end of 1947, and they are no longer taken into account in assessing any variation in the index figure.  If they were included, the rise would be still greater, as the old index figure included those items.</P>
    <P>We need not now traverse the circumstances in which the Fianna Fáil Government altered the index figure in August, 1947, or prior to the introduction of the Supplementary Budget in October of that year, when those items, on the specific direction of the Government, were deleted from the computation made by the Statistics Office in assessing a variation in the index figure.  Those who are familiar with the pattern of life in this country, familiar with the pattern of expenditure as undertaken by average persons, are well aware that the two items I have referred to figure to a considerable extent in the ordinary budget of almost every family, and in many cases the ordinary budget of all adults.</P>
    <P>This serious economic situation has been gravely worsened by the speeches of members of the present Government. As we have indicated, we are anxious to make a constructive approach to the problems that face the country.  We do not impute wrong motives to the Ministers concerned or to those responsible for this policy, which has already caused so much economic dislocation, so much suffering for so many, often needlessly and without due regard to the consequences of the policy that is being pursued.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1950 and in the early part of 1951 we recognised that the temporary disequilibrium in the balance of payments position, or the substantial import excess which was caused by the stockpiling at that time, would rectify itself later.  We asserted then that it was the considered policy of the then Government that that import excess would continue only for so long as the various interests concerned required to import goods needed in anticipation of any worsening of the supply position, goods which were sought not only by importers here but by numerous other countries as well. We announced then that any temporary import excess could be regarded as <Col N="701" /> justified in the circumstances, and that time would remedy it&mdash;as the export figures showed then, and as they have justified since by continued expansion. Our exports have continued to increase and without any drastic remedial measures the import reduction would have taken place already.  But when the present Government assumed office in the middle of last year they announced here, in a speech by the Minister for Finance, and subsequently supported by speeches from different members of the Government, that the country faced an acute crisis, that there was urgent need to rectify the import excess and that drastic measures would have to be taken.</P>
    <P>That speech was subsequently followed by the report of the Central Bank.  It followed the same pattern as previous reports from that source and amongst other suggestions incorporated in it was the assertion that a reduction in consumption should be enforced in the country, that that reduction in consumption should be effected by the abolition or reduction of food subsidies.  That report was the subject of a debate here and the Minister for Industry and Commerce alone said that the Government did not accept the terms of the report. It is significant that this year's Budget follows exactly the recommendations in respect of food subsidies that had then been enunciated by the Central Bank Report and which have since been given effect to by the abolition in some cases and substantial reduction in others of food subsidies on bread, tea, sugar, butter and flour.  These essential items have all been substantially increased in price by the methods adopted in the Budget and in compliance with the recommendations which were made in the Central Bank Report.</P>
    <P>That position has seriously affected the economic circumstances of large sections of the community.  In the last few months, numerous wage applications have been made to the Labour Court and other wage agreements have been negotiated between workers and employers, in an effort to ease the burdens that have been imposed on the community by the exceptional <Col N="702" /> terms of this year's Budget.  It is well, however, for the House to remember that the main charge that was made against the inter-Party Government was that we had squandered money extravagantly, that we had wasted our assets, that we had put the country into debt, that we had squandered the people's resources. No specific instances were given of this alleged waste; no indications were given of what schemes should have been abandoned; no particular instances were given of what schemes should have been continued.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the current rate of expenditure this year, as furnished in the returns published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, shows that on an average this Government so far has spent for each financial month of this year approximately £5,000,000 more than the inter-Party Government spent during its term of office or on the basis of the Budget introduced last year.</P>
    <P>We have had references to the fact that certain schemes were wasteful and that some schemes might have been modified, but no particular instance has been quoted where schemes should not have been proceeded with, nor has this Government seen fit to stop the capital development programme initiated by the inter-Party Government. It is, I think, important that we should during this discussion decide once and for all what capital schemes are desirable and, if necessary, establish an order of priority for such schemes.</P>
    <P>During our term in office we considered the question of drawing up a priority list for capital development schemes.  We decided that, if necessary, such a list should be drawn up and particular schemes initiated immediately and others postponed to a later date.  As things turned out, it was not necessary to earmark individual schemes for particular years and, in the main, a large-scale development programme was adopted which had the effect of expanding agricultural and industrial production while providing at the same time other capital development schemes of a social kind.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions here and references to different aspects of that capital development programme.  Nobody <Col N="703" /> has yet suggested that we should not proceed with the Electricity Supply Board development programme or curtail the extension of rural electrification. No one has suggested that Bord na Móna activities should be reduced or that the Irish shipping programme should be cut down.  Similarly, no one has suggested any curtailment of activity on land reclamation and drainage.</P>
    <P>All these schemes in their own way and in varying degrees are productive. In some cases the return may be immediate.  In others the return may be delayed, but in all cases some return will be forthcoming, and it is our aim and policy to see that the maximum development possible is undertaken in respect of all these worthwhile capital development programmes.</P>
    <P>No one has suggested that there should be any contraction of developments of a social type, such as housing, hospitalisation and health services. In the strictly economic sense no direct return is expected to be forthcoming from these, but nobody has suggested&mdash;in fact, there is common agreement on both sides on the point&mdash;that the rate of progress in relation to building and hospitalisation is as rapid as we would like it to be.  The significant change that has occurred this year is that, although some local authorities are proceeding at about the same rate as they were last year and the year before, private building now for the first time shows indications of a substantial drop.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that Dublin Corporation is building 5,000 houses per year.  The truth is that that particular body has never yet reached that level.  That may be the target set, but the fact is that that target has never been reached.  Aiming at a target and reaching that target are two very different things. The rate of building in Dublin has never yet reached 5,000 houses per year.  That may be the plan, but the plan has never been attained.  In relation to Dublin Corporation and in relation to some of the local authorities the rate of building has been <Col N="704" /> maintained, but the substantial drop in private building is noticeable.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion here recently on the variation in the rate of interest charged under the small dwellings acquisition loan.  It was significant that although a motion was moved here on that subject the Minister for Finance declined to intervene in the debate.  Subsequent questions and representations to both the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance were successful in getting the Government to alter its views, and to allow the old rate of interest in respect of applications made up to the beginning of October.  That is satisfactory in relation to those persons who had undertaken commitments prior to that date.  Has anyone taken the trouble to find out or is the Government aware of the serious position which faces those who are anxious to avail of the facilities under the small dwellings loan because of the rise in the rate of interest?  Virtually, in respect of Dublin, the small dwellings acquisition loans have now ceased to operate, and many people are in a serious position because of their inability to secure loans at rates of interest within their competence to pay.</P>
    <P>That problem must affect and has already begun to show its effect in the diminution in private building.  Its effect has been to reduce substantially private building.  The figures which were recently circulated to Deputies show an increase of over 500 in the number of building operatives now on the unemployment list as compared with this time last year.  Even though this is the slack period, that in itself is an indication of the trend of events, and an indication of the effect that the alteration in the rate of interest is having in relation to the small dwellings acquisition loan.</P>
    <P>I wonder if it is possible now to clear up a bit of a mystery.  We had here recently a number of questions dealing with the export of timber to Belfast. Apparently nobody can elicit the full facts of the situation.  Would it be possible to get from the Minister before this debates concludes a full statement of all the circumstances which warranted the granting of export licences <Col N="705" /> in respect of that timber?  If timber is available freely, as we believe it is, at a cheaper price than that timber was imported, then it is difficult to understand why persons in Belfast, or elsewhere, were not prepared themselves to avail of the cheaper timber from whatever source it was available.  If, on the other hand, this timber is being sold at a reduced price, then I think local authorities in this part of the country are entitled to first preference.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Minister did not inquire into the circumstances in which this deal was undertaken. Normally, where private firms are concerned, it may not be fair or reasonable to expect a full disclosure of the circumstances in which private transactions are undertaken.  But in this particular case where a commodity was imported as a safeguard against a deterioration in the supply position, it is reasonable to expect that the full facts and the full circumstances of the transaction which took place and the reason why an export licence was sought, and the Minister decided to grant that export licence, should be disclosed.  It is recognised that there are available in this country ample supplies of timber.  It is recognised that supplies&mdash;particularly in view of the anticipated reduction in respect of certain construction work&mdash;will last for a considerable period, but it ought to be possible to give the House and the country the full facts of the circumstances which made it possible for this timber to be exported, why it was not offered in the circumstances or, if it was offered, why it was not accepted by the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>The other two matters to which I wish to refer are bread and tea.  The Minister, in defending the decision to grant an increase in respect of bread prices, stated that the inter-Party Government did precisely the same thing in similar circumstances.  He omitted to mention that on one occasion the Prices Advisory Body was not in existence and that on the second occasion the Prices Advisory Body had only just been established, and was at that time inundated with applications for price increases, and <Col N="706" /> so forth.  Everyone is familiar with one aspect of this matter and that is that bread made by different bakers is being sold at different prices in different shops.  It is not suggested that if wage increases are granted they should not be implemented.  It is not suggested that if awards are made by the Labour Court or agreements negotiated for increases in wages these increases should not be granted and that the award should not be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to understand why, in Dublin itself, the price of bread can vary as much as 2d. a loaf.  It may be that it is confined to specific instances where small bakeries find it possible to sell bread more cheaply but it is equally significant that some of the large Dublin bakeries are sending vans even as far as 100 miles down the country to compete with rural bakeries or bakeries in provincial towns.  That position has been justified by the Minister on the basis that an inquiry was conducted by the Lavery Commission, that the price factors that were then revealed have not varied considerably since and that it had been possible, on the basis of the figures then compiled, to assess accurately the variation in any item of cost.  It is, however, common knowledge and in that report and as a result of that inquiry the Commission announced that it was difficult to get costings in some instances, that it was impossible to assess accurately the level of profits, that it was impossible for the commission to decide particular costings in respect of particular branches of the industry and that their decisions in some cases had to be on the basis of conjecture or on the best assessment that the figures available to them allowed.  That inquiry was conducted over two years ago.  It is unreasonable to expect the Dáil or the country to accept the suggestions that have been made in defending the recent variation in the price of bread that the figures which were then compiled or any variation in prices or the changes which have occurred since can be related to the rates and figures that were then available.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern that the application for the increase in the <Col N="707" /> price of bread was not referred to the Prices Advisory Body.  As a result of questions which were put down here about this time last year I succeeded, in common with other Deputies, in getting the substantial increase in motor insurance premiums referred to the Prices Advisory Body.  The House may not remember the facts.  When that matter was first referred to the Prices Advisory Body and an investigation undertaken some of the insurance companies at first refused to reveal the full figures.  Certain figures that were required were not produced.  The Chairman of the Prices Advisory Body advised them to get these figures and to produce them.  Subsequently the figures were produced.  A full investigation was undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body decided that the increase that had been imposed by the insurance companies was exactly double what the figures justified after examination by the Prices Advisory Body.  The fact that that applied to motor insurance and did not affect all sections of the community may not have made its significance as effective or may not have brought home to the people the full significance of that inquiry.  I think it is a matter of very considerable importance that, in that specific case, a full investigation by the Prices Advisory Body resulted in a 50 per cent. reduction in the increase which had been imposed and which was actually introduced last year in respect of motor insurance premiums. The inference from that inquiry justifies the House and the country in expecting that matters intimately affecting every individual in the community should be investigated fully by the Prices Advisory Body.  If import prices rise, if wages rise, if the raw materials increase in price, if a whole number of factors increase in price and whatever is manufactured or produced as a result of the particular commodities concerned increases in price, then the public will understand and will appreciate the reasons and the causes for any variation in price.  What the public do not understand and what the public find confusing is the fact that price increases take place without giving the public the information and <Col N="708" /> without revealing in public the causes for these increases.  If an increase is warranted after a full investigation then people generally accept whatever changes have to be made.  However harshly they may bear upon them, they realise that these increases are inevitable&mdash;but they realise that they are inevitable after a full examination of the facts and after a full investigation into all the causes of whatever increases may flow from that particular matter.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of tea. In recent times we have had questions in this House concerning the price of tea.  It is common knowledge that tea is available in Britain at substantially lower prices than it is available here. Nobody expects that the tea stocks which were accumulated could be utilised overnight, but it is known that those stocks are now being used up. It is known that the accumulated stocks are gradually being worked off, but no indication is given that we may expect any substantial reduction in the price of tea.</P>
    <P>No valid justification has been made for the continuance of the monopoly which is enjoyed by Tea Importers. The only argument that has been advanced here is that because we were dependent on Mincing Lane or the London tea market during the war for our supplies, our tea position was worsened.  It has not been stated whether that position was created by Government restrictions in Britain or by the tea market itself.  I think that it is generally understood that whatever limitation was imposed was a Government limitation and not a limitation imposed by private enterprise. However, circumstances have changed and we should not continue to operate a system which obliges our people to pay more for tea of the same quality than people in Great Britain or elsewhere.  If an alteration in our trading methods can enable us to get cheaper tea, surely the cost of living is already high enough&mdash;the price of essential commodities is far beyond the capacity of most people to bear&mdash;without having an official limitation or restriction, preventing a reduction in the price of tea or <Col N="709" /> preventing benefits which would flow if normal trade practices were allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer in this connection is the fact that no explanation has been given to the House as to why this Government abandoned its undertaking, contained in the 17-point programme, that it would maintain food subsidies and that the price of essential commodities would be regulated by, on the one hand, control and, on the other hand, by the maintenance of food subsidies.  In respect of a number of commodities, food subsidies have been abandoned and in respect of others, substantially reduced.  No justification has been given and no case has been made for the deception that was practised on the people or for the deceit that is being perpetrated by that alteration in policy.</P>

      <P>If Deputies want to salve their consciences by interrogations on matters of this kind, we made our position quite clear.  In the course of the recent by-election we undertook to follow a certain policy in regard to the cost of living, and we succeeded in securing from the electors of Dublin the most decisive indication of public opinion on the present cost of living that was ever given in any by-election since this State was established.  We are prepared to abide that result.  It is common knowledge for a long time that this Government is waiting for something to happen.  It is common knowledge that it has no policy, no leadership, no guidance, no direction, that the Government are hanging on in the hope that something will happen. They know that they may postpone <Col N="710" /> their doom, but that it is inevitable. If they are not prepared to adopt an alternative policy, then the sooner they give the country the opportunity that it awaits, and the sooner they give the country an opportunity of providing an alternative Government, the better.</P>

      <P>Despite all that has been said on both sides of the House, much of it was merely playing the game of Party politics again.  I am satisfied that we have come to have one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilised world.  It is no longer government by vote of the majority but government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men who, because they control money, are able to control credit and decide to whom it shall be allotted.</P>
      <P>I want to say that it is only the courage, the fearlessness, the honesty and the true patriotism that inspired the men of 1916 and the men of subsequent years that are required to challenge things for what they are, rather than what they appear to be, and to abolish the poverty and insecurity that affect so many thousands of our people to-day.  I want to make it clear, also, that whatever the Government do or wish to do&mdash;and I do not care what Government is in power&mdash;they will never do anything effective or practical until they take control of the money situation and the credit of this country and give to our Central Bank the necessary power to deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it my business to listen with great attention to the speeches in this debate.  I followed with interest the speech of Deputy Briscoe a little while ago.  Deputy Briscoe made it quite clear that he does not want to change the present system, but he wants to make it work better than it is working at present.  I listened with very close attention last night to the constructive speech of Deputy Costello and to the speech made here last week by Deputy McGilligan, the ex-Minister for Finance.  I am going to repeat now what I have said before, probably for the last time, that if the present Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach and the present Minister for Finance <Col N="711" /> and the former Minister for Finance got together, with all the goodwill in the world, to try to make this system work, it would fail them to do so unless they are satisfied that it is to operate in the interest of 30 per cent. of the population, while the other 70 per cent. are suffering from poverty and insecurity.</P>
    <P>I have no room for much of the talk that took place in regard to what happened in 1936, 1938 or 1948 or what happened in the recent by-election.  What does all that matter to the man in the street or the man down the country? Deputy Briscoe expressed his belief with emphasis that we must preserve private enterprise and that we are living in a democracy.  What use is that concept to the many thousands of our people who are living in poverty and insecurity?  What good is that concept to the thousands living in slum hovels?  Deputy McGrath will know that I am not exaggerating when I say that there are thousands of decent men and women in Cork living in hovels, pest-ridden and rat-ridden, and in conditions that are a disgrace to any civilised community.  I think we are not doing our duty, having before our minds the condition of the thousands of people who are living in poverty, if we do not take radical steps to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to read the speech of Deputy Lynch, Parliamentary Secretary, last week.  He did not consult anybody, but he seemed to be satisfied with his own statement that we were better off than most other countries and that we should be satisfied to maintain the present cost of living.  I want to tell Deputy Lynch&mdash;and I am speaking from no political Party angle &mdash;that the time has arrived when we have to face these things more realistically than we are facing them.</P>
    <P>We have the position to-day that we have 68,000 people registering at the labour exchanges.  The maximum amount allowed to any worker who is signing there is 24/-, the purchasing power of which to-day is only 11/3.  He gets 12/6 for his wife, and according to the Taoiseach's statement last May, the purchasing power of that is only <Col N="712" /> 5/3, giving his wife and himself a total income for the week of just 17/-.  That has to do them for seven days of the week.  If they are living in a corporation house they are expected to give one-sixth of their income for rent which, in their case, would be 3/6. Deputy McGrath will bear me out when I say that you cannot rent one of these houses in Cork for one-sixth of that man's income.  Therefore, the position of that man is that for seven days of the week his wife and himself have an income of 13/6.  Divide that into seven days, and you find that the man is left with 1/7 a day.  If his wife and himself are going to have anything resembling three meals a day, they are left with 6d. for each meal, without taking into account at all what a bit of firing and clothing will cost them. While conscious of having these problems behind the scenes, is it not a shame that we should be spending hours in this House talking Party politics, and of how one Party can advance against the other?</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe tried to defend the loan and the payment of 5 per cent. for it.  He complained about the last Government floating a loan at 3½ per cent. and of the fact that its market price has now gone down considerably. I suggest that, instead of wasting time here on Party politics, we should be devoting ourselves to the question of trying to change that system.  I believe that if a man puts £1, £100 or £1,000 into State funds for the purpose of building houses it should have the same value after six or ten years or any other number of years that it had when he made his investment.  Are we going to allow the gentlemen on the Stock Exchange, the manipulators of our finances, to dictate how the pound is to fluctuate, as it has been fluctuating for years?</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of the cost of living and to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is representing the Government, that I took the trouble recently of ascertaining the price of 26 items of food on the 27th September, 1951 and on the same date in 1952.  The food items which I selected are those which are used by the average housewife.  None of them could be classed as a luxury. <Col N="713" /> Their cost in September, 1951, was 46/2.  In September, 1952, the cost of the same items of food was 62/10.  I defy anyone to controvert those figures. I had a question down last May asking the Taoiseach what was the purchasing power of the pound then as compared with 1938 and 1939.  He informed me that it was 9/- Deputy Briscoe, last Thursday, emphasised the fact that the purchasing power of the pound to-day was only one-third of what it was in 1939.  I am prepared to stick to the official figure despite what Deputy Briscoe said.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that we ought to have some reality in this debate, especially as regards how people are living.  Despite the depreciated value of the pound to-day, we are only giving our deserving old-age pensioners 21s. 6d. a week.  Quite a big number of them are men who have given 50 years of honest and faithful service to the nation, and that is the best we are able to offer them.  We are told, of course, that we are spending an awful lot of money on the old-age pensioners and that the country cannot afford any more.  The fact is, taking the present-day value of the pound, that what they are actually getting is 9/-.  The man who was earning £2 14s. in 1939 should have £6 a week to-day; the man with £3 12s. in 1939 would want a wage to-day of £8; the man with £4 10s. in 1938 or 1939 would want £10 a week to-day; the man who had £4 19s. a week in 1938 and 1939 would require £11 per week to-day, while the man who had £5 8s. a week in 1938 and 1939 would require a wage of £12 a week to-day to give him the same standard of living as he had in 1938 and 1939.</P>
    <P>I submit that if we claim to be making progress we should be able to make an improvement on the standard of living that we had in 1938 and 1939. I will not agree that the masses of our people had the standard of living that they were entitled to in 1938 or 1939.  I think it is necessary that I should say this: Is not the daily imposition of poverty upon thousands of our people an offence to God?  We have the scandal of unemployed resources of labour and capital coexisting with unsatisfied want.  I <Col N="714" /> think it is time to end that.  I want to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is time we refused to accept any longer the doctrine that we must have poverty in the midst of potential plenty.</P>

      <P>I think it is an insult to our intelligence for anyone to say that the conditions operating in this country to-day are providential.  From the way some people talk about the unemployed and about poverty one would imagine that it was an act of God that it should be so.  I ask Deputies to bear this in mind, that God did not fill this earth with full and plenty to mock the sufferings of thousands of people.  God is the God of Heaven as well as the God of earth. He is the God of earth as he is the God of Heaven.  It is time that we got some conviction into our minds for the purpose of dealing with the very serious problems which are confronting us rather than be wasting the time of the House on Party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe taunted me by suggesting that I was denying the right of private property.  I have never suggested or advocated any such thing.  I did say that the control of money and credit should not be left in the hands of any group of individuals in this or in any other country. Until we take control of our money <Col N="715" /> and credit, nothing will be done.  We can go on talking here for years, but we will not get anything done.</P>
    <P>Why have I talked about the system of banking and credit?  I have an interest in the affairs of the Cork Corporation and in the citizens of Cork.  What do I find?  The Cork Corporation for the five years ending in 1941 paid an average of £46,000 per year in interest on money borrowed, and for the five years ending in 1951 they paid £70,540 per year in interest alone on money for building houses.  Last year the Cork County Council paid the huge sum in interest on loans and overdrafts in the bank of £93,274, and in six years they have paid a total of £380,470 in interest on money borrowed.  Yet Deputy Briscoe and the Minister for Finance tell us that paying 5 per cent. interest on the loan of £20,000,000 was a normal thing to do in order to get money to serve the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope to have another opportunity of discussing that aspect on the other Estimate that is coming before the House, but the time has arrived when the people elected to this House should get down to talking about the necessary changes which must take place in this country if the people are to be served.  I advocated before and I advocate now that we should have a private session of this Dáil, at which the back benchers of Fianna Fáil and the other Parties could, without Press propaganda, talk about the changes necessary to be brought about to serve the people of the country.  That is badly needed.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce is as conscious as anybody else of that, because we in this House are just children in the hands of combines and financiers and people who have no interest in this country.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the members of this House have been given the full details or the implications of the agreements which we made with the British Government in 1938 and 1948.  Whoever goes to Great Britain or anywhere else, the elected representatives of the people are entitled to be told every detail of what took place or what has <Col N="716" /> been done in the interests of this country or to the detriment of this country. I am satisfied that the implications of the 1938 Agreement are contrary to the best interests of this country.  Under that agreement Britain was to give us all the coal we required, but we were unable to get that coal because she decided not to give it.  As against that, she gave Denmark all the coal that country wanted; she increased her supplies to Denmark.  In 1948, Denmark got 813,928 tons of coal from Britain; in 1949 she got 1,609,000 tons; and in 1950, 1,876,475 tons.  Why did we not get from Britain the coal to which we were entitled in those days?  I do not care from which side of the House representatives go to Great Britain to discuss this, that or the other thing, but I am satisfied that our Budget was dictated mainly by British interests rather than Irish interests, because when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced his Budget he said that the only way to make sterling stronger was to make it scarce, and that is what we have done in regard to our business in this country since the introduction of the Budget.  I say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the time has arrived when each Party in this House should sit down and, without scoring political points, discuss and decide what changes are necessary to bring this country back to where it was in 1919 and 1920. Let us get back to the Sinn Fein days.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the selling of the National Land Bank in 1926. The Labour Party at that time objected to that.  We want to see the Central Bank Act amended in such a way that that bank will control our money and credit and give us advice in regard to it.  As it is, the Central Bank might as well not be in existence because it has no powers.  I hope the Minister will pay heed to the appeal I made, that the time has arrived for the Government to take into their confidence the people who matter in this country and have a private session of the Dáil to decide what changes are necessary and should be brought about in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent I shall probably find myself riding the <Col N="717" /> same hobby horse as the Deputy who has just concluded.  It seems to me that we are at present discussing the problems of unemployment, emigration and high prices which dominated the debates here since the Dáil began.  I do not think there is the slightest use in the Opposition berating the Fianna Fáil Government for any recent increases in the unemployment figure or for the continuation of emigration, both of which are interdependent.  Nobody can deny that the problems which created these evils in modern democracy have existed throughout the life of those who have held control of affairs here.  The usual unemployment figure has been 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000, and anything up to 20,000 usually had to emigrate.</P>
      <P>It does not matter which Government is in office, these are the facts.  I have listened very carefully and, when I have been unable to listen I have read very carefully, the speeches of the Opposition and, with the exception of Deputy Costello, and, to a limited extent, Deputy Cosgrave, I have not really received any help in finding out what the Opposition will do if and when they are returned to the Government Benches again.  Naturally, as the main Opposition they must anticipate such an occasion.  But I feel that as a responsible Opposition they have the responsibility of putting before the House a reasonable plan of campaign which they would operate if returned to control our affairs.  It must be obvious to them that speeches that go down at the crossroads or which move a mob at a street corner will not impress the average Deputy.  We expect a reasoned examination, fair criticism and, more important than all, constructive suggestions, either to help the existing administration out of its difficulties, or constructive suggestions as regards their own activities should they be returned to power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I have read or listened to most of the speeches and Deputy Costello is the only Deputy from whose speech yesterday I have received any light at all.  Now for the time we must leave aside completely the fact that Deputy Costello is the ex-Taoiseach, the ex-head of the Government.  He did not solve the problems which <Col N="718" /> existed; they may have been mitigated to a certain extent, but these problems substantially existed throughout the term of office of Deputy Costello as Taoiseach and of his Government.</P>
    <P>As an absolute realist, I must accept as axiomatic that the ex-Taoiseach did not in his time solve these problems when he was in a position to do so. We must, therefore, judge by whatever propositions he has put forward now, and we must assume that he has changed completely his solution for those problems which will doubtless be there for him if he should be returned as Taoiseach with his Government, however it may be composed. We must accept that the solutions which he tried last time substantially failed&mdash;even though you accept that there was a certain mitigation of the problems&mdash;and that he has decided that those solutions which he provided will not be put into operation if he comes back over the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>As far as our problems are concerned&mdash;and I think they are very serious ones, indeed&mdash;I said before in the Industry and Commerce Vote debate that, in relation to prices, prices were largely dependent on the two main industries, the agricultural industry and our other productive industries of relatively recent origin.  I feel, as I have always felt and believed, that our industries, factories and so on are in safe keeping with the Tánaiste.  I do, however, feel, and would like to repeat, that the time has come, in my view, where the competent and efficient industry&mdash;and there are plenty of them&mdash;must be specially considered and the incompetent, inefficient industry which shelters behind Deputy Dillon's friends, tariffs and quotas, struck out of the life of the country. The good industrialist should be given every possible encouragement&mdash;he is up against it in every way&mdash;to produce a good article cheaply and, what is very much more important, to produce a good article which he can export in the world market, the world market being the way it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that an industry based on the idea of supplying the domestic market is a futile industry. I do not think it is an industry on <Col N="719" /> which any country can exist solely. That must be accepted; certainly it is accepted by most of the countries of the world.  Even America could not live on a completely internal economy. Great Britain is now finding itself gradually losing all its colonies and gradually finding that places like Canada are moving into the dollar areas; that New Zealand is self-supporting and tending to reorientate itself towards the dollar area, and that Australia has its own problems. Similarly the whole of Europe is really becoming self-sufficient as regards its own home needs in the industrial markets.  Consequently, in the industrial field, if you take textile goods and factory products generally, any Minister or any Government trying to get a healthy industry here&mdash;I believe a healthy industry must be an exporting industry&mdash;must realise that the industrialist is up against a tremendous problem.  I do not think the good industrialist can be expected to compete in the world's market without substantial help from the Government in the form of protection, insurance and guarantees against loss if he does branch out abroad.  If the bad industrialist is put out of business you can get a good article at a reasonable price under those circumstances. It would help in the present great problem of high prices.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Bill when it is enacted will be a great help if it is properly operated.  The time has come when the Minister should reconsider the Industrial Standards Bill which did not get through the House.  The Industrial Standards Bill, if passed into law, would be a great help in carrying out this grading process in regard to our existing industries and in that way we could rid ourselves of the incubus of those people who are operating behind the protection of the tariffs and quota system, and who provide possibly a good article, often a shoddy article, at a price in excess of that which could be obtained elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Possibly one of the greatest troubles is the fact that many firms operating here, being subsidiaries of British companies, are not remotely interested <Col N="720" /> in developing our export trade; consequently it is they to a large extent who are operating to their own advantage behind the protective barriers which the early Fianna Fáil Government largely established for the protection of our own industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made a number of grandiloquent passes at the problems facing him or likely to face him in relation to high prices, unemployment and emigration.  I think I am being quite fair in saying that he really did not get down to devising a general programme which would convince anybody with a reasonably open mind&mdash; very few of us have open minds, I suppose&mdash;that he could cope with these problems which substantially overcame him during his term of office as Taoiseach.  He mentioned some alterations in the Stock Exchange.  He was extraordinarily vague about the Stock Exchange and what he wanted done. I do not know whether he wants to change the Stock Exchange personnel from being a largely Freemason dominated body to being one dominated by the Knights of Columbanus or something like that.  Fundamentally, the Stock Exchange can only be changed by a completely different approach to the use of money.  Deputy Costello left that particular suggestion rather high in the air, I thought.  He agreed, I believe, on a most important postulate of Government particularly where the Minister for Finance is concerned and in the context of the existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>He said that any future Government would be faced with getting their money at 5 per cent. and having to like it.  They had no choice.  I think that is a fair summary of what he said.  I think that is a most important admission, a perfectly sane admission under the existing circumstances.  I think that is the problem which faces the Minister for Finance.  It is one he will have to accept if he is realistic.</P>
    <P>Accepting that postulate, I think you must then go a little further and accept that this is a very high interest rate if we accept that the solution to our problems is capital investment in a very big way.  Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, was most unkind incidentally in the course of a letter <Col N="721" /> in this morning's newspaper referring to Deputy Costello's former very lukewarm and unenthusiastic reference to capital investment but we will leave that matter to Deputy MacEntee. Deputy Costello has not always been so enamoured of capital investment as he now appears to be but let us accept that this is a deathbed of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;seeing that he has now changed over and honestly believes&mdash;as I believe he now does&mdash; in a capital investment programme for the resuscitation of the State, the end of unemployment, the solution of emigration and such like problems. May I add, indeed, that with his capital investment proposition I am in complete agreement?  Fortunately, I am in rather a good position to comment on this, being, I suppose, one of the few people who had a lot of money to spend and actually spent it or arranged for it to be properly utilised&mdash;Hospitals' Sweep money.  It was, I believe, in my view quite correct to spend such moneys in prohospital facilities.  To a limited extent the orthodox economist&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;referred to the desirability of spending money on projects which might or might not give a big return or, indeed, any return at all.</P>
      <P>I think all sides of the House and, of course, Deputy Cosgrave are completely agreed that it is correct policy for the Government to develop the physical requirements of a good health service by building hospitals.  I would have liked, indeed, to have been able to spend money on projects which would give productive employment in order to create wealth for the community as a whole.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Costello's suggestion in relation to capital investment.  I believe that both sides of the House would agree with that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I suppose, in the practical application of that particular principle that the New Zealand Government established the tremendous level of prosperity which we know to-day.  It must be little comfort or satisfaction to those who are so sceptical of the <Col N="722" /> welfare State because New Zealand happens to have achieved both desiderata of a modern democracy&mdash; prosperity and, in addition, social justice for everybody.  That desirable achievement has largely sprung out of the most far-sighted&mdash;positively visionary&mdash;policy of faith and belief in the wealth of the land and in the produce of the land of New Zealand. That intensive development of their land over the years has given to them a place second to none in prosperity and wealth and social justice amongst the civilised countries in the world. Even at this late stage, we ought to accept that a solution to our problem must be a vast and large scale capital development programme.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Costello left me at any rate high and dry on another very vital problem.  Perhaps, he did not mean to do so and, perhaps, he may elucidate the matter subsequently.  I do not know.  Perhaps Deputy McGilligan or even Deputy Dillon will provide his own bizarre and novel solution to the problem.  At any rate, I must confess that I am still in the dark to know where the Fine Gael Opposition are going to find the hundreds of thousands of pounds which I feel they will have to find if they are going to provide for their capital development programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has said that he considers 5 per cent. a fair rate of interest. I think that is very dear money.  Having regard to the way we are organised here and the particular economy which exists, I suppose it may be considered to be cheap money.  But if we are going to try to develop agriculture then it is axiomatic that you must accept the proposition of making available long-term loans at low interest rates, particularly in relation to agriculture and to the development of land generally.  If Deputy Costello is going to borrow his money at 5 per cent. that is all right.  If he is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on the land and the development of the land of the country I say good luck to him.  But how is he going to provide the money at the right price for this very desirable development?  Perhaps, Deputy Costello has made a most revolutionary conversion.  Perhaps, Deputy Costello considers that it will be possible for <Col N="723" /> this Government to alter the legislation governing the activities of the Central Bank.  Deputy McGilligan hinted at that in his recent speech.</P>
    <P>If they expect to do that then I, and I am sure, a lot of other Deputies will be glad to welcome it, but I think it would be very helpful for Deputies generally to know what Fine Gael has in mind.  I do not mind what Government carries out such a programme, but any Government prepared to adopt such a policy must accept the responsibility of combining and changing the activities of our joint stock banks and our Central Bank to provide the cheap money which is essential for the rational and realistic development of agriculture, and will get my support. The other, what could be termed quick-money-producing industries, can find the capital fairly easy.  I do not think anybody has ever contested that the ordinary textile industries cannot find money.  They can.  There is plenty of it.  In regard to the development of the land, the banks do not seem anxious to lend money for agricultural production.</P>

      <P>I agree completely with Deputy Costello's diagnosis.  I agree completely with the cure he proposed. I should like to know what price he is prepared to pay for that cure.  He left us on the edge of that very interesting and important question, a question on which depends, in my view, the prosperity or otherwise of the country in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is any good berating the farmers for being lazy, improvident or anything else.  I have been a critic of the farmers.  I believe they do not pay half enough income-tax, and I am prepared to say that anywhere, but at the same time I believe that the farmer suffers from very serious disadvantages. He appears to me not to have any facilities for the proper marketing of his goods, and, in addition to being a technician on the land, he has to be an auctioneer, a shopkeeper, a good bargainer and so on.  I believe <Col N="724" /> that a lot of time is wasted in that way, in getting rid of his produce, when he should be out on the land applying his ingenuity and skill to it for the production of goods to make life easier for us in the city.  That is not the sole reason, but it is a good enough reason.</P>
    <P>I believe the farmer works terribly hard and works, on the whole, to very poor purpose.  He gets very little real return for the work he puts into his land, and this is largely due to the fact that he works with the wrong equipment, that he cannot afford the right, the most modern and the best equipment and because, as everybody agrees, our agricultural economy generally is completely antediluvian, under-mechanised and operating under tremendous disadvantages.  The result of that is hard on the farmer, but I am not gravely concerned about the farmer.  I am concerned with the fact that the general effect of that on the community is that we are living in grave fear of&mdash;disaster is a very serious word to use&mdash;very serious trouble ahead.</P>
    <P>I am a person&mdash;this is quite a dangerous thing for me to say in some ways&mdash;who fervently believes in very fine social services&mdash;sickness benefit, health provisions and so on&mdash;but I believe that all these things are inextricably bound up, logically and to the realist, with a prosperous agricultural and industrial economy.  So long as we have, on one side, an exotic and extravagant set-up of social services and, on the other, this high rate of unemployment and emigration which has been the constant criticism of every Government since the formation of the State, I am afraid it is unrealistic on our part to try to pursue it, despite its lack of realism.  We are trying to provide the super-structure of a prosperous State on a foundation of something which is positively wrong.</P>
    <P>I have asked Deputy Costello that question.  I do not expect a clear-cut answer, but I should be very glad to get it, particularly if it were in agreement with what I believe to be very necessary, that is, an amendment of the Central Bank Act so as to give us greater powers over the disposal and <Col N="725" /> repatriation of money, and to enable us to take some action in relation to the joint stock banks concerning the lending of money and their operations generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made one other point in relation to taxation.  One hears from the Fine Gael benches the most perfervid declamations of a most revolutionary type and I am sure that those Deputies who have been here longer than I and have listened to statements by Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies in former years and Fine Gael Deputies now must prick up their ears when they hear the very revolutionary things that come from over there from time to time, but, throughout all that, there runs the same constant thread. There is a tremendous obsession about taxation.  &ldquo;We will reduce taxation&rdquo; has been the constant cry over the years.  &ldquo;It might mean that we will have to reduce old-age pensions or carry out some other social change of an undesirable nature, but we must reduce taxation.&rdquo;  Deputy Costello said that, and, if he can reduce taxation, good luck to him, but, at the same time, he left us in some doubt&mdash;and Deputy Cosgrave again this morning left me in doubt&mdash;about this question of subsidies.</P>
    <P>If he is going to reduce taxation, is he going to restore the subsidies?  If he is, in the name of the Almighty, how is he going to manipulate these two quite contradictory propositions? I am leaving aside the possibility that there might be an attempt to play around with the figures on the cover of the book and assuming that orthodox financial methods will be employed. How is this tremendous sum of money required to provide subsidies to be found and how is taxation going to be reduced?  That is a simple question which I feel is capable of an answer.  I think it is positively dishonest for an Opposition to go around waving this apparent promise to the people that subsidies will be restored if they are returned to office, while, at the same time, promising our old friends, the taxpayers, that they will reduce taxation. It is a case of having one eye on Cabra and the other on Morehampton Road and I do not think that is <Col N="726" /> being quite fair as a responsible Opposition.</P>
    <P>There is a certain tempering of the enthusiasm for this promise with regard to food subsidies and there was a certain amount of circumlocution in the context of the subsidies promise. It is not quite as clear-cut and definite as it was a few months ago.  They may not mean to restore the subsidies and may not mean to reduce the price of bread, butter, tea and so on.  If that is so, I know that it would be politically inexpedient to say so in anticipation, but I suggest that it would be a damned sight more inexpedient politically not to do it if the Fine Gael Government is ever restored to office, because it would be a major failure with the people, and could only be treated by them as such. In their own interest&mdash;and I am not vastly concerned with the interests of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;it would be wiser for them to make it clear at this stage whether they intend to leave the prices of essential commodities as they are at the moment, or to adopt the good socialist principle of introducing subsidies in order to mitigate or ameliorate the hardships which these things tend to bring on the people. I would be very glad if Deputy Costello had enlightened us on those points, because I can assure him that his speech, a most interesting one in its analysis and in its occasional constructive propositions, did not, in my view, do the job of a Taoiseach or a shadow Taoiseach, and that is to say what they think of these things, and that, if they were given the opportunity of handling these problems, they would handle them quite differently.  I believe myself that the big barrier or difficulty which Deputy Costello would find as a Taoiseach would be this 5 per cent.  For he would have to lend out at 6? or 6½ or 6¼ per cent. to the farmers who could not take it at that rate or to the local authorities for house building, and they could not take it either, because the people could not pay the rates necessary to get the money back. And it would be no use raising their wages because then you would get inflation.</P>
    <P>You must get back to the root <Col N="727" /> problem of our society at the moment. That is the fact that we are trying to carry on, providing for our social services&mdash;good houses and hospitals, etc.&mdash;and at the same time keeping in power the joint stock banks and following their dictates in relation to the price of money.  It is no use appealing to these people.  We have given them authority and power to dictate these terms to us.  They are not philanthropists.  They are not interested in unemployment, old age pensioners or widows or the blind or anyone like that.  This must be said for them: they never make any profession of being interested in these matters.  They are a business concern. Money is given to them to make more money and that is what they do.  It is no good moaning and whining here. The solution is in our own hands.  It is a very radical solution and if they had to face it most Deputies would run away from it.  I would honestly like to know whether Deputy Hickey would face the very serious repercussions implied in his own statements.</P>

      <P>If the day comes you will have at least one supporter in carrying out your particular policy. In the 30 or 40 years of our Government here we have roamed far, far from the domestic programme of the founders of the State.  We have here a capitalist economy.  I think everybody will agree with that.  I would like to quote an article from a journal here.  It was written by Dr. Newman of the Catholic Workers' College, Oxford.  I deprecate in the strongest terms the use to any extent at all in political matters of what you might call ecclesiastical hatchetmen to do your dirty work.  But this quotation is so apt and so helpful to us at this stage that I do not think I can be accused of using these subterfuges to further what I believe in myself.  Dr. Newman's statement was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Capitalism can blame itself for the fact that to-day men are prone to think of liberty, justice and equality <Col N="728" /> solely along material lines.  It is a valuation springing directly from the capitalist system which condemns the worker to economic dependence, subordinates his life to care for his daily bread, and makes it impossible for him to better his lot in any other way than by the stimulation of his acquisitive instinct in opposition to that of the employer and the middleman. Living in an environment which seems to him to be entirely dominated by the material motive of gain, the worker is rich soil for materialism. It springs, as it were, from his social experience.  As a result, he distrusts all conceptions which do not present themselves as the defence of some economic interest or other and he is shy of ideas which cannot be represented in a concrete economic programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>A sound quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very sound quotation indeed.  I am deeply grateful for this particular article and have learned a lot from it.  It is an outright condemnation of the communist ideology and a perfectly sound and reasoned one.  But that particular extract is, I think, terribly important and one which for some reason or other is an attitude of mind towards this particular problem in Ireland which appears to be overlooked completely. Perhaps, it is not overlooked exactly completely, to a certain extent we have developed in other lines but to a large extent we have adopted holus bolus since the beginning of the State the attitude of the British Treasury towards economics.  It would appear to me, looking at the British Treasury and the forlorn and desolate state in which it seems to be to-day, that nothing could be more unwise and unsound for our successive Governments than to turn their heads towards the British way of economic behaviour. And although they have changed, unfortunately we have not changed our attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have thrown all this overboard now&mdash;I believe, too late.  They have thrown over the whole orthodox view on economic matters.  We, unfortunately, are meandering along accepting <Col N="729" /> the penalties of the old attitude&mdash; the impositions on our people, the inevitable unemployment, the inevitable emigration and low standards of living for our people, and particularly for our old people and various other sections who are so gravely penalised simply because we continue to follow this particular attitude.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that we have in many ways and at many times been given really first-class guidance such as the one to which I referred.  Again, may I in passing refer to the excellent articles appearing under the name of Dr. MacCarthy on the use of private property and of private enterprise in the State?  I think a lot of what is said there has been completely neglected by our big landowners and property owners.  That is one of the reasons&mdash; the neglect of development of the land by the big farmers, in particular&mdash; which have produced this sad state in which the Government finds itself, and in which, I guarantee, any other successive Government will be, unless a major reorganisation takes place in the fundamental set-up.</P>
    <P>Down in my own bailiwick near Wicklow I am within reach of about five farms running from 100 to 150 and 200 acres.  Two vast farms are owned by a Belgian.  Goodness only knows where or how he made his money, but he has come over here and bought up two of these big farms, and he has let them out for two successive years in conacre.  He does not care what happens to the land.  He is taking out of it all the time as much as he can get and he is putting nothing back. Another Belgian has bought a farm of nearly 200 acres.  He has sacked all the men, and he now has one man and a dog looking after cattle.  That farm is let in conacre too.</P>
    <P>We all know that the land is undeveloped.  We all know it is not producing one iota of what it should produce if properly worked and harvested.  It does not need any extraordinary intelligence to know what is wrong.  It has become a platitude and, because it is a platitude, we are inclined to ignore the fact that agriculture is our most important <Col N="730" /> industry and is sadly underdeveloped. The main solution to all our problems lies in the land and in an agriculture upon which we can base a really sound economy.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Agriculture since the foundation of this State has tackled the problem as it should be tackled. That may be due to the fact that there is a certain insecurity of tenure where Ministers are concerned because of changes of Government and it is not so easy to handle agricultural problems as it is to handle health, financial or other problems of the State.  The facts are there.  The figures are there. Both are incontrovertible.  There is nothing like the same increase in production and in wealth from the land as there has been from industry, industry which labours under all the disadvantages of lack of know-how, lack of faith and trust in the beginning, lack of capital, competition from abroad and all these other drawbacks.</P>
    <P>Industry has forged ahead.  If it can go further, then good luck to it. Agriculture is stagnant.  There has been no progress despite the activities of the different Ministers who have occupied that office.  I am not a farmer but I know enough to realise that our land is not producing anything like the wealth it should and could produce.  Its position is analogous to that of the father of a family who has a fixed income of £10 per week and is trying out of that £10 to educate his children, give them every opportunity he can afford, care for his parents, provide medical and health services for them and his family and at the same time spread this £10 over schemes he cannot possibly hope to meet.  We are creating no new real wealth.  It matters not whether Deputy Costello is Taoiseach or Deputy de Valera.  So long as we accept the existing fundamental economic policy of expensive money we cannot develop an economy based on a sound agricultural policy.</P>

      <P>Our colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne, said at the outset that he hoped he would say what he had to say in less time than it took Deputy Hickey to say what he had in his mind. Actually he took twice as long, but I do not complain of that because he was in one of those reasonable moods in which he was endeavouring to speak his mind on the problems that confront us as he saw them.  It is a source of great satisfaction to me to participate in this debate on a day on which it is so auspiciously inaugurated.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Dr. Browne is mistaken in his interpretation of Deputy Costello's speech.  I do not think Deputy Costello said that he accepted 5 per cent. as the minimum effective rate of interest payable on Government borrowing.  Indeed, I am quite certain he did not say that.  I think he very properly said that the action of the Minister for Finance in raising a loan at 5 per cent. would render the task of his successor proportionately difficult, but I can assure Deputy Dr. Browne that the day of Government borrowing by an Irish Government at 5 per cent. is gone and gone for ever.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Dr. Browne understood Deputy Costello correctly when he spoke of reform of the stock exchange.  I think what Deputy Costello said was that he thought the time would come when we would have to inaugurate in Dublin a money market.  If I read Deputy Costello's speech aright, I think he spoke in very great and, indeed, unprecedented detail for a leader of the Opposition of the very comprehensive programme for the reform of the financial structure of this State designed to make possible a programme of capital investment in our national resources by an inter-Party Government when this Government is put out.  It is not without significance that throughout Deputy Dr. Browne's speech to-day he referred to Deputy Costello as the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Quite so, and I noticed that, towards the end, he amended that in speaking of the shadow Taoiseach and, of course, coming events cast their shadows before, as Deputy Dr. Browne well knows.  I think he displayed a strange political sagacity and wisdom in approaching the whole of this discussion from the point of view that he was concerned lest Deputy Costello should undertake the responsibility of Taoiseach unprepared, and he apparently felt that Deputy Costello had not very long in which to prepare himself for undertaking such burdens and responsibilities and that, therefore, the sooner he arrived at precise conclusions as to what he wanted to do the better it would be for the community.

      <P>I think we have travelled far enough to-day when we have awakened Deputy Dr. Browne's solicitude that Deputy J.A. Costello should take office as Taoiseach in the next Government.  Let us not go through the whole Cabinet lest somebody should ask questions about me. That, as everyone would realise, would cause me embarrassment and distress.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne is asking&mdash;indeed I think he is entitled to ask questions&mdash;more questions to-day than he has offered solutions.  One of the questions he asked rewarded me for years of missionary zeal.  He announced that I was not far wrong when I referred to tariff racketeers.  He said that while there are honest, decent, hardworking manufacturers in this country there are, side by side with them, a number of tariff racketeers and that it is high time to root them out.  He said that the difficulty is how to encourage somebody to expand his business so as to supply not only the domestic market but to press forward for an export market as well.  I think there is a perfectly simple way of doing that.  I have always believed that there is a way of providing encouragement to industry in this country without burdening the consumer with a blister which makes his life a misery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way is to abolish all quotas forthwith, to impose a tariff on such commodities as we deem it to be expedient to protect and, if there are any imports of that commodity, to take the revenue derived from the tariff on those imports and to say to the domestic producer: &ldquo;We will give you a State subsidy of so much per article produced by you.&rdquo;  Let us take a concrete case.  Suppose we eliminate the quotas on boots and say: &ldquo;We will put a 25 per cent. duty on all boots coming in.  Out of the revenue derived from that tariff, we will give every bootmaker in this country 5/- or 7/6 for every pair of boots he produces.&rdquo; We can then tell him to do his best and sell them, at the same time pointing out that the foreign boot manufacturer has to pay a 25 per cent. tariff.  We can tell the domestic producer that his costs of production are <Col N="734" /> reduced by 7/6 a pair and that, with all that help, he should now be able to go out in competition with all comers. By that device the consumer in our own country will get a reasonably cheap article.  If the manufacturer has any pretence at all to efficiency and if he begins with a subsidy of 7/6 a pair and has to compete with people who have to pay a 25 per cent. tariff on their goods, he ought to be able to get ahead on these conditions.  If any part of his commodities is designed for export then he still enjoys the 7/6 bounty per pair on that part to be exported.  Thus, we can very quickly test the willingness of an industrialist to spread his wings and to enter on the export market.  Protect the domestic industry where necessary but ensure also that our own consumer is not as ruthlessly exploited as he is at present being exploited behind many of the tariffs and quotas in operation in this country.</P>
    <P>The Supplies and Services Bill is designed to confer wide powers and wide discretion on the Government.  I want to put it to the Government that there are two prerequisites for a Government which asks Paliament for wide powers&mdash;(1) that the Government should enjoy the confidence of the electorate, and (2) that the Government has shown some degree of prudence in the conduct of the nation's affairs prior to seeking the powers contained in this Bill.  I submit that, by both these tests, this Bill should not pass. This Government has been repudiated in a by-election by a greater majority than has ever been recorded against a Government in office in any previous by-election since this State was founded.  Nobody can say that it was the popularity alone of the candidate that was responsible for that victory, because the Government had no less a candidate than the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  Whether we agree or disagree with the Lord Mayor's politics, nobody will deny that he is popular, and would, on personal grounds, strongly recommend himself to the electorate of the constituency for which he stood.  He had every advantage as a candidate.  Yet, the moment the Minister for Finance presented himself <Col N="735" /> at the corner of Manor Street to dwell on the demerits of President-elect Eisenhower, and to display his own charms to the electorate, the Government of which he was a member was defeated by the greatest majority ever recorded in a by-election against a Government in office since this State was founded.  Is it reasonable to invest a decrepit Government such as this with the powers contained here?  The pledge which the Taoiseach gave to the four satellies has now nearly run out. Will the Government go to the country now?  Will they clear out and take the judgment of the electorate upon them? They will be wiped out, of course, but they will be honest men-such of them as are left to come back here.  They are not in that position now.  If they have a scruple that their guarantee to the four satellites does not run out until June, I think they can retrieve the situation now by saying: &ldquo;We will go out in June.  Let us hang on until then&rdquo;.  I think that if the country knew that this burden was to be taken off their backs in June we could carry on and hold them in some reasonable kind of check for the next six months.</P>
    <P>I imagine, however, that the poor satellites are going down the drain in February or June or whenever the Government goes.  Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Taoiseach when he comes home&mdash;which will be soon, please God&mdash;will meet the satellites and discuss with them whether they would not release him from the undertaking he gave them 18 months ago not to expose them to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture calls &ldquo;the cold blast&rdquo;&mdash;the blast which proved so unpropitious in North-West Dublin. The Government certainly should get out and face the people before they ask for powers such as are contained in this Bill.  Will anybody deny that when a Government has suffered an electoral reverse such as this Government has suffered they can no longer claim to represent the people?  There is not a constituency in Ireland to-day in which the Government would not sustain a similar reverse.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>The answer is no.  The importance of providing accurate and comprehensive statistics of emigration for different periods is fully realised, but serious difficulties are encountered in endeavouring to do so.

      <P>Further examination has confirmed the view, expressed in the reply to Deputy Hession, that full and accurate statistics of gross emigration to and immigration from Britain and the Six Counties for annual or shorter periods could be derived only by the institution of elaborate frontier controls.

      <P>I am also informed that, in regard to the two ships mentioned in the second part of the question, the position is as stated by the Deputy, and that the inability to tender competitively was due to the fact that the necessary steel, which must be imported, will only be supplied to shipyards here at a price substantially higher than that at which steel is available to outside competitors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Department of Health circular 74/52 of 21st October, 1952, to health authorities on the subject of the increased allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, to infectious disease sufferers.  The circular informed those authorities, that, in view of the increased allowances now payable under the regulations, I considered that the issue of vouchers for extra nourishment to certain limited classes of tuberculous patients in receipt of allowances should cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may not be aware that the issue of vouchers for extra nourishment to necessitous tuberculous patients undergoing domiciliary or dispensary treatment was commenced <Col N="760" /> some years before the introduction of the maintenance allowance scheme at a time when the cash income, if any, of such patients was, as a rule very limited.  That scheme was introduced for the purpose of providing such patients with cash allowances to enable them to maintain themselves (and any dependents) during their course of treatment.  The scale of allowance payable under the scheme is reasonably generous and compares very favourably with other social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, and having regard to the increased maintenance allowances and social welfare benefits now payable, I do not consider that the grant of vouchers for extra nourishment to persons in receipt of such allowances and benefits is now necessary.  Health authorities have been advised, however, that vouchers for extra nourishment may continue to be issued to necessitous patients, e.g., married women and children undergoing dispensary or domiciliary treatment, who are not eligible for cash allowances.  If, however, any Deputy is aware of any case of a single person in which hardship has resulted from the present arrangement, I will have it investigated if he will furnish me with particulars.</P>

As the <Col N="761" /> Deputy is aware, in July last the rate of disability benefit was increased from 13/6 a week to 24/- a week, and at the same time the maximum rates of widows' non-contributory pensions were increased from 14/- a week in an urban area and 10/- a week in a rural area to 20/- a week. The consequent reassessment of means in the case of a widow who had no other income but disability benefit resulted in the award of a non-contributory pension of 12/- a week.</P>
      <P>The effect of the changes accordingly was, in the case of a widow in an urban area, to increase by 8/6 a week the combined rate of disability benefit and widow's pension, viz., from 27/6 a week to 36/- a week and, in the case of a widow in a rural area, by 12/6 a week, viz., from 23/6 a week to 36/- a week.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances I do not propose to make any change in the existing means test for widows' non-contributory pensions.</P>

      <P>There was an increase from 13/6 to 24/- in the widow's pension.  Then there was a modification of the disability benefit, which was reduced from 20/- to, I think, 12/-.  Therefore, the difference would be 2/6 per week, would it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Offaly County Council's proposal to accept a tender for the erection of eight cottages at Derrinagun, Pullough, has been approved. No other housing proposals for the Pullough district have been submitted to me.  It is a matter for the county council to decide what further houses, if any, are required to meet local needs.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the need for immediate provision of employment in all sections of the building trade, and of an equal need for more houses and flats in the City of Dublin; and, if so, if he will request the City of Dublin housing director to make his target 5,000 houses per annum instead of 2,500 as at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ask the corporation to pull down the 100 or 200 tenement houses that they have shored up at the present moment in order to relieve substantially the unemployment situation?  There are hundreds of men in the building trade unemployed at the moment.  If the corporation started to clear these sites now these men could be engaged on that work and it would be reproductive work eventually.</P>

He said that any profits made by the Potato Marketing Board went back into the pockets of the farmers. That was the Minister's expression. In what way is the money going back into their pockets?  Surely it has not got back according to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  Is there a system of bonus?  Why did the Minster not make himself clear?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to give two examples.  The company does a great deal of unseen work in paying for diversionary charges.  For example, transport to the port for the shipping of the cargo. These level out the charges.  Another example is the hold-up of a boat at Derry.  Demurrage had to be paid on the boat at the rate of £400 a day. <Col N="782" /> The company spreads these charges over the entire trade and so enables problems of a local character to be met.</P>

      <P>In connection with the entry on to-day's Order Paper relating to the Adoption Bill, 1952, which has now been sent back by the Seanad, I conceive it my duty to draw the Dáil's attention to the fact that it is now 142 days since this Bill was sent to the Seanad after being passed by the Dáil, that is, 52 days in excess of the stated period of 90 days prescribed by Article 23 of the Constitution. This overholding of the Bill by the <Col N="786" /> Seanad would appear to call for the consideration of the Dáil owing to its constitutional implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should say that the view of the Government is that the Seanad should have requested the consent of the Dáil to a longer period for the consideration of the Bill, if that was required.  I am advised, however, that there is no constitutional objection to the Dáil considering the amendments proposed by the Seanad and accepting them, as I understand the Minister for Justice intends to propose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Bill has come back from the Seanad with the amendments after the expiration of the constitutional period. It is clearly open to the Dáil to enact the Bill by resolution without dealing with the Seanad amendments.  I am advised it is also open to the Dáil to consider these amendments and to accept them and thereby complete the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government satisfied that that is constitutionally possible without extending the time under Article 23, clause 2 of the Constitution?  It would appear from the reading of that Article that it would be necessary to extend the time formally and possibly, as a matter of precaution, to send back the amendments to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  I am not giving any opinion on these matters here, but I would suggest that the position under Article 23 is that the Bill has not been passed in accordance with Article 23, clause 1, sub-clause (2).  Therefore, it is a Bill that is in the air.  To bring it down to earth again, it might appear to be necessary that an arrangement should <Col N="787" /> be made between the Dáil and the Seanad to extend the time.  That is a matter on which I should like a direction.  I should like to know whether, under this Article of the Constitution, the Dáil can ignore the fact that the Seanad has not done anything about the Bill within the stated period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice we have got is that the Dáil can now, by resolution, deem the Bill to be passed in the form in which it left the Dáil, but there is nothing in the Constitution which requires the Dáil to exercise that power, nor is there anything in the Constitution which precludes the Dáil, if it so desires, from considering and accepting the Seanad amendments at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the constitutional lawyers may advise on the matter, arising out of the Bill the whole lives of individual citizens may be seriously conditioned.  It would be highly disastrous if, after ten or 15 years, somebody raised a constitutional issue in regard to one individual child and that its whole life would be torn up as a result thereof.  Would it not therefore be wiser for the Minister for Justice to incorporate in a new Bill the amendments which he proposed to accept, on the understanding that if he will allow this Bill to be discharged from this House, the House will provide him with every facility to get the Bill with the amendments proposed in it through with all despatch.</P>
      <P>Presumably, the Seanad would do the same thing, thus putting beyond all future possibility of constitutional doubt the validity of this Act inasmuch as it affects the lives of individuals who might be gravely victimised in years to come.</P>

I do not think there would be any difficulty if the Minister for Justice were to bring forward a new Bill with the amendments which he proposes to it, and were to discharge the present Bill.  We could put it through in less time than it would take to deal with this resolution.  That would put the matter beyond all reasonable doubt.</P>

      <P>I do not want in any way to cast the smallest doubt on the validity of the opinions which the Government got on this constitutional matter.  There is something in what Deputy Dillon says.  I think, however, that the procedure which he suggests is not necessary.  That the constitutional point will be tested some time by <i>habeas corpus</i> in the case of the custody of an infant is almost certain. We can adopt a procedure which will prevent litigation&mdash;let me say, far be it from me to prevent any litigation&mdash; but we can prevent it in the interests of the public, and make it clear beyond all doubt that that point cannot be raised.  I suggest that we now pass a resolution extending the time, get the Seanad to agree to that extension of time, and pass the Bill this evening. The whole thing could be done to-night, and then no one could ever raise the question.  As long as it depends only on the opinion of constitutional lawyers, however eminent, there will be always some one to get up and say: &ldquo;You can say this, that and the other against it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>God be good to the days when the Minister responsible for this annual Bill would take the trouble of mentioning the meaning of the four Acts in the Schedule.  I venture to think that there is not a Deputy who knows what they mean.  I think it is important that, when a Bill is brought forward, some steps should be taken to explain it even if it were only to <Col N="791" /> read out a White Paper on it so as to have the contents incorporated in the Official Report as a record of why the Bill was brought forward.</P>

      <P>The intention, as far as I know, is to reach a stage when a codification of the electoral law will take place with certain amendments.  I do not know how many Electoral Acts there are or how many will be affected.  There is no use in my saying to the House when, I think, these amendments will be effected.  I am not able to say that.  Neither can I say if these amendments were effected, when the codification would take place.  All I can say is that the Department has been working on this matter for a long time, and that we hope to do something in regard to an amendment of the electoral law perhaps within the next 12 months.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

He says that he has some trouble about the codification of the electoral law which would render the annual passage of this Bill unnecessary. May I direct his attention to the fact that there was a codification of the fisheries law introduced two years ago which is quite as complex a code and, though it was a long and arduous task, it was done?  I suggest to the Minister that he should inaugurate in his Department a similar enterprise and introduce it into this House and let the House deal with it.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill we got for the first time from the Minister an explanation which we asked for originally on the Committee Stage of the Financial Resolutions.  It was asked for by Deputy Costello immediately the Minister had sat down.  It was requested by others on this side of the House on the Committee Stage and it was requested again on the Report Stage of the Resolutions.  It was requested again on the Second Reading of the Bill.  We only ultimately got the explanation from the Minister on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The explanation requested was as to how the new method of horse-power was being computed.  It was made clear in the early stages of the Resolutions and the Bill that one of the things which Deputies on this side felt was that the relinquishment of the existing provision in respect of hackney drivers would mean that hackney cars would tend to be smaller cars.  We could not state for certain whether that would be so until we knew what was the horse-power provision.  Since we got the horse-power provisions, I made it clear in column 304 of the Dáil Debates of the 27th November last that, now that I got those explanations, I wanted to mention rates.  My wording is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The schedule deals with all the different rates.  I want to mention the rates that are mentioned in paragraph 6, so as to keep the field open for myself on Report Stage. We may consider putting in an amendment to that paragraph on report when we have had an opportunity of considering the explanation which the Minister gave earlier to-day about horse-power.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am ruling according to precedent.  Deputies <Col N="795" /> who consider the functions of the various stages of the Bill will realise what the position is in regard to amendments submitted on the Report Stage.  The Committee Stage is the stage on which each section of the Bill is before the House for examination in detail and on which amendments of substance and importance may be moved.  Unless a matter is raised as an amendment on that stage it cannot be raised subsequently.  The Chair has no means of discovering what is intended to be raised on the statement made by Deputy Sweetman. The section, as a section, is put and carried; therefore, there must be some knowledge as to what is the exact, specific and definite point that is to be raised.</P>
      <P>I read and re-read Deputy Sweetman's statement, and I cannot find anything which indicates clearly to me what was the definite, specific point which he wished to raise.  It is a matter concerned with the reduction of taxation.  That is a new matter that was not discussed on the Committee Stage.  I must, therefore, rule in accordance with long-established precedent that this matter cannot be introduced at this stage.  It is a matter of too great importance to be introduced on the Report Stage.</P>

I submit, with great respect, Sir, that the tradition of both Houses always has been to the contrary.  On the Report Stage matters that are discussed in Committee are proper for the Report Stage, and that has always been the practice.  It is not necessary to have a specific amendment on the Committee Stage in order to introduce an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I submitted an amendment in the names of Deputy Corish and myself, the object of the amendment being to preserve the present reduction of road taxation in respect of those who operate taxi cabs and hackney vehicles.  Apparently, Sir, your ruling in respect of my amendment is the same as that in respect of the amendment submitted by Deputy Sweetman.  The point I desired to cover was one which was actually discussed on the two Financial Resolutions and also on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I thought that as this particular aspect of the legislation had been pinpointed by lengthy references to the inequitable character of the taxation proposed, it would have been in order to submit an amendment on the Report Stage.  However, if you rule otherwise, there is nothing further I can do in the matter.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Minister might co-operate in this matter, that is he might agree now to recommit the Bill to Committee in which case presumably we could discuss not only the amendment submitted by Deputy Sweetman which has been ruled out of order but also the amendment which I submitted. Perhaps the Minister would do that on an assurance that that fact will not result in any further delay to the Bill if we can get a majority of the House to pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, Section 1, line 17, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to add &ldquo;except in the case of small public service vehicles used as taxis or hackney-cars when the duties to be charged shall be those specified in the Schedule reduced by 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to travel over all the ground covered before but I want to make this final appeal to the Minister. Here in this Bill we are proposing to add new burdens to the taxi owners and to the owners of hackney-cars. These are folk who earn a hard livelihood by following their existing occupations.  That livelihood is all the harder when, in fact, by the increased <Col N="799" /> cost of living and the recession in employment they find it difficult to earn a living, hard and all though it is. Not only are we imposing on them new burdens&mdash;as we are on every other owner of motor vehicles, whether private motor vehicles or lorries&mdash;but we are placing a special burden on the hackneymen and taximen to the extent that we are completely wiping out a somewhat preferential rate of taxation which they had enjoyed from, I think, 1947 to 1952.</P>
    <P>Whatever case there might be for reviewing that at some future date, I do not think that that review should take place this year or that they should be asked to share these burdens in the same year that they are called on to bear the impact of the toughest Budget that this House has known for 30 years.  I think it is unfair to impose those burdens on such persons, knowing the conditions under which they have to earn their livelihood and considering the competition they have to meet from pirate employers in the same industry.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, the Minister could without in any way seriously diminishing the income that he has calculated to come from a Bill of this kind, agree to meet the claims put forward even from his own benches on behalf of the hackney and taxicab owners.  I am not asking the Minister to go too far but merely to recognise the special character of their employment and the special difficulties that they experience in their avocation.</P>
    <P>The Minister would not in any way seriously diminish the increased income which he plans to obtain from them.  I move the amendment accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often, Sir, that I have an opportunity in getting up in the House, of thanking a Minister for his consideration in handling the business of the House, but I do thank the Minister for the way he has met the points raised.  When this matter was discussed previously we had not, as I already said, several times before, in submissions to the Chair, the position in regard to horse power that we have now before us.  It appears <Col N="800" /> fairly clear that the provisions the Minister is going to make by dividing the capacity by 125 will hit particularly those types of large car which are suitable for hackney vehicles.  The Minister will agree that it will be undesirable if as a result of this legislation hackney vehicles should become smaller than the present large ones, which are more suitable for conveyance of that kind.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the case the Minister made in the earlier stages of this Bill and the resolutions preceding it was that it was impossible to avoid what one might term the hackneyman. The Minister will say that I have introduced in amendment No. 5 a provision which ensures that only a person whose only or chief occupation is operating these vehicles will get the benefits of the remission.  The wording is taken from the Minister's own wording on the part dealing with the tractor tax.  The wording follows it exactly and when there was no difficulty in regard to the wording of the tractor tax I would suggest there would be no difficulty equally in regard to the hackney tax. If the Bill is passed without amendment there will be a real danger that not merely will there be hardship on these people but in addition there will be a tendency for them to go for the smaller type of car with resultant discomfort to passengers about whom the Minister, I am sure, is just as much concerned as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot at all concede the point made here again to-day by Deputy Norton in moving his amendment. He talked about the additional imposition on taximen and hackneymen. These proposals merely aim at restoring a position that existed prior to 1947 and if the other side of the case were to be made it is that the private owners in 1947 obtained an assurance that immediately on conditions becoming normal the 50 per cent. increase in their tax would be removed.  Instead of that, these private owners, who have paid that additional tax for the last five years, are now having their tax increased while taximen and hackneymen have enjoyed preferential rates from 1947 to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> I look at this thing entirely the other way.  My contention has been that the taxi and hackneymen have had an advantage for the last five or six years in that special rates applied to them for the first time and in view of the need there is to replenish and increase the amount in the Road Fund there was no alternative left to me but to bring about uniformity again at this particular stage.</P>
    <P>If I showed any resistance to the suggestion made by Deputy Norton in asking me to recommit these amendments to Committee, the only reason operating at the back of my mind was that I could not concede any of the points urged on me, not only, as he said rightly, by members of the <Col N="802" /> Opposition but by members of my own Party, who, hearing the particular story advanced by organised sections of the community, would naturally come to me and make that case, both privately and in this House.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that I must resist these while I am prepared to concede that when you restore the position as it existed prior to 1947, it may come as a bit of a slap to the hackney and taxi-men.  At the same time it is not unjust.  These conditions existed prior to 1947.  The money is required and I must repeat that I have no alternative but to take the course I have taken so far.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite obvious.  As things stand, a person who cannot afford to pay the full rate of annual duty at once has to pay what is equivalent to an extra 5 per cent.  We suggested on earlier stages that that was unfair and I suggest that, as the basis now stands, we should reduce it to half so that the difference will be only 2½ per cent. instead of 5 per cent.&mdash;that is to say, 6d. in the £.</P>

There is no use in my trying to mislead the Deputy or the House as to what I might do.  I think I should say that I have no present intention of changing from 30.  Certainly I must resist lowering the ceiling from 30 to 27½ which would mean that I would have discretion only as between 25 and 27½.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 1 (4) (d), line 6, to delete &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a small net point.  As I understand the position on this Bill as it is drafted, if a vehicle for carrying machinery is used by a local authority for carrying machinery, which machinery works on the public roads of the local authority and also does other work on non-public roads, say, for the Special Employment Schemes Office, then the exemption included in the paragraph falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>I am not trying in the amendment to cover any case except the local authority case.  It is purely a small technical matter.  I take it that the Minister would not wish that local authority machinery which was utilised other than on the public roads of that authority should thereby become disqualified. I am satisfied to withdraw the amendment and to give the Minister an opportunity of looking into the matter.  If the interpretation of the section is what I take it to be I think the Minister will agree with me and will be able to deal with the matter in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I was not clear what the Deputy was aiming at.  If I felt that <Col N="805" /> this amendment would result in giving the general freedom not only to local bodies in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy but also to private contractors, then I should be obliged to resist it.  I take it that the type of case the Deputy wants to make is that where a local body is the owner of machinery of this nature it is not subject to any tax for using our roads system while it is being used on its own work, and where in certain circumstances that machinery might be made available for work other than work undertaken strictly for the county council, that situation would have to be covered by law if we are to be entitled to so use that machinery.  I would be sympathetic in the matter of meeting the Deputy to that extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Schedule, before paragraph 5 (b) (iv), to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(iv)  exceeding one ton and used for haulage in connection with agriculture and for no other purpose&mdash;£25.</P>
      <P>On the earlier stages of this Bill I mentioned on more than one occasion the case of a farmer who has a lorry and who uses that lorry for the purposes of agriculture.  As the Bill is phrased by the Minister, that lorry will be taxed at exactly the same rate as a lorry that is plying every day.  The Minister will know, understand and agree that a lorry that is held by a farmer and that is used for the purposes of agriculture and for no other purposes will not be on the road anything like as often as what one might term an industrial lorry.</P>
      <P>It will be brought out perhaps during the beet season or during the harvest season alone, to bring artificial manure back to the farm.  It will only operate for a very limited number of days in the year.  I suggest that when it operates only for a limited period it should not be taxed to the same degree as a lorry which travels very many more miles.  The basis of the Minister's case in respect to lorries is, of course, the damage that is done to the roads.  I was endeavouring to provide in this amendment that the tax that would have to be paid would bear some relation to the user of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to all these exceptions and exemptions is that they are abused, that they have been abused and that they will be abused. I have satisfied myself completely that many of the vehicles that took advantage of this concession over a long <Col N="807" /> number of years could not be described as agricultural lorries in the strict sense and that they were not used by people who were deriving their livelihood from agriculture in the accepted sense.  I can see that any attempt to find a new definition or to make the regulations tighter than they were in the past will fail.  There may be some farmers who use any lorry they have for strictly agricultural purposes but I am satisfied that in these cases also, and in many of the cases that were cited here in our previous discussions such as those of farmers from County Dublin who were supplying the markets here, the lorries were used as well for purposes other than ordinary agricultural purposes. They would have to be so used or it would not pay the farmer to keep such a vehicle.  It is only people who make fairly constant use of vehicles of that kind who can afford to buy them. According to my information, the people who were availing of these exemptions and of this exceptionally low rate of tax, were people who were technically entitled to describe themselves as following agriculture but who, in the main, were living by other pursuits. I can find no soft spot in my heart for any amendment which would continue the previous practice, in view <Col N="808" /> of the need there is for more money for the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  The definition I have there is also in the Bill in paragraph 4, sub-paragraph (c) of the Schedule.  It is exactly the same wording and if the wording is good in one place it is good in the other.  I am sorry the Minister cannot show his reasonableness further.  He has shown reasonableness in regard to the last amendment and it is a pity he could not meet us on this one because the amendment is really required.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment I was making the case that the wide powers envisaged in this Bill should not be committed to the hands of a Government which had lost the confidence of the electors and, secondly, to a Government which by the improvidence of its general conduct suggested that it was not worthy of the confidence implied in the granting of these powers.</P>
      <P>I think I have established beyond cavil that a Government which has received at the electorate's hands the heaviest electoral reverse that any Government in office has ever received since the State was founded, manifestly is under the obligation of going to the country at the earliest possible moment to ascertain whether the views of the electors of North-West Dublin are reflected by the electors of the other constituencies, and I believe they are. In these circumstances, it is manifestly absurd for the Government to seek the wide powers contained in this Bill when they will proceed to use them without the confidence of the people, and with this astonishing record behind them which I now propose to detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the most recent manifestation of their folly and irresponsibility in the demeanour and conduct of the Minister for Finance to-day.  He procured that two questions should be put to him about the rate of interest payable on the Marshall Aid funds and he then sought to establish that it was highly improvident of an Irish Government to borrow these funds at 2½ per cent., payable to a foreign Government, when they might borrow money at 5 per cent. on the open market.  The case he made was on the face of it grotesque.  But let us suppose that the case he made were true and that is the representation he made to Dáil Éireann.  But the fact is that when he came into office there was a sum of <Col N="812" /> £24,000,000 in cash on his desk.  He said to-day that to borrow that money and to use it for the capital purposes for which we intended to use it was egregious folly and a gross misuse of the discretion vested in the Government.</P>
    <P>If that is the criterion which he set for himself, why did he use in six short months £24,000,000 of that money?  In the previous three years we had gradually appropriated for capital purposes £16,000,000 of the counterpart moneys derived from the Marshall Aid loans. We left £24,000,000 in hard cash at the disposition of the incoming Minister for Finance.  He says that he looks back to-day with horror at the improvidence and folly of borrowing that money at 2½ per cent.  Nevertheless, within six months he borrowed and spent more than we had appropriated in the previous three years.  That is his own declaration.</P>
    <P>He answered two questions to-day and when I asked a supplementary question he said: &ldquo;Will the Deputy wait until I come to my considered answer to the question which Deputy Cogan has put down?&rdquo;  He made the case that to borrow this money at 2½ per cent. payable to the American Government was the equivalent of paying 12½ per cent. on a National Loan.  He is a stupid man but we must give him the credit that he has persuaded his own limited intellect of the truth of that proposition.  Having done so he says himself that he borrowed and spent £24,000,000 on terms which he now regards as improvidence to the point of recklessness.  We should remember that when he came in here to speak on the token Estimate for the Department of Finance a week or a fortnight ago he told us that he admitted that when he was bringing his financial proposals before the Government he was met by his colleagues with reluctance.  They did not want to be associated with this but he felt it his duty to remind them that the Government had collective responsibility. He said: &ldquo;I told them that either they adhered to my proposals or my duty was to resign!&rdquo;  He went on: &ldquo;The Taoiseach and every one of my colleagues came round to my point <Col N="813" /> of view and authorised me to approach Dáil Eireann as the representative of a united Government sharing responsibility for every item of the policy I put forward.&rdquo;  He has hung round the neck of every one of them full responsibility and warns them: &ldquo;If you attempt to throw me overboard I will drag you all with me and the four satellites to boot.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A week later he comes in and tells us: &ldquo;Never was money borrowed in so improvident a way as the Marshall Aid funds.&rdquo;  But he did not add: &ldquo;When I had a chance of repaying £24,000,000 of that money I did not take it.  I spent it in six months, albeit that I believe it to be borrowed on a basis more improvident than ever characterised a financial transaction of this country in the past.&rdquo;  That is the Government which asks us now to give it these powers in this Bill.  They are all joined in that.  It astonishes me that they have the audacity to propose that this House should give them the wide discretionary powers involved.</P>
    <P>I remember frequent debates when we were in office on the subject of unemployment. I remember my colleagues saying repeatedly, &ldquo;Let our policies be judged by how far they achieve our aim of enabling people who want to earn their living in this country to find jobs at wages which will enable them to maintain a family in decent comfort.&rdquo; I remember Deputy Davin saying shortly after our Government left office, &ldquo;The plain fact is that three months ago there was virtually full employment in rural Ireland.&rdquo;  That was a proud boast.  We sought to provide the means to put capital works in progress because we felt that where you had men and materials and capital and could bring them together for the creation of wealth-producing projects and for the creation of projects which raised our people out of the slum dwellings and condemned houses to put them in decent homes, or where we were able to provide accommodation which permitted our people to turn their backs forever on the county home and to have decent standards of treatment and comfort in hospitals where they could be cured of their ills, it was the duty of the Government, if no <Col N="814" /> other agency was available, to bring money, men and goods together and boldly to use them for the joint purpose of enabling our people to work in their own country for the benefit of their neighbours and, secondly, for creating the wealth potential of our society in the years that lay ahead.</P>
    <P>What is the position to-day?  I say that this Government has deliberately and expressly accepted the proposition that our people were eating too much and living too well and that it was the duty of the Government to see that they would not eat as much in the future and that their standard of living would be brought down to a level which the Minister for Finance considered good enough for the people of this country.  And they have done it.  I challenge anyone in this House to deny that there is less bread being eaten in Ireland to-day than there was 12 months ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what I am speaking of.  There is less bread being consumed in this country at the present moment than there was 12 months ago. The Minister may be bewildered with statistical calculations which are furnished to him by civil servants in Kildare Street, in the Department of Finance or elsewhere.  I am talking of what I know from my own neighbours and what my colleagues know from their neighbours, and that is, there is less bread being consumed in Ireland because the bread costs too much. Many people may imagine that the dramatic decline in the consumption of stout and beer is due to the increased tax on stout and beer.  I thought that too, but it is not true.  The decline in the consumption of stout and beer is due to the fact that a great many working people in this country, when they come to Saturday night have to hand over so much of their earnings to the woman of the house in order to keep the household going that they <Col N="815" /> cannot keep back the 5/- or 10/- they used to keep back for going to the local.  I am not saying that that is good or bad, but I make no apology for saying quite openly and frankly, before temperance reformers and everyone else, that it is not part of an Irish Government's job to reduce our people to a level of poverty which denies them the discretion to regulate their own drinking habits.  If you are a temperance reformer, go out and argue with people about temperance. That is a good thing to do.  But it is not part of the duty of an Irish Government to leave the working man in this country so poor on Saturday night that there is no discretion left to him.  He must either leave the children hungry or go dry himself.</P>
      <P>I say this is the position which is obtaining in an ever-widening area in this country at the present time.  I have never felt that in connection with the decline in consumption of spirits. The consumption of spirits fluctuates pretty closely in relation to the excise duty levelled upon it but when you see the consumption of beer and stout slumping away down under the impact of an excise duty and not coming back but continuing to drop slowly away, you can be perfectly certain that it is indicative of a quite different condition than that which you readily expect from an increase on the excise duty on beer.  It means&mdash;and we all know it means&mdash;that those who are responsible for families in this country have imposed upon them an obligatory temperance. It is an obligation imposed on them by the alternative of leaving their children hungry or naked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be an utterly shocking thing that we in our own country should do to our own people what we would be prepared to take up arms in our hands to prevent a foreign government doing.  Does any Deputy doubt that if the British Government were in power here and openly announced a policy in which they were going to make our people hungry and poor, the mildest among us would not have felt there was justification in resorting to any weapon to prevent them from doing it?  Was it <Col N="816" /> not the famine that drove the people in '48, ill-equipped to bear arms as they were, to bear them rather than lie down and die of hunger in their own country, because they said no Government but a British government would do that here?  Rather than submit to famine they would sooner risk being shot or hanged for bearing arms.</P>
    <P>Nobody is going to die of famine in this country, but we are going to have hardship and see the standard of living reduced.  The astonishing thing is it is our own Government that is doing it, and doing it, they say, for the benefit of the people.  Who is benefiting? What is the purpose of government if it is not to provide people in their own country with a decent living?  What merit is there in taking from the people the modest standard of decency they enjoyed 18 months ago and telling them: &ldquo;We hope some day you will get part of it back, but in the meantime get down where you belong.  Get down to the standards of peasants and the proletariat, and let no one presume in this country to make the case that our people are entitled to a standard of living superior to that&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If I believed that I would advise the people of Ireland to get out and go somewhere else.  I would not ask anyone to stay in the country in the belief that he looked forward for himself, his children and his children's children to a lid being clamped down forever upon him and being told that he was never to rise from the low standard of living appropriate to peasants and proletarians. It is because I am convinced this country can provide for her people a higher standard of living than that of many other agricultural countries in the world that I consider it a privilege to live here and a proud duty to participate in the public life of this country.</P>
    <P>Just imagine what kind of mentality brings a man into the public life of this country to see that our people are impoverished. This is the Government controlled and directed by the Minister for Finance, coerced by his threat of resignation into sponsoring this measure which asks us to give them wide powers in connection with supplies and services. Not unless we are daft.  I look <Col N="817" /> at the four satellite Deputies of this House who are now supporting Fianna Fáil.  There is not one of them but pleaded in their constituencies that the cost of living was one of the issues which forced them into supporting Fianna Fáil and deserting the inter-Party Government.  After three years administration in this country, in the course of which the inter-Party Government had to contend with the devaluation of the £ and the impact of the Korean war, the cost of living had gone up by two points when this Bill came to be debated in 1950.  Between then and the subsequent June I think it went up a further four or five points.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office the cost of living has gone up by at least 12 per cent.  Why has it gone up?  Because this Government set out their policy to make it go up.  It was they who took the subsidy off the bread in part, off tea, off butter and off the other foodstuffs the increase in which has produced the increase in the cost of living under which we are struggling at the present time.  They told us their hearts were moved by the prospect of unemployment at the very time when those best qualified to judge were stating that in rural Ireland there was virtual full employment.  Let me read from an official publication which reached me in the course of the last ten days.  These are the figures.  The total number of unemployed has gone up in the last 12 months by 10,000.  I refer now to the industrial analysis life register, mid-October, 1952.  It referred to an increase in the number of unemployed persons in certain groups of employment.  General building construction and repair, an increase of 596 unemployed persons.  What is the reason?  Slackness in building and allied trades.  Is it suggested by any side of this House that the housing problem is solved?  Is that the reason that we have shipped timber to Belfast?  Docks, harbours, piers and lighthouses, 201&mdash;slump in dockside employment.  Our policy was to increase production so that the exports of our agricultural industry would be adequate to pay for whatever imports were required.  This Government came in and announced that their object was <Col N="818" /> to cut down imports.  While they warned of bankruptcy awaiting us, inevitably there was no prospect of our agricultural industry providing the additional exports in the foreseeable future in time to save the nation from the collapse that they threatened.</P>
    <P>The only way, they said, to cut the balance of payments was to make the people eat less and spend less and they have done it.  It is no mean achievement in 12 months to have turned this country into a country exporting building timber to Belfast.  Remember that all this was done by a procedure envisaged under this Bill of quasi ordinance and by their own confession they have decided to stop house building.  They came forward with proposals three months ago intended to raise the interest rate on people who were seeking house-building loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. Representations were made from every side of the House detailing the hardships which those proposals would bring to everyone who under the Acts had building projects already in hand. The Government changed its mind and said: &ldquo;We agree that would be an unbearable hardship on those having plans on hands to put this extra levy on them and therefore we will change our programme and give the money at a lower rate of interest to everybody with commitments already made.&rdquo; What did that imply?  If they themselves admit that unless they make the money available at a lower rate of interest those already building would suffer intolerable hardship, does it not follow from that that they concede that from October, 23rd, nobody is, in fact, going to avail of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to build a house? They admit that under the new rate of interest it would be unreasonable for anybody to persist with an existing contract for building a house.  How much more unreasonable it would be then to ask any young fellow contemplating matrimony to set out <i>de novo</i> on the erection of a house under the terms now available.  Signs on, the builders' suppliers of this country having noted that, properly applied to the Minister: &ldquo;Let us ship this building timber now for we will not want it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> The Minister says, of course, that they could buy cheaper timber elsewhere. But they have never tried to explain how, if it is possible to buy cheaper elsewhere, the people in Belfast do not try to buy it.  The truth is that we had accumulated a stock of timber but the present Minister said to the builders' suppliers: &ldquo;This timber will not be required now because the consumption of the people is about to disappear, and timber from Riga or wherever they get it will be here long before the prospective demand for timber will make any serious inroads on your present stocks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government is held up to odium because we encouraged builders' suppliers to lay in timber in anticipation of a demand so vigorous and strong by the people that the timber would be turned over to the contractors as quickly as the shippers' orders could be filled.  Fianna Fáil's answer is: &ldquo;Ship the stuff to Belfast and get it off your hands as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No smart Alec crosstalk will alter the facts.  When we were in office the quantities of timber were coming in on such a scale that, according to the present Minister for Finance, there was danger of turning the whole country into a timber yard. We went out of office and the next moment the timber we brought in for dollars&mdash;we deliberately insisted on getting dollars and spending the dollars on timber for our own people &mdash;was loaded in flat cars and shipped to Belfast.  Those are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I am making is this: the Government are undeserving of the confidence necessary for the passing of this Bill.  The position we have had ever since Fianna Fáil came into office is that everything the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, says, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, contradicts, and then the <i>Irish Press</i> comes out the following morning and sings a third and different tune&mdash;and &ldquo;you pays your money and takes your choice.&rdquo; Whatever suits the boys is always there for them.  There is the Party line a lá Lemass, there is the Party line a lá MacEntee and there is the Party line a lá Pravda, and you can quote them with equal authority in the certainty that the others will always contradict them.  The facts are that Deputy MacEntee says he made the Government and everyone else toe the line and I challenge them to throw him overboard.  The Tánaiste may talk very bold and may vow his intention to do this and that but when the facts come to be read the Tánaiste is trotting along after the Minister for Finance like any &ldquo;penny-boy&rdquo; but as he is trotting he is still protesting that he is really going in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that timber is going to Belfast.  The facts are that our people cannot build houses.  That may rend the tender heart of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the Minister for Finance does not give a fiddle-de-dee.  He warns the Tánaiste that if there is any departure from that course of policy he will resign, <Col N="821" /> and he will bring the whole rotten edifice down around his ears.  He sees himself like Hitler in the Chancellery in Berlin; if he cannot rule Ireland he will ruin it, and if he cannot rule Fianna Fáil he will ruin it and bring it down around his head.</P>
    <P>Mark you, facts speak louder than words.  Fianna Fáil are making a great effort to keep the building standing, and the Minister for Finance is strutting about like a cock in a barnyard and when anyone crosses his path he warns them: &ldquo;We will rule you or ruin you; one rude word to me and you are out facing North-West Dublin.&rdquo;  There is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy who does not turn up the collar on his coat when he hears those words and the four satellites put on a &ldquo;Parker&rdquo; or a fur coat, tip their hats and say: &ldquo;All right, sir; we would sooner stay where we are.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now, it was not mouse traps that were on the flat cars going to Northern Ireland.  The Minister's heart was stirred by no Pied Piper of Hamelin sentiments when he shipped timber to Northern Ireland.  It was not to catch rats or mice that he sent that. If he had sent mouse traps we would probably have had no complaint about them.  I heard no complaint about mouse traps going up to Northern Ireland.  Only the photographer went out and took the photograph we would have known nothing about it and we might have been told that it was mouse traps that were going out, but they were blooming big mouse traps&mdash; 14 x 3 x 3&mdash;big enough to catch ferrets or badgers.  It was not mouse traps. It was building timber, but we were told there had been no stockpiling of <Col N="822" /> timber.  At least that confusion has gone.</P>

We replied there was no such improvident purchase. There was stockpiling.  We sent for the editors of the four national newspapers in the autumn of 1950.

Fianna Fáil says that was not so but facts speak more eloquently than the falsifications of the Minister for Finance.  Here we are in the year 1952, a year in which the Minister for Finance&mdash;he is the big shot&mdash;informs the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis that we are faced with an adverse trade balance of £50,000,000 sterling on our exports and imports, visible and invisible.  The Tánaiste, with more resource, says £50,000,000, £25,000,000, £10,000,000, may be nothing at all.  He is backing his horses both ways, first, second and third.

This is the Government that asks now for wide discretion under the powers of this Bill&mdash;a Government which, in November, 1951, managed to be out £10,000,000 on the adverse trade balance in the calendar year 1951.  In November, 1951, the Minister for Finance, speaking in this House, said that he looked again on the forecast of an adverse trade balance of £70,000,000 and that he saw no rational reason for amending the forecast&mdash;and there were then only six weeks of the calendar year to run.  This year, he tells us: &ldquo;Prepare for emergency, for there will be an adverse trade balance of £50,000,000 to be met out of our savings accumulated abroad.  His colleagues say £50,000,000, perhaps <Col N="825" /> £25,000,000, maybe £10,000,000&mdash;maybe nothing at all.  We arrive at the end of the year with the prospect of a very trivial one.  Bear in mind that a mistaken prophecy would be a very trivial offence, but it is on the strength of those prophecies that they taxed bread, tea, butter, sugar and every commodity which our people have to purchase.  It is on the strength of those prophecies that they told our people the time had come to recognise that they were eating too much and living too well.  They quoted those figures as evidence of the fact that our people were eating too much and living too well and must be made eat less and live at a lower standard so as to bring the adverse trade balance back into equilibrium, and they said that there was no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are asking to get powers under the Supplies and Services Bill.  I would as soon give it to a very foolish person.  Let me look for a moment at the uses to which they have put the powers that they have enjoyed in the past 12 months.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made a series of Orders controlling the disposal of hides in this country by virtue of the powers enjoyed under that Act.  Do you know what the position to-day is?  If a beast is slaughtered in a slaughter-house anywhere in Ireland for consumption by our people the price payable by the tanners for the hide of that beast is 4d. per lb.  If the beast is slaughtered for consumption by the British people the price payable for that hide is 1/7 per lb. f.o.b. a ship in Dublin.  That is 1/3 per lb. of the hide. There is an average of 60 lb. in a hide. That means that £3 15s. is levied on every carcase of meat slaughtered in this country for consumption by our people&mdash;and who pays it?  The man who buys the meat pays it; it is put on the price of the meat.  The canner will not pay it.  It is time to say out plain and frank that the canners of this country&mdash;and I wish them well&mdash;have been making profits on a scale that no other industry in Ireland has been making.  Some of the canners of this country have been making profits of a character that would stagger you. <Col N="826" /> They were very enterprising men and so long as they were making those profits out of the British or the United States my general reaction was more power to their elbow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did you give them the guaranteed minimum of 2/6 a hide, which has caused this debt of £500,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the British Ministry of Food said to us: &ldquo;We are prepared to pay 1¼d. more for carcase beef than for beef on the hoof.  If that does not meet the expenses of the canners or the slaughter-house proprietors' expenses in Ireland it is your own fault because you are levying on hides.&rdquo;  I wanted to build up the carcase meat export industry and to make it pay.  We all came to the conclusion that it was reasonable so long as the British Ministry of Food said: &ldquo;Let the fellow in Dublin who slaughters a beast for consumption in London get the same price for his hide as the man in Birkenhead who slaughters a beast for consumption in London and then make up whatever differential remains.&rdquo;  I said that we could not resist that case, that we could not go to the British and ask them to subsidise the hide tanners and factors in this country but that we must see that the fellow who slaughters a beast in Dublin for consumption in London gets the same as a man in Birkenhead who slaughters a beast for consumption in London.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The same price.  What actually happened was that they got the same price.  The British made up the differential that made it possible for us to export carcase meat.  The facts will tell us the result of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the figures for the export of canned and dead meat that took place over those years. The result of that policy was that we provided for our people a growing market for these commodities.  We created a situation in the abattoir in Dublin that they could not kill any more cattle in it.  We built factories <Col N="827" /> all over the country to the point that my successor in office, when he was introducing his Estimate said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Build no more factories for dead-meat because there is a sufficiency of them in this country for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no, no.  The Trade Agreement of 1948 provided that there would be a 10 per cent. limitation on the export of live stock from this country to other countries&mdash;10 per cent. of our total exports.  Throughout the whole period of our Administration there was never any limitation on the export of live stock to any other destination in the world.  Under those conditions of free export it was never possible to get shipping to fulfil that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I warned our people in connection with catering for the prime carcase meat trade in the United States because past history taught us that, while you might get a nice profit out of it for the time being, as soon as the Americans could get their demands in America and in Canada they would squeeze us out.  The price to-day does not make it worth selling a pound of prime beef in America.</P>

      <P>The British market will be there.  We have a grip of it under the trade agreement, guaranteeing to our farmers every day, month and year every penny that is made by the <Col N="828" /> British farmer.  Our carcase meat trade will be built up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They were told to go in and examine industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They examined, in particular, industrial conditions, and their views on the agricultural industry in this country are not worth the ink they are written with.  I happen to know that they met some of the cute boys in the dead-meat trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told them about this limitation you had imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who thought they were not making enough out of canning carcase beef and that they ought to be given a wider scope not to skin cattle, but to skin the farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those cute boys always found, so long as I was in office, that their schemes for skinning the farmers of this country were brought to nought before they even got under way.</P>
      <P>We are now entertaining them with the high hope that under the new departure that was recently created, when Fianna Fáil got into office that they would get a softer deal if they could create a good American alibi for the new departure.  So we had talk of a levy on live-stock exports to stimulate the dead-meat trade and talk of the necessity for doing something to encourage the export of American beef. Who were the people who gave that counsel to the American team?  Does the Minister know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I advised&mdash;and I stand over that policy without hesitation or cavil; it is facts and results that prove policy&mdash;that where our future lay was in markets that we could retain and control.  That policy is the policy that built up every slaughter-house in Ireland to-day.  It is that policy which has maximised exports and it is not the policy that was proposed to the American team by the cute boys who had access to them, and put their side of the case to them and took damned good care that they would hear no other side.  Some day perhaps the Minister will tell us who were the individuals with whom the American team discussed the dead-meat industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no reason why you should impose that restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps now the Minister will give us that interesting information. I want to know does this House approve of the arrangement whereunder the carcases would be consumed by our people and the hides would sell at 4d. per lb. whereas they got 1/7 per lb. for every hide off carcases that go to Britain?  I urge on the Minister now, that the time has come to break up the dirty ring which dabbles in hides and simply say: &ldquo;Let there be free trade in hides so that we can pay the best price to the farmer who produces the beast from which they are taken.&rdquo;  So far as the canners are concerned, if the Minister is worrying about their financial resources, I suggest that he should ask them to submit their true accounts to him and then consider if there was not an ample margin in the profits earned by them during the last two or three years to meet any charge that came in course of payment and then go to the tanners, who distributed a 100 per cent. share bonus to their shareholders, and ask them if a little of that might not be appropriated to pay a proper price for Irish hides at a time when they were paying 50 per cent. more for hides brought from the Argentine.  They were paying 2/6 per lb. for Irish hides at the time that they were paying 3/6 to 3/9 for Argentine hides.  They paid for the Argentine hides on the dot but because <Col N="830" /> the 2/6 hides were Irish hides, they could not pay that.  Somebody else paid that.  If they were able to pay 3/9 for the Argentine hides they were damned well able to pay our people the 2/6 that they were asked to pay.  Let the House decide who is right and if they think that our attitude is right let them decide whether the Minister should have the power he is given under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has power under the Supplies and Services Bill to deal by way of licence with turkey exports.  These are rather humble everyday matters which I suppose are beneath the exalted attention of so great a man as the Tánaiste but I happen to have seen some of my neighbours trying to sell turkeys in Ballaghaderreen and I have seen them robbed.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture to take steps to see that the officials in his Department would go down there and stop that and what does he tell me?  That they are there for the purpose of advising women who have turkeys to sell whether their turkeys are fat or thin.</P>
      <P>Now, in the name of Providence, how does a woman who is selling a turkey want to be told by a poultry instructress whether her turkey is fat or thin?  Let him tell his instructresses to tell the chancers who are offering 2/6 per lb. that they must pay the fixed price and see that the woman selling the turkey gets that price.  Under the arrangements at present existing, if the poor woman does not accept the price she is offered by the dealer, he will call her names and she will accept anything she is offered and run like a red shank rather than have herself exposed to such abuse before the whole market. It is not possible for her to establish her rights without assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no Order under this Act relating to turkeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a scandal that there is not?  When I was Minister for Agriculture I lost no time in taking measures to ensure that the producers were paid the proper price, and the minute I detected a couple of chancers robbing the people of a <Col N="831" /> proper price for turkeys I made them deal in rabbits or some other line of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no Order made under this Act relating to turkeys&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhere, somehow, there was a licence to export fowl&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Live pigeons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not live pigeons. I do not blame the Tánaiste for not knowing the difference between pigeons and turkeys.  I was dealing with turkey cocks and hens, and my purpose was to stop the fowl-buyer from giving people for turkey cocks the price of live pigeons, and I succeeded.  I succeeded very simply by going to a couple of chancers, whom I caught at the job, and putting them out of that business, and by telling them to go and deal in rabbits, pigeons and things of that kind.  When I cleared them out, the rest of them were going out the road offering to pay the people 4/- per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister for Finance thinks that if the people got a proper price for turkeys they would be living too well and they might be eating too much.  If you cut down the receipts of a woman for her turkeys, it means that she will eat less.  She will consume less and she will live at a lower standard than she would live if she were given a proper price.  I was walking up Kildare Street recently and I was ashamed of my life when I met a respectable woman coming down the street with two small boys, one of whom was about five years and the other about seven.  They were apparently pointing out to their mother, children's coats in a shop window and I heard her say to them: &ldquo;Next year we shall be able to buy two nice coats.&rdquo;  The two kids were going about in their figure with mufflers wrapped around them instead of coats.  There was the woman walking past and she did not know how to console them further than by saying: &ldquo;Next year we will buy them.&rdquo; I was ashamed of my life as I walked past her wearing my own coat.  She <Col N="832" /> was making no moans but was trying to encourage them by telling them that by next year she would buy them two nice coats.  Have we all gone daft? What Deputy in this House wants to see a poor woman&mdash;and not such a poor woman&mdash;walking the streets of the town, not being able to buy a coat for the child walking beside her on a cold day?  I do not believe that any Deputy wants that.  Yet we have this fantastic little man, the Minister for Finance, telling us that he went into the Government and said to the Government: &ldquo;I shall take the coats off them and I shall take the food from them and if they do not accept that policy I shall resign and they will have to face another North-West Dublin.&rdquo; He said, and he emphasised it, that the Tánaiste and every one of his colleagues were prevailed upon and authorised him to say to the House on their behalf, there being joint responsibility, that they accepted that position. I think that when I put it that way to the Tánaiste he is shocked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked at anyone talking such nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I being unjust?  Take the ordinary working man or artisan who is bringing in £6 or £7 a week on a Saturday and plans to get overcoats for his two children.  They will cost maybe £5 or £6 for the pair of them. Since he finds that the household bills have imposed on him the obligation to give up drinking stout and cut down on his tobacco, he says to his wife: &ldquo;If the children want coats I will give up smoking altogether.&rdquo;  His wife says: &ldquo;I think the children will be able to get through this winter without the coats; we can wrap them up warm when they are going out; we will do with what they have and get the new coats next year.&rdquo;  Is that a fantastic picture?  I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, I give the Minister credit for this, and I think when it is put to him in that crude familiar form, he is himself a little shocked and he says: &ldquo;Do you really suggest that I and my colleagues agreed with the Minister for Finance to take the coats off either child?&rdquo;  I honestly do.  I do not think that the Minister himself foresaw the <Col N="833" /> full consequences of the policy to which he was being betrayed by the Minister for Finance.  I do say quite deliberately, and I challenge effective repudiation of this, that the policy of the Budget, for which every member of that Government was made responsible, was to take the coats off the children of working people in this country.  The charge against us was that our policy was to put coats on too many, that we were bringing in too much material to make coats, and that we were bringing in too much wool to weave into cloth to make coats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the cloth that you brought in&mdash;4,000,000 square yards of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the charge against us that we brought in too much consumer goods, that we brought in too much goods which the people were buying and wearing out?  Was not that the cloth out of which the coats were to be made and which those two children would have worn if we had remained in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased children's allowances will help to buy them coats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has said that the total measure of his exertions was to contribute 1/6 a week to the family household to offset the burden which that family has to carry. Now, if you tried to pay £5 for two children's coats at the rate of 1/6 a week you would get a very dusty answer from any trader in Talbot Street to whom you went to make that proposition.  The Minister and myself have some familiarity with the drapery trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has very little familiarity with the children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that 1/6 per week extra was the measure of the relief which it was designed to provide to offset the burden which the ordinary family has to carry under the Budget.  I think the Minister himself is shocked at the simple story I have told him.  I think he would have been <Col N="834" /> as uncomfortable as I was when told that story and I give him credit for that.  If he went into any draper's shop in Talbot Street, Earl Street, Camden Street or in Ballaghaderreen and put that proposition to a draper, that he should give two children's coats on credit and pay £5 for them at the rate of 1/6 a week, he would, I think, get a very dusty answer.  I put it to the Minister that that is what he has been walked into.  I say to him that if he has suffered himself and his colleagues to be walked into that kind of position at the hands of such a vain little peacock as the Minister for Finance he is not fit to have the power which he seeks to have under the Bill that we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude.  I am not without hope that the suggestion which I am going to make may fall on a more receptive Minister than the one I was addressing when I began.  I am not asking anyone on the Government side of the House to accept what I say as the truth.  All that I am asking is this: On the grounds set out by me, go to the country.  In the last analysis I had never accepted the de Valera dictum that our people have no right to do wrong.  It is true that nobody has the right to do what is morally wrong, but a sovereign democracy, such as our people are, have dearly won the right to perpetrate political folly on themselves whenever they like, and in that sense the people have the sovereign right to do wrong.  Give them that chance to vote&mdash;to do right or do wrong.  Is it not fair to suggest that the last time you went to them you were buried alive in the votes of the people of North-West Dublin, and you were buried alive there for your actions, even though you put forward the best candidate you had.  That is what happened to the poor man, your candidate, with all the glory of the Lord Mayoralty about him.  You tarnished every brass button on him by exposing him to the people of North-West Dublin.  You got a good decent man to stand as your candidate, but Deputy Tom Byrne walked on him and did not leave the colour on him on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> By the criteria I have put forward, and by your own dismay at the consequences of your own policy, as related by that respectable woman in Kildare Street, do you yourselves not feel that the time has come to test the sense of our people and get their verdict on you?  Give the four poor satellites some compensating consideration. If you make the proposition that the price of your going to the country now would be to put the four tulips in the Seanad, we will go a long way to try and meet you.  We would park them anywhere and almost on any terms to persuade you to go to the country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the flatulent humbugs who sometimes suggest that Parliaments and Governments and a vigorous Opposition are inimical to the welfare of this country.  I am proud of this Parliament and jealous of its rights and reputation.  I am certain that it is the greatest citadel of liberty that our people could have.  I am delighted to do my part either as a member of the Opposition or as a member of the Government, and I consider it an honour to work in either capacity.  I think a general election is a good thing when the Government's authority is rendered weak by a legitimate doubt as to the validity of the warrant that it holds from the people to govern the country.  The Fianna Fáil Government of to-day is the legitimate Government of this country and every member of it is entitled to the respect which that position entitles him to, though some persons, lay and clerical, have overlooked that fact in the recent past.  I do not.  I think it is bad for a Government in this country or any other country to be clinging to office long after the people believe that they no longer have a valid warrant of authority.  Every Fianna Fáil Deputy knows well that he would not stand a chance of a snowball in hell if he went to the country to-morrow.  I do not think it would be fair to tell them that they have the obligation to go to-morrow, if they think that this is a disadvantageous time.  Will you go in February or will you go in June?  Will you go at any reasonably early date so that your <Col N="836" /> policy can be tested and so that we can find out whether our people want the Government to continue on the assumption that the people are eating too much and living too well?</P>

      <P>I do not need to test it. We have tested one constituency and look at the result: two to one against the Lord Mayor.  If it were anybody else the devil a vote at all he would get.  If there was another election of that character I do not think that you would get a candidate to stand.  If there were another by-election in North-West Dublin would you get a candidate to stand?  To whom would you turn?  If Andy Clarkin, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, gets beaten two to one, who else would you put up?  He will find it hard to save his deposit. In that situation does not the Tánaiste agree that this whole doubt can be settled in a constitutional and proper way by going to the country in February or, at the latest, in June?</P>
      <P>I think you ought to go in February. It is bad weather for campaigning, but it will be worth it.  Then, if you do your job on this side of the House half as well as we did it for 16 years before we took office and for 18 months since we left office, this country will have much more reason to be grateful to you than they have now after the 18 months' depredation you have done since that unhappy hour when the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo; on my right eased you into office, consequent on the various bargains and arrangements you made with them.</P>

      <P>It is not my practice to contribute to or to intervene in these debates, primarily, I suppose, because there are so many Deputies on this side of the House who are able to put the Opposition point of view with so much more clarity, information and effect.  In this matter, however, I feel it is my bounden duty to enter a brief but most emphatic protest against the manner in which this country has been governed, and is being governed, by the present Administration since it resumed office 18 months ago.  There is absolutely no doubt but that the last one and a half years have witnessed a remarkable <Col N="837" /> change for the worse in the economic life of our nation.</P>
      <P>During the period of the inter-Party Government, a measure of progress, of amelioration, of advance, of improvement, of peace was achieved and maintained which was never before experienced or known in our country.  A degree of national development was introduced and also maintained which far exceeded the most optimistic anticipations or the most sanguine expectations of all but the very few.  This remarkable work was effected, not with the encouragement or assistance of the Fianna Fáil Party, but in the very teeth of their bitterest and unremitting opposition.</P>
      <P>When, due to circumstances too well known to be further described, the present Government assumed office, they found a country that was prosperous, secure and happy.  Trade was thriving, unemployment had reduced or dwindled to a trickle.  Emigration had almost ceased and money was freely in circulation.  Men found a pleasurable security in their work. That, naturally, was not a state of affairs that Fianna Fáil could hope to stomach.</P>
      <P>It was a condition of things fit to stimulate their bile and, as we know to our cost, they embarked on their infamous counter-offensive.  Almost at once, clouds were made to appear on our economic horizon, artificially created, conjured up out of ersatz or phoney material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, at any rate, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance became the Rogers and Hammerstein of the Fianna Fáil Party, except that their theme song was that &ldquo;ruin was bustin' out all over&rdquo; and they invited the country to join them in a dance macabre to the verge of economic dislocation and bankruptcy.  Due to Deputy J.A. Costello's famous speeches, the Tánaiste had the intelligence and, may I say, the guts to put a stop to his own frantic gallop and he steadied down to a more respectable trot.  Not so with the Minister for Finance, who was immediately joined by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and they, like twin Cassandras, continued the horrific <Col N="838" /> jeremiads, the woeful dirges to a nation now thoroughly upset and disturbed. If these gentlemen considered themselves to be the latter-day Paul Reveres deanta in Éireann, sounding a clarion warning to the Irish nation, it was due to an <i>ad hoc</i> schizophrenia consciously and deliberately introduced. So that their moanings and ululations might appear to have some validity, the now ill-fated White Paper was introduced and it was quoted by the Minister for Finance with almost unholy glee.  He gloated in the fact that that discarded document supported and justified in some way his own gloomy prognostications, his own summing up or analysis of the economic position. It seemed to me, on the other hand, to be a particularly sordid performance. Naturally, there was the inevitable reaction.  A trade recession immediately began to develop.  Banks began to restrict credit.  Unemployment began to surge and assume the proportions of a tidal wave.  Emigration was once more resumed, as we know, on an almost vast scale.</P>
    <P>The building industry, which had been encouraged to such a remarkable degree by the inter-Party Government, creaked and grinded to a stop and all over, as we and the people in the country know, there was dislocation, there was worry and there was anxiety. All that time the Minister for Finance continued to spur his own apocalyptic horsemen with the threat of economic disaster, the threat of bankruptcy, the threat of financial chaos and dislocation. His <i>pièce de résistance</i> was, as we know, his Budget of this year, which I, with so many other people, regard as being lunatic, irresponsible and without justification.  He appeared to level his sights at the pockets of the most vulnerable sections of our community and to have fired point blank. What queer urge impelled this action I cannot say.  What reason or what motives he had for doing so I cannot even imagine. There may be these reasons.  It may be that the Fianna Fáil Party were so outraged, or may be enraged, by the decisions of the electorate to put them out of office some three years previously, that they found <Col N="839" /> it impossible to forgive them and sought this the first opportunity to wreak revenge upon them.</P>
    <P>However, I find such an explanation so reprehensible, so callous, that I disregard it right away.  There is another reason which has at least the merit of an historical justification.  Since Fianna Fáil was first given power it has had the strange, unreasonable point of view that the Irishman and Irishwoman should be made to adopt the Spartan way of life.  The hair shirt complex has ever been inherent in their political philosophy and they have neglected no opportunity whereby we, the Irish people, might be hedged in with restraint, inhibition and control of all sorts.  It is apparently their policy to say: &ldquo;What was good enough for our great grandfathers is good enough for us,&rdquo; and down the years they have, consciously or unconsciously, attempted to depress, and they have sometimes succeeded in depressing our standard of living.</P>
    <P>While they might have been trying to induce asceticism, they certainly succeeded in bringing about deprivation. Now we are being urged to eat less, to spend less and to save more. We are being told that we live beyond our means.  I imagine that statement must strike a bitter chord in the ears of the unemployed, the underemployed, the widow, the orphan, those forced to emigrate, those with fixed salaries and those whose incomes are comparatively static.</P>
    <P>If there are people living beyond their means in this country it is not the working, honourable sections who are doing so, but those of the spiv mentality who could not care less. One of the outcomes of the present Government measures has been that the price of sugar has increased for the ordinary customer so that the jam manufacturer and the large-scale confectioner may be able to sell their goods at a more acceptable price.  The price of flour and bread has been increased, but that of biscuits and fancy goods has been reduced.  &ldquo;If they have not butter, let them eat jam.  If they have not bread, let them eat cake.&rdquo;  With such a slogan, the <Col N="840" /> Minister might easily join the company of the immortals.  One can almost visualise the late Marie Antoinette emerging from some spectral salon to backslap the Minister and to say: &ldquo;That's my boy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that the infernal machine which the Fianna Fáil Party gleefully invented for the destruction of the inter-Party bloc has become a Frankenstein in their hands, incapable of being disciplined, apparently, no longer subject to control, and poised and ready to plunge this country into possible bankruptcy, what defensive measures does the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggest to us when introducing this Bill?  I heard most of his introductory speech and the rest I have read.  It seems to me his speech dealt almost exclusively with the reasons behind the bread-price increase, a matter which was dealt with, in my opinion, very brilliantly and effectively by Deputy Crotty.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to the rise in the unemployment figures. He did not at any time pass any comment on the increasing tide of emigration. No reference was made to the fact that a trade recession is unfortunately in full operation in this country. He suggested no curatives nor palliatives whereby the present unfortunate economic conditions might be remedied in some way.  No nostrums were mentioned; no panaceas were introduced. As far as the Minister was concerned, the present economic ills now besetting this country might as well not exist or have existed.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that all over the country a wave of outrage, of resentment, of bewilderment, almost of shock, has spread, and continues to spread.  Whether they be in support of the Government or not, the one question agitating everybody's mind is: what does the Government intend to do and when is the Government going to do it?  If the Government have no policy, no programme, no suggestion as to the manner in which the present critical situation may be relieved, then I think that, in all fairness, not only to the people of this country to whom they owe their paramount and primary <Col N="841" /> duty, but also to themselves, they should pack up and get out while, in their view, the going is good.  If the country is to be allowed to flounder in its present morass there will inevitably be a recrudescence of the depression and want which last found full flower during the economic war.</P>
    <P>May I join with the other Deputies on this side of the House in urging upon the Minister to bring his policy, or his lack of it, before the bar of public opinion by going to the country and seeking the views of the electorate? It might have the effect of clearing away some of the obfuscation, some of the virtuous hypocrisy, which at the present moment enshrouds the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and their immediate supporters. It would also afford the Minister for Finance, that financial Picasso, the opportunity of explaining to the people his surrealistic efforts in the fiscal field and of discovering whether they appreciate the bizarre and iconoclastic flourishes as much as he does himself.</P>
    <P>I was interested to discover how the Independent Deputies currently in support of the Government, would justify their continued allegiance and fealty. I wondered how these gentlemen, the virtuous, righteous, <i>preux chevaliers</i> of the House, would react to the manner in which this country has indubitably gone to hell in the last 18 months. I would have thought that they would have risen in their wrath and denounced the Fianna Fáil Party for all its works and pomps.  I have had the experience of hearing Deputy Cogan, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne.  Deputy Cogan was so outraged by an alleged social peccadillo on the part of Deputy Giles that he felt constrained to intervene in the debate.  Were it not for this purported <i>faux pas,</i> he would probably have kept his peace.</P>
    <P>The rising tide of emigration, the growth of unemployment, the increase in the cost of living, all those unfortunate and regrettable matters apparently would have passed unnoticed; but he chided the Opposition with having been so indelicate as to <Col N="842" /> mention these rude matters at all.  It is apparently Deputy Cogan's attitude that we should not disturb Nero's fiddling by even the slightest reference to the fact that Rome was beginning to singe a trifle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was surprised to discover that this grave and important debate was still in progress, when he arrived some time at night in the House last week.  It would seem that he, too, regarded such a debate as this as being of such little import as to merit only the most casual and perfunctory reference.  He then proceeded to launch a gratuitous attack on one of the most decent and honest Deputies in the House.  I refer, of course, to Deputy Dr. Esmonde, and he ascribed to him statements he did not make.  He appeared to be ready to forgive the Government for its many sins in recognition of its genius and valour in having introduced the Legal Adoption Bill.  I certainly do not wish to appear offensive and Deputy Cogan, who is now in the House at the moment, will, I trust, accept that assurance but I cannot help feeling that those four Independent Deputies currently supporting the Government, have come to regard the Fianna Fáil Party as their political &ldquo;Tuts&rdquo; and they are prepared to remain avidly affixed to its hind teat, irrespective of whether or not the nourishment doled out to them is curdled or sour or just plain unpleasant. I have no doubt the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly the Cabinet, have come to look with a fond affection on those legislative orphans.  I have no doubt that in their secret hearts they refer to them with particular nicknames&mdash;maybe Eeenie, Meenie, Minie and Moe.  Very few in the country would be prepared to refer to any of them as &ldquo;Tóstal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before closing, I would like to urge on the Minister to come down to the realities of the present situation. He, in my view, is an intelligent, hardworking, resourceful Minister.  I believe he has the right spirit.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why it is that he continues to allow the ship of State to drift in the aimless manner in which it has done for the last year and a half.  I, as a newcomer <Col N="843" /> to the House and essentially a back-bencher, make so bold as to urge on him that if he has a policy whereby the present unfortunate state of affairs may be brought to a close, and he is being prevented by anyone in his Cabinet&mdash;be he an egg-head, are-actionary or a radical&mdash;if he is, I say, being prevented by anybody in the Party or the Cabinet from putting his policy into effective operation, then I would suggest that he jettison such a destructive element and go ahead.</P>
    <P>We have been charged with not having suggested any way whereby the present crisis might in some way be relieved.  I think myself-and I put forward my own view with all proper humility&mdash;that one good way to do that would be to restore the confidence that was in the country when the inter-Party Government was in office.  If that feeling of confidence, of security, of happiness that there was in this country then&mdash;I say it quite honestly&mdash;if that spirit were to be reintroduced and re-established, if all this gloom, depression and the destructive elements who have been in full flight and operation were dispelled and banished, I imagine one considerable step on the way back would have been taken.  Deputy Dr. Browne, speaking to-day, complained that we on this side of the House had made no practical suggestion. That may be so; that may be Deputy Dr. Browne's point of view, but may I point out&mdash;and I listened carefully to his speech&mdash;that he certainly made no reference to the unemployment situation or to the emigration position, except to say that they must always be with us. That is a point of view that I have never heard before in this House or outside it.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of that parenthesis.  He did pay a somewhat left-handed compliment to Deputy Costello's point of view.  He did suggest that one way of getting out of the present difficulty&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;was to stamp out any industries which were uneconomic or running at a loss.  I suppose that might be rightly regarded as being a rather totalitarian or dictatorial point of view and I imagine there would be some controversy as to who was to decide whether or not an industry was economic.  However, that is a matter for the Deputy's further cogitation and I shall leave it to him.  I urge the Government to get wise to the present situation without delay and, if they cannot do anything about it, let them have the good grace, at least, to allow some other person or persons to have a go.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear to any observant Deputy sitting here for the last hour or so that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not fully realise the seriousness of the situation which the programme and policy of his Government have brought about.  When Deputy Dillon forced upon him the homely view of the situation that exists in the country I am satisfied that the Minister was really impressed and that he realised for the first time what the situation is and was.  I am perfectly satisfied that he has heard this story from the back-benchers of his own Party time after time in the last six months.  The story that Deputy Dillon told him this evening is the story that has been recounted at the Party meetings on many occasions but for some reason the Government persists in its attitude that it cannot now reverse engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one of very far-reaching effect.  The Minister, in introducing the Bill, explained that it is a yearly Bill, which gives the Government and the Minister power to legislate practically <Col N="845" /> by Order.  There is scareely any type or phase of our economic or administrative activities that it cannot control.  Under this Bill the Minister for Finance exercises exchange control.  That control is still in operation.  There are many aspects of exchange control, and one wonders exactly what control is meant and what control is effected.  There is certainly one control that he does not exercise or that he cannot operate, and that is control over the infiltration here of sterling in all sorts of ways, sterling which is never returned by any bank or business firm except when the notes come into the possession of the bank or are put into circulation through the bank.</P>
    <P>The exchange control that he does operate is to prevent our citizens from spending their own money outside the country.  I presume that is all to the good, but it constitutes a grave interference with the rights of the individual. The Minister does not control the easy money sent from the United States and other parts of the world through the gap in the North. When a British £5, £10, £20 or £100 note gets into circulation here it automatically becomes a sterling security and our Central Bank can issue its equivalent value against it. The operation of this Act at the moment, therefore, by the Minister for Finance is in the interests of sterling, and only in the interests of sterling.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce grew very indignant with Deputy Costello, the former Taoiseach, when he stated&mdash;I shall quote now from the <i>Irish Press</i> and I presume the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will not challenge the accuracy of that&mdash;that we were not told the result of the conversations between the Irish Government and the British Government last year.  Deputy Costello went on to say that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the inter-Party Government&mdash;&ldquo;secured from Sir Stafford Cripps the right to withdraw from the sterling pool as a customer would withdraw from his banker. They had not been concerned with the interests of the sterling area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> For some reason the Minister flew off the handle and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy knows that what he has been saying is a falsehood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle then intervened and said the word &ldquo;falsehood&rdquo; must be withdrawn but the Minister persisted and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that he would not say that the Deputy knew that what he was saying was a falsehood.  No Minister of the Government, or any Government, would accept the dictation of the British Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, had not at any stage made any such assertion and it is somewhat peculiar that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has a really thick skin, should become so sensitive and jump almost as if the cap fitted.  Deputy Costello merely asserted that we got the right to withdraw from the sterling pool.</P>
    <P>The way in which history repeats itself is rather significant.  I now assert that the present Fianna Fáil Government is trying to justify their conduct in 1947 by doing the same thing in 1952. In 1947 Fianna Fáil introduced a Supplementary Budget.  That was followed by the trade agreement and speaking on that agreement the then Taoiseach is reported at columns 1822 to 1823 of Volume 108 of the Official Report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We realised that it was a matter of concern to us that confidence should be preserved in sterling and that it was desirable that the remaining dollar resources should be utilised to the best possible advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, continuing at column 1829, the Taoiseach announced:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was agreed that the Irish Government, with a view to conserving the dollar resources of the sterling area, would effect substantial reductions in their drawings of dollars from the dollar pool for the period 1st October, 1947, to 30th June, 1948 . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then asserted that they <Col N="847" /> were interested in sterling and in the sterling area.  As will be seen from the Official Report, they agreed in that financial agreement to restrict the purchasing power of our people.  The reason they brought in the Budget of 1947 was to restrict and lower the then purchasing power of the people.  They attempted to justify that Supplementary Budget by saying that it was essential to have that Budget to reduce the cost of living, to maintain subsidies, and so forth.  But, as a matter of fact, it was for the purpose of restraining the purchasing power of the people because there were people in the Central Bank and there were bankers at that particular time who were asserting that an inflationary period had arisen and that the people must be compelled to restrict their purchases and to effect savings.  When they were not effecting the savings voluntarily the Government decided to compel them to do so.  We challenged that.  We said that if we were given office we would remove these penal taxes which were imposed in 1947&mdash;and we did.  When the inter-Party Government went into office they removed these taxes forthwith.  Fianna Fáil has never forgiven us for that.  Fianna Fáil, in an effort to justify what they did at that time, proceeded to do identically the same thing again in 1952.  Speaking down the country recently, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs declared that the prosperity during the inter-Party term of office was a fake prosperity.  Is it not a good thing that he admits that there was prosperity of any description?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs declared that we had a faked prosperity.  It is something, at any rate, that he admits that we had prosperity, faked or otherwise. What I want to know is what was faked about it.  I assert that there was no fake about it, but that, on the contrary, for the first time, we had an opportunity to do what should have been done 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> To-day we have been examining cause and effect.  While I have no intention whatever of traversing the hardships of the past, I want to say that what Collins asserted is as true to-day as it was when he first said it-that the ejection of the British forces from this country was not our greatest hardship and our greatest difficulty. He said that there was a British cult in the country that had grown into our people and that that cult would have to be ejected, and that it was more difficult to eject that cult than to eject the armed forces.  That cult includes our financial system.  Owing to circumstances over which I think neither of the Governments had any control, they were unable to change it.  Surely the time has come when an effort should be made in this connection.  When the inter-Party Government proceeded on the line of capital development, the building up of our resources, trying to get the banks to have confidence in our Irish stocks and shares and property, they were doing, for the first time, what should have been done many years ago.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Briscoe to-day talk about liquidity.  He said that one of the chief reasons why the commercial banks invest money abroad is that they can get it back at short notice. He asked: &ldquo;What is wrong with a man who has £100 or £500 putting that money into the bank one day and drawing it out the next day?&rdquo; I said there was nothing wrong with it.  Deputy Briscoe was flogging a dead horse in that connection.  When a man put £500 in the bank in 1912 and went back to take it out he was going to take out 500 gold sovereigns for the £500 which he had lodged in the bank.  If he put in that £500 in 1912 and left it there ever since, would he get the 500 sovereigns now?</P>
    <P>Not likely.  He would get 500 £ notes, the purchasing power of which, as compared with the 1914 level, is approximately 5/9 per £1 note&mdash;if it is as much as that.  A run on the bank at the time when it had to produce the sterling&mdash;and sterling then meant gold&mdash;was a serious matter and the bank that would not have the gold <Col N="849" /> would have to put up the shutters. That is not the position now.  As I said to Deputy Briscoe, John Bradbury finished that in 1914 when he made the postal order legal tender. The Central Bank is to-day charged with the responsibility of seeing that no situation like that can arise.  Even if it did arise and if the people went into the banks to withdraw all their money what would they get?  They would get paper.  When they would get the paper what could they do with it except to go back the next day and say: &ldquo;The paper is all right.  I think I will leave it with you.&rdquo;  Therefore, there is no reason in the world why, as Deputy J.A. Costello said, a stock exchange and a money market should not be established here.  Even in the short time that we were in office, what would have happened if the banks had refused to lend to the Dublin Corporation the £5,000,000 which was required? I will leave it at that.  However, it was a situation in which the then Government of this country was determined on the development of our country for housing, agriculture, and so forth, and that the money must be made available for those purposes. This country has been harshly treated, unwittingly, perhaps, by Fianna Fáil. At a time when development could take place they started to play down everything.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here by the Deputy who spoke a moment ago to the hair-shirt policy.  Fianna Fáil had this advantage.  When they first talked of the hair-shirt policy they applied it to themselves also.  They reduced the Ministers' salaries to £1,000 a year. They said that it would be a hair-shirt policy for all.  They found that it did not work.  The hair-shirt policy is no longer for the Ministers but unfortunately it is still in operation against the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    <P>That situation should not obtain. Under this Bill the Minister for Finance has power to deal with exchange control, the money and the whole finances of the country.  The Minister for Social Welfare has power under this Bill to do all sorts of things which are in the interests of the country and yet, for some reason, these <Col N="850" /> things are not carried out but are put on the long finger.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, the Minister for Agriculture has the power under this Bill to make regulations relating to dairying. He can regulate the prices of cereals and feeding stuffs and, as was pointed out a moment ago, the price of turkeys.</P>
    <P>Now 1/6, 1/- or 4d. per lb. on the price of a turkey may be of no great import to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but it is a very important factor in the life of the Irish housewife, the wife of an Irish farmer because to her the turkey has ever been one of the great sources of income for the Christmas festival.  Any reduction in the value of that market is a very serious matter for her.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has soared but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not adverted to that in his opening remarks.  I think it is right that he should not advert to it.  If he thinks of the decision that he got in North-West Dublin, I think he was wise not to advert to it.  Deputy Cowan said something to the effect that it was the candidate that won North-West Dublin. He went a little bit further and said that the Irish people were very charitable and that they liked to vote for the relatives of deceased Deputies. That may be as good a defence as anything else but Deputies will remember that when a Deputy, a very decent man&mdash;I do not deny it&mdash;died in Donegal and when his son was elected in his place, Fianna Fáil had no hesitation or doubt as to what that decision meant so far as they were concerned.  They were very loud in their boasts.</P>

      <P>We were beaten but you cannot have it both ways. When you lose it means just the same thing.  There was, of course, no comparison between the two elections because in North-West Dublin there was a two to one decision against the Government.  A two to one beating is a very serious thing.  I therefore agree with the point of view which has been put forward here that the Government to-day have not a mandate from the people to continue with their policy. <Col N="851" /> They have gone to the country before for much less reason, within a much shorter period and when there was no evidence to sustain the point of view that they no longer represented the majority of the people.</P>
      <P>It was under this Act that the Minister for Industry and Commerce increased the price of bread and flour without any consultation with the Prices Advisory Body.  He did it automatically under this Act.  When you consider the profits made by some of the large bakeries in the city here, I cannot for the life of me see how the Minister could be justified in taking such a step.  I, therefore, agree with the assertion that the Government are so misusing the powers given them under this Act and that they have so abused these powers, that they should not get a renewal of this Act.</P>
      <P>I believe that under this Act a direction was also given to our commercial banks to restrict credit to the people of the country.  If such a direction was not actually issued, the threat was held over the heads of the bankers that if they did not restrict credit voluntarily they would be made to restrict it positively under this Act. That restriction of credit has had its effects as every Deputy on the Fianna Fáil back benches knows, on every activity in the agricultural, industrial and commercial life of the country. I am not going into details but I mentioned a case here before where a bank closed down on solvent people and refused them credit for the legitimate business of buying and selling seed potatoes and for the purchase of farms. That is bad enough but worse still is the restriction of credit for the building of houses in the country.  I heard Deputy Briscoe say to-day that in five years' time the housing problem of the City of Dublin will be solved.  More power to their elbow if that is so, but in 25 years' time the problem of housing the people of the country will not be solved because to-day more than two-thirds of the total number of houses in rural Ireland are as obsolete and as backward as they were 100 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> There is a problem there to be tackled and if any Government thinks that the people of the country will continue to reside in houses that are obsolete and out-of-date, while their brothers and sisters live in the fine houses built by the corporation and by private enterprise in Dublin, they are making a great mistake.  The influx of people will still continue to the city, if this matter is not attended to, and the result will be that you will have large barren tracts in the country because of the lack of proper housing. Money, therefore, must be made available at a cheap rate to replace practically two-thirds of the houses of the Irish farmer and his worker.  Why should the Irish farmer and his worker not have the same amenities of life as their brothers and sisters in the city? If you go to any part of Ireland and take a survey of the modern conveniences in farm houses, you will find that they are practically infinitesimal. There is a huge problem there and it can only be solved by cheap money, and by building at the fastest possible rate.  It breaks my heart when I know that good Canadian timber brought in here, which could have been used in the building of good houses, has been sold. We get two stories about that.  One is that it has not been sold at higher than present-day prices, and in the next breath we are told that a good profit was made on it.  That does not make sense.  Every country Deputy knows that good seasoned timber is of the first importance in the building of a house.  It has been sold, and raw unseasoned timber is brought in, bad soft timber not much better than white poplar.  That is the kind of stuff that is considered good enough for our houses for the future.</P>

      <P>I agree, when compared with the exports of timber from Norway and Sweden, but what we brought in was not a small quantity. We went all out to get good timber.  I am asking, why sell the good stuff and bring in tripe?  Is it because that is considered good enough for the people <Col N="853" />&mdash;that they are eating too much and living too well, and that you want to lower their standard of living?  Is that what we have coming from an Irish Government?  If the British Government attempted to do that there would be skin and hair flying.  If we, when we were in the inter-Party Government, attempted to do what the present Government are doing, we would not get ten Deputies to stand behind us. Certainly, Deputy Cogan would not. If the rate of interest on loans to farmers were to be raised to 6 per cent. by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, does any Deputy think that Deputy Cogan would stand behind Deputy Dillon for a moment if, as Minister for Agriculture, he was responsible for that?  I know well he would not.  Why does he do it behind Fianna Fáil?  The dear only knows. He knows that, after the next election, unless he changes his mind in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>He defends them, anyway.  I do not care whatever else he does, he defends the interests of the farmers in this House.  Any Deputy who does that is to me a fine fellow.  Therefore I would like to see him remaining in the House if I could get him on the right foot so that he would continue to advocate the interests of the farmers.  But when he votes for a 6 per cent. interest charge on the farmers by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, then I say he is not the Deputy Cogan that I knew. He knows quite well that an Irish farmer, when he has to pay 6 per cent. on his capital, is not working for himself but rather for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The profit that the farmer has for himself is nil.  If the best industry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could put up was able to earn a gross 6 per cent. in its first year it would be considered to be doing well, but if it had to pay 6 per cent. out of its profits before it was able to put anything aside for itself and its shareholders it would be working for the bank and not for the shareholders.  That is what the Irish farmer is expected to do. He is now told that the reason why that happens is because of the faked prosperity which was brought into the country by the inter-Party Government. He is told, too, that the people must now suffer for that before Fianna Fáil will right the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, lack of capital is holding up all the activities of the nation.  The Minister for Finance is now beginning to realise that the step he took when he introduced his Budget this year is going to have dire effects on the country.  He is now worried about the situation.  I do not know what excuse he is going to make to the Government of which he is a member when the situation is fully clarified and he sees the results of his policy.  When that day comes his colleagues may say to him: &ldquo;Well, it was a pity we did not let you resign when you were going to before you brought in this Budget; if we had let you <Col N="855" /> resign we would not have this difficulty now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to go back over the question of dear money for housing. The Government have changed their step on that, and have agreed to reduce the rate of interest charged to those who had signed agreements and started building before the 5th or 6th of October.  I submit that any person who had a contract signed could have enforced it in law.  They could bring mandamus proceedings against a local authority to compel it to give them the money at the old rate as set out in the contract.  In giving the money now at the old rate, the Government cannot claim that they are giving any gift to those people.  Instead they ran away from lawsuits which they were likely to have to face in connection with that matter.  They now gild the pill by saying that they are sympathetic to those who had contracts signed.</P>
    <P>The whole thing shows that the Government did reverse their position. They did that because of the force of public opinion, as expressed by Deputies of all Parties.  But the thing above all which led the Government to reverse their decision was the pending election in North-West Dublin.  It was the result of that election, more than anything else which secured the cheap money for the people who had signed contracts.  Therefore, instead of thanking the Government for reversing their decision, it is the electors in North-West Dublin who are to be thanked. It was they who secured a restoration of their rights from the Government for those people who had signed contracts.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Government should not, in my opinion, get a continuation of this measure.  I think they have abused it in some respects and failed to use it properly in others.  Their activities since they came into office have created such a slump and such a depression in trade and inflicted such hardship upon our people that even Deputy Cogan, Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and the Deputies whom Deputy Cowan called the charitable Deputies should not vote <Col N="856" /> for this measure in order to put it through the House.</P>
    <P>The back-benchers of Fianna Fáil know as well as I do that the taxation in the Budget was unjust and unreasonable and should not have been imposed. The inter-Party Government proved conclusively that that taxation was not necessary.  Notwithstanding all the protestations by Fianna Fáil in 1947 that the taxation then imposed was necessary, we proved conclusively that it was not and the inter-Party Government relieved the people of approximately £5,000,000 of taxation in their first year in office and £5,000,000 a year in each succeeding year.  Any Government which, to prove that they were right in the beginning, are guilty of the same offence again are not worthy of support.  Any measure which gives them the power to do most of the things they are doing and impose such a hardship on the people should not be given to them.  I appeal to Deputies to reject this measure and let the people of the country decide between us, just as the people of North-West Dublin decided at the by-election. We know what the result will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, any citizen who wishes to assess the qualities of a Government can do so by examining their activities from three points of view.  First of all, he will consider the purchasing power of the pound note. If the activities of the Government are directed towards increasing the purchasing power of that pound note, he can safely assume that they are going in the right direction.  Secondly, he will consider the employment situation. If unemployment is on the decrease he can then assume that the policy which is being pursued by the Government is the correct one.  He can also look at it from the point of view of emigration. If the emigration figure shows a decline, combined with the other two factors I have mentioned, it is logical for him to conclude that it is a good Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examined from these three angles can anybody in this House, irrespective of where he may sit, claim that this <Col N="857" /> Government have achieved any one of these, much less the three of them? The situation is so serious to-day that it should not be viewed from a political angle.  The economic situation which has developed in this country over the past 12 months calls for immediate action regardless of political affiliations.  Much valuable time has been wasted in this House by Deputies on both sides who have hurled at one another: &ldquo;What did you do and what did we do?&rdquo;  It is not what is done by either side that counts now but what will be done to remedy the situation which is appalling every honest-minded citizen.  The purchasing power of the pound is dwindling to such an extent that the ordinary wage earner, the ordinary fixed salary man, is at his wits' end to provide the bare necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>How did it come about that a former Government, which did many things with which I disagreed, could bring about a period of prosperity, when unemployment was at its lowest, when emigration was decreasing, and when prices, although tending to rise, were kept at a reasonable level&mdash;were kept at such a level that the pay packet was able to provide for what a family needed?  Then, under a new Government with a completely different policy, the people have been brought to the condition in which they are to-day.  Is it not time that the Tánaiste should examine the situation and admit honestly to the House and to the people: &ldquo;Our policy has been a mistake but now we are prepared to change it.&rdquo;  Anybody can make a mistake but I think the most honest and the most manly thing he can do is to admit his mistake.  He has been entitled to try any remedies which he tried in the past but let him be man enough to say that his remedies and his policy have been a failure and that even at this late hour he is prepared to alter his course.  It may happen, owing to Government policy, that one section of the community may be prospering while another section is being depressed.  But under the existing policy the people, whether they belong to an urban or a rural population, or no matter how they may live, are all feeling the pinch to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> North-West Dublin has been referred to.  I do not want to rub salt into the wounds caused by the North-West Dublin by-election, but I am sure that in every constituency in the Twenty-Six Counties an answer similar to that given by the electors of North-West Dublin would be given if the opportunity were afforded to the people. I recognise quite well that there are difficulties confronting the Government. There are difficulties that will confront whatever Government takes their place.  I have not the slightest doubt that the day the Minister for Finance decided that the policy set out in the Central Bank Report was a proper policy for the Government to pursue was the day on which the mistake was made.  I said in connection with that report that, in my opinion, it was the duty of the directors of the Central Bank to present the situation which they saw.  It was their duty to suggest a certain course of action; but there it finished.  They should not dictate, nor should anybody be in a position to dictate, a policy for a Government, which has the support of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>It is evident, however, that the Minister for Finance decided that question and I have no doubt whatever in my mind that the Tánaiste, many of his colleagues in the Cabinet and the vast number of those who sit behind them know the error that was made. It is no joy to me, or indeed to anybody here, I am sure, to have to make complaints like this.  None of us would glory in the failure of any Government in this country.  We would like to see them all doing well because when a Government is pursuing a right policy the people of the country are becoming prosperous and everybody is better off. Unemployment is rising.  Emigration is rising.  The purchasing power of money is going down.  That, I think is an indictment of any Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the big failures of this Government, besides the adoption of the Central Bank Report, is that the present Government, neither from 1932 to 1948, nor since it came back into office, ever could be made realise that we are an agricultural country, that that is our only industry. <Col N="859" /> It is our basic industry and if you want to make this country prosperous you must begin by making agriculture prosperous, and on a properous agriculture base your whole economic development.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturing industries should be based on a prosperous agriculture. They should absorb our agricultural output and in that way you could hope for prosperous factories in this country. Those industries which are not based on the raw material produced here cannot succeed and promise no future.  At some time or other the raw material from outside will not be available and then you may put up the shutters on your factories.  Those which you can maintain from the raw material produced in this country must and will develop; others will fail.</P>
    <P>Great hopes were entertained here on the introduction of the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  Deputies from the West of Ireland were particularly interested in that piece of legislation.  Some of them had great hopes of its possible achievement.  I do not think there is any praise in any part of the West of Ireland of any new development under that measure.  I would like to know how many draws were made on the fund put at the disposal of Foras Tionscal.  At any rate, I have seen nothing in the way of industrial development in the undeveloped areas in the West.  I will not blame the Minister for that nor will I blame the Government.  I recognise that what the Minister has said so often is true; private, individual initiative must provide the answer.  Nevertheless, I think it must be a sorry disappointment to the Minister as much as to the people of the West of Ireland when they are told that the new assistance to be given to the western areas is for better highways to bring foreign visitors to view the country and better highways for the native to travel on leaving the country.</P>
    <P>It must be a bitter disappointment to people who 30 years ago thought a great deal of what it would mean to see an independent Ireland governed <Col N="860" /> by our own people.  But they are still emigrating because they cannot find employment at home.  Over vast areas of the country there is a shortage of workers because the form of employment available is not remunerative enough to keep themselves and their family.  There must be something wrong with the agricultural policy&mdash; and I believe it is wrong and has been wrong for a long time&mdash;being pursued by native Government.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to refer to one particular aspect that is worrying the people in turf-producing areas. Many people were advised by the Government to embark on the private production of turf.  They were guaranteed a market for it.  Practically adjacent to those people in the same areas Bord na Móna produced quite a lot of turf, but neither private producers nor Bord na Móna can dispose of their stocks to-day.  As a matter of fact, I think it is correct to say that Bord na Móna has no definite plans for 1953 in many of those areas.  It would appear now that they are not going into production in 1953 in many of those areas.  The present stocks are left on their hands and British coal is coming in freely.  High as the emigration figures have been I have no doubt they will be very substantially increased with the discontinuance of turf production as seems likely at the present time.</P>
    <P>In all sincerity, I would ask the Minister to sift the speeches whether made on his own side or on the Opposition, to admit the truth of the charge that the policy being pursued is not the correct one and to outline what he considers&mdash;and I think everybody has conceded that he is a man who has given serious and intelligent thought to the whole problem&mdash;to be the proper economic policy of this country, to break away from the crippling hand of finance and bring some cheer to the people of this country for Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting that I would hear from the back-benchers of Fianna Fáil or from the Independent Deputies some excuse for the serious position the country is in to-day.  Our <Col N="861" /> minds go back to 1947 when the then Government threatened the trade unions with a standstill Order if they sought further increases in their wages to meet the then cost of living.  In 1948 the new Government came in, the standstill Orders were removed, and wages were allowed to increase to meet the then cost of living.  But the Government to-day is going back; they are not issuing standstill Orders but they have removed the food subsidies and placed the workers in a worse position than they were in 1947.</P>
      <P>We were assured here by the various Ministers that there would be no demand for increased wages but look at the serious position with which the country is faced to-day, especially in Dublin City where all trade unions are demanding increases.  They are accepting something less than they demand in many cases but even their full demands will not give them sufficient money to purchase the same goods for their families that they could purchase two years ago.</P>
      <P>We know it is due to the Central Bank.  We have had experience&mdash;in fact it is published now&mdash;that the Central Bank's whole platform was to create unemployment.  It is in their report that it is better to pay unemployment assistance because then the unemployed will have less money to purchase goods that might require to be imported and the men who are lucky enough to be in employment will remain quiet and will not seek what is considered a just wage.  Was not that the Central Bank's report?</P>
      <P>At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis the plain man of the country realised the seriousness of that report and the Tánaiste got up and said he did not agree with it but the excuse was given that it was necessary to conserve our money that was invested in a foreign country because we might require it at very short call.  I will give you some little history.  I was placed in a very important position in the years 1920-21 when I had to carry out the whole administration of a county, to maintain the claims of hospitals and keep the services there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Had I money?  Had I thousands of pounds at call?  No, I had not, but we carried on the administration knowing very well that the shopkeepers or the people who had accounts with us would not demand all in one call in the one day or week. The assistance of public bodies and of public men did as much as the I.R.A. to defeat the powers in authority at that time.  We returned on paper much more money than we received. I returned several thousands of pounds although there were many weeks when I had not £100 in my possession to pay the officials and to carry on the various services that were my responsibility.  Therefore there is no need for any man to say that any emergency would require on short call the entire amount that we have invested abroad.  Foreign countries themselves are using our money for the very work that we require to do here with it.</P>
    <P>The public bodies are anxious to know before they proceed with further big building schemes what interest they will be charged for new loans from the Local Loans Fund.  We have been told the new rate of interest under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts but we have not been informed about the rates of charges on loans for new housing schemes.  I am sure members of the Fianna Fáil Party, like myself, are on public boards; they must know of the demands being made on those local bodies because in my 30 years' experience of public boards I have never known so much hardship, so much misery, so many unemployed, so many appeals to public bodies for relief work at Christmas.  But even with the high rates and the prospect of further increases in them public bodies are still not in a position to meet a quarter of the demands made on them at the present time.  Years ago they could have raised £5,000 or £10,000 on the following year's estimate in order to provide work at this time of the year.  But they are in no such position to-day because the prices of commodities have increased and unemployment has risen and the people are taxed out of existence through local taxation, and no matter whom the <Col N="863" /> members of local bodies represent they are not there to throw further burdens on to the people.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago that the position in the building trade was that we had men coming back here from England to work in this country. To-day, you have over 580 skilled craftsmen unemployed.  They will go over and find employment in the erection of houses on the other side, employment provided by the money invested by Irish people at 1½ per cent. We are told we are building hospitals. That is a very admirable thing but will our hospitals be large enough to meet the requirements of our people in a few years if we continue in the same manner as we have over the last year and a half?</P>
    <P>To-day, less bread is being consumed. Less milk and less butter are being used by the poorer classes, for there is not sufficient money to purchase the necessities of life.  What is going to be the position of the children of the rising generation who are being deprived of essential food at the present time?  The hospitals erected now will not be large enough to accommodate the number of patients we will have.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Cogan believes he represents the people, will he come to a public meeting at any place he wishes to select and justify his action?  The Government believe they have the confidence of the people.  Is there not an easy way to test it?  I speak for my own constituency and I challenge the two Deputies to test the feelings of the people in County Wicklow for they no longer represent their views. I have issued that challenge before and the number the Deputies had then will be much less the next time.  Why is there such a change?  Because all sections of the community have suffered as a result of the Government's action. The Government knows it too.  They have lost heart and they know they have lost the confidence of the people. They have only one honourable duty to perform and that is to let the people elect a Government&mdash;let it be good or bad, if it is elected by the <Col N="864" /> majority nobody will have any complaint.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, never has there been such unemployment as at the present time.  Years ago in this House special grants would be allocated at this time for the relief of the men unemployed throughout the country but there will be no such grants to-day.  Public bodies' funds are exhausted.  They have received all the grants the Government are prepared to give but the money is not enough.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to provide employment only for a small number of men.  What will become of the others? Will they be left without any aid and must they depend solely on unemployment assistance from this until Christmas? We appeal to the Government to change its policy.  If up to now the Government has obeyed the authority of the Central Bank, now is the time to make a change.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that some of the trade unionists are so very silent to-day as compared with some years ago.  We have been told that Córas Iompair Éireann will have to dismiss thousands of its men on the grounds of economy. We are told that the Irish people must pay more in taxes in order to provide foreigners with a transatlantic air service.  Simultaneously with that we propose to reduce our bus traffic, increase our fares and dismiss thousands of our transport workers on the grounds of economy.  Now is the time for the trade unionist leaders in Dublin to speak out.</P>
    <P>It is not right that the people should be treated as serfs and slaves.  Trade union leaders should realise that they have shot their bolt.  They have failed to represent the rank and file, the plain people of Ireland.  Take care that the rank and file does not take matters out of the hands of their leaders and do what they should have done three months ago.</P>
    <P>The people are dissatisfied with the present set-up.  Why?  Because the Government has attempted to serve only one section of the community and has forgotten the other 75 per cent. The Government wants to take revenge on the plain people for their action in <Col N="865" /> 1947.  They are crucifying the people. They will not even let them have enough money to purchase the essential food they need and they are permitting food to soar in price.  Food is to-day almost beyond the reach even of those who are in employment.</P>
    <P>I warn the Government and I appeal to Deputy Cogan to take an honourable course and resign if he believes he represents the people, or else put the Government in such a position that they will be forced to hold a general election thereby giving the people an opportunity of putting in a Government that will restore hope and confidence in place of the despair that exists at the present time.  We know the serious position that exists in our factories.  We know the numbers who are in temporary employment living from week to week.  Those who are keeping the Government in power know full well that the ship is sinking but they are afraid to disembark and save their own lives before the ship goes down.  The people in County Wicklow know that some of the members of that crew will sink because they will never again be given an opportunity of misrepresenting here the people who gave them their confidence in the last election.</P>

      <P>The four main problems under discussion on this Bill are unemployment, emigration, the trade recession and the cost of living.  It is rather remarkable that the Minister in opening the debate on this Bill never <Col N="866" /> once adverted to any one of these four items.  Two years ago when the inter-Party Government was in power the Opposition was led by Deputy Lemass for a period of three weeks and during that three weeks the inter-Party Government got a very thorough lacing from practically every Deputy sitting on the Opposition Benches.  I am quite certain that the Minister when he was leading the Opposition would have been far more vehement in his criticism of the Government of the day had the position been only half as bad as it is now.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister when he is replying will deal with the cost of living first of all, the trade recession and the serious unemployment position that has been created over the past 18 months.  The cost of living is at present at a higher level than it has ever been in the history of this State.  There is not a single commodity ordinarily used by the working classes and by the poorer sections of the community which has not increased in price.  Since we were discussing this Bill 12 months ago bread, flour, butter, tea and sugar have increased to a level they never reached before.  The only people who can afford to purchase these commodities to-day are the well-to-do.</P>
      <P>I was reading through the debate that took place here in 1949 and my attention was taken by a speech made by Deputy Lynch, now Parliamentary Secretary, at that time.  It is indeed typical of the speeches made by the Fianna Fáil Party when in opposition. At column 1750 of Volume 118 of the Official Report Deputy Lynch said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One does not need to have much knowledge of the ordinary working classes in this country to realise that bread, tea and sugar are used in greater quantities by the poorer classes than by the better off classes. Bread is used particularly by people who are in poor circumstances and who are rearing families.  I have received from all over my own constituency and outside it, complaints from people who are forced to buy bread, tea and sugar at these increased prices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1949.  I wonder what his <Col N="867" /> constituents have to say at the present time, and the constituents of the other Fianna Fáil Deputies, now that the cost of living has increased by 25 per cent. over that period.  Unemployment has increased during the last 18 months by approximately 11,000.  Apart from increased unemployment, there are numbers of people who are still lucky enough to be working short time.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has grown considerably during the régime of the present Government.  It has grown considerably since the Fianna Fáil Party took office.  It is with regret that I express the opinion that unemployment will grow still further during the next three, four or five months.  The building trade and the building industry is the principal industry in the City of Dublin and in the urban areas throughout the country.  In that trade alone, serious unemployment has occurred during the past six months.  Any Deputy who thinks it worth his while to make inquiries about the unemployment created in the building industry can contact any of the secretaries of the building trade unions in Dublin City and what I have said will be confirmed. There is serious and very serious unemployment in the building trade in the city and throughout the urban areas.  The recent loan certainly put the last nail in the coffin of the private building industry.  It has helped to add to the unemployment list.  The loan at 5 per cent. which is made available to local authorities throughout the country means that the local authorities have to pay far greater interest for this loan and they, in their turn, have to hand on that extra rate of interest to borrowers under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Young married people and families desirous of securing their own homes have to find from 10/- to 15/-a week extra to repay the money which they borrow.  Next March we will be faced with a very serious problem when every local authority throughout the country will have to consider the striking of the rate for the year ahead. Every conscientious member of a county council or local authority throughout the country realises that the rents paid at the moment for <Col N="868" /> labourers' and working-class cottages have reached their limit.  If the county council have to pay a higher rate of interest for the money which they borrow to enable them to build these cottages they must charge a higher rent for the cottages and if they do not do that they must increase the subsidy off the rates.</P>
    <P>I suggest that next March, when the local authorities are striking a new rate, they will have to strike a far heavier rate to provide for the housing needs of their counties.  I suggest that Deputy Cogan, when he is voting on this Bill, should seriously consider this matter, as he represents himself here to be a member of a ratepayers' association. I wonder if he will be able to reconcile his attitude when he is voting on this Bill with the requirements of the association to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>During this debate Deputy Briscoe accused the members on the Opposition side of the House of misleading the people in relation to the cost of living.  I would ask all the Deputies on the Government side of the House to remember the promises they made when they were seeking election in June, 1951.  They criticised the inter-Party Government and all the groups that made up that Government on the cost of living during the three and a half years when the inter-Party Government held office.  I wonder what they have to say to-day when they realise the heights to which the cost of living has soared.</P>
    <P>One night last week Deputy Cowan came in here and made a very quiet and lame speech.  Yet, two years ago, speaking on the same Bill, he strongly criticised the then Government in the most emphatic fashion on the cost of living which then obtained.  Can Deputy Cowan answer his constituents to-day when his vote and the votes of the other three Independent Deputies will be responsible for maintaining the present position in this country?</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to reject this Bill and to let the country decide whether or not they approve of the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of those other Deputies on this side of the House and on the Labour benches who have referred to the trade recession and to the present cost of living.  The trade recession has come about very largely as a result of the financial policy of this Government.  Under the inter-Party Government, trade was booming and employment reached a height which it had never reached before in this country.  Unfortunately, when the present Government came into office a financial policy was inaugurated which could have only one effect: it would throw large numbers of our fellow-citizens out of work and it would be bound to have its effect on the cost of living and on trade generally.  I was talking to a draper to-day who called my attention to the fact that a drapery house in Dublin is advertising a sale at the present moment.  That is practically unknown at this time of the year.  It is very unusual, coming up to Christmas, for a drapery house to have to resort to a sale in order to sell its goods.</P>
      <P>I can endorse entirely what Deputy Belton has said with regard to the building trade.  The recession in that trade is extremely serious and has been brought about by the stringent financial conditions in which all businesses find themselves at the present moment and, above all, as a result of the increased price which money can command and the effect that that has had on the building trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the question of the rate at which the Government can borrow.  Certainly I think the Government should have been able to borrow at a lower rate than 5 per cent., but even with a rate of 5 per cent. the Government should have made special arrangements for those engaged in private building, for those borrowing through societies and for the building trade generally. Other countries have recognised that the housing of their citizens is something which is highly desirable in the national interest.  In fact, we here in Ireland have recognised that too but we have not gone to the length of <Col N="870" /> providing cheap money at a cost to the Exchequer.  It is looked upon as being something which is inevitably tied up with the cost of borrowing money&mdash;that is to say, the rate at which the Government can lend it to private individuals and to local authorities for building.  I maintain, and have already maintained in articles, that there is not necessarily any connection between the rate at which the Government can borrow and the rate at which it can lend to any individual or group of individuals. It would be very much to the benefit of this country and of employment in general if cheap money were made available to the building trade.  In fact, the very slight difference that the Government would have to pay would be amply repaid by the increased volume of business which would result from the building trade being in a boom condition.  I can tell the House from my personal knowledge that the building trade is in a very stagnant position at the present moment&mdash;in a more stagnant position than the conditions in the month of December would warrant.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to the economic survey which was made by a group of Americans.  Their report was received by the Government here in August, 1952 and it has not yet been made available to Deputies.  I understand from what I have read that there were something like 50 copies available. Surely it would have been possible to order more copies and to have them readily available, in fact, to circulate them to Deputies.  I think it is a very wrong system that when a report like that is made it should be issued to the newspapers and to members of the Diplomatic Corps here in Dublin and not to the members of the Dáil and Seanad.  I think if necessary the report could have been held up for a few weeks until additional copies were available.  I think it is very wrong that the only copy that any Deputy can see is that in the Library of this House.</P>
    <P>There are many things I should like to mention in connection with that report because it has a bearing on the present situation here.  I think it shows the trend in certain ways.  It shows <Col N="871" /> that the policy of the Government in relation to industry has not been as sure as we would like, and that the uncertainty, which resulted from the lack of a direct policy on the part of the Government has had its bad effect on industry and, in turn, has had its effect on employment in the country. I think it would be a good thing if, at the earliest opportunity, this report were circulated to the House and if, at some later date, the House had an opportunity to debate it, not indeed as a political matter but as something which is of vital importance to the people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that this Government, very greatly to the regret of the country in general, has proved itself by its financial policy to be unduly harsh on the community.  In its industrial policy and in its handling of the economic situation it has proved itself to be entirely unfitted to deal with the difficulties of the present day. I think the only thing left to the Government is to resign, to hand over the reins of Government to those who are more fitted to deal with the difficulties of the situation to-day and the difficulties which we can see looming ahead so long as this policy is followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of Deputy Dockrell's speech expressed a theme which ran through all the speeches delivered from the benches opposite during the whole of the debate, the theme that all our national problems&mdash;economic, social and financial&mdash;rising prices, higher taxation, emigration and unemployment&mdash;have developed only since the Coalition Government left office and will all disappear again if only the Coalition Government gets back.  Put that way it sounds nonsense.  Put any way it is nonsense and I hope in the time available to me to demonstrate that that description of it is precisely accurate. Many Deputies talked about the damage which was alleged to have been done by the gloomy speeches delivered by members of the Government. If gloomy speeches can do damage, we heard enough in the last week to wreck an empire.  I do not <Col N="872" /> think that the speeches delivered by Ministers merit that adjective.  They were designed to draw public attention to serious national problems, to define these problems and to define also, in as precise terms as possible, the action that was needed to reduce and to remove these problems.</P>
      <P>There are in every community people who, when brought face to face with the reality of difficulties and told that they must do something about them and exert themselves to remove them, go off to whinge in corners, to deplore their fate and to plead for sympathy. There are others who, in the same circumstances, respond in the right way by taking off their coats and getting down to work.  The Opposition seem to me in the course of this debate to have made up their minds that the majority of the Irish people are whingers when real national problems have to be dealt with, that they are lily-fingered softies who cannot be expected to face realities and who must be &ldquo;jollied&rdquo; along by fancy promises.  We believe that the majority of the Irish people are now, as they always were, a fighting people and that when they are asked to respond to the national need they will give the right response.  If we are wrong in that you will win the next election; if we are right you have not a chance.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that we have got here serious economic and social problems.  Deputies have defined them, in a manner which I do not dispute, as high prices, high taxation and persistent unemployment and emigration. We have had, during the course of the debate, grotesque exaggeration of the dimensions of these problems.  I do not think exaggeration does any good.  I am certainly not going to minimise them.  I hope that I will be able to get the Dáil to see these problems as they really are, and to realise that they are within our strength to deal with.  It does not help us in getting the right national response, in the face of these problems, to represent this country as being in the last stages of decay.</P>

      <P>The problems of this country are no greater than, and not much different from those of other countries.  I think it is possible to demonstrate that we here are making more successful efforts to cope with them than many other European nations.  That effort will succeed, in the course of time, if the Deputies opposite will stop peddling discontent. We have got to get our people to realise that there is a job to be done and to get them to understand that they have the strength to do it.  We have got to urge them to do it instead of hawking grievances around the place so that they will be discouraged from even making an attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to deal in a precise statistical way with these problems of ours, there are a few general remarks that I want to make.  When this Government took office, it knew well that the measures it would have to adopt to remedy the deplorable state of the national finances, to restore the national economy and to get productive activity going in the right direction, would not be pleasant.  We were fully aware that, in adopting these measures, we would be prejudicing our political future.  We knew that whatever steps we took could not produce the results we expected from them, the beneficial results for the people of this country, for some time, and that the people would not realise in the immediate present how necessary or how beneficial they were until the results we anticipated from them were visible.  We intend to see, so far as it is in our power to do it, that they <Col N="874" /> will get the time, and that is the answer to Deputy Morrissey's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is clear, definite and positive.  We think that the circumstances of this country require a Government with a policy of that kind.  We did not make our decision for the purpose of hanging on to office.  We made it for the purpose of ensuring that there will not get into office a Government that would represent nothing more than a collection of diversified grievances, with no policy and no clear objectives, a Government which would be formed from a coalition of the Parties sitting opposite, and which would come in hamstrung with promises impossible of fulfilment.  We are going, if we can, to save the country from that fate.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government which, we are told, brought all these benefits to the country, left office in 1951 voluntarily.  Why did they do it? Deputy Bartley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, asked that question, and it is a very pertinent question: Why did that Government in 1951, without being defeated in the Dáil, nevertheless dissolve the Dáil and go to the country?</P>

      <P>I repeat that the Government had not been defeated in the Dáil.  There was no compulsion on it because of a Dáil situation to dissolve and go to the country at that time.  What was the situation in which they did it?  May I remind Deputy O'Leary and the Deputies opposite of the situation?  The Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government, Deputy McGilligan, brought here the Budget statement of 1951.  In accordance with the normal <Col N="875" /> practice of the Dáil the debate on that Budget statement was adjourned until the next day on which the Dáil would sit.  The Dáil never got a chance of sitting again.  Without warning it was dissolved that night.</P>

      <P>They knew that they had so presented the national accounts to the House that they were concealing their failure to make adequate provision for revenue in the financial year to meet the outgoings to which they were committed.  We discovered that for ourselves within a week after becoming the Government in June of that year.  We found then that the maximum revenue anticipated from the taxes that they imposed fell short of the minimum commitments in respect of expenditure which that Government had undertaken by several million pounds.  We knew that the job, the unpleasant job, of proposing new taxes to the Dáil to close that gap was going to be ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that these new taxes are harsh and impose a burden on the people.  In so far as I can, I am going to ensure that the responsibility for that situation will rest where it belongs&mdash;upon that cowardly Government which, rather than face their responsibilities in that year, tricked the Dáil with a faked Budget that was followed immediately by a dissolution. They knew more than that. They knew that the very exceptional facilities which they had given for the import of manufactured goods in the previous month were bound to produce a trade slump in a number of important <Col N="876" /> Irish industries.  They must have realised, when they gave special licences for the import of 4,000,000 square yards of woven cloth, that, in the course of time, orders to the Irish woollen mills would dry up.  When they gave their special licence for 1,000,000 nylon stockings&mdash;stockpiling against an emergency we are told&mdash; they must have realised that in due course the orders to Irish hosiery factories would be curtailed.  They realised that the trade slump which they are now blaming on the present Government was bound to come following upon the measures they took, and they tried to dodge responsibility for that also.</P>
    <P>They knew another thing.  They knew that, in the last three months of their term of office, the cost of living was going up at an unprecedented rate.  Deputy Norton, in the course of this debate, said that the last published index number for the cost of living while his Government was in power was 102.  That was the index number for February of that year, but they did not leave office until June, and there was another index number for mid-May. They took good care, however, to go to the country before it appeared, because in that last quarter, without any withdrawal of subsidies and with the Government then in office doing nothing but sitting back and looking on, the cost of living, measured by the index number, went up by the same number of points as it went up consequent on the withdrawal of subsidies in this year&mdash;by seven points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We took over a situation, as I have said, in which we knew that we had to make a choice between straightforward action to protect the national interests and our own Party advantage.  We made that choice and we do not regret it.  It has been suggested in the course of this debate that this Government should resign because their candidate was defeated in a recent by-election.  It is ridiculous to suggest that this Government or any Government should resign if they do not win every by-election <Col N="877" /> during their term of office.  We know that in by-elections, particularly one caused by a vacancy on the Opposition Benches, where it is obvious that the fate of the Government is not involved, ballyhoo sometimes counts more than logical argument.  You had the advantage of that situation in the recent by-election.  We regret the result.</P>
      <P>May I say that, following on the introduction of the Budget this year and the initiation of these measures to rectify the situation on which we had decided and which we knew would not pay off in benefits to our people for some time, we did not expect to win the by-elections in June last either? We were gratified to find that in two important constituencies it was possible for us so to explain the position to the voters as to secure the return of our candidates.</P>

      <P>I am confident that if in any constituency, not excluding North-West Dublin, the electors have to make a choice, not between two candidates at a by-election, but between a Government of the Fianna Fáil type and a Government of the Coalition type, there will be a different result.  I want the House to understand our position.  We have set the ship of Government on its course and have lashed the wheel.  We are concentrating on the tasks immediately to hand.  If that ship gets torpedoed on its voyage, we will do the conventional thing and go down with it.  We hope it will get to its ultimate destination because, when it gets there, the people will realise that the course has been well set and that the destination is one worth reaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn now to deal with those specific and grave economic and social problems which have been in debate here and with which this Dáil and the country are faced.  The cost of living has gone up substantially, and that rise in the cost of living has imposed burdens on the people, burdens which it must be the aim of Government policy to mitigate.  Can we get agreement in the Dáil that the cost of living <Col N="878" /> must not be allowed to rise further, that nothing must be allowed to happen which will force it up further, that no cost will be allowed to be increased which will have the effect of making prices go higher?  If Deputies are as perturbed as they declare about the rise in the cost of living, it should be possible to get agreement on that proposal.  If we cannot get agreement on that proposal, a lot of their talk about the cost of living must be classed as hypocritical.</P>

When they have gone through that process, they go out into the passage to titivate themselves and then come in to demand a higher price for milk delivered to creameries, a higher price for butter, a higher price for beet involving a higher price for sugar, a higher price for wheat involving a higher price for flour and bread.</P>

      <P>I say to any group of Deputies who come here on alternate days to deplore the rise in the cost of living and to urge measures which will cause it to go higher still that they are either incapable of putting forward a logical policy or they are allowing hypocrisy to determine the character of their speeches here.</P>
      <P>We decided upon a reduction in subsidies.  Subsidies for food prices were initiated as a temporary device in the post-war period and it was always the aim that they should disappear eventually.  Does any Deputy seriously believe that we should maintain food prices subsidies in perpetuity?  Do they think it would be wise to do so?  Is it not better that we should get reality into our price structure?  We realised that the withdrawal of the food subsidies and the rise in the price of certain foodstuffs would cause hardship.  In so far as it was in our power to mitigate that hardship we took the appropriate measures.  For every class of the community who are depending in any way upon Government subventions under any of the social welfare schemes the amount paid to them was increased by at least the amount that the cost of living had been raised, and in some cases by more.  We said that where, over and above those measures, the rise in the price of foodstuffs required adjustment in remuneration, that adjustment should be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride in the course of the debate endeavoured to represent me or some other Minister as saying that there should be no increases in wages. I said the contrary.  I said that it was far better that we should get our price level on a basis of reality and adjust wages in relation to that price level rather than that we should maintain the policy of subsidisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also stated that the current <Col N="880" /> demands for higher wages result solely from the adjustment in food subsidies made in the Budget.  That is not true. Every Deputy connected with the labour movement knows it is not true. Long before the Budget was introduced, I personally became involved in discussions between the executive committees of the Congress of Irish Unions and of the Employers' Federation, discussions which ultimately led to a general agreement to regulate the increases in wages.  These discussions had their origin in the rise in prices which had taken place in the previous year, and I felt I was in duty bound to tell those who participated in them that when they were engaged in their negotiations they should know that the Government contemplated changes in respect of food subsidies.  I did not feel at liberty to tell them more than that but I felt that it was my duty to let them know that they might have a problem of wage adjustment to solve greater than that which was indicated by the cost-of-living index number at that time.</P>
    <P>What is the position now and what is the position likely to be in the future?  I think it is true to say that only internal factors are causing prices to go up now.  The import price index number has fallen fairly consistently since the first quarter of this year.  The cost of goods imported into this country and used for industrial and agricultural purposes is tending downwards but the effect of that fall in material costs on our price level is being offset by rising internal costs.  There is a fair prospect that when these adjustments in internal costs are completed a position of price stability will be realised.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite have, however, given to the House and to the country a completely false picture of our price situation.  Even Deputy Costello who promised to be scrupulously fair and meticulously accurate on facts said that there had been a rise in the cost of every commodity. Other Deputies read out lists of commodities which had risen in price.  Deputy Hickey, I think, chose a number of selected commodities and said that any given quantity of them <Col N="881" /> would cost so much more now than they cost a year ago.  I can select commodities which have fallen in price as numerous as those selected by Deputy Hickey and perhaps it is no harm to remind the House that within the overall situation in which the cost-of-living index number has risen, many prices, including prices of important commodities, have come down during the course of this year.  The price of coal fell by a pound a ton in Dublin and by varying amounts in other counties.</P>

      <P>I did not say the cost of living is going down and I will not be misrepresented by Deputy MacBride's tricks.  Keep them for the cross-roads.  You will not get away with them here.  What I have said is&mdash; and these are facts any Deputy can check&mdash;that the cost of imported materials is coming down, the import prices index shows that, but the effect of that fall in material costs is being offset by higher wages and higher costs at home; the net result is that a position of price stability may be realised when and only when the effects of the present wage adjustments are finally and fully reflected in retail prices.</P>
      <P>We are told that all these rises in the cost of living occurred since the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  Deputy Blowick, a former Minister, actually made a statement that during the three and a half years in which the Coalition were in office only one price went up, that of butter, by 2d. a lb.  I asked my Department to produce a list of the commodities that increased in price during the Coalition term of office&mdash;those that were the subject of official Government Orders sanctioning increases and those that took place with the consent of the Government without formal Orders. It would take me an hour to read over list after list of the commodities that went up in price at that time.  Does Deputy Blowick seriously think that anybody will believe his assertion that during their three and a half years in office no price went up except one?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that from February, 1948, to February, 1951, there was a rise of only two points in the index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Coalition Government were still in office in May, 1951.  In the last three months of the Coalition's term of office the cost of living began to shoot up at an accelerating pace and that is one reason why they dissolved the Dáil at that time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello also said that the cost of living has gone up here more than it went up in Britain.  I contradict that statement.  The cost-of-living index number in Britain shows that during the period between 1948 and August, 1951, the British index went up from 100 to 126.  Here the index went up from 100 to 122.  Whatever influences were at work here in causing the cost of living to rise were equally at work in Britain and were producing a still more definite increase in prices in Britain.  Nor was that true of Britain only.  In every country in Europe prices were fluctuating during the same period.  It is true that in Belgium and in Germany there were no increases, whatever local circumstances operated there, but as against the increase here there was an increase in Austria of 36 per cent., in Iceland, 36 per cent., in France, 22 per cent., in Norway, 12 per cent., in Sweden, 12 per cent., in Denmark and Italy there was also an increase.  In Switzerland there was a fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious, therefore, that the contention made by Deputies <Col N="884" /> opposite that all these misfortunes fell on this country just because the Fianna Fáil Party came into office is not capable of statistical proof.  I will put it clearer than that.  It is a falsehood.</P>
    <P>We are told that taxation is too high.  I will agree that taxation is very high, that it is dangerously high having regard to the present level of national production.  Could we get agreement in this House that it must not go higher?  Will the Parties opposite consent to a proposition that no matter what proposal is made here for increased Government spending, no matter how desirable the objective of that spending, no matter how justifiable the claim leading to it, we will not agree to it; that, in order to keep taxation from going higher we will stop all spending from going up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody will agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, nobody will agree to it.  Deputies who deplore the present level of taxation and then stud the Order Paper with motions demanding still higher Government spending upon particular projects in which they are interested are again, I submit, leaving themselves open to the charge of hypocrisy.  Deputy Costello, it is true, admitted that, if taxation was to be reduced, Government spending would also have to be reduced, but he took very good care to give not the slightest indication of the direction in which he would achieve that reduction of spending.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of speeches about unemployment, and the persistence of unemployment is a most serious feature of the national economy; but I again want to say that no Deputy gave a fair picture of the position, and least of all Deputy Costello, despite his aim of being scrupulously fair and meticulously accurate, when he said that the unemployment register figures gave the whole of the picture in relation to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not&mdash;it is much worse.</P>

    <Col N="885" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey says it is worse.  I am going to give another side of the picture.  The factors which influence registrations on the live register are numerous.  The increase in the number on the live register, in the course of the past 18 months, took place despite the fact that there were more people in employment during that period.  According to statistics from the Department of Social Welfare, the average weekly number of people employed in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, calculated from the number of contributions paid in respect of them, in 1951, was 369,700 as compared with 353,600 in 1950, an increase of 14,000. I endeavoured to get from the Department later figures than those for 1951, but they told me that no later figures are available, but that sample inquiries had been made and that these inquiries suggest that, in the first six months of this year, there was a further improvement in respect of the number of people employed, as compared with the first six months last year.</P>
      <P>Whether these statistics, when available, will show that or not, I will content myself with asserting that there was no falling off in the number of people in employment in insurable occupations during that period.  That can happen, as we know, while, at the same time, the number of people seeking work in insurable occupations and registering at the employment exchanges for that kind of work can increase also.  I am not going to minimise in any way the magnitude of that problem.  We know that the live register is not an indication of the number of people available for the type of work that could be offered on Government works schemes.  Probably not more than one-third of those on the register are capable of manual work of that kind.  At any rate, that was the position as we found it when we analysed it some years ago and I am sure it has not changed fundamentally since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-all situation in regard to employment, as distinct from unemployment, is not nearly as discouraging as Deputies suggested.  So far as building is concerned, it is not true <Col N="886" /> that there has been any curtailment of the activities of local authorities. Deputy Cosgrave, I think, agreed with that, but he did say, and probably rightly, that there has been some falling off in activity by private people. The extent to which it is possible for the Government to influence the building orders placed by private people is very problematical&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest on small dwellings loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am quite certain of this, that the rise in the cost of building has led to a falling off, and I will suggest to Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dockrell that the rise in the cost of building has had a far more detrimental effect upon the volume of building orders by private people than the increase in the interest rate on loans.  If we could get back the cost of the materials used in the building of houses to the level at which it stood a year ago or two years ago, we would do much more than offset the effect of higher capital costs.  I am going to make some shot in that direction by breaking up the builders' providers' rings under the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, but I suggest that both Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Belton could lend their influence in getting some improvement in that direction also.</P>
      <P>May I, as a matter of interest, mention that, in all the distributive trades in this country, in the year 1951, the average net profit on turnover taken was 4 per cent., but the builders' providers secured 6.2 per cent. and earned 14.3 per cent. on capital invested?  Perhaps, if there is a falling off in the volume of private building, the builders' providers may be able to make a contribution to its restoration by being satisfied with the same net profit on turnover as other persons engaged in distributive trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate at which the Government can borrow is determined by a variety of circumstances.  Is there <Col N="887" /> a suggestion that the Government here can borrow money at lower rates of interest than other European Governments are paying?  We know that there was for a time in Great Britain a cheap money policy, when Mr. Dalton was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and we were able to benefit by that policy, but just as there has been a change of policy in that regard in Britain, so also has there been a change of policy in America and all over the world.  Because of changing circumstances, the cost of money, of long-term money, has risen.</P>
      <P>Why do Deputies expect that it should rise everywhere else and not rise here?  We could undoubtedly force people to lend us money at a low rate of interest, but it would mean imposing a restriction on the movement of funds between this country and Britain, and we do not think it would be worth it.  We think that the cost we would pay in unemployment would be far too high for the advantages we would secure.</P>

All our woollen factories are back in full production and some are on overtime. <Col N="888" /> The same is true of our leather tanneries.  In most of the textile industries, normal conditions are back again.  We had to take drastic measures in order to get that situation but it has been secured.

      <P>We were told that the export of timber was an indication that building activity was falling off.  Let me tell the House the story.  There was set up by me during the war for the purpose of securing adequate supplies of timber during the emergency an organisation called Timber Importers, Ltd.  That organisation was dissolved by Order of the <Col N="889" /> Coalition Government in 1950 and its funds confiscated for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Within a few weeks, they wanted to restore it and those concerned agreed to bring it back into existence provided they got their money back again, but that was asking too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And so the responsibility of bringing in stocks of timber in the circumstances of that year was not given to any organisation set up for that purpose but left to individual firms.  Some of these individual firms brought in substantial stocks.  I have no doubt they were thinking of their own interest as much as the interest of the country.  After the stocks came, timber prices fell, and fell heavily and are still falling.  I met the representatives of Timber Importers and they told me that they were facing such serious losses that some of them would not be able to continue in business.  They endeavoured to put on me an obligation to help them out of a situation which was brought about by the request of the previous Government. I declined to agree that there was any such obligation on me.  I did say that to the extent that they were carrying abnormal stocks on which they were likely to make a loss I was prepared to relieve them by giving them export licences.  They have not been able to effect exports to any extent worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the experience I have had recently, in relation to timber, wool tops and other goods, convinces me of one thing, which I am going to put on the record for the benefit of any Minister who follows, that if the danger of war should arise again, it would not be fair to put the obligation of stockpiling, for safety purposes in an emergency, on private firms.  We will not get it done anyway.  Everybody knows that those who responded to the requests made to them in 1950 to carry abnormal stocks suffered losses in consequence <Col N="890" /> and none of them will burn their fingers a second time.  If we are going to have a policy of stockpiling at any time in the future then the Government in office will have to take the responsibility for setting up organisations for the purposes of financing the stocks and covering the losses in the event of a loss arising.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with some of the more serious contributions that were made in the course of the debate than those to which I have replied so far.  Deputy Costello delivered what was obviously a carefully prepared speech conveying what he described as suggestions for the improvement of the financial organisations of the State.  I think it is true that the financial institutions of this State were not specifically designed to foster the economic development of a free Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am convinced also that their reform must come gradually and, if possible, voluntarily.  State action to press that reform if it should <Col N="891" /> have the effect of creating, mistakenly or otherwise, fears that the private savings of our people were going to be seized to relieve the financial difficulties of Government, or if it aroused fears abroad that payments made in Ireland for goods sold to Ireland could not be freely transferred into sterling, would cause widespread unemployment and bring trade to a standstill.  That is a risk we should not take, at least until the need has been demonstrated.</P>

      <P>There has been no evidence so far that either public or private investment here has been found impracticable.  We had during the years before the war and the years since the war a substantial volume of investment both in public undertakings and in private business enterprises. There has been no real evidence produced anywhere that the defects of our financial organisation have impeded seriously worth-while developments of that kind.  Deputy Costello appears to be still under the delusion that the Government he led started a policy of productive capital investment.</P>

      <P>And other Deputies opposite seem to share his illusion.  I would ask the Deputies who share that illusion to apply this practical test. Let them read Deputy McGilligan's Budget statement of 1950 and the list of items which was then described for the first time as the Coalition's capital investment programme.  They will find in that list of items only one that was not based on a Fianna Fáil Act.  Every single item in that list was made possible by the legislation passed by the previous Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the exception of the land improvement scheme with which Deputy Dillon was associated. On referring to Deputy McGilligan's Budget statement of 1950, Deputies will <Col N="892" /> find that there was appropriated for that scheme in that year £3,000,000 but if they turn up the finance accounts for the whole of the year they will find that of the £3,000,000 only half a million pounds were spent.  That was a queer sort of capital development programme.  What is the position this year?  The position this year is that so vigorously has our Minister for Agriculture gone ahead with the land improvement programme that already the full amount voted for the year has been expended and he is coming here next week for a supplementary sum to enable the activities under that scheme to be continued and extended in the rest of the financial year.  Compare that accomplishment with the large promise and poor performance of Deputy Dillon.</P>

I ask them to find out how much of the total amount provided for capital services in that year was actually spent.  They will find that Deputy McGilligan had £10,000,000 unspent at the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>That was a queer sort of capital investment policy.  It was one pushed with very little vigour or, if pushed at all, pushed the wrong way. Of course we know the policy of the Coalition in this matter changed during their term of office.  They did not come in with a programme of capital investment. They came in with a programme of retrenchment and in their first year of office took pleasure in coming here <Col N="893" /> and announcing that various capital schemes initiated by their predecessors had been dropped.  Do not Deputies opposite remember that? Was not the whole mineral development project dropped?  Did not they leave 70 workers down there in Avoca, County Wicklow, getting their pay but under orders to do no work for 15 months?</P>

Was not every single one of them put in the wastepaper basket and only revived in September, 1949, when political pressure made it expedient to revive them?  I could enumerate here for half an hour worth-while capital investment projects which, in their first enthusiasm for retrenchment and economy, they decided to drop.  But then there came a change of policy.  Why there was a change of policy I do not know.  Instead of retrenchment and economy and cutting down upon capital expenditure this so-called capital investment programme was initiated.  I say that it was phoney from the start; it was a phrase designed to conceal the fact that they were going to borrow for ordinary Budget purposes and thus avoid the political unpleasantness of imposing necessary increases in taxation.</P>

There has been a larger volume of money made available for investment this year than in any previous year, despite the increased taxation, and done entirely out of our own resources, because that is the significance of the disappearance of the adverse trade balance.  We can forget about that now.  That problem is solved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that the solution of our economic difficulties is to set up an active capital market. That is Deputy Costello's proposal for ending all our difficulties.  A market, as I understand it, is an institution, a place where buyers and sellers make contact, to do business.  If there is a need to attract the savings of individual citizens to investment in Irish industry&mdash;and I have not seen evidence of serious difficulty on the part of Irish industry in getting new capital as required up to this&mdash;but if there is such a need, then it will be met, not by tinkering with machinery but by creating conditions in which our citizens will desire to make investments of that kind and, if that desire is to develop amongst our citizens, then there must be first of all a cessation of these attacks upon Irish industrialists as racketeers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I thought, preposterous for Deputy Costello to come here urging more voluntary investment in Irish industry, the creation of some organisation which would enable Irish citizens to invest in Irish industry&mdash;as if they had not the means already&mdash;when his first lieutenant or second lieutenant, <Col N="895" /> or sergeant-major or whatever he is, spends his time in this Dáil denouncing Irish industries as criminal offences against the community and those who engage in them, those who seek the investment of Irish resources in them, as crooks and racketeers.</P>
    <P>There must also be some effort to repair the false impression that has been created that, for political reasons, Governments may come into office here which will prevent Irish industries from earning profits commensurate with those that industries in Britain can earn.  If we are to have investment in Irish industry made possible in competition with investment in English industry, then there must be the same prospect of return, the same prospect of security here as in Britain.  The alternative is to impose restrictions, to have something akin to a capital levy, a conscription of capital resources, but we cannot make that effective except by imposing general restrictions upon the movement of funds between this country and Britain, and that would have such serious consequences upon our trade and employment that it is a measure we should not take until we are driven to it.</P>
    <P>We can develop an active capital market here in the course of time provided we get rid of the mentality which regards a successful and profitable Irish industry as a public enemy. I have said that I have no evidence that industrial development by private enterprise has been unduly held up by lack of access to investment funds.  If more is to be done, it is far less a matter of changing the methods by which industrialists can have access to the savings of investors than of changing the mentality which has operated in that matter heretofore.</P>
    <P>I have been asked for a declaration of the Government's policy.  It is difficult to condense a statement of policy in a few sentences but I have no hesitation in again explaining to the Dáil what the Government is trying to do, what every single Minister in the Government is trying to do.  I emphasise that this is a united Government, that every member of it has the same policy and is striving to the same objectives.  We argue amongst ourselves. <Col N="896" /> We can afford to argue amongst ourselves because we know that, no matter how heated the argument may become&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the end, when there is a majority vote, that decision will be accepted by all members of the Government.  I have always contended and I know now from examination of the records that the Coalition Government could never afford to push any question upon which there was disagreement to the point of decision and they never did.  The Coalition Government whenever they came to that position adopted one of two devices: either they postponed consideration of the question indefinitely or set up a committee that never met.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Independent Deputies who have supported this Government, I want to refute one suggestion that was made repeatedly from the benches opposite.  There was no contact between the Government and any of these Deputies, much less a bargain, before the vote was taken in the Dáil that put this Government into office.  There has been no understanding of any kind with them that the Government will or will not dissolve the Dáil or have an election.  There is no agreement expressed or implied which binds them to support this Government one day longer than they decide in their judgment to do.</P>

      <P>It is despicable that suggestions to the contrary should come from Deputies opposite, some of whom know the efforts that were made by their leaders to suborn those Deputies from their decision and to induce them, for material reasons, to vote otherwise.  It is the aim of the Government by every device in its power, to utilise every instrument of legislation and administration to assist fuller and more efficient production in every branch of the national economy.  I believe, unless we can get greater production of wealth from <Col N="897" /> Irish farms and Irish factories, we cannot afford to sustain the present level of State services or the present standard of living of the people.  We can for a time postpone the day of reckoning by living on our reserves but inevitably that day will come, unless the efforts being made to expand production and increase efficiency are successful.  I think already we have made substantial progress. Whatever criticism the Opposition can make of the Government they cannot say that we have been idle.  In every Departments things have already been done which they failed to undertake. Is that not so?  We have come in here with legislative proposals and other measures representing the accomplishment of things which the Coalition talked of but did nothing about.  The new industries established are now making an important contribution to the nation's capacity to produce more wealth.  In industry also things are being done now that should have been done years ago. The extension of cement factories is a case in point and so is the extension of sugar factories and the extension of the merchant marine service.  All these things could have been done much more cheaply and easily in 1948-49 but nothing was done about them.</P>

      <P>Plans for the development of the natural resources of this country which were held up or delayed or scrapped by the Coalition Government are now in progress again.  That applies to the mineral development proposals and to the exploitation of our peat and our water power for electricity purposes.  Again, let me remind the Dáil that plans for only two electricity stations were approved by the Coalition; one was in Dublin and the other in Cork, and both were designed to use either imported coal or imported oil.  Look at the picture now.  From Donegal to Kerry new power stations are being planned or are being built, designed to use native resources only. <Col N="898" /> The people in North Mayo have no illusions of the significance of the return of Fianna Fáil to office.  The peat bogs of Bangor-Erris are being developed to feed two power stations which between them will have a greater capacity than the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies from the West have expressed doubts about the Undeveloped Areas Act in relation to the establishment of industries in the Fíor Gaeltacht and similar areas. I do not think any inducements held out by the Government will get private enterprise to go into industry in those areas.  That Act represented only one part of the Government's plan for the revival of those areas.  That part was intended to encourage industrial development by private enterprise.  It is going to have that effect but inevitably it will be confined to the towns and other centres of population where the ordinary amenities necessary for industrial development, such as transport facilities and water supply, are available.  If more is needed to be done in these areas, in the rural hinterland of these towns, it must be and will be done by State enterprise. For that reason we set up the office of which Deputy Jack Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, is in charge and the proposals he has been working on during the year are now coming one by one before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have spoken satirically about the plan to expend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 on the construction of roads in these areas.  Do they not want it done?  Which one of them will say it should not be proceeded with?  The building of these roads, apart from the immediate employment they will provide, <Col N="899" /> will in time tend to increase the wealth of those areas in the years ahead.  The tourist trade was at one time a matter of controversy here but I understood it had long ceased to be such and that now it is recognised that the substantial net income it produces is a major prop of our national prosperity and that we were now agreed that all efforts must be made to expand it.  This is one of the measures designed to that end and it will be of direct benefit to the people in all these counties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal at any length with the measures which the Minister for Agriculture has taken or is planning in order to secure the expansion in production and the improvement in the technique of production in agriculture, which we require.  The Government, in fact, has been devoting most of its time at recent meetings to the consideration of these measures and when they are complete in detail they will be announced to the country and to the Dáil.  But I want the House to appreciate that few of these measures can be made effective without the necessary funds.  If funds are to be expended, then somebody has to provide them.  There may be particular projects which could be fairly described as of a capital nature to be met out of borrowed money but in most cases the necessary resources to vitalise these schemes must be secured out of normal revenue either by an expansion of the tax yield or a diversion to these purposes of money now being spent otherwise.</P>
    <P>We do not expect Deputies opposite to agree with everything the Government does.  It would be a bad thing for the House if there were a lack of debate or criticism.  But we are asking for fair criticism.  If there are Government plans and projects which appear in the view of Deputies capable of improvement, we will welcome their views.  But the type of balderdash with which Deputies opposite have deluged the House in the past few days is doing nobody any good&mdash;not even themselves.  I am quite certain that, even though there comes a time in the life of every nation when, for a very short period, ballyhoo will outweigh <Col N="900" /> serious argument, inevitably serious argument will come into its own again.  For the 25 years of the Fianna Fáil's Party's existence we have planned our political campaign on that assumption, and we were rarely proved wrong.  I would recommend Deputies opposite to study the record of Fianna Fáil.  It was able to go back again and again to the people and get a vote of confidence from them, because on each occasion it could detail the work done or proposed to be done in the most specific way.</P>
    <P>We never relied upon vague promises.  If ever we were tempted to do so, we knew that it would lead to electoral defeat, and I suggest to Deputies opposite that if they want to get the confidence of the people and create a situation in which the Irish people at an election will deliberately vote them back into office&mdash; remember, they never deliberately voted them there yet&mdash;they also must come down to specific detail on the measures and plans they propose to implement, if they have any such plans, and they must make it clear that these proposals are not merely bargaining counters in some new coalition arrangement, but matters to which all those who may support that Government are committed.  No evidence of any such positive thinking, much less constructive planning, has been forthcoming in this debate, and that is why, so far as I am concerned, I do not mind when we have a general election.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride has given notice to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 41 which appeared on the Dáil Order Paper on Wednesday, 3rd December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I asked the Minister for Education to state &ldquo;in relation to the conciliation and arbitration machinery for national teachers agreed to by the Department of Education and the I.N.T.O. in February, 1951, why the review provided for by this agreement has not taken place and, further, whether he is now prepared to agree to the carrying out of such review without further delay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his reply which was given by the Parliamentary Secretary, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The experimental scheme of conciliation and arbitration for national teachers, based on a similar scheme for the Civil Service, was subject to review a year after its formal establishment on 1st March, 1951.  Arrangements for such review were put in hand immediately on the termination of the experimental scheme but the review could not be completed pending the outcome of negotiations in connection with a revised Civil Service scheme.  A new element was introduced, however, into the situation concerning national teachers by the fact that the teachers' organisation was officially supporting High Court proceedings on behalf of two teachers in regard to a matter which had been considered by the Conciliation Council.  I am at present in correspondence with the teachers' organisation in regard to the position.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some supplementary questions which I do not think threw very much more light on the situation than that which is revealed by the Minister's answer.  The Tánaiste, at first, when I asked whether the effect of the reply was to suggest that, because two teachers had availed of their constitutional rights to go to the court to establish their case, conciliation and arbitration was to be denied to the rest of the teachers, said that had not been suggested, and then, at a later stage, in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Mulcahy, he said that one of the normal conditions attaching to arbitration is that it is the sole method of settling <Col N="908" /> matters in dispute.  I sought leave to raise this matter, because I consider that, apart from the issues involved, it raises certain matters of constitutional importance.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with these, I should like to underline one or two of the statements contained in the Minister's reply.  The first matter that I should like to mention is the wording used by the Minister in his reply which describes a scheme of conciliation as an experimental scheme.  It is true that the scheme in question was made subject to review at the end of the year, but that was merely in order to permit the scheme to be amended if defects were found in it at the end of the year.  The scheme itself was very carefully drawn up after long negotiations and consultations between the Department of Education and the teachers' organisation. Article 4 of the scheme provided that a scheme for the formation of a Conciliation Council and Arbitration Board would be subject to review a year after its formal establishment. That is the normal provision, I think, in such schemes.  I do not think that that would entitle the scheme to be treated purely as an experimental scheme.  I think it was intended both by the Government at the time&mdash;the Department of Education on the one hand&mdash;and the teachers' organisation, on the other hand, that this scheme should form the basis of permanent machinery whereby disputes concerning the salaries, emoluments and conditions of employment between the teachers and the Department of Education could be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, gives two reasons as to why the machinery provided for in the scheme&mdash;the machinery for review of the scheme and the continued operation of the scheme&mdash;was not given effect to.  In the first place, he says that the Department was waiting for a determination of the negotiations in connection with the revised Civil Service scheme.  There is no mention, and there was no mention at the time that this original scheme was discussed, of any condition which would make it dependent upon any other conciliation or arbitration scheme that <Col N="909" /> might be agreed upon in regard to civil servants generally.  The matter of the teachers' conciliation and arbitration machinery was considered separately, and I can conceive of no reason why it should be dependent upon the outcome of any conciliation or arbitration proceedings affecting civil servants as a whole.  The provisions for conciliation and arbitration for the teachers would be rendered nugatory if they were to be dependent upon the outcome of arbitration proceedings in regard to civil servants or to any other class in the community.</P>
    <P>On the same basis it might be argued that the Labour Court should refuse to consider any claim brought before it by one trade union until it has considered the claims put forward by four other trade unions.  I do not know whether the intention was that the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal might arrive at findings which might not be commensurate with the increase in the cost of living, and the Department of Finance could place some hope in the fact that the arbitrations would not be so favourable to the civil servants. That was possibly one of the reasons.  I do not think it is a worthy reason or a reason which the Minister should stand over.</P>
    <P>The really more serious aspect, from the point of view of this House and from any point of view, is the reason advanced by the Minister in the latter portion of his answer.  The effect of that reply is that the Minister, as the employer of the teachers in the country, refuses to operate a scheme to which he has agreed because two teachers have availed of their constitutional right to resort to the courts to test out the validity of certain findings in regard to married teachers.  I ask the Minister to consider this in a detached and reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>What would be his attitude to an employer who refused to discuss terms of employment or refused to carry out an agreement because some of the workers were resorting to the courts in order to enforce their legal rights? For instance, we have a number of statutes which provide for conditions of employment.  Would an employer be entitled to say to his employees: <Col N="910" />&ldquo;If you seek to enforce that statute against me, if you seek to avail of your constitutional rights, then I will penalise you either by dismissing you or refusing to grant you the increase to which you are entitled&rdquo;?  Surely that is not a tenable position.  Surely the Minister would be one of the first to denounce an employer who used his position as an employer to try and blackmail his employees from availing of the rights to which they are entitled. If the Minister considers the situation objectively and away from possible preoccupation which the cares of office and negotiations of this kind may involve, he will realise that his position in that respect is untenable, and that it is setting a bad headline.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful whether the Minister's attitude is constitutional.  Our Constitution gives a right&mdash;and a constitutional right is one of the fundamental rights of every citizen of this State&mdash; to resort to the courts and be equal before the law.  I do not think the Minister has a right to impose any condition upon the teachers or upon any other State employees, and to say to a State employee, or any group of State employees: &ldquo;If you seek to avail of your constitutional rights, I will not arbitrate or I will not pay you any increase in wages or salaries which may be due to you by reason of an increase in the cost of living&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no substance in the reasons advanced by the Minister. I know that in the course of discussions that took place, or some of the correspondence, which took place, the view was advanced on behalf of the Minister that the court's decision in the two cases pending might affect the whole structure of the salary basis.  I do not think there is very much substance in that argument, and I think the Minister will realise that there is not very much substance in it, because I understand that the cases which are being litigated only apply to a very limited class of teachers, teachers who were unmarried before a certain date in 1941, if I am not mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that the real reason <Col N="911" /> for this action is that it is part of the delaying tactics which possibly the Minister has been pressed to take by the Department of Finance.  I do not think the Minister should resort to these methods in dealing with the teachers.  The relationship between the teachers and the Department may have been difficult, but better relations have been achieved in the course of recent years.  The Minister started off well, and it would be a pity if at this stage he were to damage that good relationship which is so essential between the Department and the teachers.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Minister should not hold a threat of this kind over the teachers and use methods that are not very far removed from blackmail to try to prevent teachers, either as an organised body or as individuals, obtaining rights to which they are entitled by the Constitution and the law of this country.  He should not use his position as an employer to say: &ldquo;If you go to court, if you resort to your constitutional rights, then I will refuse to give you any increase, I will refuse to arbitrate, I will penalise you because you are doing what you are entitled to do by law and under the Constitution of this State.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this problem as a very serious one.  In my opinion, Deputy MacBride has raised a question about it in a most irresponsible fashion.  He has misstated the facts and practically accused me twice of being a blackmailer. Surely he is not so ill-informed as to be unaware that a scheme of conciliation and arbitration has been offered to the teachers.  The Government did not act in any frivolous fashion in this matter.  They gave very grave and serious consideration to the whole problem, and the teachers on their part, too, approached the matter with a full sense of the gravity of their responsibility.  They did not permit the matter to be handled merely by their executive no matter what confidence they had in that executive.  They decided a delegate convention should be called to consider the offer made to the teachers by the Government.  I <Col N="912" /> will not say anything to-night that might in any way adversely affect the arrival at a satisfactory solution that the Government is so anxious to find and that, I am sure, the great body of the teachers is so anxious to find.</P>
      <P>Reading over the questions, the supplementary questions put and the various remarks, I feel that there has been some misunderstanding of the basis of the proposal for conciliation and arbitration.  So that we should not be any longer talking at cross purposes I think I should give my understanding of what that basis was.  It seems to me that it was intended that conciliation and arbitration should be a permanent feature of the relations and discussions between the teachers and the Government if the scheme was found to be workable and satisfactory, but it was set up for a trial period of 12 months and if either party to the discussions discovered as a result of experience that there were any defects or any objectionable features in the scheme as it existed, either or both parties would put forward proposals to remove those objectionable features.</P>
      <P>That was done by the teachers and it was done by the Department of Education.  Irrespective of what Deputy MacBride has said, there really is no analogy between the scheme for conciliation and arbitration and the Labour Court.  The scheme was an extension of the conciliation and arbitration scheme by which Civil Service differences were settled and until the scheme for the Civil Service had been rearranged after the 12 months' trial period, it would not be possible to put into operation a scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there should be any real objection to the fact that there was an association between the scheme for the Civil Service and the teachers and that the operation of one in some measure affected the other. There was, of course, a certain amount of delay, and grievance in regard to that delay has been very emphatically expressed.  I do not know if Deputy MacBride still believes in a state of permanent revolution, but it seems to me that even between revolutions, no matter how often they occur, there <Col N="913" /> ought to be some period of peace and when a problem is settled at conciliation level there ought to be a truce for a while.  It seems to me also that a review of the settlement was not a matter of extreme urgency.  A settlement in the question of teachers' salaries, was made, I think, on 29th February, nine months ago.  A reconstitution of the scheme is now offered. It does not seem to me that the period of parturition is abnormal.</P>

      <P>While I thought that there was no undue delay, the I.N.T.O., apparently, thought otherwise and they involved themselves in litigation on a matter that had already been discussed at conciliation level. Deputy MacBride said here that my action was a denial of the constitutional right of certain individuals.  It was no such thing.  There was no denial of the constitutional right of any teacher.  Any man who feels himself <Col N="914" /> aggrieved, who feels that he has been wrongly treated, has a legal remedy for that treatment or grievance and is fully entitled to come to the courts; nobody, not even the Government, can prevent him.  But an organisation that enters into an arrangement to settle their differences by way of conciliation and arbitration must, if they are to show any good faith, refrain from trying out alternative methods.  I have not asked the gentlemen who are the litigants in this case to refrain from litigation.  I say: &ldquo;Let them go ahead,&rdquo; and I wish them luck, but I do object&mdash;and I think it is wrong&mdash;to an organisation that has entered into the working of a scheme of conciliation and arbitration resorting to litigation as an organisation.</P>

      <P>This seems to me to be an eminently reasonable attitude.  I regard conciliation and arbitration as a very satisfactory method of dealing with the problem.  I regard the continuance of conciliation and arbitration as highly desirable.  There was no intention at any time of denying it to the teachers.  It is not denied them. They are holding a congress, a delegate convention, to discuss the problem.  I think that Deputy MacBride should have waited for the decision of the teachers' congress, and I propose to do so.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 5th December, 1952.</P>
