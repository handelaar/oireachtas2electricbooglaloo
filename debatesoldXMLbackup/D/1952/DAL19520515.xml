      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my remarks on the Finance Bill last night I referred to the outstanding feature of the discussion, that the Government had failed to disprove the case made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, that they had in fact budgeted for a surplus.  In the weeks which have elapsed since we commenced discussions on the Budget the effects of it have become more evident as day succeeded day.  I referred last night to the effect which it will have on the quantity of foodstuffs which the people can afford, especially the working classes.  I pointed out that bread, butter and flour and such essential foodstuffs will reach a price beyond the capacity of the poorer sections to pay, and that that will mean that the great increase in the quantity of butter <Col N="1707" /> consumed by our people in recent years will be retarded.  That will have a bad effect on the health of our people.  It is a bad thing that the Government should withdraw the subsidies while foodstuffs are so costly to produce and the costings are so high.</P>
      <P>When concluding last night I was addressing my remarks to the effect which the tax on petrol will have on all sections of the community.  We are told that it is intended merely to stop some of the unnecessary expenditure on petrol for luxury purposes.  It will strike hardest at the business community and, incidentally, upon one of the biggest concerns in the State&mdash; Córas Iompair Éireann.  It would be superfluous to relate again the circumstances which attended the former increase in the price of petrol.  The Party which is now in power were vociferous when they were on this side of the House in charging the inter-Party Government with having been remiss in permitting an increase in the price of petrol, because it would react on bus fares and on all charges, thereby again affecting the working classes.  Throughout this country all people engaged in the haulage business are now faced with a very large increase in the price of petrol.  It will mean that they will have to pass on that increase to the people whose goods they are transporting.  The additional cost of haulage will be reflected in the price our people will have to pay for goods when they go into the shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A call is going out to the farmers from various members of the present Cabinet to produce more so that we shall be in a position to export more food and, incidentally, to do with any surplus food imports which we may have at the moment.  I do not think that the increase in the price of petrol will in any way assist that idea.  I would remind Deputies that, particularly in the constituency which I represent, tractors are not owned by a great number of farmers but that contractors hire out their implements to farmers who cannot afford to buy such machinery.  They do the ploughing, the haycutting, and so forth.  At the end of the year they attend the harvest operations <Col N="1708" /> and they charge so much per day.  As a result of the increased price of petrol their charges will, of course, be increased.  That, surely, will not facilitate the expressed desire that costings be reduced so that the price of food may be kept at a level which will help to prevent the cost of living from mounting still higher.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last general election the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, stated in Cork City that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office they would reimpose the taxes which they imposed under their Supplementary Budget in 1947.  It was not enough that the candidates going forward in Fianna Fáil's interests in that city should reply to that statement.  The Tánaiste, as he now is, spoke in Patrick Street, Cork, on the 12th May of last year and is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 13th <i>idem</i> to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Coalition Minister had said that Fianna Fáil, if elected, would increase the taxes on beer and tobacco.  Why should such taxes be necessary?  There is no reason why we should reimpose these taxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not a single indication was given by the Fianna Fáil Party that they would impose taxes which strike hardest on the people.</P>
    <P>Was any indication given by the Fianna Fáil Party that if elected to office they would reduce the food subsidies? I say none whatever.  In fact, on the day this Government was elected to office one of the Independent Deputies who helped to put it into office said that he intended to vote for Deputy de Valera because he had confidence in the programme which Fianna Fáil published after the people had voted&mdash;a programme consisting of 17 points, No. 15 of which related to the maintenance of the food subsidies. We see in this Budget an absolute negation of all that was specifically stated in that manifesto.  Consequently we feel that the people are desirous of an opportunity of recording their opinion and that when they get that opportunity they will do so in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>The policy of this Government has <Col N="1709" /> tended to bring about increased unemployment, increased emigration and a stagnation in industry.  There is a great danger that that position will now be worsened by demands for wage increases consequent on a rise of 10.2 points in the cost of living which will come into effect next July, and that there will be such chaos that it will be impossible for the country to maintain the progress which it was making under the inter-Party Government. I would impress on the Minister and the Government that the people of the country feel that the Government have not a mandate to pursue this policy which will inflict an unnecessary burden on all sections of the community&mdash;a burden of a magnitude not visualised at any time since we attained self-government.  It was never conceived that in any Budget the people would be called upon to face such an impost, the result of which must be apparent to everybody, no matter on which side of the House he may sit.</P>
    <P>Many people feel that Deputy Costello's claims are justified&mdash;that the present Government is budgeting for a surplus and that it is their intention to extract in the coming year from the pockets of the people any few pence which the people might otherwise be able to put aside and to bring that extra money into the Government coffers.</P>
    <P>At the end of that period they can turn to the people and say: &ldquo;See how we have saved the country; here is a well-balanced Budget; here is something left over.  Now we can go to the country; we shall take a couple of pence off beer and cigarettes; we shall not touch the food subsidies but that will pass unnoticed in the jubilation arising from the reduction of the taxes on cigarettes and beer.  The people will not notice the fact that we recanted everything we said about the food subsidies&rdquo;. Then they will go to the country hoping that the people will give to Fianna Fáil the over-all majority which was their stated goal at the last election.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon might allow the Chair to continue without interruption.  Independent Deputies cannot expect to be called as members of Parties are.

      <P>The Minister for Finance, in his introduction of the Bill and in his treatment of the Budget, went to great pains to quote the statement issued by the Trade Union Congress.  He tried to give the impression to the House that in the majority of their statements, the Irish Trade Union Congress were more or less in favour of the Budget, and that the statement of the congress supported many of the observations that he had made on the economic situation in which the country finds itself.  He attempted, as a matter of fact, to attribute to the statements of the Trade Union Congress a denial of the allegations by the Leader of the Opposition that the figure of £15,000,000 as a deficit was an incorrect figure.  As usual, the Minister, whilst he did not misquote, did not finish his quotations.  He picked out small separated paragraphs in the Trade Union Congress statement that suited his purpose.  I think that if he were honest with the House he would recognise, as will any member of the House who cares to read the statement issued by the Trade Union Congress, that that statement was a scathing attack on the proposals contained in the Budget and in the Finance Bill which we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>I merely want to quote one paragraph which has been so often quoted by the Minister and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party, with regard to the gap of £15,000,000.  Page 5 of the Trade Union Congress statement says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" />&ldquo;Firstly, it is necessary to discover whether or not the figure of £15,000,000 constitutes the gap in the current Budget.  We do not doubt for a moment, despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister did not quote the next sentence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless, they remain estimates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Leader of the Opposition is entitled to challenge these figures. I think he made, in respect to many of his statments, a very good case as to why many of the Estimates presented by the Minister could be wrong.  In any case the view as expressed by the Labour Party is the view I expressed this morning.  I make a present of this to the Minister for the sake of my argument, that it is necessary to raise £15,000,000 to balance the Budget but the objection which we raise from this side of the House is to the method by which the Fianna Fáil Government proposes to raise this money.  That is a simple issue.  I suggest, therefore, that the reasonable comment, the comment of the majority of the people of this country, on the Budget is that it is totally unfair, unjust and especially unwarranted in view of the situation in which the country finds itself at present.</P>
    <P>One thing which the Minister, in his introduction of this Bill and in speaking to the Budget, avoided saying was whether or not we were heading in this country towards inflation or deflation. I submit that if there were signs of an inflationary trend in this country, the Minister would be justified in some of the proposals contained in the Finance Bill but inasmuch as we are in a period of deflation, and that it is likely that that trend will be accentuated, this is the worst type of Budget that could be introduced.</P>
    <P>In his reply, the Minister should tell the country, through the medium of this House, whether he believes we are in for a period of inflation or a period of deflation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, <Col N="1714" /> had no hesitation in making up his mind.  Sometimes he is regarded here as the leader of the Government or the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, and a considered statement by him on our economic situation should be taken very seriously.  Speaking in Dáil Éireann on 25th March, the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Almost every country in the world which, like ourselves, was concerned at the beginning of this year or towards the end of last year, at the danger of the inflationary forces, which were then active, getting out of hand, are now no longer worried, any more than we are, about the danger of runaway inflation.  They are beginning to get much more worried about the possibility of deflation, of the downward spiral beginning to move.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether he got that idea or that view from the Chancellor of the British Exchequer who, introducing the British Budget, spoke in more or less the same terms.</P>
    <P>This is the worst Budget that could be introduced if, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce says, there is a deflationary trend.  If it were inflation, it might be necessary or desirable to draw money from the taxpayers to deprive them of a certain amount of purchasing power, but in a deflationary situation surely that is not the remedy the Budget should propose. If there is a deflationary trend, this Budget will accentuate that trend.</P>
    <P>While some people challenge our right to speak for the trade union movement, that is a responsibility which we undertake.  We do not say that we get the majority of the support of the trade unionists of this country&mdash;that could be argued inside out&mdash;but at least we take this responsibility in this House and the trade union movement recognises that we take that responsibility of speaking for organised labour in this House.  We must be concerned for the trade union movement with regard to the effects of this Budget.</P>
    <P>The question of the withdrawal of the food subsidies has been mentioned <Col N="1715" /> at length.  Bread will be increased in price by 38 per cent. from 1st July, sugar by 63 per cent., butter by 28 per cent. and it is expected that the price of tea will be increased by 100 per cent.  In my opinion and in the opinion of those who have examined the figures, that will mean that the cost-of-living index&mdash;which we all agree is no real gauge of the actual cost of living&mdash;will go up by approximately one-eighth. Taking into consideration the increases in other items not included in the index&mdash;cigarettes, tobacco, stout, clothing and other things used from day to day &mdash; compared to January, 1951, in July of this year the cost of living will have risen by approximately 25 per cent.  Now, 25 per cent. in a short period of 18 months is too steep an increase to be borne by the workers and the small farmers.</P>
    <P>I have been taken to task by the Minister and other speakers on account of what was reported from my speech in some of the daily papers.  I said rhetorically that this Budget would not put Chrysler cars off the road, that it would not prevent people from buying mink coats, that it would not prevent people who were in the habit of going to every race meeting in the country the whole year round, still going.  I do not think anyone could misconstrue my mind or my remarks when I said that in my last speech.  I venture to remark that there are people in my constituency who drive Chrysler cars and I have friends who wear mink coats and who vote for me.  The Minister speaking here on Tuesday said that I wanted to deprive people of mink coats.</P>

      <P>I wanted to convey to the Minister&mdash;it is not necessary to convey it to the ordinary people&mdash;that this Budget falls infinitely more heavily on the working class than on those who can afford to buy mink coats or drive Chrysler cars or attend all the race meetings held during the year.  That is the one thing that has made the people so indignant, so mad at the Minister for Finance&mdash; to say that he wants £15,000,000 and proposes to get the bulk of it by depriving people of cheap butter, bread and sugar and by asking them to pay more for cigarettes and a bottle of stout.  That is why I say this Budget does nothing to prevent people from still doing the things I have mentioned but does something to prevent people from eating more bread and butter at the present time.</P>
      <P>Despite the comments of certain newspapers, our antics here on Tuesday were more in amusement at the Minister for Finance when he made his 35-minute apology for the abolition of the dance tax.  He spent 35 minutes in an endeavour to tell the people and to explain to Deputies who sit behind him why he abolished the dance tax. He quoted Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cafferky as those who opposed the abolition of the dance tax in 1946.  He attempted, whether dishonestly or not, to say that I spoke on Resolution No. 9 of the Budget in 1946 and that I welcomed wholeheartedly the abolition of the dance tax.  Is the Minister trying to be dishonest? Is he trying to be just smart or does he imagine that no one but himself takes the trouble of looking back over the debates that took place here?</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the record, and not for the information of the Minister because I know exactly what I said in 1946, I should like to quote what I said on that particular occasion.  Speaking on Resolution No. 9 at column 102 of Volume 101 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" />&ldquo;Another concession which should appeal to younger folk in the country is the abolition of the dance tax in its entirety.  I am for and against the abolition of this tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister could not understand how I could be for and against the abolition of the tax:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think my argument is very reasonable. There are in this country, more so than in any other country in Europe a number of societies, religious; semi-religious and charitable, who run dances frequently for no other purpose except to raise funds for the benefit of the community and for such things as Catholic action, boy scouts, etc.  Dances are also frequently promoted by sports clubs and football clubs.  I am in thorough agreement with the abolition of the tax so far as these people are concerned because if the Minister and his officials knew what it cost to run a dance at the present day they would certainly realise that a whole lot of money cannot be made for these societies if a tax is levied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am, however, very much surprised to see that the Minister will allow commercial dances to be run free of tax as from the 1st August.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did the Minister then understand that? Did the Minister understand that my concern was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To be on both sides of the fence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister finished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;concern was for the football clubs and the other societies and organisations that run dances to support their clubs and organisations.  My concern was not then, nor is it now, for the dance hall proprietors and the commercial dance halls.  I will not labour the point.  The Opposition speakers have attributed to the Minister what I believe to be the motive behind the abolition of this tax; it is to curry favour with the <Col N="1718" /> dance hall proprietors and have them contribute to the Fianna Fáil cumanns.</P>
      <P>The dance tax is a very small part of the Budget.  It will amount to only £140,000 in a full year, but the irony of the situation is that the Minister makes a present of so much money to the dance hall proprietors at a time when he believes the economy of this country is in grave danger and, on the other hand, asks the people to pay more for bread, butter, tea and sugar. Does he appreciate that that is the real reason why there is such a volume of criticism from the Opposition Benches?  Does he appreciate that that is the real reason why there was such a volume of criticism in the the course of the Budget discussion from the members of his own Party who sit behind him?</P>
      <P>The Minister may talk about the problem of people holding dances five miles away from their ordinary habitation in order to evade the tax in the rural areas.  He can talk about the danger of drunken drivers and the debauchery that goes on.  The fact remains that the abolition of this tax in the present situation is ironical.  It is an insult to the people to repeal the tax on dancing and at the same time ask them to pay more for bread, butter, tea, sugar and for cigarettes and a bottle of stout.</P>
      <P>We can come to only one conclusion. The principal reason why the tax was repealed was obviously to induce the dance hall proprietors to subscribe even more to the funds of the Fianna Fáil Party for the pending by-elections or perhaps for the next general election.  These quotations from Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon, Deputy Cafferky and myself in relation to the proposal in the 1946 Budget are just so much eyewash when we consider the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not mention one word in relation to the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  When I suggested he might mention food subsidies in his introductory speech on the Finance Bill the Minister, being such a great upholder of order and decorum here, said there was no provision for the withdrawal of the food subsidies in the <Col N="1719" /> Finance Bill.  A very simple and a very clever way out.  No matter what people may think about the increase in cigarettes, tobacco, stout, petrol and income-tax, the one thing that really concerns them at the present time is that, while they may be able to do without cigarettes or perhaps not smoke so many, and while they may be able to drink two bottles of stout in future instead of their customary three, the four items to which subsidies were applied were, still are, and always will be, the staffs of life.  The people must buy these things.</P>
    <P>Despite the furore created here and the furore throughout the country, the Minister never attempted in his introduction of the Finance Bill &mdash; and he did not do it in his Budget statement&mdash; to give any justification for the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  These subsidies were first introduced to close the gap that existed between rates of wages and the cost of living.  That gap has not yet been closed.  Only when that gap is closed, then, and only then, should we consider a withdrawal of food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I wonder why Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll wanted an assurance from the Fine Gael Party in relation to the restoration of food subsidies?  Why the Fine Gael Party?  I never thought Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll was particularly attracted to the Fine Gael Party.  He had an assurance from the Labour Party.  He had an assurance from the Clann na Poblachta Party. Why was he so wedded to the Fine Gael Party?  He did not get any assurance with regard to either food subsidies or increased taxes from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, even if there had been a specific statement from the Fine Gael Party with regard to food subsidies before Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll spoke, he would probably have asked then for an assurance from Independent Deputy Fagan. Anything for a way out.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the food subsidies will, in my opinion, mean that the tourists will in future get cheaper food.  I think I am correct in saying that.  The tourist over the past few years was in the habit of paying extra <Col N="1720" /> for tea, bread, butter and sugar.  In future he will get his food cheaper.  I do not want to turn tourists away; I want to see as many tourists as possible coming into the country.  But why should tourists get cheaper food as a result of the Minister's Budget?  Why should tourists from America, from England or from any other country get cheaper food here from the 1st July next while our own working-class people, who can ill afford it, will have to pay more?  To my mind that is an ironical way of encouraging the tourist industry.  The tourists who come in here spend a good deal of money.  The ordinary people do not understand why the tourists should in future get cheaper food while they themselves will have to pay more.</P>
    <P>We export from this country at the present time foodstuffs or goods with a sugar content.  The people who manufacture these goods will, in future, get their sugar cheaper.  The cost of sugar will be cheaper to the factories.  Does that mean that exports of chocolate crumb, jam and biscuits and so on will be cheaper in future on the British market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is this.  They have been getting sugar at the top price, and now they will get it at a lower price.  Will there be any change in the price which they will charge either inside or outside this country, and does it mean, in respect of chocolate crumb, jam and biscuits or in respect of any foodstuffs that have a sugar content, that these goods will be sold cheaper than they are at present on the British market from the 1st July next, and what effect will that have on the balance of payments about which the Minister is so very much concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister queried my figure when I said that the Finance Bill and the Budget, on which I was then speaking, gave to the cigarette and tobacco manufacturers of this country nearly £1,000,000.  Again, I want to say that I reckon that figure to be £.9 million. Exception, I think, could not be taken if I gave the wrong figure of £1,000,000. I base that figure on this calculation, <Col N="1721" /> and if I am wrong I hope the Minister will correct me, that the Budget statement says that the 6d. increase in taxation which it was proposed to put on the packet of cigarettes would bring in to the Minister £5,500,000.  I reckon, therefore, that 1d. should bring in £.9 million.  As I say, if I am wrong I am open to correction by the Minister. If I divide six into £5,500,000 I get £.9 million.  That is the basis of my calculation, and that is the reason why I give the figure of £.9 million.  In any case, the Minister took me to task, and asked did I want to see unemployment in these Irish firms manufacturing cigarettes and blending and manufacturing tobacco.  I did not.  I want to see Carroll's progress and I want to see Sweet Afton sold and smoked.  It is rather ludicrous, however, to suggest that Wills' and Player's are in need of any assistance from this State.</P>

      <P>Is there any indication that these two firms, which supply the majority of cigarettes in this country, are on the verge of bankruptcy?  I do not know why Wills' or Gold Flake or Player's sell more than Sweet Afton; maybe it is a squeeze on the part of these two on Sweet Afton; maybe it is that Sweet Afton is an inferior cigarette and maybe it is that an inferior tobacco is used in it, or maybe it is that there is a squeeze from the Imperial Tobacco Company.  I am making these suggestions to the Minister so that he will clarify the position for the country, and so that the people will get some reason as to why nearly £1,000,000 should be given to these cigarette and tobacco manufacturers.</P>

I will take his word if it is Carroll's, Ruddle's and other Irish firms are meant, but I cannot for the life of me understand why the other two big cigarette manufacturers should have a present made to them of a substantial portion of this £.9 million.</P>

If that is his contention, I would like him to say what is likely to happen to Carroll's output, and how many of Carroll's cigarettes would be sold at ld. per packet of 20 dearer than those sold by the Irish subsidiaries of the Imperial Tobacco Company?</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have always boasted that their policy was to protect Irish industry, and if the Minister wants to do that, that is another way of doing it.  Will the Minister answer the question, whether or not Wills' and Player's in this country and their subsidiaries are on the verge of bankruptcy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party to task for their advocacy of the excess profits tax and he quoted the case of Socialist Britain.  I think anyone will agree that the present Minister for Finance is far removed from Socialist Britain. Again, that is an apology as to why he cannot touch these people, and why our Minister for Finance will not touch the excess profits tax.  He will not attempt to touch those people who have over £5,000 a year, and, further, he will not attempt to tax people who have salaries ranging over £2,000 per year because he says: &ldquo;Look, for God's sake, leave them alone; if we tax them too much they will run out of the country.&rdquo;  But he spent a quarter of an hour here the other night trying to tell us why he should not tax <Col N="1724" /> those people.  He said that these people had their money in this country, and that, even if we were only to get £500,000 or £1,000,000 off them, we should not do anything that would disturb them in this country; but at one fell blow, by one stroke of his pen, he determines that the people will pay £8,000,000 more for their bread, butter, tea and sugar.  In his own words, he said if he attempted to tamper with surtax he would drive the 700 people who were in the region of £5,000 per year out of the country.</P>
    <P>Spleen would be attributed to me&mdash; I suppose will be attributed to me&mdash; because I ask that the people who have over £5,000 per year could bear just a little extra.  I do not want to deny them their £5,000.  I am not jealous of their £5,000.  I do not want to see the £5,000 taken from them entirely and distributed amongst ten people.  I merely want to put this simple suggestion to the Minister: if the ordinary family of five will have to pay at least 10/- extra for these four foodstuffs from 1st July next, if they will have to pay an extra £26 per year, surely the Minister could ask these people who are in the £5,000 bracket, the people who do make excess profits, the people who have Chrysler cars, who can buy mink coats, who can go to every race meeting, to bear proportionately a little more or even to bear proportionately what the man who has £5 per week is bearing.</P>
    <P>The excess profits tax, the Minister says, would not be a good tax because it would encourage extravagance and would be too hard to collect.  These may be fairly good excuses for departmental officials.  They may be good excuses for the people who would be charged with collecting them.  Surely it is not unreasonable to say that if there is a prospect of getting from excess profits, £6,000,000, £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 during next year it would be worth while getting after excess profits.  The Minister may say that as far as this country is concerned it would not be any encouragement to business and industry here to expand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I will say is that there is no possibility of getting anything like that sum.</P>

      <P>The Minister's opinion, I suppose, I will not say is as good, but may be far better than mine.  I am entitled to advocate again that the extra profits levy or the excess profits tax be considered and be exacted.  If the Minister is right when he says that this would be no encouragement for Irish industry, I would suggest that there would be compensation for the business or industry that would show evidence of wanting to expand their particular line of business or industry; that there would be some compensation by way of tax refund to those people who would plough back their profits into industry, to the people who would replace old machinery, to the business or industry that would bring their premises, factories or workshops up to date.  I suggest that there could be many compensatory advances made to those people who showed evidence of being genuine and sincere in their efforts to expand and to make their industry or business progressive.</P>
      <P>I said that the Minister was very solicitous for the 700 people who are in the £5,000 per annum bracket.  The taxes and the cost of foodstuffs, I venture to remark, are higher in Britain.  I think these gentlemen will think twice and three times before they leave this country, bad as the Minister says it is.  I think the Minister might take a little courage in his hands and make an attempt to exact from people who have, for the purpose of balancing the Budget, so as to relieve the burden on those who have not and who can ill-afford to do what the Minister expects them to do in the coming 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is solicitous, as I said, about these people.  The Minister is afraid that, by touching certain rich people, he will drive them out of the country, but he is not a bit concerned for those people who, as a result of this Budget, will be left unemployed.  He is not a bit concerned for the fact that those people will fly very much quicker than the people whom he is afraid to approach or to touch.  They are doing it at the present time.  They are going through Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire and the North Wall, flying across to Britain as fast as they can.  This, from <Col N="1726" /> the Party who promised&mdash;it is not right, I suppose, to twit them about their election promises of 1932&mdash;to bring back the emigrants.  Every single Fianna Fáil member behind the Minister knows that, as a result of this Budget, emigration will increase, because unemployment will increase. Emigration is a consequence of unemployment in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I want to say on the Finance Bill, but again may I revert to the Irish Trade Union Congress statement? The Minister gave much publicity to this statement, but he omitted to read some paragraphs.  I quote one which sums up the attitude of the Irish Trade Union Congress to this infamous Budget.  On page 5 of the statement there is this paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our principal criticisms of the Budget are therefore (a) that it imposes intolerable and insupportable burdens on the masses of the people,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;does any Fianna Fáil Deputy deny that?&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) that it does violence to the principle of social justice in that the effect of the Budget changes is to impose relatively greater hardships on the poor than on the rich, (c) that it will cause a substantial increase in unemployment and emigration, (d) that its contribution to the real problems facing us is essentially negative, and (e) that it will hinder progress towards industrial expansion and economic stability.  These are severe criticisms but we seriously and sincerely believe them to be entirely justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any member of the House who reads that paragraph, in his own conscience if not verbally, must readily admit that these five criticisms by the Trade Union Congress are the criticisms that would be levelled against this Budget, not alone by every Deputy, but by every working man and every member of his family.</P>

Deputy Captain Cowan stated last night deliberately that the justification for this Budget is that the Minister for Finance has before him only two alternatives; to scourge our people with the provisions of this Budget or the inevitable alternative of selling Ireland into subjection to the United States Treasury.  Deputy Cowan says that, rather than see Ireland sold, he asks the people and his own constituents to sustain him in casting his vote for this Budget, which nothing could justify except the desperate need to preserve the independence of Ireland from sale for American dollars to the American Government.  I will give way now for the Minister for Finance to say is that true or false.  Will he answer it?  Will he answer?  Look at him.  There he sits like a miserable mumchance, resting for his authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mumchance&rdquo; is a word I borrowed from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, but if you do not approve of it, Sir, I will very gladly withdraw it.  I understood it to be classical and complimentary, but if Tennysonian English is disorderly, I withdraw it without qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at that silent man!  He is depending and his Government is depending for their existence on the vote of Deputy Captain Cowan. Deputy Captain Cowan is going before his constituents to say: &ldquo;I have betrayed every undertaking; I have reneged on every promise; I have gone <Col N="1728" /> back on every ground on which I sought the suffrage of the voters of Dublin.  Why?  Because I have it in confidential information from the Government I now support that this Budget, with all the burdens it lays upon the people and which controverts every principle I defended in public life, is made necessary by the supreme consideration that nothing else will protect the sovereignty and independence of Ireland from sale for dollars to the United States Government.&rdquo; Unless that is true, Deputy Captain Cowan says he would vote against the Budget and that Government would fall.</P>
    <P>There sitting opposite is the Minister representing that Government who not ten minutes ago asked and got the leave of a Deputy speaking to intervene to clarify a matter relating to tobacco taxation.  I now offer him leave to clarify the statement made by Deputy Captain Cowan.  Does he speak truth or does he speak falsehood? The Minister should tell the House and the House has a right to know.  I want to know.  Does Deputy Captain Cowan speak for the Government when he says that?  Is the United States Government seeking to purchase the sovereignty and independence of this country for dollars?  Is the necessity for this Budget that the domestic resources must be mobilised to prevent that sale and purchase being made?  I will give way for the Minister to answer and the question can be answered monosyllabically.  All I want is a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that question.  Is the story told by Deputy Captain Cowan true or false?  I dare the Minister to tell us now &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and I will give way for him to do so.</P>
    <P>Look at him!  Look at the miserable figure of a Minister who depends for his existence on the vote of a Deputy of whom he is manifestly ashamed! Where now are the incisive northern accents of the sprightly Minister for Finance?  Where now is the commanding presence of the resourceful debater who can turn the sword on any assailant?  Was there ever a more degraded spectacle in the public life of this country than a Minister who <Col N="1729" /> depends for his existence on the vote of a man whom he is ashamed to adopt and whom he does not dare to repudiate?  Was ever political servitude more revolting than that of a creature who is prepared to claim the right to govern this country by the suffrage of a task master whose chains he must wear?</P>

However, neither the dilatory progress of eloquence nor anything else will persuade the Minister for Finance to accept now what he is offered willingly, though he was so eager to claim it a quarter of an hour ago.  Lest his hearing be defective to-day or his understanding slow, I want to tell him again that, now or at any time before I conclude, I will give way for as long as he wants to intervene to tell us whether Deputy Captain <Col N="1730" /> Cowan belongs to him or whether he belongs to Deputy Captain Cowan.</P>
      <P>Let us face the fact.  The policy of this Budget is clear and&mdash;to give the devil his due&mdash;has been proclaimed.  It is this: our people are eating too much and living too well and the time has come to cut down their victuals, to reduce their consumption and to see that these commodities pass into the channel which the Central Bank and the Treasury think they should pass into, so that the Central Bank and the Treasury may use the proceeds for the accumulation of good respectable British consolidated stocks for the better protection of our currency and our Government funds.  Is that true or not?  Is that not Fianna Fáil policy &mdash;our people are eating too much and living too well; it is time to bring them down, to bring them back to a sense of realisation that God made them peasants and they ought to be proud and content to be respectable and respectful as peasants; and that if they dare to aspire to a standard of living not consistent with that our new Tory Party in this country&mdash; Fianna Fáil&mdash;will put them in their place and see that peace and quiet and calm and confidence will rule again in College Green and Foster Place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are not the members of the Fianna Fáil Party ashamed to be made instruments of that policy?  Let us take the issue clearly that is joined between us. Fine Gael does not believe that God fixed the eternal destiny for our people to be pauper peasants.  We believe that the destiny He fixed for this country and our people was as glorious as that for any country in the world and that our people, starting from abject poverty as the poorest peasants in Europe, have pushed forward steadily from starvation to sufficiency, from the servitude of tenants to the freedom of freeholders, from the wretchedness of a subject nation to that of an independent Republic, have now the right and their Government the duty to use the resources of this country, not for the accumulation of sterile savings in British Government securities primarily, but primarily for the development of this country and the winning for our people in Ireland a <Col N="1731" /> standard of living better than they had enjoyed heretofore and which we are satisfied they can and should have now.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy is to cut down their victuals, reduce their consumption and export the proceeds and, as they grow poorer, to view with satisfaction a decline in imports.  What more certain index is there of a falling standard of living than declining imports?  Can anyone point to any nation in the world that raised the people's standard of living contemporaneously with a decline in their international trade?  That is Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>What is the policy of the Fine Gael Party?  It is clear and certain.  I am going to submit that, even if there was only three years in which to prove it, it proved itself dramatically.  It is that, instead of trying artificially to depress the level of imports, we should expand our profitable exports until they are sufficient to pay for all our people require and that, whatever capital investment is necessary to that end, we should make it fearlessly, not from taxes levied from the poor, but from the millions that are available to a hard-working and solvent people resolved to employ them prudently and wisely.</P>
    <P>Our policy was as clear as crystal. We brought it before the Dáil in a dual Budget, and we said that as to £72,000,000 of our annual expenditure, that is for a annually recurring charges which must be met out of annually recurring revenue, and that as to £9,000,000, these are capital projects and once that expenditure is made it need never recur again without the annual demand and approval of the Legislature.  We funded that £9,000,000 over 30 years and, lest anyone might be tempted hereafter to fall down on amortisation duty, we made it a charge on the Central Fund.</P>

      <P>The Minister was as silent as Tennyson would have described it, but which I may not.  Let him not quack now.  I never mistake his version of Falls Road courtesy for <Col N="1732" /> anything but the birdlime that it is. We charged it on the Central Fund, but, before spending the money, we gave notice to the House that, if it authorised us to make this capital investment of £9,000,000, it meant that, for 30 years ahead, there would be an annual charge on the Budget of such and such a sum.  That procedure was described by the present Minister for Finance as fraudulent, as disreputable, as concealing debts, as budgeting for a deficit under highfalutin' terms, and as a procedure which he would never soil his sanctimonious reputation with.  Yet, when the time came to present his Budget, with his tail down, trailing along the floor behind him, there never was a biped with a caudal appendage&mdash;let me choose my words with care and with super-Tennysonian precautions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What he said was fraudulent, what he said was disreputable and what he said disgraced financial procedure, was what he proposed himself to do.  I grant that he blushed and to bring a blush to that leathery countenance requires much.  He blushed and he blushes now, poor man, and so long as he serves under the rhinoceros-hide whip of Deputy Captain Cowan he will have many occasions to blush hereafter. He adopted that procedure of the dual Budget to redeem the money borrowed for capital purposes.  He was right but he should have shaken dust and ashes on his head before he asked this House to approve of that departure on his part.  He wound up his Budget speech <Col N="1733" /> on which this Finance Bill is founded and he charged his colleague, the Tánaiste, to make the same demand as he made in his concluding words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tell us, in common reason, why should we produce proposals of this kind if they were not urgently necessary?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a fair question and I will stand or fall by the veracity and accuracy of my reply which I now make.</P>
      <P>This Budget and this Finance Bill have two purposes.  I ask the House to remember that the campaign to justify it began nine months ago.  I now assert that that campaign began when it was decided to put Deputy de Valera, the present Taoiseach, out to grass.  Deputy Flanagan, of South Mayo, says that he is a fossil who should be put over in the Museum with his boots.  I do not say that but I say that the campaign was launched when Fianna Fáil took the decision to put de Valera out to grass.  A long, bitter, acrimonious wrangle was going on in the Fianna Fáil Party room as to whether Deputy Aiken or Deputy Lemass should enjoy the succession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I have been asked across the floor of the House: &ldquo;Why did we bring in this Budget if it was not necessary?&rdquo;  I am answering and I have the right to do so.  The Government have no right to ask me the question whether there was urgent financial need for the Budget or whether it was necessary to bring it in unless I have the right to answer.  It was put by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass.  I say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce ultimately won, that he then went to the Minister for Finance and put him this proposal: &ldquo;You want to get out of public life; you want to retire to enjoy your parliamentary salary, your pension and the income from your fine businesses as consulting engineer.  To that I am prepared to add the assurance that you will have a directorship of the Industrial Credit <Col N="1734" /> Corporation, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Mianraí Teóranta and one or two other directorships in my gift&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;if you will carry the baby of introducing a Budget which will produce so substantial a surplus that I will have at the end of the financial year approximately £10,000,000 in hand and an excess revenue within my capacity during the ensuing year of £7,000,000.  We want to put the old man out to grass.  I can distribute largesse all over the place.  Some of the hungry young warriors in the Party who are inclined to favour Deputy Aiken I can put in parliamentary positions and the disappointed like Deputy Allen, who hoped to get Tom Walsh's job, will get a step up.  I will consolidate the Party in the absence of the Chief and God knows but I might be able to find some permanent niche for the busted flush, the two pairs, the threes or whatever is left, if anything is left of them, by the time I take over and start to prepare the ground for a general election in June in which with £17,000,000 in hand to distribute I should be able to do pretty well.&rdquo;  Does that answer the Minister's query why he should introduce this Budget?  The answer is because he hopes to be on velvet for the rest of his life and the Tánaiste who is an ambitious energetic young man hopes to get where for many a long day he never dared hope to get&mdash; into de Valera's boots while they are still warm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is plain talk but it is the truth and every Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party knows that it is the truth.  I see with amusement Lemass, Traynor, Boland, Briscoe and the Lemass gang squaring off to the Aiken rump whenever it puts its nose in.  I saw Deputy Aiken, the Minister for External Affairs, demonstrating in one of the funniest speeches ever made in this House&mdash;I will deal with it later&mdash;in Volume 131, No. 5, what a great financier he is.  I am told that since he became acting-Minister for Industry and Commerce hair or hide of him has <Col N="1735" /> not been shown in the Department of External Affairs because he wants to show that anything Lemass can do he can do better.  This House is getting crowded with Annie Oakleys.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy de Valera, the present Taoiseach, when he was Leader of the Opposition whirling his petticoats á la Annie Oakley, when he was trying to scramble with his 17 point programme into the Government.  He got in, point 15 of those 17 points being &ldquo;We will never reduce the food subsidies.&rdquo; Then that dashing versatile gambler on his left suddenly got the brilliant idea that he might Annie Oakley the Chief.  I think that he has done it but what he forgot was that there was a larger, more formidable Annie Oakley on his left and that Aiken has got the skirt on now and is whirling its frills in an Annie Oakley caracola which might yet split the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is a danger none of them has reckoned with.</P>

There were on Deputy MacEntee's desk when he walked in to become Minister for Finance, 24 individual bags in each of which was £1,000,000 in legal tender.  Mark the words &ldquo;in legal tender&rdquo;.  He had the option, if he wished to employ it, of saying to his secretary: &ldquo;Take those bags in each of which there is £1,000,000; put them in the corner of my office and as each instalment falls due on the American loan for the next 20 years go to the corner, take out one of those bags of legal tender, go round to Merrion Square and place them on the American Ambassador's desk.&rdquo;  If there is one syllable of that which is false I stand convicted.

Is there anyone in this House who considers that the securities of the Government of Ireland are in any respect inferior to the Government securities of Great Britain?  I do not think they are, and if you go to the Stock Exchange and ask what the hoariest money-changer thinks of our securities he will tell you the same. But we are told in this House that, if you hold Irish Government securities, you hold nothing but debts due by peasants.  But if you hold 2½ per cent. consolidated stock of the Government of Great Britain, what do you hold?&mdash; a promise that they will pay you £2 10/- in their money once a year for every £100 that they had from you. They will never pay your money back, and the £2 10/- they pay you now is worth about 16/-.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil says&mdash;and let us join issue with them clearly and precisely&mdash;that the only form of capital investment that is justified is one that establishes a source of direct revenue for the Exchequer.  The Fine Gael <Col N="1739" /> Party repudiate that definition of capital investment.  We say there are two types of capital investment eminently justified.  One is capital investment in an enterprise such as the Electricity Supply Board which does finance itself annually, but we also hold that any capital investment which will expand the national income of this country, with a corresponding expansion in the tax yield, thus providing the only revenue wherewith to amortise the loan, is totally justified.</P>
      <P>In 1948 we embarked upon a programme of so financing, and I want to suggest to the House that we have been amply vindicated by the event. In 1947 the gross output of the agricultural industry, as recorded at Table 53 of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1951, was valued at £112,000,000; in 1948 it was £119,000,000; in 1949 it was £127,000,000; in 1950 it was £133,000,000. But that is not all, because that is the agricultural output based on the thoroughly unsatisfactory method employed by our Central Office of Statistics.  That gross output takes no cognisance of the increase in our live stock population or the increase in the fertility of our soil.  Contemporaneously with that increased output I have figures, and I ask the House to look at them, for increased input in 1945.  The value of input (seeds, fertilisers and feeding-stuffs)&mdash;and I ask the House to remember that all feeding-stuffs and fertilisers that go on to the farm ultimately manure the soil and enrich it&mdash;in 1945 was £5,000,000; in 1946 the input was £8,000,000; in 1947 it was £10,000,000; in 1948 it was £14,000,000; in 1949 it was £17,000,000; in 1950 it was £21,000,000.  Was the bank of our land a better place to put our savings than the Bank of England? Or do Deputy Brennan and his successor, Deputy Cogan, in Wicklow&mdash; for Deputy Brennan is going to lose his seat: I told him two years ago to move up in the bed because he is in danger, and look at the danger now&mdash; make the case in Wicklow that the land of Ireland is not as secure a bank as the Bank of England?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We made the case that the land of Ireland was a better bank than the Bank of England and we will fight Fianna Fáil in every constituency in Ireland on that issue.  When we resume responsibility for the Government of this country we will bank our people's savings in the land of Ireland and those who live on the land and get their living on it and if the bankers do not like that they can lump it and any bankers who were not born in this country, who do not live in this country and who are not subject to the law of this country had better learn now that they are not wanted in this country, that a time is coming when it will be made clear that there will be nobody a director of a bank in this country who is not an Irishman and whose first allegiance is not to the Irish people and the Irish nation.  If we get rid of some of the tulips who are managing our banking system we might have decent workers, decent farmers and decent professional men in this country.  These people are being run ragged at the present time by banks forcing them to redeem overdrafts that they did not expect to have to redeem at 48 hours' notice.  I get no satisfaction in seeing three shops closed within five minutes' walk of Leinster House and the same type of thing is taking place in every small town in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Central Bank told the Joint Stock Banks of this country to squeeze everybody that could be squeezed.  It is the dirtiest transaction that has taken place in my memory and it has left a mark upon the mind of every decent man in Ireland that is not to be expunged until we get rid of those to whom our people gave no warrant of authority to crucify the community on their new cross of gold.  We do not believe in that.  We are not one bit alarmed at the prospect of investing money in Ireland rather than in the 2½ per cent. consolidated stock of Great Britain.  We are perfectly aware that the return on our investment in Ireland for the good of our people will be sounder, better and more enduring than the return on any investment such as Fianna Fáil suggests we <Col N="1741" /> should make.  I have read out for you the fruits of our policy of investment in the only industry of importance in this country, namely agriculture.  The tariff quota industries set up by Fianna Fáil are merely badly-run relief works, mainly dependent for their existence on what they are able to levy on agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feature of our production which has displeased the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputies will find it at Table 54 of the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i>  You will read there of the disposal of the output of the agricultural industry.  In 1943 our people consumed £47,000,000 worth of commodities and exported £17,000,000 worth; in 1944 they consumed £79,000,000 worth; in 1945 they consumed £83,000,000 worth; in 1946 the amount consumed was £81,000,000 worth.  In 1947 £89,000,000 worth was consumed; in 1948 our people consumed £93,000,000 worth; in 1949 and 1950, respectively, the amounts consumed were £92,800,000 worth and £92,000,000 worth.  Then Fianna Fáil intervened.  They scanned these figures and said: &ldquo;Tut, tut; £83,000,000 worth of goods were consumed in 1945, and now these presumptuous peasants are actually consuming £93,000,000 worth of commodities instead of sending them across to Britain and earning money.  We will soon put an end to that.  They will have to go back to the 1945 level and cut down their consumption.  If they could live on £83,000,000 worth of goods in 1945, they <Col N="1742" /> can live on it now.&rdquo;  Does anyone deny that that is the purpose of the Budget?  I agree 100 per cent. with Deputy Blowick when he says that the primary purpose of the food we produce in this country is to feed our own people.  When that is done, we will sell the surplus to those who will pay the best price for it over a long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My new acquaintance, Deputy Carter, quacks.  Perhaps he does not know that the result of that policy is to be seen in the figures of our exports.  In 1947, our exports were £39,000,000; in 1948, they were £49,000,000; in 1949, they were £60,000,000; in 1950, they were £72,000,000; in 1951, they were £86,000,000.  In the first three months of this financial year our exports were £22,500,000.  That compares with £16,000,000 in the first three months of 1950.  Probably, if the same proportion is maintained, our exports in this calendar year will surpass £100,000,000, or two and a half times what they realised when Fianna Fáil last went out of office.</P>

If he wants praise for himself let him go down to his patron, Major-General Dennis, and he will get it there.  However, the patronage of his kind is not welcome by the rest of the Deputies in this House, and the fact that Deputy Cogan has it is not a commendation in our eyes.  If the servants of the Ascendancy in the last century had it it did not make them any more respectable in the eyes of our people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil policy is to reduce imports and the people's standard of <Col N="1743" /> living.  Our policy is to increase output and exports to a level where we are paying for whatever our people require.  I submit to the House that the figures already available have shown that policy to have a potentiality for success.  Does this House recall that the figures I have read out to them from the <i>Statistical Abstracts</i> of 1951 show that if we increase the total output of our agricultural industry by 25 per cent.  We increase the volume of our agricultural exports by 100 per cent.  If we increase the volume of our total agricultural production by 50 per cent. we increase the volume of our total agricultural exports by 200 per cent.  There is no ambiguity on the issue of the price of bread and flour, tea and sugar and the other essential foodstuffs.  It is the considered and resolved policy of Fianna Fáil to raise the price of bread, to raise the price of sugar, to raise the price of butter and to raise the price of tea.  It is the considered and resolved policy of the Fine Gael Party that there shall be no increase in the price of bread, that there shall be no increase in the price of flour, that there shall be no increase in the price of sugar and that there shall be no increase in the price of tea.  Mark that down and record it.</P>

      <P>The inter-Party policy on butter was made clear and rejected. The milk producers have been led up the garden path by the present Minister for Agriculture because he was <Col N="1744" /> afraid to be honest and straight with them.  The whole future of the dairying industry is thrown into the melting pot and there is no use in any Party pretending that the price of butter in this country can be precisely forecast until the future of the creamery industry is restored to some basis of permanence of which it has been deprived by the Minister for Agriculture in his policy of passing the buck to Professor Murphy and the Costings Commission which is at present sitting.</P>

It is our belief that the Exchequer exigencies will allow them to be reduced.  So far as the tax on dance halls is concerned, a low bargain was made with the dance hall proprietors to get paid for handing money out of the Exchequer for their benefit.  There will not get the benefit which they covenanted for when the enterprising proprietor of a dance hall sent the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, £250 for the Fianna Fáil funds and exhorted other dance hall proprietors to rival that generosity so that the weight of their influence would make itself felt in time.  They have got as much influence with the Fine Gael Party as a fly on the window and they never will have more.  <i>(Interruption.)</i></P>

He is not in the habit of being told to &ldquo;shut his trap.&rdquo;  Of course, he does not mean to insult the Deputy. The Minister went to London to see Mr. Butler and came back with tears in his eyes to tell us that he had only $16,000,000 wherewith to meet his dollar commitments and that the extremity in which he found himself was due to the profligate extravagance of his predecessor.</P>

For three and a half years the Government of which I was a member was bombarded with applications from the grocers' association for dollars to buy Californian dried fruit, prunes and raisins.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself answered every memorandum that was put up by saying that there was a pre-emptive claim on the dollar resources to finance imports of the raw materials of agriculture and urban industries for capital equipment and machinery and that there was no justification for using dollars for consumer and luxury goods such as dried fruit, more especially as there were alternative sources of supply.  We were <Col N="1746" /> denounced as being profligate.

All these applications have been revived and allocations for the purchase of dried currants, raisins and prunes have been made to every grocer in Ireland who asked for them.</P>
      <P>I ask Dáil Éireann is that consistent with the proposition that the Government are short of dollars?  Is that consistent with the proposition that our Government are embarrassed and prejudiced and even in danger because they have not the dollars wherewith to meet the annual instalment that has fallen due on January 1st, 1952, for the American loan.  I venture to say&mdash;and I have no means of checking the figure yet but I will have&mdash;that a sum in dollars has been allocated for the purchase of dried fruit in California in excess of the total requirements of the dollar service of the Marshall Aid debt for the current financial year.</P>
      <P>Look at those dupes in the Fianna Fáil Party who have thundered throughout the country that the poor Minister for Finance is left without dollars to pay the debt while, at the same time, the dollars that they say he told them he had not got were being allocated to the grocers of this country to purchase currants, raisins and figs, if you please, in California. God knows, it must be a queer experience to be a Minister in a Party which tolerates the insult and affront that is habitually put upon them.</P>

      <P>That is not true.  Listen. I assert now that the problem of the Government to-day is to get the dollars spent.  If anything we have too many dollars.  I assert that the reason this allocation of dollars was made for dried fruit&mdash;and now I have to do this and I ought not be forced to do it&mdash;is that our claim on the sterling pool for dollars is related to our draw on dollars in the preceding year.  I assert that the Minister for Finance could not spend the dollars which he has at his disposal and that the reason he gave dollars for raisins was for the purpose of enabling him to make the case which he will have to make for the allocation of dollars from the sterling pool in respect of this country next year.  That is a fact.  There is no reason why anybody should not get dollars for the purchase of raisins. Too many dollars are available for our trade with the United States.  But the Minister, properly, will seek the widest manæuvring area he can to maintain a claim against the British Treasury in respect of the largest sum of dollars he can claim for.  To do that he must spend this year all the dollars to which he has access or he will be told next year that he did not spend all the dollars which were allocated to him in this year and his full claim in respect of next year will not be granted.  There is no question of anybody sticking his fingers in the eye of the Minister for Finance to the detriment of the community. The dollars had to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is doing in respect of raisins and currants to-day what I had <Col N="1750" /> to do two years ago when I spent $7,000,000 in one afternoon on the purchase of maize and wheat so that when the new claim came to be made against Marshall Aid we could establish our need for an ample allocation.  If we did not spend what was allocated to us in 1949 in respect of 1949, when the allocation fell to be made for 1950 we would be cut down and, therefore, we took good care to spend it.  That is what the Minister for Finance is doing now.  My only complaint is that he has sent out unfortunate dupes in his own Party to pledge their honour and their faith to their constituents that there is an acute dollar famine, that Deputy Cowan is right but that they do not care to say so and that the only way we can save ourselves is to crucify our own people or the rapacious dollar monster in Washington will starve us into subjection.  The whole thing is a dirty fraudulent election device. That is why I want them on the hustings where I can debate that question before the people and ask the people's verdict on it&mdash;and, by heaven, out they are going to go.  We will drag them if we have to.  However, I think three by-elections ought pretty well knock the pins from under them.</P>

      <P>As a colleague of Deputy Dillon in County Monaghan, will he tell me whether, when the American Government were generous enough to extend Marshall Aid to this country, any conditions or any stipulations were imposed on the people here when that loan was being given to this country? If a person goes to a bank in this country and asks for a loan he has to give security and sometimes collateral security.  Had any guarantee to be <Col N="1751" /> given by the Coalition Government to America when we got this money?  I am asking that question just for my own information.  Were any conditions or stipulations attached to the giving of that loan or was it given unreservedly and unconditionally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is unreservedly and unconditionally, in one of the most unprecedentedly generous and handsome gestures ever made by one sovereign State to another.  There was no security.  There was nothing but their willing acceptance of our promise to pay.  I know that I cannot persuade the Minister for Finance to repudiate his disreputable prop, Deputy Cowan. I look forward, however, with confidence to my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Rice, when she returns to Monaghan joining with me in repudiating the disreputable alibi offered by Deputy Cowan.  He voted for the Budget as the only means of protecting Ireland from being put in pawn to the United States Government.</P>

I am glad that Deputies had this opportunity of being educated in regard to what Deputy Mrs. Rice so crudely believes to be incredible magnanimity on the part of the American nation, in a way that will make you wonder why it dawns not only on her imagination but her convinced knowledge.  Now I shall ask the Minister for Finance&mdash;perhaps he will intervene now&mdash;to say whether there were any conditions or any obligations imposed by the United States Government other than to repay.  Will the Minister tell us whether there were any conditions? How odd!

I want in conclusion to deal for a moment with the speech of that grotesque figure the Minister for External Affairs. He certainly is a prize exhibit.  I find at column 661 of Volume 131, No. 5, that in the discussion on the General Resolution he made some of the most astonishing allegations that have ever been made by a man, coherent or incoherent.  I have put down eight extracts from his speech, by way of asking to-day a question of the Minister for Agriculture and I must urgently urge Deputies to be here to hear the answer because it is going to be one of the funniest situations that ever arose.  Either the Minister for Agriculture is an incompetent boob according to what the Minister for External Affairs says or else the Minister for Agriculture will get up and show the Minister for External Affairs <Col N="1753" /> as an imbecile who should be locked up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  I am about to quote the Minister for External Affairs on the Finance Bill.  He is reported at column 663 as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With all the blowing about it Deputy Dillon did when the election was coming in Connemara, with all the talk about shipping the rocks and mountains into the sea, all he did in his time was to clear two acres at a cost of £200 apiece and I will swear that there is not a farmer in the county who would give 50/-for what £200 of the taxpayers' money was spent on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was made by the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>When that statement was first made in this House I asked the Minister for Agriculture what acre involved such cost and he said: &ldquo;No acre.  The most spent on one acre was £100.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;How many acres cost £100&rdquo; and the answer was &ldquo;One.&rdquo;  This wretched man had charged up to the first acre reclaimed in Connemara the entire cost of staff, transport, machinery and everything else, which had been assembled for a programme to cover the whole area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree but the Minister for External Affairs dealt with it at great length in the debate on the General Resolution.  Apparently he had the benefit of a chat with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, since the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs returned from his incognito travels on the continent.  You will remember that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had an interview with a number of Belgian trade unionists who had told him in explanation of how they had arrived at the solution of their major difficulties: &ldquo;<i>Mais, nous travaillons, Monsieur</i>.&rdquo;  But these same gentlemen are now collecting the <Col N="1754" /> Belgian dole because they have no <i>travail</i> whereon to <i>travail.</i>  Since the incognito member we sent out came home, a great many of our unfortunate Irish <i>travailleurs</i> have lost their <i>travail.</i>  Not alone that, but they have been forced to go to the Minister's native land to seek <i>travail</i> there.  I wish he would go over and ask his fellow countrymen to release these unfortunate Irish workers.  We would gladly exchange him for them.  It would be both a profitable and desirable exchange.  Have Deputies ever reflected on the fact that there are more aliens in the present Government at the present time than in any Government in the world?  Up to the time that Deputy Little left, we had three aliens in our Government.  I do not think there is a Government in the civilised world of which that can be said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for External Affairs was asked was he serious in his statement he replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Absolutely serious.  I will take any Deputy who wants to come to my constituency and show him land treated under that scheme at a cost of £50 or £60 per acre of the Irish taxpayers' money... that land would not produce enough of grass to feed a snipe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask where this land is.  Of course the thing is pure nonsense.  He went on to speak of the adverse trade balance and he then took counsel with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but instead of giving us an account of what they were doing in Belgium the Minister for External Affairs only gave us an account of what they were doing in Sweden.  He said that during the past 25 years the Swedes have vastly increased the output from their land and he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are producing from land which is on the average as good as <Col N="1755" /> there is in the world, a mere £104,000,000 worth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister for External Affairs has access to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> as well as I have. The gross output of our land was £104,000,000 when he left office in 1948.  As a result of cleaning him out, the output of our land rose.  In 1948 it was £119,000,000; in 1949 it was £127,000,000; in 1950 it was £133,000,000; and it rose further in 1951.  I wonder if the poor man is still flapping around in the belief that this country is still in the same slough of despondency as it was in when he and his colleagues went out of office in 1948.  It is not.  We were going ahead like a house on fire when we left office in June, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to paint the background of the man who spoke these words.  Remember that he was <Col N="1756" /> a Minister for Finance.  Here is his contribution to this year's discussion. He was talking about our sterling assets and our adverse trade balance and he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the end of a couple of years&mdash; put it at four years if you like&mdash;we would have to take some other more extraordinary measures because at that time the external assets in the hands of Government Departments, the Central Bank and the commercial banks would have gone.</P>
      <P>We could still carry on, however. We could do as they did in England and as they have done in other countries&mdash;make everybody who has £1 or 1/- invested abroad register it and give it over to the Government and get payment in Irish currency. That could be done.  If we did that we could carry on for another three or four years&mdash;if every person who has shares in some British company, or shares in some American company, or a holding in some British Government stocks were made to sell them to the Minister for Finance for Irish pounds.  We could always print Irish pounds to give to them, and we would have these external assets to meet our liabilities in case we had a continuing deficit of £60,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister for External Affairs not know yet that everybody who has dollar currency must list it with the Department of Finance and must, in respect of every dividend cheque he receives, turn it in to the Department of Finance and accept Irish currency for the dollars?  Remember that this unfortunate man was himself Minister for Finance for two years during that period.  He is now Minister for External Affairs&mdash;and he does not know On the contrary, the fact that that is so makes his blood run cold.  He is shocked to think of anyone suggesting that it should be done.  It has been in operation here for the past nine years.  Is there anyone who thinks it wrong to have it in operation, who thinks the Government should not have the right to sequester for the use of the community the necessary foreign currencies on a basis of 20 shillings per £1?  They have had that power, they <Col N="1757" /> are using it and every other Government is doing likewise.</P>
    <P>This is the root of the problem. People like Deputy Aiken think there is something wrong in our people have ing this power.  &ldquo;It is all right for the British&mdash;they are a big and independent people&mdash;or for the Americans; but the people of Éire how dare they aspire to control currency!&rdquo;  Just imagine the dollar holdings of some gentleman in Rathmines or Ballsbridge and think of the ignorant peasants of West Donegal asserting the right as members of the community to control the user of the dollar interest payable to an important person living in Ballsbridge or Montenotte on his foreign investments.  It is shocking, says Deputy Aiken.  Shocking, my foot! We have done it for the past ten years and will go on doing it for as long as it is necessary, without apologies to anyone, like any independent sovereign State in the world.  It is only a banker in Foster Place or College Green who would have the brazen effrontery to suggest we should not do it&mdash;and if they were not domiciled in London they would be ashamed to make the claim.  Even the most brazen faced banker I have ever met never dared make the claim that Deputy Aiken makes there, that this Government and this country should not do that.  He did it himself, we did it and with God's help it will go on as long as the interest of our people requires it.  As I say, I read these speeches made by Deputy Aiken and I mark them with the intention of quoting them here and then I become ashamed as they are too grotesque, too scandalous.</P>

      <P>I have given the reference. The Deputy can read it&mdash;if he is able to read.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this, that £600,000 of the Marshall Aid money has been invested in the debenture of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I think that was a good thing to do. I want to invite the attention of the House to this interesting fact.  Every penny of the Counterpart Fund is now invested.  It has this advantageous <Col N="1758" /> aspect about it, that every penny so invested is earning 3½ per cent. and we have to pay only 2½ per cent. on it.  In respect of every £100 of our own Counterpart Fund we have invested, the Irish Treasury has a profit of £1 per annum.  That is a good deal of money when it comes to £40,000,000.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance these questions.  Although he was left £23,000,000 in cash last autumn, if he thought it was improvident to invest £28,000,000 over the period of the previous two years, why did he borrow the whole £23,000,000 in five months?  That is what he did. I want to ask the Minister for Finance, if there is a scarcity of dollars, why he provides them for the purchase of raisins.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance whether he on behalf of the Government will adopt or repudiate Deputy Cowan.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance if he concedes that, now having no majority in this House, while he undoubtedly has a constitutional right, has he a moral right to force these Budget proposals through without accepting the invitation of the principal Opposition to put them to the issue&mdash;the country&mdash;and that is the invitation I am authorised to issue now.</P>
      <P>Take this Budget to the country and we will abide by the people's decision. Take it to the country now.  If you want a Vote on Account to enable the Government of the country to be carried on while that decision is being taken, we will give it to you forthwith. It is a waste of time and money, it is a waste of everything that the country can least afford to spend at the moment to hold three by-elections and then a general election.  You know that the Government will be defeated in the three by-elections; then you will have to hold a general election.  From every point of view the sensible thing to do is hold the general election now and take a decision on the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Taoiseach is bound to the busted flush not to put them in peril until next spring.  Deputy Captain Cowan stated that he would vote for the Budget because he did not want an election until the coming year.  He has <Col N="1759" /> now changed the alibi and says that he voted for the Budget in order that the country shall not be sold into servitude to the United States of America.  He spoke the truth the first time.  Pension the busted flush.  Make them Senators. Do anything you like with them.  We do not give a damn.  There may be some compensatory arrangement which could be made with them.  It is intolerable that the interests of the whole State should be sacrificed to some seedy bargain struck with a few Independent Deputies in order to procure their vote on condition that they, in turn, were not exposed to the fury of the electorate for at least two years. Upon my word, I would almost let them keep their seats, if that could be done, in order to persuade the Government to take the verdict of the people on issues of such supreme importance. Offer them seats in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>All I ask of Deputy Cogan is that he will be as respectful here in Dáil Éireann as he is to General Dennis down in County Wicklow. Let him conduct himself here as he conducts himself in his best blue suit when General Dennis summons him to attend.  Do not let him act bellicosely here and crawl on all-fours when he is sent for by the general to present himself at the big house. Nothing is more disgusting than to have a person acting bellicose to those who accept him as their equal <Col N="1760" /> because he has been sent here as a representative of our people, and who crawls at the back door of the ascendancy big house when he is summoned to come and hear the pleasure of his lord and master.</P>
      <P>Go to the country and let this matter be resolved in a peaceful and constitutional way.  Then we can get on with the job.  The issues are clear.  They are straight.  There is no ambiguity. Fianna Fáil wants to beat down the standard of living of our people and reduce their consumption of food and consumer goods so that these goods may be shipped abroad.  We believe we can get production which will fill all the needs of our people.  Fianna Fáil say that borrowing for the purpose of investing the proceeds in the land and in the homes of our people is improvident and wrong and if the people want their land to yield more than it has yielded in the past, let them suffer now for they must be sacrificed on the cross of gold as laid down by Foster Place in College Green.</P>
      <P>We say that the best place to invest the savings of our people is in the land of our people.  We say that our people should get their living from the land. We propose to continue that policy because we are impelled into continuing that policy by the results already demonstrable.  It is a glorious thing that this country, and it is something in relation to which we are all entitled to a share of credit, with a civil war only 30 years behind us, can change its Government peacefully and constitutionally by the due process of constitutional function.  The classic method of resolving differences which are fundamental, clear-cut and certain in a House of Parliament such as Dáil Éireann is to-day, divided almost fifty-fifty, is to go back to the people and take their pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government to go to the people now and put the issues as defined peacefully before the people, abide by their decision and then look forward, as I confidently believe we will be able to look forward, after that election to a long period of stable progress in which Ireland will continue to be one of the best countries in Europe in which to live and make one's living <Col N="1761" /> and which will certainly be for generations ahead the most prosperous agricultural country in the whole world provided the Government now accepts the proposition that not only pounds, shillings and pence matter; peace, decency and dignity come into the calculation too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I received a deputation of North Wall dockers. They told me that to-day 300 men stood at the docks waiting to be called.  Out of that 300 men only 23 were called for work that will extend probably over ten days.  That is a very serious matter.  It is up to the Government to take steps immediately to improve conditions there.  If the families of these people have to bear grave hardships because of the unemployment of the breadwinners, while to all outward seeming living in the midst of great luxury, they may get out of hand.  I ask the Government to take serious note of the conditions.</P>
      <P>Later three of these men came to see me and to put forward a certain viewpoint.  They pointed out that the cost of living has increased tremendously and they said that out of all the millions about which they read some money should be made available to them either through the medium of unemployment benefits or otherwise to enable them to live.  They did not complain about the personal burden as far as they themselves were concerned; they complained about the burdens that their wives and children would have to bear.  They complained about the increase in the price of the loaf from 6½d. to 9d.  I appeal to the Government to restore the subsidy on bread at least.  I warn the Government that it will be dangerous for them if they increase the price of the loaf on these people to whom I have referred and on the workers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to ask the Government whether they will give some guarantee that bread will not be increased in price, and further that they will take some steps immediately to provide work for those who are anxious to work&mdash;married men with large families.  I am informed that what I have already referred to has <Col N="1762" /> been going on at the North Wall for the last three months.  There are 20 men offering themselves for every job that is available at the docks.  For the type of work that is available there, a man has sometimes to be at the docks at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the morning in order to try to get a call.  The balance of the 300 men&mdash; that is to say 280 men&mdash;when they found that they were not getting a call, all they could do was to go straight over to the employment exchanges in Gardiner Street or Werburgh Street to sign on.  I want to say that the Government must not sleep any longer over this question of unemployment.  These men have told me that, if they were younger, they would take the boat to-night and clear off, but in their present position they cannot do that because the cost of keeping two homes would be too great for them.  I promised that I would not take more than five minutes to draw the Government's attention to this most serious state of affairs in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come for a factual and reasoned discussion, on the basis of the Second Reading of this Bill, of the economic approach of the Government as against the economic approach of the Opposition to the alleged current day problems. I hope, in the course of what I have to say, to take the main props of the case put by the Government and to shatter their foundations completely, and when concluding to offer what I consider to be a constructive and progressive method of dealing with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I start on the premise of accepting the case as made by the Government and of asking them which of the two legs of it they are standing on.  We have gone through the painful experience in this country of seeing ministerial hysteria and Central Bank conservatism welding together, willy-nilly to arrest development.  There is one patent fact in Ireland to-day on which there is no conflict, and that is that a complete wave of depression has hit the country.  We have been sent here by the people to discharge, to the best of our ability, the responsibilities which <Col N="1763" /> they have placed on us and, therefore, we have to address our minds seriously to the cause and effect of the present situation, and, having done so in a deliberative and unimpassioned way, to try to arrive at a solution of it.</P>
    <P>Now, it is perfectly true, and perfectly obvious to everybody, that the Government have been hoisted on their own petard.  It is quite clear to everybody, even to the doughtiest and toughest of the hard core of Fianna Fáil support itself, that the Government have run themselves into a serious jam by their own hysteria.  They have been caught in that position by their own verbosity, their lachrymose utterances and their own melancholic prognostications and have come back to choke themselves, and their only answer is a vindictive, a savage and a completely unwarranted attack on the unsuspecting ordinary citizen who, if he gave a mandate for anything at the last general election, gave it for a continuance of government in this country by anybody other than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I am not going to digress on the niceties of the busted flush or on the manner in which they were acquired, but I want to state emphatically what I know to be true, and what the vast majority of the Irish people now realise is true, that we have a penal imposition put on the people of the country in this Finance Bill by a minority Government.  I say deliberately and assertively by a minority Government. We, unfortunately, as a nation have to pay the penalty of having foisted back on this country as a Government people who have long outworn their usefulness and have long gone past the stage of giving any real service to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance comes into this House and, with his usual pert utterances, with usual playful, kittenish and adroit phrases, describes the inter-Party Government as a Party on a spree and as a Party of uninhibted spending.  I postulate again specifically the question which I put when the General Resolution on the Budget was under discussion: Can the Minister for Finance, can any member of his Government, can any member of the extremely mute back benchers of his <Col N="1764" /> Party tell me that there is anything improper or wrong about the assertion that it is the duty of any Irish Government, no matter what Government it may be, to invest to the maximum possible extent that it can the resources of its own people in our own country for the benefit of the country?  I want to ask the Minister for Finance in a pointed way: Can he describe to me why something that is regarded as being non-fallacious in normal business should become a fallacy in national business?</P>
    <P>We had in this country a very large system of building societies.  Under that system we encouraged the people to become the owners of their own houses on the basis of a limited deposit and of amortising the debt by the repayment of interest in capital over a period of 25 or 30 years.  That system enabled the occupiers to meet their commitments and, in due course, to become the owners of their houses at the end of the period of the loan. By means of that combination of sinking fund and interest repayments, the houses become theirs without any attachment of debt.  What initially might have seemed to be a wall of debt being built up, on the last payment being made becomes the occupier's clear, untrammelled property.</P>
    <P>Apply the same principle to an investment of a national character, where the benefits are spread over a period far in excess of the period laid down for repayment.  Whether it is the provision of a large regional sanatorium, long-term development in forestry, improvement of the quality of the land, what is wrong with the economic theory of treating the sum so invested in a project that will endure for the continued benefit of the people in the same way as we treat the purchase of a house by a private individual?  There is nothing wrong in it.  Everybody in the House knows that.  When we talk about capital investment increasing the national debt, the Minister for Finance is being patently dishonest, because, at the close of the period over which the loan and sinking fund are repayable, there is no debt, but there is left a salient and positive feature either in bricks and mortar or <Col N="1765" /> in the improvement of the land, the value of which to our people will be untold.  This is what was glibly and without due responsibility termed by the present Government when in opposition as putting the country in pawn.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong or improper about an Irish Government facing a situation in which there is a serious deflationary tendency, using all the resources at hand to cushion the people by an improved standard of living and a better way of life against any rude shocks that may arise from that sudden deflationary tendency.</P>
    <P>There is the kernel of difference and when the heat and abuse and the clash of personality are taken out of this discussion we come down to an analysis of the basic economic theory.  I assert in a positive way that it is the duty of this country, even though we may be criticised for pledging the credit of posterity, to cushion the people against the shock of the day.  Posterity, whose credit we are pledging, will be given the enduring benefit of that capital investment. I cannot see any reason why, in those circumstances, the load of cost and the burden of repayment should not be spread over those who will get positive benefits from the investment.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the complete intemperance and the ill-considered judgment of an Opposition, which never believed in their wildest dreams that they would be the Government again in any reasonable space of time, have driven them back into a situation where, for conservatism of thought and effort, they would outrival the early Victorians.</P>
    <P>Countries are advancing.  Nations are becoming more and more conscious of their general responsibility to the citizens.  Where a situation threatens a country, where there is rising emigration, rising unemployment, disruption of the normal standard of life, it is the positive and bounden duty of a Government to seize time by the forelock and to ensure that it uses the national credits and resources to cushion the unfortunate people against that devastating and trade-destroying wave.</P>
    <P>We have to analyse to-day the question as to what solution the Budget <Col N="1766" /> brings to our problems.  I say positively that, far from being a solution, it will add immeasurably to our difficulties. What is the effect of penal taxes?  What is the effect of increasing the price of bread, butter, tea and sugar?  In what way will that encourage increased production in agriculture or industry?  How does the Minister for Finance, with all his gymnastic capabilities, conceive that an Irish people earning less, taxed more, their larder raided to maintain services, will be able to produce more and, as the <i>pièce de resistance,</i> save an extra 10 per cent. of what is left?</P>
    <P>Why not face stark reality?  Why not face the issue as the ordinary man in the street sees it?  Why give utterance to grandiose cross-talk as to external disinvestment and internal reinvestment, balance of payments or any other balance, when the crucial matter that faces us is the reaction of the man in the street, the ordinary worker, the small farmer, the ordinary middle-wage group to a situation in which the Government, with savage intensity, demands an extra price for bread, butter, tea and sugar and, in addition, imposes a varying degree of penal taxes?</P>
    <P>It certainly will be a reaction that could not be described as being conducive to monumental effort.  Where is the encouragement of the will to work? Where is the encouragement of the urge to increase production when some of our major agricultural problems remain unresolved, when industry in fact is damped down and when factories are closing and going on part time.  You can kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  You can overburden a willing people and the real basis of my quarrel with the Government on this Budget is that that is what they are doing.  They budgeted to get a certain sum of money.  Any Deputy, Government or otherwise, has only to walk from this House into his constituency to see the damage they have done, to see a people once geared up for a productive effort and a country expanding and urgently anxious to expand further, hit a body blow and staggering in uncertainty as to its future, but in the certainty of the incompetence and unnecessary <Col N="1767" /> harshness of the profligate Government which has been foisted upon them not by the votes of the people but for reasons of the political survival of certain individuals.</P>
    <P>The issue is clear&mdash;whether it is the duty of a Government, instead of crushing people at their whim and caprice, to use every resource they have to help these people over whatever difficulties may lie ahead, because, fundamentally and in the final analysis, the problem of production and the problem of development come back to the individual citizens.  What incentive to increased production, to increased efficiency at home, is the continued flight from the land and the continued overloading of the emigrant ship with boys and girls, going now in numbers greater than ever went before, to seek the necessaries of life elsewhere? What solution is that of our problem? Remember that the cumulative effect of this Budget has not yet been felt in all its naked reality, but already Deputies opposite, as well as Deputies here, are being pressed for references and for help in expediting&mdash;what?  The flight of some young girl or boy out of this country.  It is a tragedy for all of us that they go, because, once gone, it is not easy to get them back and our fundamental problem is bound up with the manpower and womanpower which we can put into production, be it agricultural or industrial.</P>
    <P>The issue here is simple.  This Budget has been attacked in a constructive way by the Leader of the Opposition.  He has alleged something of which there has been no coherent repudiation.  He has alleged that it deliberately conceals a budgetary arrangement for a surplus, to enable the Government to get by direct taxation the money necessary to keep our capital projects afloat.  That is dishonesty to which I hate to see any Government being a party.  I would much prefer to see a return of the onetime courage and progressiveness of Fianna Fáil as a young Party, to see them men enough to say: &ldquo;We were wrong on the capital-issue; we were wrong on the question of capital investment at home, and we admit it.  We <Col N="1768" /> will not bludgeon our people, but will you give us your support and help us in getting the savings of the Irish people for the purpose of development at home?&rdquo; You would have got it from us without any restraint, and we could have saved the people these penal impositions, the real devastating, effects of which have yet to come.</P>
    <P>I look back and can see vividly the faces of each different Fianna Fáil Deputy as there was unfolded the drastic story of the new taxation, and I can see in those countenances shock, frustration and abhorrence.  They know as well as we know that this is something the Irish people do not want, and something which took them infinitely more by surprise than it took us, because we had known of the cavorting of the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance with the Chancellor of the Tory Government.  We were able to read into the change in the tone of their speeches that the pattern had been cut for them.  It was only for them to fill in the details.</P>
    <P>We now know that they have been guilty of the incomprehensible sin of framing a Budget for Ireland, a creditor country with tremendous potentiality, on the same basis as that of one of the greatest debtor nations in the world, embroiled and entangled as it is in tremendous defensive commitments.  In this country, none of these considerations obtrudes itself, and, as I said before, it is an extraordinary thing to see the wheel turn its full circle and to find that the people, who once condemned us as an Empire Party, as an over-conservative Party, outstripping us completely and dissipating completely for all time that illusion by their own solid proof of devotion to Foster Place and Thread-needle Street that must be very touching when they relate it to the continuous struggles of generations to wrest the country from their thrall. Sad, indeed, is it that a freedom so dearly won and so hazardously and frantically guarded can be destroyed by an indecent, filthy bargain, of which even the details cannot be disclosed to this House&mdash;an indecent union between a Tory Chancellor and a sans bowler hat, sans spats, sans umbrella Deputy Seán MacEntee, <Col N="1769" /> Minister for Finance, who might indeed be a ghoulish reincarnation of his Tory friend.</P>
    <P>We come into this House arguing desperately and seriously for the survival of our own people, throwing down the challenge that is on the lips of every person throughout the length and breadth of this country&mdash;a challenge that meets the Fianna Fáil Party constantly on the retreat&mdash;that in a House, where a minority Government rules at the whim and caprice of Independents, they can go back to all their Ministers and ask them for a verdict.  That is the cause of the indecent retreat and the reluctance that has now become apparent even in connection with by-elections.  You know full well that the people do not consider this Government to have any real policy or any constructive, progressive theory for the development of Ireland for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>On the Budget Resolution we had the wonderful, extraordinary statement of the Tánaiste that brought my mind back immediately to shades of Marie Antoinette, but a rather ghoulish reincarnation of that spirit in the present Tánaiste, who blatantly said to this House: &ldquo;If butter will be dearer, jam will be cheaper; if bread will be dearer cakes will be cheaper.&rdquo;  That statement came from a responsible Deputy Leader of the Government, when, in this Budget, they were cruelly raiding, with deliberate and positive intent, the larder of the working man, the labouring man, the poor, the aged, the widow, the orphan and the old age pensioner to complete the savage intensity of their unnecessary Budget.</P>
    <P>Where is the argument or the logic to support such a case?  We have Deputy Captain Peadar Cowan vociferously applauded and enthusiastically taken to the bosoms of some of the less experienced Fianna Fáil Deputies when he tried to cloak the Government's savagery and stupidity by casting slurs on the bounty of the United States of America.  It serves us ill in this House to treat with contumely what was a magnificent gesture of generosity unparalleled in the history of democratic relationships between sovereign nations.  The rotten, foul part of the <Col N="1770" /> slander is that it was done under the aegis of a gallant captain now with his army disbanded.</P>
    <P>What can this little country, bewildered as it is under the shock and the bludgeoning effect of this Budget, think of a tottering Government with its rather unwholesome props?  I do not wish to digress into personalities in regard to them.  They have their responsibilities to the electorate, but there is one thing sure that they are wedded in a close union with the Government in their determination to avoid going to the people for a verdict.  One thing emerges from this discussion and that is that this Government, with all the intensity that is in their power and with all the bargaining powers that are at their disposal, is going to avoid at all costs the verdict of the people because fear welds Deputies Dr. Browne, Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, Cogan, Captain Peadar Cowan and each and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Taoiseach down to Deputy P. J. Burke, in an unholy and indecent union.</P>
    <P>I want some responsible spokesman from the Government to tell us what is wrong&mdash;and that quickly&mdash;with the desire of a Government to use the available resources of its own people for improved housing condition, hospitalisation, land, facilities by way of Electricity Supply Board and water schemes for the Irish farmer and the Irish people?  What is wrong with that type of investment, giving as it does employment and improved social conditions to the Irish people?  What is right with your miserable half of 1 per cent. for the £400,000,000 invested in England and loaned to the people of England at a rate far below the rate we can offer to our own people at home?</P>
    <P>Deputy Traynor, the Minister for Defence, came here yesterday to make a defence for the increase in the bank rate of interest.  You are fooling no one, not even yourselves.  That is dictated to you and forced on you by people over whom you have no control. You are aided and abetted, encouraged and helped by the melancholy and doleful Central Bank, who have forced you to say to the Irish people: &ldquo;You <Col N="1771" /> are eating too much; you are living too well; you are dressing too well; you are too happy and we will damp down on that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You should be ashamed of yourselves for denying to a progressive Irish people the right to progress, to develop, to march onwards to greater production, greater stability and the better standard of life which is within the reach and potential of our people with progressive intelligent planning. No, the vicious, tortured spite of people who seek only to discredit, whether right or wrong, the efforts of their predecessors is twisting now in your own very entrails because, whether you like it or not, whether you want it or not, before this year finishes, we will have you back to your masters.  We are very confident, very sure that we will remove for all time the possibility of having foisted upon Irish public life an incubus of disillusioned, tired, over-conservative old men.  Where is the future for this country?  It lies in a very simple hypothesis, it lies in the return to the Government of the country of courage and vision, courage sufficient where the needs of the country demand it to brush away the conservative whispers of caution of the Department of Finance and the extolling of gloom by the Central Bank, the courage to reassert belief in the strength of the Irish people themselves, in their will to progress and in their capacity to make the country produce more and make a better State for us all.  We urge greater production upon the farmers of the country, slashing the prices, as we did of barley; we urge greater production at a time when we are leaving unsolved one of the primary basic problems of our whole agricultural system: the survival or otherwise of our dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Platitudes have been uttered by Ministers, each Minister careful to talk about any Department but his own.  We talk of greater production to the Irish farming community then one of the first impacts of the Budget will be on local charges by way of a tremendous increase in maintenance charges in certain institutions.  We tell <Col N="1772" /> the farmer to produce more while we crush him down a little more.  Where is the sanity of that?  Where is buoyancy of revenue to be found?  It is to be found in encouraging people to do more by getting their willing cooperation, and as they earn more, as their standard of life improves, as the production from each holding becomes greater, then their increased prosperity will give us the opportunity to collect equitably and fairly the taxes necessary to run the State.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill will give effect to the budgetary proposals.  The main portion of the money raised will be used for services, a large portion on the administrative cost of the Civil Service, a very worthy body but, I venture to suggest, a very unwieldy one, one which seems to have the capacity of ever increasing, not only in cost but in size.  May I draw the attention of this Government, as I drew the attention of the last, to the increasing incubus that is on the revenue?  I have no quarrel with the efficiency and capability of the service but I feel that if we ask everybody else to tighten their belts and to make a little more effort we can reduce the administrative cost of the State by getting a little extra from officers in the Civil Service, thereby reducing the necessary intake every year.  It will have to stop somewhere or we will arrive at the grotesque position of being a minority group of people surrounded by a large wall of civil servants.  That is a problem which I feel the service wants tackled because I think that there are many officers who would like more to do and who, having been given more work, would be entitled to a better remuneration.</P>

      <P>If you so rule I will <Col N="1773" /> depart from it.  My observations on the subject are well-nigh complete.</P>
      <P>Is it for spite, is it just because they were not able to conceive and operate the idea, that the Government are making this onslaught on local works, on land rehabilitation schemes, on all schemes which tend to put more money in circulation in rural Ireland and tend to improve the lot of the people who are destined to carry the burden of the work necessary to carry on the State? Is it just stupidity, or is it a combination of incompetence, viciousness and stupidity that damps all of those?</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House ask ourselves what is the really true background of this Budget, and we find a ready answer.  It is not a Budget of necessity.  It is a Budget which, as we have asserted here, and as I reassert specifically, can be reduced by £10,000,000 within ten minutes of our return to office, which, for the sake of the Irish people, I trust will not be long delayed.  The Budget is unnecessary because, we assert positively, there is no necessity for the price of bread, tea or sugar to be increased by one farthing from the 30th June to the 1st July.  If this insipid, spineless little Deputy, who knows not whether to go to the right or to the left, seeks an assurance he can have one from me: With the return of any Party into office other than the incubus that is now in it, the price of bread, tea or sugar will not go up one farthing.  To the hard-pressed trades that this Government have nearly obliterated goes this assurance, the review of taxation will ensure reductions to the extent of making their business again a real one.  Let an assurance go out that we will stop the rising unemployment, consequent on the caprice of a combination of Victorianism, stupidity and spite.</P>

    <P>The time has come for this country to be told, in no uncertain fashion, that we firmly and positively believe that this Budget is a hoax and a fraud. It conceals a tremendous budgeting for a surplus so that, like the great &ldquo;I am&rdquo;, the Government can throw back a sop to their long-suffering and outraged supporters, hoping that it might temporarily allay the cancer <Col N="1774" /> that is eating them all, because slowly and surely, even into the toughest and hardest core of the Government's supporters is permeating the knowledge that they are worthless, stupid and incompetent.  It is fully time that somebody answered our challenge.  We have all got one master in this House&mdash;the ballot-box. Gone is the intimidation and the ugly threat that once was thine.  Now, in the domestic peace and harmony at home, we can try this issue at the bar of public opinion&mdash;the bar of all our masters.  We can try it without any difficulty.  The cost of Presidential elections, by-elections and other types of elections can all be wiped out by a throw now for a general election, and then, &ldquo;Good night, Fianna Fail&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot of talk from the Government Benches attacking the previous Government for the debts they left behind.  I have heard no Deputy telling the House that a Supplementary Budget was brought in by Deputy Aiken when Minister for Finance, thereby increasing taxation.  There was no Marshall Aid and no debts left behind.  Fianna Fáil held office for 16 years and, by bringing in a Supplementary Budget in 1948, a general election took place which had the effect of putting them out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like when I hear the younger Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches who are new to this House attacking men like Deputy Costello and Deputy Dillon, who have had years of experience in this House and who have given facts and figures. The Leader of the Fine Gael Party made a statement to the effect that the present Government were over-budgeting to the extent of £10,000,000. I am certain that a man in his profession would not make such a statement in an Irish Parliament if he were not sure of his facts.  As a worker, and living in a community of poor people, I can say that we are very much afraid at the moment of what the future will bring after the 1st July, when there will be a higher cost of living than ever before operated in this country.  There will be increasing <Col N="1775" /> unemployment in rural areas due to the cutting down of the Marshall Aid money which was developing the land of the farmers in my county and in other counties and giving sound employment.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in this House during the discussion on the Finance Bill in 1948, said in Volume 111, column 856 of the Official Reports of the 10th June, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You budgeted for £5,000,000 more than we had.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. McGilligan: And you would have put on £10,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, Deputy McGilligan's statement was true.  £10,000,000 has been put on.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, was terribly annoyed because there was a small increase in the price of petrol in 1948.  He stated in Volume 111, column 916 of the Official Reports of 10th June, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Perhaps I do, but then I have suffered in a good cause....  I would prefer, if I might be allowed without interruption, to discuss the merits of this tax.  I have said it is a regressive tax and I have said it is an oppressive tax.  It is a tax which falls most heavily on the people least able to bear it.  It is a tax which the man with the Rolls Royce will not notice very much.  He has already to pay, perhaps, £120 or £150 to put his car on the road. He can well afford to buy petrol, but it is a different thing in the case of the struggling farmer and country doctor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was what the Minister said, as Deputy MacEntee, in 1948, and he came into this House a couple of weeks ago with a Budget containing a proposal to increase the price of petrol by 4d. Therefore, the agricultural community, who have resorted to tractors instead of horses, find they have to pay 4d. per gallon extra on their petrol.  The Minister was asked in a parliamentary question in this House a fortnight ago, if he would give any concession in this regard, and he said that he would not. <Col N="1776" /> When in opposition, in 1948, he was talking about the increased tax on petrol, but he now comes into this House and puts a burden on the people such as they have never had to bear before.</P>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question in this House about the subsidy for the flour millers.  I understand they are getting a subsidy of £7,000,000, £8,000,000 or £9,000,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the subsidy does not go to the flour millers but to Grain Importers (Éire) Limited.  Who are they?  Deputy Dr. Esmonde, my colleague from Wexford, asked a parliamentary question about the personnel. The reply he got was that the people controlling the flour millers were Grain Importers (Éire) Limited.  Why should we withdraw the subsidy to keep down the price?  Why should we do it?  The Fianna Fáil Government who held office in this House for 16 years are subsidising the catering establishment in this House which is charging high prices all the time.  Five hundred pounds a year.</P>

      <P>This is a subsidy that is not cut down.  Surely these people in the restaurant should be able to do without that subsidy.  Another post which ought to be abolished is that of President, if we want to be honest with the people and save the tax payer needless expense.  We should also abandon this highfalutin practice of sending Ministers away, thus costing us dollars. I see that the Taoiseach announced yesterday that there are more representatives going away.  Apart from that, Fianna Fáil are trying to keep the good graces of Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll so that he will vote with Fianna Fáil; he was doubtful on the night of the vote on the Budget and he did not vote at all.  All this is going on while the people are struggling to live.  Many of them cannot get employment and are going to Britain in droves.  I have never seen so many people queueing at the labour exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last three and a half years there were parts of County Wexford <Col N="1777" /> where there was not a man unemployed but to-day, as a member of Wexford County Council, I see deputations coming into that county council seeking employment.  This is due to the fact that the Marshall Aid money which was granted to this country to give employment and to develop the land of Ireland has been reduced from £60,000 to £30,000. Deputy Allen, of course, said there was not a dollar left in the till when his Party took office; we know at the moment that there is £30,000 worth of dollars to be expended by the Wexford County Council, but it is only half what we got during the inter-Party Government term of office.</P>
    <P>In spite of all our difficulties, as I say, we are sending Minister away to Strasbourg, which is costing dollars even though there is a great deal of talk about the scarcity of dollars. The people are fed up with this racketeering.  The Twenty-Six Counties is trying to do what the biggest States in the world are doing, sending representatives to all the nations of the world.  This is being done at the taxpayer's expense and at the worker's expense.  After all this, we are faced with the worst Budget that has ever been produced in any country and which is going to further depress the hard-pressed people of the country, the working classes.</P>
    <P>We are told that certain reliefs are being given as regards income-tax. Who are the people who are going to be relieved by the income-tax concessions? It is not the man on the dole; it is not the man on the miserable national health insurance; it is not the thousands of people on home assistance. It is a very sad state of affairs to hear a Government talking like that in view of the miserable plight of many of our people.  The hardest job in public life at the moment is visiting assistance officers in the area and going from him to the county manager and to the superintendent assistance officer to put up a case for an unfortunate man or woman to obtain a few shillings from the public authority.  It is absurd to think that 1/6 will compensate old age pensioners for the removal of subsidies.  The ratepayers <Col N="1778" /> in my constituency are giving 6/- a week to blind pensioners along with £1 a week, and here we have a Government which can only give to the old people, the fathers and mothers of 1916 and down along, a miserable 1/6 and tells them it compensates them for the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Anyone who would say that in an Irish Parliament, having been voted in by the people, is not worthy of being elected.  The people sent us in here to look after their interests.  It is disturbing when I hear Deputies from my own constituency, and one Minister, standing up and telling us&mdash;he would not state it in the Bullring in Wexford or in the market square in Enniscorthy or Gorey&mdash;that 1/6 would compensate a person for the cost of living.  I think the members of this Government should compel the Minister to bring back his Budget and let the Irish people dictate its terms instead of putting us on a par with Britain in regard to the price of cigarettes and other commodities, or getting up and saying that they are paying more for the same article in the Six Counties.  There is a big difference in the chances of employment in Britain and those here.  The workers in Britain can afford to pay more for their cigarettes and tobacco because they can work on Sundays if they like and work other overtime. But in this country many people cannot get a week's work.  That makes all the difference.</P>
    <P>The people who stand up in an Assembly like this and make ridiculous statements know that they only appear on the official records of Dáil Éireann, and do not appear in their daily papers.  What they say is kept from the people.  Nevertheless, the Irish people are pondering over the present situation?  But whom do they blame? They blame four Independent Deputies who have no mandate to come in here and vote for Fianna Fáil any more than I had.  They are keeping the present Government in office.  I came here on a strecher to put them out, because I knew that if Fianna Fáil got back into power the penal laws would be enforced again.  Of course Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cogan from Wicklow were <Col N="1779" /> approached the night before to vote Fianna Fáil back into power.  They got a guarantee.  I was lying up there on the stretcher when I heard Deputy Lemass saying that the Dáil would run its full constitutional term.  That was one guarantee the Independents got. Deputy Cogan got another one in regard to the Land Commission or some other commission, because the next day he was in the Dáil looking for grants and loans for farmers. Deputy Cowan is expecting to get a judgeship I suppose to compensate him for his allegiance.  I do not know what Deputy Dr. Browne will get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in connection with the Finance Bill.  Four Independent Deputies are keeping a minority Government in power that the people do not want.  The people find themselves in a sad position to-day with a high cost of living, with an increased Budget, with less employment, growing emigration and a standstill all over the country.  The grants under the Works Act have been cut down on all county councils.  It is interesting to hear now the statements of Deputy MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, and the other Ministers, and then to read the statements back over the years and see what they said when 1d. was put on petrol in 1948.  I wonder do the people outside ever think over the promises that were made during the general election by Fianna Fáil Ministers and Fianna Fáil members.  There was no need to impose this Budget and reduce the food subsidies.  Could they not have gone another way round? There were plenty of other ways of getting revenue without taking the bread, butter, tea and sugar off the people's tables.  In spite of the hardships imposed, however, 1,128 people, namely, the dance hall proprietors, will get away scot-free with the potential revenue of £140,000.  The only excuse that Fianna Fáil Deputies could offer for the removal of the dance tax was that it was too difficult to collect.  That is no excuse.  The dance hall tax should have been retained and that <Col N="1780" /> revenue would have benefited the poorer sections of the people.  It was taken off to suit the dance hall proprietors but it will not mean cheaper dancing for the people who go to the dance halls.  There will be an increase in the admission price.  These are the things that any Deputy is faced with since this Government came into power.</P>
      <P>The rents of houses which people are now going into have gone up.  Probably the next thing we will have is a standstill Order to prevent people from seeking an increase in wages.  That will be the next thing we will be fighting against here in order to satisfy the employing class and stop strikes. Someone said that Fianna Fáil represented the workers.  The Deputies sitting behind the Minister ought to ask him to withdraw the Budget, bring it back to his officials and into the Fianna Fáil Party rooms.  If that is not done, the Whips should be taken off and a free vote allowed.  Fianna Fáil for once should give its members the right to a free vote so that we will see what side they will vote on.  We were allowed a free vote when the inter-Party Government was in office.  Why not have a free vote on this?  That would test it without going to the country. Give the ordinary rank and file Fianna Fáil Deputies a chance to show how they will vote and I will guarantee to the Minister that there will be action by this House.  If they are allowed a free vote, some of them will not vote for the Budget, they will stay at home. That is the best way to decide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Deputies sitting behind the Minister who are not satisfied with the Budget, who are greatly annoyed by it.  The biggest problem they have when they go down the country is to explain why there are these increases in taxation, and that takes some explaning. They will not get away with everything.  Fianna Fáil Deputies should try to explain why the Minister is budgeting for £10,000,000 more than is required, why the price of butter is to be increased by 10d. a lb. and why the price of bread will be increased, when the people were told that they would not be increased.  These are the things the people will ask Fianna <Col N="1781" /> Fáil Deputies when they go before them.</P>
    <P>Although before the election Fianna Fáil Deputies were crying out about the cost of living, since the Fianna Fáil Government came in the cost of living has gone up.  Control has been taken off bread, butter, tea and sugar.  Every item going into a household is increased.  Because there is no control, people are finding that the price of some of these things is cheaper in some shops than in others.  That is a bad policy.  The Government are allowing the people to be fleeced by taking control off.  We all know what goes on when there is no control.  Some time ago the price of coal in different towns was reduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  A number of people were charging £10 a ton for coal when they should be only charging £8. That happened in a few towns, one of them in my own area in Wexford. These people had to reduce the price.</P>
    <P>We are told the children's allowances are to be increased.  They would want to be increased if we are to give the youngsters any milk, as milk is now 5d. a pint and will probably be dearer. Young children must get milk every day in the week.  That was the advice given by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Yet he walks into the Lobby and votes with Fianna Fáil for dearer butter for the youngsters and less bread.  These are the things which the people in the country have to face, and yet we have to listen to Deputies defending this Budget and trying to score points at the expense of the Opposition.  Deputy Dillon put questions to the Minister to-day which he could not answer.  He said he would deal with them when he came to them.  Ministers have stated that Deputy J. A. Costello's statement was untrue when he told them that they were budgeting for £10,000,000 more than was required.</P>
    <P>I wonder what will happen in the City of Dublin when there are thousands of unemployed there?  Will the few shillings increase which he will get by way of dole satisfy the unfortunate man who is put out of his job?  Will that compensate him for taking his work away from him?  The last thing that a working man wants is to queue <Col N="1782" /> up at the labour exchange.  That was the thing that I detested most when I had to do it&mdash;to have to stand in a queue at the labour exchange in order to sign for a few miserable shillings. We are now told that there is to be an increase in the dole and in children's allowances.  What good are these increases when the cost of living is going sky-high?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance when in opposition said that he went out of office a poorer man than when he went into it.  I am sure he will not go out of office poorer man.  He will receive a pension of £500 a year after all the things he has done on the people.  Even if he is defeated in his constituency, he can enjoy a pension of £500 at the expense of the taxpayer and yet he is worrying about the taxpayer.  As reported in column 917, Volume 111 of the Official Reports, he said on the Finance Bill in 1948 when dealing with the petrol tax:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope the position will always continue in this country, since Deputy Collins has raised this matter, that when people have been 15 or 16 years in office they will go out of it, as I have gone out of it, a much poorer man than when I went into it.  This is a tax which falls most heavily upon the people who are least able to bear it.  The struggling businessman, the small haulier trying to keep a lorry or two upon the road, finds this tax oppressive.  Perhaps the large transport undertaking will not find it so oppresive.  The large transport undertaking will certainly be able to pass it on to the customers and it is the customers who will ultimately pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Burke will listen to what the Minister for Finance said in 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The people who live at Crumlin and Kimmage, in working-class houses, built under the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;at which Deputy Collins sneers and gibes&mdash;will find this tax very oppressive because they will have to pay.  When, I due time, bus fares have to be raised, it is those people who will have to pay for this tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> Captain Cowan: They will not be raised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Cowan tell the Minister, Deputy MacEntee, this evening, when he walks into the Lobby to support him, that the bus fares will not be raised?  That is the assurance which Deputy Cowan gave to Deputy MacEntee in 1948.</P>
    <P>The biggest mistake the Taoiseach ever made was to appoint Deputy MacEntee Minister for Finance.  I had occasion recently to look over the Dáil debates for a number of years back, and I could not help noticing that all the present Minister held different ministerial posts in former Governments. They were changed from Local Government to Finance, from Finance to External Affairs, from Education to Lands, from Lands to Education, and so forth.  They have all been changed about because they were failures, and they are not fit to hold posts as Ministers to-day.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the tremendous work done by Deputy MacBride when he was Minister for External Affairs this country might not have got an allocation of £40,000,000 by way of Marshall Aid.  The Fianna Fáil Party were then in opposition and they sneered and they jeered at it.  They said that they would not take that money, and that if they did take it they would give it in fertilisers to the farmers.  They ignored the unemployed and their policy was to give that money to the farmers.  During the three and a half years of inter-Party Government many people who are now unemployed were provided with work because of the money which this country got from the United States by way of Marshall Aid.  Every nation in the world was looking for dollars and Ireland got £40,000,000 to reclaim the land so as to bring about increased production. That money was well spent.  It gave constant employment to many people who to-day are unemployed as a result of Fianna Fáil policy.  It helped to drain our land, to clear our rivers, and so forth.  There is unemployment in rural Ireland now.  Men are roaming the country looking for work.  They are approaching every member of the <Col N="1784" /> county council in an effort to obtain work.  They are going to every housing scheme in the hope of being able to get some kind of a job.  The position is becoming worse.  Tractors have begun to take the place of the horse and have displaced many farm workers who are emigrating to Britain to work for the British farmers.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about the Irish Trade Union Congress statement on the Budget.  Deputies on the Government side of the House tried to score political points in respect of that statement.  They read certain passages from it but they neglected to read other passages in it.  We did not hear anybody on the Government side of the House read out this paragraph which deals with the effects of the Budget:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place it is certain that the Budget proposals in themselves will cause a sharp reduction in living standards.  The prices of essential foodstuffs will rise sharply as from July, bread by 38 per cent., sugar by 63 per cent., butter by 28 per cent., while it is expected that tea will be about doubled in price. Cigarettes have already risen by one-third and beer by from one-fifth to one-third.  Each of these items enters into the budgets of practically all working-class families and together constitute roughly one-quarter of expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cost of everything that goes into the poor man's house is increased under this Budget.  Though the Minister, Deputy MacEntee, chose to quote certain parts of the Trade Union Congress statement he did not quote the above paragraph.  At the last general election the people were led astray by false promises.  They believed the Fianna Fáil speakers who said that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office the cost of living would be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, who is also the Minister for Industry and Commerce, accompanied the Minister for Finance at discussions with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in London. These twó Ministers came back here after these talks, and gave no indication whatsoever to the House of the <Col N="1785" /> trend of these talks.  I remember the headlines in the <i>Sunday Press</i> before the two Irish Ministers left for the talks in London.  We were told that the Minister was going over to talk to Mr. Butler, and that he held trump cards in his hand.  It is not difficult to guess what happened at these discussions. The Irish Ministers were told to do what Mr. Butler told them, and to go back to the Dáil and, with their majority, to put that policy into action. The fact of the matter is that the people in Britain, who had been coming over here for holidays, noticed the difference in the standard of life in this country, and were making unfavourable comments about conditions in their own country.  The tourists who came over here were able to report that drink, tobacco, cigarettes and lots of other things were in plentiful supply here, and could be purchased for much less than the prices prevailing in Britain.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance concluded the reading of his Budget speech he was clapped by the Deputies on his side of the House.  Yes, he was clapped by Deputies who were elected to this House by the poor man's vote&mdash;clapped for announcing an increase in the cost of living.  I wonder what these Deputies will have to say to their constituents after July next when the prices of foodstuffs go up.  I should not like an election until after July and until the people feel the real effect of this Budget.  When the women have to pay 10d. extra for a lb. of butter I hope the shopkeeper will tell them that it is as a result of this Fianna Fáil Budget and I hope that the housewife will not forget the fact that one of the planks of the Fianna Fáil programme was to promise to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We heard an announcement on the Radio last night that, as a result of a shortage of petrol, there will be a tightening up of Aer Lingus flights.  I wonder what will happen if, some evening, we hear an announcement on the Radio to the effect that the Korean peace talks have broken down and that world war has been declared.  What will then be the position of our Irish farmers whose horses have been sent abroad to be canned and who are relying instead on tractors?  What <Col N="1786" /> about the petrol supplies that are so vitally essential for the successful operation of our agricultural industry? What steps has the Minister for Agriculture taken to ensure adequate reserves of petrol and oil against a possible emergency?  There would be utter chaos in this country if, some evening, we were told over the Radio that world war had broken out and that we had no petrol for our tractors. Not alone have our ordinary horses been exported but even the horses which were used to escort the President have been replaced by motor-cycles.</P>
    <P>Those horses consume a considerable amount of the crops which our farmers produce.  Now they have been sacrificed for British made motor bicycles and Russian petrol.</P>
    <P>There is nothing constructive in the Government's policy so far as the future of the country is concerned.  All the restrictions on emigration have been removed and it is no longer necessary to go to a Garda Station or to the United Kingdom Office here in town to seek passports.  We heard a statement from a Fianna Fáil spokesman last night, which was later quoted over the wireless, that there was emigration from this country over 100 years ago but I do not think that there was ever such a volume of emigration as since the present Government came into power.  The country is being drained of its manpower and womanhood. The Taoiseach talks about the restoration of the Irish language at the same time as he is allowing the country to be denuded of its people.  In a short time no one will be left but old &ldquo;crocks&rdquo;.  There is free emigration now and our young people are taking full advantage of it.  I would appeal in all sincerity to Deputies supporting the Minister, who know the country as well as I do, to consider the situation which now confronts our people, a situation which will become much worse when the food subsidies are removed on the 1st July.</P>

      <P>So far as the Central Bank is concerned, the policy would seem to be to dismiss all of the directors.  The Statistical Branch also came in for some correction, but I do not know what will take place there. The banks' policy was also subjected to a good deal of criticism and they were seriously threatened because it was alleged they curtailed credit.  I am certain the present Government did nothing to curtail the credit usually afforded by the banks or gave any indication to the banks as to what they should do.  Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance in the late Government, was not so shy because, when he introduced his last Budget, he warned the banks and warned the people against the volume of credit.  Therefore I take it that the policy of the Opposition would be, if there were by-elections, that the banks should not be allowed to give credit except under special conditions.</P>

      <P>The Parties composing the Opposition are almost unanimous in the view that our sterling assets or our foreign assets should be all brought home and spent&mdash;I do not know how.  We got Marshall Aid here and, up to the present at any rate, the result of those spendings are not apparent. Opposition Deputies do not say how these foreign assets are to be repatriated and nobody tells us exactly how much of these moneys belong to the banks, to public bodies, to the Government and to private individuals. Do they propose to put before the <Col N="1788" /> people a policy of confiscating these assets belonging to private individuals which represent the savings of these people? Is that part of their policy? If it is, I think it is a new departure. It might bring results, but I think it would be a very dangerous policy to pursue.</P>
      <P>The most important matter about which I should like to hear is the question of the subsidies.  Their removal was severely criticised but not one Deputy on the opposite side told us they were going to restore them.</P>

      <P>I only want to have my mind satisfied.  If the Deputy has to speak yet, perhaps he would get his Party to come to a definite decision on that point.  We heard Deputy O'Leary blaming the four Independents and he seemed to insinuate that at the last election they were part and parcel of the Coalition Government.  They had resigned from the Coalition before there was any sign of an election.</P>

      <P>No particulars are available from which it is possible directly to estimate the total freight on cargoes from Great Britain to this country.  However, the difference between the free-on-board (f.o.b.) value of exports and re-exports from Great Britain and the Six Counties to this country, as given in the British trade and navigation accounts, and the costinsurance-freight (c.i.f.) value of Irish imports consigned from these areas was £3.3 million in 1950, the last year for which relevant particulars are available.  Such a difference should represent the cost of freight and insurance on these imports, but owing to the time-lags which arise and the fact that the particulars are obtained from different sources, it is not possible to state definitely that the figure quoted provides an accurate estimate of these elements.</P>

Since the passing of the Transport Act, 1950, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in regard to the closing of Córas Iompair Éireann branch lines. Before services could be permanently discontinued on any branch line, Córas Iompair Éireann would have to obtain an Order from the Transport Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950. Notice would have to be published, and such objections as may be made by interested parties must be considered by the tribunal.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to whether, and on what conditions, a Northern Ireland old age pension would continue to be paid if the recipient should move to a Dublin address is a matter for the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, Stormont, Belfast.  I am aware, however, that Northern contributory pensions are payable to persons while resident outside the Six Counties, but noncontributory old age pensions are not so payable.  Pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts in force here are not payable while the person concerned is outside the jurisdiction, save in the case of widows whose title is derived under Section 75, as amended, of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, that is, widows who, but for being aged 70 or over, would be entitled to widows' contributory pensions. Under Section 82 of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, it is proposed to enable me to make reciprocal arrangements with the proper authority under any other Government, and for this purpose make adaptations of, and modifications in, the Old Age Pensions Acts.  This provision has been included <Col N="1802" /> in the Bill to enable consideration to be given to the whole position affecting old age pensions of persons going abroad, including cases such as the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a leading article in a Dublin daily newspaper on 8th May, 1952, in which it was stated that the Irish News Agency had submitted to that paper six photographs connected with communistic celebrations in Moscow with a view to publication at the usual rates charged by the agency; and, if so, if he has satisfied himself that it is politic or wise or the function of the Irish News Agency to act as a medium to enable such communistic propaganda to be disseminated in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was drawn to the leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of May 8th to which the Deputy refers.  The photograph of Russian troops in Moscow published by the <i>Independent</i> was one of seven photographs supplied by the Irish News Agency as Irish agent of the United Press-Planet Photograph Service to the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; group of newspapers.</P>
      <P>In its leading article the <i>Independent</i>&mdash;refering to the sixth of these photographs&mdash;says: &ldquo;The sixth, in the words of the Irish News Agency, shows &lsquo;smart Russian troops march past during the great May Day celebrations in Red Square, Moscow'.&rdquo;  The words quoted by the <i>Irish Independent</i> as being words of the Irish News Agency were, as the editorial staff of the <i>Irish Independent</i> well know, not drafted by the Irish News Agency but by the United Press-Planet Service, and accompanied the pictures when issued by the United Press-Planet Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the evening of the 7th May one of the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; group of newspapers, the <i>Evening Herald</i>, published the seventh photograph of the Russian parade, but no reference to it was made in the <i>Independent's</i> leading article of the 8th May.  This seventh <Col N="1803" /> photograph was a picture of giant tanks in the Red Square with huge posters of Stalin and Molotov clearly visible.  The heading in the <i>Evening Herald</i> picture was &ldquo;Russia's Armed Strength on Parade&rdquo;, and the footnote said: &ldquo;The reality of Russia's challenge to the West is amply demonstrated by these huge tanks pictured in Moscow's Red Square during a recent parade.&rdquo;  These words were again, of course, the descriptive words attached to the seventh photograph by the United Press-Planet Service, not the words of the Irish News Agency.  If, as the <i>Independent</i> said in relation to the six photographs to which it referred, &ldquo;every one of them is, in our opinion, Russian propaganda&rdquo;, it is strange that the <i>Independent</i> did not also condemn the <i>Evening Herald</i> for its pro-Russian activities in publishing the United Press-Planet Service photograph on the evening of the 7th.</P>
    <P>Alluding to another one of the United Press-Planet photographs, the <i>Independent</i> says: &ldquo;Another shows vast and enthusiastic crowds carrying giant portraits of Marshal Stalin in Red Square.&rdquo;  I do not allege that the crowds in Red Square carried the giant portraits of Marshal Stalin because they were following the example of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, but within the last couple of years the <i>Independent</i> published pictures of Marshal Stalin with a smiling face; Marshal Stalin drinking a toast in the Kremlin; Marshal Stalin and Molotov at the Kremlin; Marshal Stalin at dinner; and at least three other pictures of the same gentleman, not to speak of photographs of his right-hand men, M. Litvinov, Gromyko and Maisky.  Indeed, the <i>Independent</i> was so keen on publishing this form of what it now calls Russian propaganda that in 1950 it ordered direct from the United Press-Planet and published another photograph of massed units of the Red Army parading through the Red Square.</P>
    <P>The Irish News Agency, as the Dáil is only too keenly aware, is not a money-making proposition, but one of the activities upon which it does make a profit is the circulation of photographs as agent of the United Press-Planet <Col N="1804" /> Service.  This service is a very well-known and reputable American news-photograph service.  The photograph service is the only one of the United Press-Planet activities for which the Irish News Agency acts as agent here.  Their news service is distributed from their own bureau in Dublin, the manager of which is the son of a T.D. of this House, the brother of another, and the brother of a Senator.  It will be news to these members of the Oireachtas that they are harbouring the chief of an American-Communist, pro-Russian cell.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he not consider that the Irish News Agency should use some circumspection in the type of propaganda which it circulates?

For many years prior to 1st June, 1949, the farm improvement scheme operated throughout the whole country.  The grant provisions of that scheme were similar <Col N="1818" /> in part to those of that section of the land project which provides for cases where the farmer carries out the work himself with the aid of a grant.  The land project, as a whole, is a further development of the farm improvements and earlier schemes.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I was trying to extract some information from the Opposition Parties as to what their policy was and I think I would be wise to rely, to a large extent at any rate, on the Labour Party, because the Labour Party has the balance of power.  I was rather interested in Deputy Davin's statements here, which, I take it, if they ever become a Government, will represent the policy of the Coalition Government.  He had a desperate horror that a Mr. Butler, who belongs to the British Government, had dominated, and, in fact, constructed this Budget.  Later on, he was doubtful about that and said that it was the banks did it.  He will have to amend his statement a little and tell us exactly whether it was the banks or Mr. Butler.  Another very interesting part of their policy was announced by Deputy Mac Fheórais who seems to have developed a violent horror about ladies in mink coats.  I take it they may be prepared for a heavy tax on mink coats.</P>

      <P>There is some sense in the view of Deputy Mac Fheórais. We had also statements about people driving in high-powered cars.  There is nothing wrong in that, either, nor do I think it would be fair to hammer a big tax on people who attend race meetings, because as long as I can remember&mdash;I do not go to many now&mdash;the best sportsmen we had were people belonging to the Labour Party.  I hope that argument will also be amended and that they will not tax people going to race meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very unfair to impose such a tax.  We have, therefore, an idea of what the policy of the Coalition Party is at the moment, but to get their real policy, we shall have to wait until they are elected.  If they are returned in a majority, they will proceed to tell the people what their policy is.  From a political point of view, that is a very sensible arrangement&mdash;persuade the people to elect you and leave it then to the people elected to state what the policy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words as to what was the general cause of this disruption. Deputy McGilligan noticed during his period&mdash;early in 1951&mdash;that agricultural production had fallen so low that we were unable to pay for what we bought.  To many who, through propaganda and other means, believed agriculture was booming that seemed a big shock.  Quite a lot of people who were not connected with agriculture believed that.  I and every one of us heard members of the Labour Party saying that the farmers drove in motor cars and that they were extremely prosperous.  At the same time, on the figures returned, it was shown that the output of agriculture had seriously dropped as against the output of agricultural production in Britain, which had rapidly increased.  Therefore, <Col N="1848" /> we were unable to pay for what we purchased and that was due almost entirely to the failure of the agricultural policy that was pursued by what was known as the Coalition Government. If the Coalition Government were returned to power I would advise the Labour Party to take a bigger share in agricultural policy.  They then might be able to amend matters.  I am not going to delay the House much longer.  I think that agricultural policy is one of the principal items.</P>
    <P>It was really the failure of the late Government to encourage dairying that caused the immense drop in cows in-calf and in heifers in-calf.  That fact will put us to a lot of trouble now because we will not have the stock. Live stock, upon which we depend most, have decreased in numbers.  It will be the business of the present Government and the Minister for Finance to see that live stock is in creased.  It is no use telling the people that imports have not to be paid for. They must be paid for by exports. There is no use saying that we will have private people's money, foreign money, or what are known as foreign assets.  We have a few million pounds in post office savings and a couple of million pounds left by the banks, but there is no use saying that we can pay our debts with those.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made by all political Parties to see that production is increased.  It is no use trying to deceive the people that somebody will invent a new monetary system.  I have been a long time listening to that kind of talk and I have seen nothing come of it yet.  If we are sensible we should drop that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us try it in the meantime but suppose we did not agree with it I wonder where would it lead us to?  To a large extent the system of savings, which is the capitalistic system, has been abused.  These foreign assets are entirely our savings and if we spent those the loss would be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clann na Poblachta, I think, were very keen about bringing back these foreign assets.  If they preach that <Col N="1849" /> policy during any election or during the forthcoming by-election I hope they will tell us how it is going to be done and how they are going to commandeer private people's property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it amounts to.  &ldquo;Repatriation&rdquo; is the word used in regard to the redemption of foreign assets.  I could not put any other construction on the word &ldquo;repatriation&rdquo; except compulsion.  The people who invested that money abroad invested it voluntarily.  They got a better investment there than anywhere else.  It was the best possible investment that they could make.  If those assets are brought back&mdash;there are only £125,000,000 left&mdash;I would like to know how that money is going to be invested here.</P>

      <P>That type of talk is no use having regard to the education which the people got here on modern finance, balance of trade, etc., during the last six or seven months.  They are all well up to-day and the Opposition should know that there is no chance of fooling them again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on this Bill last Tuesday the Minister stated, as reported in the <i>Irish Press,</i> that the Taoiseach and the inter-Party Government went to the President and advised him to dissolve the Dáil because the then Government could not debate the Budget and could not meet the Dáil on that Budget.  Now just picture what he tries <Col N="1850" /> to portray, that the Taoiseach said to the members of the House: &ldquo;Boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could he not have prefaced it by saying: &ldquo;Boys, gentlemen or pals&rdquo; or something like that? Let me tell the story as you would like to tell it and you can tell it afterwards as you would like me to tell it.  He said we could not stand this and we were faced with the responsibility of having on our hands £26,000,000 and £6,000,000 of the Marshall Aid moneys unspent and we were in such a position that we were not able to spend it, that we were afraid to spend it, that we were in such a condition that we had not the courage to spend it and that the only thing we could do was to get out and leave it to the Minister for Finance in a Fianna Fáil Government to undertake the task.  One never heard such a story before and when the Minister, as a responsible Minister, attempts to get that over here&mdash;I presume he intends to put it over at the cross-roads&mdash;he has a very poor estimation of the public's intelligence or that of the Deputies in this House.</P>
      <P>When the Dáil was dissolved, we had a balanced Budget.  We had £26,000,000 of Marshall Aid untouched.  We had all this at the time he says we ran away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not, nor do the interruptions the Minister makes.  I am dealing with the Minister's assertion in this House that we had the Dáil dissolved because we were in financial difficulties, our difficulties being that we had in our hands, to spend in the interest of the State, £26,000,000 Marshall loan and £6,000,000 Marshall grant.  Of course, it was absolutely incorrect and as fantastic a story as ever the Minister for Finance, either as Deputy or as Minister, tried to put over on the House or on the country.  We know that in 12 months the Government has spent the £26,000,000 but they charge us with creating an unbalanced trade situation.  When you ask them, however, in what way our trading was wrong they are vague, not particular. Looking at the trade returns as published, even this month, you find that the present Administration is importing the identical consumer goods imported by the previous Government. Why, if that is wrong?  Why, if this is the Government's plan to stop it? Where is the operation order to carry that plan out?  Apparently there is no intention whatever to do it.  The Minister tells us in his Second Reading speech that every proposal of the Dáil was considered and rejected for what he described as sound practical reasons&mdash;quoting from the same day's <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> Is it not a wonder that he did not tell us some of the things he examined and some of the reasons for rejecting them?  What were the proposals worthy of consideration?  What were the proposals he rejected for sound practical reasons?  The balance of payments is still against us.  Our adverse trade balance for February was £9,653,611. As far as has been indicated that trend still continues.  The things purchased are maize, oranges, raisins, sultanas, unrefined sugar, and so on.  As we have a good deal of foodstuffs in the country, such as potatoes that cannot be sold, if the Government had restricted even some of these purchases we would have to admit that they meant what they said but, instead, they are going gallantly on.  The net result is that they expect to reduce the adverse balance by making the people unable to purchase goods outside. By the Budget, by taxation, by reducing the purchasing power of the people they will reduce these imports.</P>
    <P>It is a significant fact that during the three seasons we were in office the agricultural yield per acre was higher than at any time in the last 15 years. As much was produced from less acres as was produced when you had a fantastic number of acres giving very low production.  The reason is that there was better husbandry and more fertilisers. Farmers could handle the smaller acreage, and the method of allowing the farmer to proceed as he thought best was bound to give the better results.</P>
    <P>The Government expect to get revenue but I am beginning to doubt that it is possible for the Minister to get the amount he has budgeted for because of the recession in trade all over the country.  It is widespread in every phase of business activity.  The draper, the merchant, the grocer and the chemist, all, I am reliably informed, find that there is a very heavy recession and the takings have fallen considerably in every business house all over the country.  If that is so, the Minister will not secure the amount he has budgeted for.  On the other hand, he budgets for at least £10,000,000 more than he requires&mdash;I am perfectly satisfied on that score.  Estimates are <Col N="1853" /> included for sums which, it is clear, he will not spend.  Of course, the Tánaiste did clearly admit that there could be an error of 5 or 10 per cent. in the calculation.</P>
    <P>Five per cent. of £138,000,000 is a very substantial sum and 10 per cent. a much greater sum, but assuming that it was the lesser figure, that even gives you a very high sum for overestimation. Looking through the Army Vote&mdash;I am not going to deal with that except in passing; whatever I have to say on it I will say on the Vote itself&mdash; I note that the sum allotted or asked for for warlike stores is more than can possibly be expended in the year, and when you examine it you will see that last year, although the money was spent, we have not got the material yet.  We have made a payment in advance, and we are hoping that we will get it.  I know the difficulties and I appreciate the fact that every effort must be made to get the most modern and best equipment that we can get. I do appeal to the Government to make sure that they do not waste our money upon obsolete or second-hand material for the defence of our country. Whatever we get, they should see that it is the very best and the most modern.</P>
    <P>Again, I feel that, instead of expanding the standing Army, if we gave greater incentive to the F.C.A. we could extend and develop that force and make it a very effective force in case of an emergency.  I am satisfied that £100,000 or £200,000 spent upon them or if a further grant were made to them, that it would do much to keep them on a firmer basis and ensure that they would be ready if required.  It may be argued that there is a large number of them ineffective.  I do not accept that view.  As long as they are in the country or as long as they are on the roll, and that they turn up even occasionally on parade, they are still effective.  In the old Volunteer days we did have a very great paper strength, and if the headquarters officer came down on inspection, it is true that he might not find a very great number on parade.  But when the testing-time came every person on the list was available for active <Col N="1854" /> service and did give whatever service was required.  I feel that the F.C.A. would also be capable of lending to the nation the same service as their predecessors in the Volunteer days did.</P>
    <P>In regard to the restriction of credit the Government disclaims all responsibility. I cannot accept that because no banking system is going to restrict credit contrary to the wishes of the Government of the country.  If they are restricting credit contrary to the wishes of the Government then I assert that the responsibility is on the Government to see to it that that system or that principle of theirs is changed and that credit is made available. I do not want to go over the ground that I covered here on the Budget debate, but I do assert that, where the Government did want and does want a certain type of work done by farmers or business people, the banks did stop and restricted credit to undo the essential work that the Government wants the country to do. That is sabotaging the Government plan of more production.  If the Government admits that then they are passing over the Government of the country to this set of people who have no responsibility to the nation.</P>
    <P>As I say, the restriction of credit in every section of the community is very serious, and the result is that unemployment is bound to increase.  Hardship of various types will be imposed upon our people, and when you consider that that is being done without any necessity, it is heartbreaking.  The Government that does it has a lot to answer for both in this world and in the next.  Let us hope that when they face the electorate, they will meet their deserts in this world, thus avoiding, perhaps, what is to come to them in the next.</P>
    <P>Again, the charge was made that the financial situation was bad when they came in.  Everybody realises that in the Budget speech by Mr. McGilligan in 1951 he estimated for a positive amount of money, and set out what he required it for.  His estimate was exceeded by a considerable amount; at the same time the present Minister for Finance says that his Budget was not filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister interrupting, because interruptions of that kind are of no value.  I assert that the Budget situation was quite clear and that a much greater sum than Mr. McGilligan estimated for came into the Treasury from revenue.  It is true that Supplementary Estimates brought in by his successors amounting to £11,000,000 were something that he did not cater for, but some of it was allowed for. Even then, when you consider that a good deal of the £11,000,000 was capital expenditure that should not have been borne out of current revenue, you can see the way the Minister and the Government attempted to discredit and to twist the Budget statement and estimates of his predecessor and then used the parliamentary word, which I hope it is, &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody knowing either Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Costello would know that, when a person uses the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; about either of them, it is only vulgar abuse and that it cannot in any way be attached to either of them.  They are both men of integrity and of ability.  When they say that the facts are so and so, it can be taken that they are the facts, and any attempt at imputing dishonesty to them is like a previous statement by the same Minister about a very prominent and respected person <Col N="1856" /> in this country when he referred to him in a most derogatory way which he had to regret afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not mentioning that, but I would ask the Minister that, in future, he should try to avoid these things and having to withdraw them when it is too late and when the harm is done.  While you do do something by withdrawing it, the spoken word can never be recalled and it is very hard to overtake the word once it is uttered.</P>
      <P>I do not think that there is any point in speaking at length on this matter, except to assert that the policy of the inter-Party Government brought peace and order to the country.  There was financial stability and increased employment every week during which we held office.  Every month since we went out of office the reverse has been the position.  However, if that appeals to the people of the country and to the Fianna Fáil supporters, they are entitled to have it, but I feel that they are foolish and unwise for their own sake and for the sake of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard a very learned friend of mine, who was a Fianna Fáil Deputy, saying on one occasion that, in his opinion the advantages outweighed the disadvantages, but that the people should make up their minds as to whether they accepted that view or not; if they accepted the view that the advantages outweighed the disadvantages they should vote Fianna Fáil; if they did not accept that view they should vote against Fianna Fáil. I appeal to the people now to examine the position in that particular light. If they do so, there can be no doubt whatever but that they will see that the policy of the inter-Party Government was of such advantage to the people and to the country as a whole &mdash;the country which we all love&mdash;that they must reverse the position by ejecting the present Government from office at the first opportunity.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that, before they proceed any further with this Bill, they should submit the matter to the electorate, so that we can get a decision once and for all.  If <Col N="1857" /> the Government continues along the lines it is taking at present, hardship will be imposed on the people, for which they have not voted, and to which they have not given their consent.  I assert that the present Government have not a moral right to do that.  Although they have the legal right, I say to them that it is not fair to their own back benchers to put them in the position of coming in here and having to defend something which they know in their hearts to be wrong, and something which, if they got half a chance, they would reject in the morning.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEoin has been speaking about what Deputy McGilligan estimated for receipts in his Budget, but he did not tell us what were the estimates for expenditure which Deputy McGilligan put into the Book of Estimates and did not provide for.  That is the vital test in this whole matter.  When the Fianna Fáil Government took office it had to introduce Supplementary Estimates amounting to <Col N="1858" /> £11,000,000.  Deputy MacEoin talked about capital expenditure.  Over £3,000,000 of the £11,000,000 provided by Supplementary Estimates was the provision for increases in the pay of the Gardaí, the Civil Service, the Army and so forth.  That was not capital expenditure, and not one penny of it was provided for in the dishonest Budget &mdash;the election Budget&mdash;which Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance introduced in this House.  It is all right talking about the integrity of Deputies as individuals, but Deputies of all Parties can come in here with lawyers' minds and lawyers' briefs under their arms to make the lawyers' case.  We want, in this matter of finance, the honest approach and the national approach.  We have too many lawyers' Governments in Europe since the last war, to the grief of Europe, composed of men without any conscience&mdash;men who threw away the financial and political independence of their countries which find themselves behind the Iron Curtain to-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin talks about the production per statute acre, or per acre of the land under the Coalition Government, and he contrasts it with the same production in the war years.  However, during the war years we were facing all kinds of odds; we had neither fertilisers nor, in many cases, sufficient seed, yet we carried on and supplied the food to our people.  During the Coalition régime after the war the figures did not increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me pause here to deal with this aspect of figures which has been brought up again and again and questioned in the Budget debate.  When I came into this House 25 years ago, Mr. W. T. Cosgrave was then Taoiseach. Again and again I heard from the Fine Gael Benches the boast, and the rightful boast, about the Statistics Department that the State had set up.  When Mr. Hooper died, a glowing tribute was paid to him in the Dáil.  In fact, there have been tributes paid again and again while the Fine Gael Party held office to the statistical department. When Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, took over he, again and again, paid tribute to its accuracy and minute work.  Now, however, overnight the <Col N="1859" /> credentials of these men are being questioned.</P>
    <P>The facts and the figures given by the Revenue Commissioners and by the Department of Finance are questioned by an ex-Minister.  If everything is suspect and everything is questioned in this State, what is going to happen?  I am not trotting up Communism here but dealing with a fact. There is a major State behind the Iron Curtain to-day, which had a number of people who were always questioning one another, and they got rid of one another by a process of liquidation. Is that the sort of doubt we are going to create here?  What progress are we going to make if we are to question the probity and the integrity of men to whom we have been paying tribute for 25 years?  It is a very poor argument indeed if we have to depart from all these things.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the balance of payments and our external assets and there has been play made with figures.  Deputy O'Higgins, Senior, talked as if nobody had a right to deal with figures but the members of the Fine Gael Party.  He spoke as if they, and they alone, are the only people who can talk about these matters.  Any man with practical experience of a county council or urban council knows that two and two make four and not five, that two from three leaves one and not two, and that we are living in a world of realities.</P>
    <P>We know that there has been excessive borrowing for three years, much more than there had been for the previous 26 years.  These people said they had to borrow for the civil war for which they blamed us.  The economic war had to be fought during our time. We had to put through our neutrality, and yet these gay spenders in a period of three years spent more than was spent during the whole of the previous 26 years.  Where will this lead to? There are practical businessmen and farmers on the Opposition Benches.  If they applied these principles in the running of their business or farms, where would they get to?  Is everything to be bought and put on the slate in the running of a farm or a <Col N="1860" /> business?  Is credit to be run up until the happy day of bankruptcy arrives? It is a good principle to pay as you go and limit your indebtedness to your creditors.  That is also a good principle for the running of a state.</P>
    <P>They speak glibly about the unemployment that will be created as a result of this Budget and about the burden on the man who has to live on &ldquo;bread and spread&rdquo;.  Deputy McGilligan was very vocal on that question and talked about the spectacular rise in the cost of living.  In 1947 agricultural wages were £2 10s. per week and at that time there was a cost-of-living base arrived at of 100.  With this increase in the price of food it is in the vicinity now of 125 and the agricultural wage is £3 12s. 6d.  I am not saying whether that wage is sufficient or not, but under the Agricultural-Wages Board they have overtaken the rise in the cost of living.  We heard Deputy Corish talking about the increase in the individual cost of living.  It has been proved that the only commodities that increased are the rationed goods&mdash;the rationed tea, the rationed sugar, etc., and the increases amount to 1/6 per head per week.  Under the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill now going through the House the man who heretofore got a flat rate of 22/6 national health benefit now gets 24/- if he is a single man.  A married man with a wife gets 36/-, and if he has one child he gets 43/-.  The man with two, three or four children gets 50/-.  Supplementary to this there is the increased family allowance.  A man with two children receives £2 3s.; the man with three children £2 12s. 6d., the man with four children £3 0s. 6d., and so on.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to the unemployment insurance benefit. Where heretofore a man got 22/6 he now receives 24/-; if he is a married man he gets 36/-, and if he has one child 43/-.  A man with two, three or four children gets 50/-.  These sums are supplemented up to £3 4s. 6d. for a man with a wife and five children and there is an increase of 4/- for each additional child.  All this sorrow which is expressed about the terrible burden on the backs of those least able to <Col N="1861" /> bear it is so much nonsense.  They are being provided for in this Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I heard a lot from the Fine Gael Benches about increased production. That comes from the Party who, when they got into office, put every big farmer in the Midlands out of production. Their Minister for Agriculture discouraged tillage.  Recently, when the Westmeath County Council brought road wages up to 80/- a week a writer in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> asked the question: How many statute acres of good Meath land under intense cultivation would yield an income of £4 a week for the 52 weeks of the year; that is an income of £208, allowing for annuities and rates and labour costs, etc., and he calculated it would be 20 acres.  There has been a dispute about that.  It has been argued that 20 statute acres of good land will not give a yield under intense cultivation of £208 a year.  Supposing that land was devoted to the feeding of cattle, what chance would there be there?  The more land you devote to cattle feeding the more acres you want.  I am not charging the inter-Party Government with this.  It is a national problem.  But the more you drift into the production of cattle the more you crush out the man who is frugal and happy on a small farm, and the more he is inclined to go into the town and enjoy the amenities there, the cheap, well-ventilated house with sanitary arrangements, and give up the small farm.  The small farm is then absorbed by the big rancher and more and more land goes into the production of grass.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves how long is this to continue?  If we have approximately 380,000 farms and 80 per cent. of them have a valuation of £35 or under, how long will the farmers continue on these farms?  How long will they carry on the fight if they are not encouraged to go in for tillage, if they are not encouraged to produce wheat and beet and the things that count? The majority of our population are living on the land, they rear the biggest families, and we want to keep them there.  Here we have a problem that Fine Gael will not solve.  Fine <Col N="1862" /> Gael close their eyes to that problem. The cattle trade and the big ranchers are the be-all and end-all of Fine Gael policy.</P>
    <P>They had a function in Mullingar recently and some lads went to it because cards were being played.  They listened attentively to an intense criticism of the Budget and said there was a lot in it.  They came out laughing, however, when one gentleman said: &ldquo;If you keep Fianna Fáil there you will have compulsory tillage one of these days.&rdquo;  They said they would swallow the Budget and a lot more along with it sooner than have the ranching policy to which Deputy MacEoin referred when he stated that the land produced more per acre under the inter-Party Government than it did under Fianna Fáil, because these gentlemen with the big farms never carried out their tillage regulations. They outraged God and man.  They ploughed up their acres but put no seed in.  They said that their fields were not fit to produce wheat and beet and they let the small fellow do it. This Budget is designed to help out the small man.  It comes to the relief of the small man I am referring to. Our policy is to help out our tillage in every way and we have no hesitation in recommending it.</P>
    <P>Deputy General MacEoin referred to the restriction of credit.  I wonder what is this restriction of credit.  He also talked about certain shopkeepers whom he knew who could not sell goods.  I know shopkeepers all over the country who have the same labels and the same price tags on clothes they have to sell as they had a year ago despite the fact that there has been a drop from 7/- a lb. to 2/3 a lb. in the price of wool.  It is well known that a Donegal man who saw a suit of clothes in the window of a shop in Derry before Christmas at £12 could go in and buy it now for £5.  If there is no buying here the drapers and other people ought to take a lesson from the North and reduce the price and then there will be buying.  It is not for the want of money but for the purpose of not letting the profiteers away with it that there is a buyers' strike, and &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; to the buyers' strike.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> As I said earlier, we were told not to refer to high finance nor to international finance.  Deputy Morrissey told one of our speakers that international finance was above us all.  Any Deputy who is a member of a county council is aware that there have been big increases in rates.  The rate collector is not met with a smile.  He realises that one of the reasons for the high rates is the fact that the councils have gone ahead for a number of years past with an intensive housing programme and that where that programme was slow during the war it has been speeded up.  In one county the housing rate was increased by as much, I think, as 2/4 in the £.  Anybody who is a member of a county council knows high finance and international finance and all sorts of finance when he is up against that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>When the ordinary man in the street reads about the Budget and notes that when we went out of office a little over £4,000,000 redeemed the State debt, whereas now after an interval of three years it takes over £10,000,000 to do the same job, all the eloquence of Deputy S. Collins will not take away from that fact, and we will see to it that it is brought to the attention of the people of the country.  The Irish people are not fools.  The population of this country consists of only 3,000,000, and whereas formerly it took £1 3s. 4d. per head to pay the sinking fund on the debt it now takes well over £3 per head to meet that bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy General MacEoin spoke about overestimation and over-budgeting. What have we been listening to for the past few days except expressions of regret that there is not enough for land rehabilitation&mdash;that it has been cut down&mdash;that there is not enough for forestry or for operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act?  With reference to the last item I think it is time there was some restriction on the spending of the hard-earned money of the people of this country on certain projects under that Act.  I know of drains not the breadth of this seat here on big ranchers' farms.  Men were employed clearing <Col N="1864" /> these drains although for six months out of the year these drains would not have a drop of water in them.  These drains were cleaned out and that work was done as a present from the State. It was a scandal the way that money was spent in the Midlands.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk about repatriating our external assets.  Deputy Collins mentioned that we have about £400,000,000 external assets.  I ask some inter-Party speaker who may follow me in this debate to tell me the total of our external assets and whether, in fact, we have £400,000,000. Will they tell us how the sum is made up?  Will they accept my statement that it is made up of corporations' investments abroad and individual investments abroad?</P>

      <P>Will they tell us what they propose to do with that money? Certainly they did nothing with it during the time they were in office. Deputy MacBride has wonderful ideas about finance.  When I began my political career, I read Douglas and all those people who write about finance. I was enamoured of it all and enthusiastic about it.  After some years I asked a friend how it was that we could not put their theories into effect. One answer which he gave me was this. Take a man in any State who is earning a particular wage which provides him with a certain standard of living and take another man in another State who is earning the same wage which provides the same standard of living for him, and if the man in one State lays 300 bricks a day and the man in the other State lays 100 bricks a day, then all the Douglas theories in the world will not solve the problem.  That is what we are up against.  We have a policy of <i>laissez faire.</i>  Personally, I should prefer to see half the men of the State on social welfare even on a much greater scale or on a living wage and the other half working and giving a return for their work, because I think that the State would be much better off.  That is a personal opinion. I do not subscribe to the policy of paying a man to remove a stone from one corner of a room to another or for removing a stone from one end of a <Col N="1865" /> yard to another.  It would be far better to give that man a pension and to let real constructive work be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly when the House is in session it is not a place where charity applies.  One statement that struck me in Deputy McGilligan's speech was his assertion that when you cancel certain debts there is less employment in the State.  I cannot see that.  When you increase production of sugar beet, butter, wheat or feeding-stuffs at home, you have an automatic increase in employment all round. Therefore, when you give an incentive to farmers to produce all these commodities, you create local industries and local employment.  Without being aggressive in this matter, I might recall that in 1945, 1946 and 1947, when machinery became available, a number of farmers' sons in my locality acquired tractors, mowing machines and threshing machines.  Living in a small town and being brought up in a centre of small business, I saw many a shilling being turned while that work was going on, but the turn of the shillings has been less since such activity decreased in the small towns. That raises a problem to which Deputies should set their minds.  It is all very well for me in my constituency to see Mullingar, Athlone and Longford increasing in population with every census, their amenities improving, and their housing, their water supplies, their secondary and vocational schools getting better, but at the same time it is a matter for regret that the population of the whole countryside is decreasing, and the sound of the plough and the whirring of the tractor can no longer be heard in many districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, therefore, in connection with this whole problem, that we should budget first of all to maintain stability <Col N="1866" /> and not to destroy the basic value of our currency.  In our own time, we saw the wholesale issues of notes and marks all over Germany to such an extent that at one period one would have to bring a cartload of marks to get a loaf of bread.  I remember that in the interim period, France stabilised the franc, and France went ahead.  The franc had a real base, but then the powers of reaction, the saboteurs, got busy, and you had a whole succession of governments in France.  You had a succession of all sorts of increases in wages and salaries for everybody.  You had a race for these increases between civil servants, gendarmes and everybody else, but the position of the ordinary people in rural France and in the cities of France steadily deteriorated. I am speaking with personal knowledge because I have been there several times, not for a day or a week-end, but for extended visits, during the European war and since, and I can say even though they may have extended social services, the general standard of living in France has decreased, despite their social services.  That has come about owing to the debasing of the currency.</P>
    <P>Does any citizen think that by paying our debts and by being credit-worthy we are going to pull this country down as is being alleged by the Opposition?  That is the charge which has been made against the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party, that because they are trying to make the pound buy a pound's worth, they are leading this country in a wrong direction. I contend, and I believe that any of my constituents will agree with me, that if we take measures now to safeguard the Irish pound, to make it respected abroad in Switzerland and elsewhere&mdash;two years ago you would get more for an Irish pound there than you would get for a British pound&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan held up the Socialist Government in England as a model to follow.  He said that that Government enacted legislation under which they went into the banks, found out who were depositors there and charged everybody taxation on their deposits.  He indicated that he would do likewise.  I hope the Conservative elements who always supported him up to this will take full note of that.

It would be a poor day for this country when you discourage <Col N="1868" /> savings.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the estimated allocations in respect of each of the following classes of benefit: (a) disability benefit; (b) unemployment benefits; (c) widows' pensions and orphans' allowance; (d) marriage benefit, and (e) maternity benefit, of the ordinary rates of contribution in respect of entrants (men and women) into insurance at the age of 16 under the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that the rates of contribution quoted in the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, were not calculated by reference to the actuarial value of the benefits in respect of entrants at the age of 16. They were determined on the principle that roughly two-thirds of the anticipated annual expenditure would be met by insured persons and employers and the weekly flat rate amounts were arrived at by spreading this expenditure over the insured population as a whole.</P>
      <P>The following is an analysis of the ordinary weekly rates of contribution necessary to meet the full benefits:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(1)  Column (11) The figure shown is the expenditure to 31st July, 1950, by Cumann an Arachais Naisiunta ar Shlainte (£89,498), the appropriatepayment under Section 16(2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1950 (£143,333), the sum payable under Section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1950 (£15,000), and the payments to doctors for medical certification (£114,939).</P>
    <P>(2)  Column (15) Cumann an Arachais Naisiunta ar Shlainte was dissolved under the Social Welfare Act, 1950, the functions, assets and liabilities of the Society being transferred to the Minister for Social Welfare on the transfer day i.e. 1st August, 1950.  On this day also the National HealthInsurance Reserve Fund and the Guarantee Fund ceased to exist and all sums standing to the credit of these Funds were carried to the credit of the National Health Insurance Fund.  The figure in column (15) includes, therefore (<i>a</i>) the balances of the Reserve and Guarantee Funds, (<i>b</i>) the value of property formerly held by C.A.N.S. (£96,499) and (<i>c</i>) the investments at cost held by the Minister for Social Welfare on behalfof C.A.N.S. (£2,358,404).  It also includes the value at cost of acquisitions under Section 21 of the Social Welfare Act, 1950 (£416,138).</P>

      <P>As the reply to the Deputy's question is mainly in the form of a tabular statement, I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>STATISTICS for National Health Insurance are compiled on the basis of benefit years (which approximate to calendar years).  Final figures for 1950 and 1951 are not yet available but estimates for those years have been made as follows:&mdash;</P>
