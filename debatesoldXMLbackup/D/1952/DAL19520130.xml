      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that statistics of gross agricultural production are furnished in the Statistical Bulletin on the basis of including only live stock sold or consumed; and, if so, whether he will direct the regular provision of a table of gross agricultural production including reasonable allowance for increase or decrease in the annual numbers of live stock on the land in the year for which the estimate of production is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the explanatory notes to the basic article (<i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin,</i> September, 1938, pp. 131-135) in which the methods of estimation of these statistics were described and as noted in many other official publications, in which the basis of the figures is given (e.g., Irish Statistical Survey, 1949-50 (pr. 536), page 17; Tables of National Income and Expenditure, 1938 and 1944-50 (pr. 350), page six), the statistics of gross agricultural output are based on estimates of sales off farms and of the consumption of Irish agricultural produce <Col N="2" /> in farm households.  They, accordingly, exclude any allowance for the value of the increases (or decreases) in the numbers of live stock on farms or similar capital items.</P>
      <P>Up to and including the agricultural year 1935-36 the estimates prepared included changes in the numbers of live stock valued at end of year prices, but for reasons explained on page 131 of the issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i> referred to above, after consultation with the best authorities, a change was made to the present concept.  As the reasons were given fairly fully in the publication referred to, I do not consider it necessary to repeat them here.  The Central Statistics Office is of the opinion that the present formula is the most suitable and it is not proposed to make any change in the content of the present official figures of gross and net output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the figures for the value at end of year prices of the changes in the numbers of live stock on farms for 1938 and for 1944-49 were given on page six of the Tables of National Income and Expenditure, 1938 and 1944-50.  The corresponding figure for 1950 was plus £1.6 million, and it is <Col N="3" /> proposed to continue to publish this series of estimates so that persons interested can make adjustments in this regard if they so desire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, has his attention been directed to the anachronistic result of this system of estimation? By reference to page six of the Tables of National Income and Expenditure, 1938 and 1944-50, referred to in his reply, he will observe that while there is a substantial reduction in the numbers of live stock in 1946-47, the impact of that reduction by this method of calculation adopted by the Central Statistics Office did not manifest itself until 1948-49 and 1950 and in the years 1948-49 and 1950 there were substantial increases in the number of live stock the impact of which will not make itself felt until 1952-53 and 1954, so that, in fact, the Central Statistics Office estimates of agricultural production have no relation to actual fact as at present drafted.</P>

      <P>The particulars asked for by the Deputy cannot be <Col N="5" /> given, since the Statistics Act 1926 does not permit the disclosure of information in regard to individual concerns, without the prior consent of the concerns in question which has not been obtained in this case.  It can, however, be stated that the returns made under the Census of Industrial Production show that the total production of coal by all mines for the year 1950 amounted to 169,177 tons and that the average number of wage earners employed in the same year was 1,250.  The average price per ton of coal ex-colliery in that year was £3 7s. For the first three quarters of 1951 it is estimated that the output of coal was 127,000 tons and that the average number of wage earners employed was 1,252.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reasons why 23 men who have been employed by Bord na Móna at Tullyard Bog, County Donegal, for the past three years have now been paid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that the number of men employed on the bog at Tullyard, Glenties, County Donegal, during the summer and autumn of 1951 was higher than in the previous year and when the normal harvesting operations by the board terminated it was unavoidable that a number of employees should be laid off.  The board point out, however, that the employment position is little different from what it was about a year ago.  In the week ended 14th December, 1951, after men had been laid off, exactly the same number of men was employed as in the corresponding <Col N="10" /> week in 1950 and in the week ended 11th January, 1952, 33 men were employed as compared with 36 men in the corresponding week of 1951.  I am also informed that there is no work available on the bog for a larger number of men as the maximum number is employed in the development work still to be carried out.  Glenties bog has gone into production and there is little development work remaining to be done. When it becomes necessary to discharge workers they are offered alternative employment on other bogs operated by Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate the location of each coal mine in Éire, the names of the owners, the quantities of coal or anthracite produced each year since 1947, the number of persons employed at each mine and whether it will be possible to expand production in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report a statement giving certain of the particulars required by the Deputy.  It would not, of course, be appropriate to give production and employment figures for individual coal mines.  I am not in a position to assess the productive capacity of these mines.  Production is conditioned by availability of capital, machinery and skilled labour and by the market for the product.  A ready market should be available for all lump coal produced by Irish mines having regard to the present high level of coal prices caused by the necessity to import substantial quantities of coal from the United States of America.  There should also be a demand for slack coal from Irish mines provided it is of good quality.</P>

Since then there has been correspondence with the company and, as a result of their consultations with the stockholders, the directors have now made to the two Governments what is tantamount to an offer for a voluntary sale of the company's undertaking for a sum of £4,500,000.  I have, in consultation with the Minister of Commerce, Belfast, agreed to accept this offer, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that it is their policy to interfere to the minimum extent with the cultivation of arable land consistent with reasonable economy in the construction of electric lines.  In following this policy, the board arrange that as many poles as possible are placed at fences and boundary walls.  I am also informed by the board that it would not be feasible to suspend the building of electric lines in each year between 1st April and 1st October as this would very seriously curtail the progress of the construction programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="28" /> Industry and Commerce if he will permit the traders on Tory Island, County Donegal, to obtain, during the winter months, a three-months' supply of rationed foodstuffs in place of the present monthly supply in order that the islanders may have sufficient supplies of tea, sugar, flour, butter and oil to tide them over periods of protracted storm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that during the winter season there are periods when Tory Island is stormbound and I am also aware that one such period occurred during the present winter from mid-December to the 12th of the present month.  I have had no evidence that on this recent occasion there was a serious shortage of essential supplies which would require the taking of special emergency measures.  Such emergency measures will, however, be taken if ever the necessity for them should arise and whatever assistance may be required will be sought from any authority or institution in a position to provide it.  I am prepared to authorise the wholesale merchants concerned to make advance deliveries of tea, sugar, flour and butter to the traders on Tory Island so that there may be available a reasonable reserve of tea, sugar, flour and butter to ensure the maintenance of rations during periods when the island is isolated from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Oil is not now rationed and no authorisation is required for the acquisition of a reserve supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister states that the fact that this island was isolated for one month was not sufficient to create a crisis.  Would he state what period of time would be sufficient to create a crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that I have no evidence that on this occasion, that is, the period between December last and the 12th of this month, there was a scarcity of these rationed goods on the island, and that against the possibility of such a <Col N="29" /> scarcity I am prepared to arrange for the allocation to traders on the island of reserve stocks.  In the case of nonrationed goods, of course, the traders can arrange that for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the poverty and financial position of the islanders and the shopkeepers there, is it not unfair to ask them to lay in a three-months' stock?  I can assure the Minister that Deputy Breslin and I would not have put down these questions were we not aware of the fact that hardships do exist on the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the urgent need for appointing coast watchers along the Kerry coast and of reorganising and developing the coast life saving service to the highest possible degree of efficiency to ensure as far as possible the safety of the fishermen and the protection of the territorial waters from poaching trawlers; and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During periods of bad weather a watch for vessels in distress is maintained at night at certain selected points around the coast by members of the Coast Life Saving Service.  The general organisation of the service and the question of the points at which the maintenance of watches is required are kept constantly under review to ensure a continued high degree of efficiency.  While it may be possible to effect some improvements in the coast watching arrangements from time to time the expenditure from public funds involved in the establishment of a continuous watch-keeping service around the coast would be prohibitive.  The Deputy's representations will be borne in mind when coast life saving service requirements in County Kerry are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention of poaching by foreign trawlers within the exclusive fishing limits is a matter for the Minister for Defence and is one in which I have no function.  I understand that the Minister for Defence is satisfied that the present machinery for reporting <Col N="30" /> the presence of foreign fishing vessels within the exclusive fishing limits is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension in implying that an annual grant of £25,000 was at any time payable for the training of athletes. There was no annual grant for such purpose.  The Deputy probably has in mind the sum of £25,000, included in the Estimates for 1948-49, to pay a grant towards the cost of providing athletic grounds in the vicinity of Dublin.  Following the change of Government in February, 1948, that Estimate was not moved and no payment was made.</P>
      <P>As the cost of meeting existing services and commitments greatly exceeds the revenue available to finance such services and commitments, I could not undertake, at the present time, to consider making available from the Exchequer an annual grant of £25,000 for the training of athletes.</P>

These were to the effect that a complete and detailed engineering survey of the Maine catchment area will be necessary for the purpose of formulating a comprehensive scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945; that I am not in a position to make a definite statement as to when a survey can be undertaken and a scheme can be prepared and that, in consequence, I cannot say whether the machinery at present in use on the Feale, even if it were suitable for work on the Maine, can be transferred to that area on completion of the Feale scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of priority I have already indicated that it was necessary when the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, came into force, to draw up a provisional programme of work, but that programme was not made public then or since and it is not proposed to publish it now.  No rigid schedule of the order in which drainage schemes will be undertaken has been settled.</P>

      <P>Since 1932 three permanent medical officers have been appointed in Dungloe No. 3 dispensary district which includes the island of Arranmore.  Departmental records show that 26 doctors were appointed as temporary medical officer and <i>locum tenens</i> (the records do not differentiate between the two classes) in the district since 1932, but this figure may not be complete as the local authority is empowered to appoint in a temporary capacity medical practitioners who have previously received the sanction of my Department in respect of employment in other similar posts</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Since the 7th December, 1951, conversations have taken place between representatives of the Government and of the United States Government, and Notes have been exchanged, relating to the coming into operation of the Mutual Security Act of 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Question No. 68, I may say that the Government of the United States took the view that, unless the Irish Government adhered to all the principles and purposes of the Mutual Security Act, it was precluded from giving us assistance under that Act and also from paying, out of unexpended balances of appropriations under the Economic Co-operation Act of 1948, for such technical assistance projects as had been agreed to between our two Governments, but in respect of which <Col N="48" /> no contracts had actually been signed before the 8th January, 1952.</P>
    <P>The Government recalled a notification received from the United States Government in February, 1951, to the effect that unexpended balances under the Economic Co-operation Act would continue to be available until finally expended, but recognised, of course, that the question of giving or withholding aid is, finally, for the United States Government to decide.</P>
    <P>In answer to the first part of Question 66, it is the President of the United States who, according to our reading of the Mutual Security Act, determines what countries qualify or are eligible for free military or free economic assistance under that Act. The Irish Government did not, however, ask for free military aid or for further free economic assistance under the Mutual Security Act but urged that they should be facilitated by the United States Government to purchase supplies of American arms and equipment or the designs and materials for such of those supplies as could be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>In the course of the conversations and correspondence it was pointed out that this country adhered, and still adheres, to the principles and purposes of the Economic Co-operation Act 1948 under which the E.C.A. agreement was signed between our two Governments at Dublin in June, 1948 and by virtue of which aid was heretofore granted.  We pointed out also in relation to the Mutual Security Act that we sought to promote international understanding and goodwill, to maintain world peace and to eliminate causes of international tension.  Indeed, we made it quite clear that it was because we sought these objectives without qualification or reserve that we wished to obtain a peaceful and early ending of the unjust partition of Ireland which not only adversely affects the internal development of the Irish nation but dominates its approach to all questions of external policy.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question last November there is no question of reapplying for membership of U.N.O.  The application was made in 1946, with the unanimous approval of Dáil Éireann, and remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council.</P>
      <P>It is natural that, in view of the delay which has occurred in accepting our application, the question of withdrawing the application should be raised.  However, I do not for the present, at any rate, propose to interfere with the course of events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1951, made on the 29th day of December, 1951, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 5th January, 1952.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1951, which I am asking the House to approve, consists of a number of amendments to the existing Pensions Orders.  A memorandum has been circulated to Deputies, explaining the effect of the various amendments, and I am sure that it will not be necessary for me to go into a further detailed explanation of the provisions of the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important provisions of the Order are Articles 5 to 16, which provide for the Garda a lump sum pension scheme, similar to the pension schemes of civil servants, teachers and officials of local authorities.  Under the existing Orders, the pensions of members of the Garda are assessed at one-sixtieth of annual pay for each year of service.  Each year of service in excess of 20 counts as two for pension purposes, and the maximum pension which may be payable is one equalling two-thirds of annual pay.  No gratuities are payable to members retiring on pension.  Under the new scheme, pensions will be assessed on one-eightieth of annual pay, instead of on one-sixtieth. Each year of service in excess <Col N="57" /> of 20 will still count as two, and the maximum pension will be one half of annual pay.  In addition to his pension, however, a member will receive on retirement a gratuity calculated at one-thirtieth of annual pay for each year of service.  Furthermore, if a member dies after completing a minimum of five years' service, a gratuity of not less than one year's annual pay will be payable to his widow, in addition to the pension which she is entitled to under the existing Orders, and if the member is unmarried, the gratuity will be payable to his legal personal representative.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will apply to all future entrants to the force.  Serving members are given an option to remain under the existing Orders or to apply to come under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Order are not so important.  They are all intended, however, to effect improvements in the pension code.</P>
    <P>There is only one of them to which I wish to draw attention, namely Article 21.  It provides for the grant of pensions in cases where members were dismissed, required to retire as an alternative to dismissal or given an opportunity of resigning following disciplinary charges and it is subsequently proved that at the time of their discharge they were incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity.  This provision, I hope, will cover a few cases about which Deputies have made repeated representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an improvement on existing conditions but that is the best I can say for the Order. The representative body expected much more.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has covered all that should have been covered, in equity.  Take, for instance, the matter of an increase to widows and families of deceased Gardaí. The Minister has not improved that situation very much.  While it is laudable and desirable that the Garda himself should be provided for in his old age, nevertheless, owing to the increased cost of living and the circumstances under which Gardaí operate, a Garda can never make full provision for his wife and family in the event of his death and, as far as I can see, there is no improvement in that respect. I thought that, even if it meant that they would lose something themselves, it would be better to make provision for the dependents of Gardaí.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that matter.</P>
      <P>For a long time the Gardaí have fought a long drawn-out battle for better conditions.  In other countries the conditions of those serving in the police force are much better than here.  This is not the time to raise other matters with regard to the conditions of service or organisation of the Garda Síochána, but I should like to hear from the Minister what improvement, if any, he has made with regard to the widows and orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While this Pensions Order is an improvement on the present superannuation position in respect of the Garda Síochána, it is also of benefit to the State taking the long view, because actuaries will tell you that, with the expansion of the period of expectation of life, actuarially sixtieths for pension purposes are now more valuable than eightieths plus a lump sum.  I have no doubt the Minister has already been advised to that effect by actuaries.  Certainly, the Department of Finance knows it because <Col N="59" /> the information is in their possession. Therefore, while the Gardaí do benefit because of the mechanics of the scheme in relation to their own domestic lives, the State in the long run also benefits, because it is swopping something for something else and what it is getting is a better bargain for the State over a period of years than the existing situation.</P>
      <P>It is because of that fact that I think it was a mistake to spoil this otherwise good Order by some evidence of niggardly administrative approaches to the problem.  The dead-hand of the Department of Finance is all over this Order because I am sure the Minister personally does not approve of some of the restrictions imposed in this Order.  For example, this is a scheme to give to serving officers the benefits of what I might describe as the new pension code; that is the code by which they can get half salary on retirement, plus a lump sum calculated on the basis of forty-five-thirtieths, with a coverage for dependents in the event of death while in the service, instead of a scheme of sixtieths under which they got two-thirds of their salary on retirement with no lump sum and no coverage on death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody with experience of these codes will know that the new one is an improvement on the old one.  But look at what happened and you will see the hand of the Department of Finance in this Order.  Those who are on an extension of service, those who have passed the normal age limit for retirement and are still serving, although members of the Garda Síochána the same as any of the other Gardaí&mdash;there are only 40 concerned out of a force of 6,000 or 7,000&mdash;will not be allowed to opt to go into this scheme; the view of the Department of Finance, apparently, being that they might die quickly and, therefore, a lump sum would have to be paid or, if they did not die, on retirement they would have to be paid a lump sum in addition to the half salary.  There is no addition for them in case they would die quickly and their next-of-kin might get the benefit of the scheme.  Then you have <Col N="60" /> a health test so as to make sure that if they die after a few more years their next-of-kin will not collect from the Department of Justice a lump sum. The Gardaí must pass a health test before they come under the scheme.</P>
    <P>A similar scheme was operated under the Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1909.  Up to 1909, civil servants' pensions were calculated under the 1859 Superannuation Act. Under that Act their pensions were calculated on the basis of one-sixtieth of salary and emoluments for each year of service and after 40 years' service they got a pension of two-thirds, just as the Gardaí are getting to-day, with no lump sum or no coverage for death.  Then a scheme was introduced by which civil servants could get in substance what the Gardaí are now getting.  There was a provision, however, in the 1909 Act, which gave them the new scheme, that they should pass as medically fit before they would be allowed to opt for the 1909 Act provisions and quite a number of them failed to pass the medical test.  The strange part of it was that a number of the people who failed to pass lived five, six or ten years longer than the doctors who disqualified them.</P>

      <P>These people were serving at the time.  Everybody was subjected to a medical test.  A number of people were disqualified, and some of those people disqualified in 1909 were alive until 1940 or 1950&mdash;some of them are alive to-day&mdash;while the doctors who examined them are long since dead.  But they were disqualified under the 1909 Act and, consequently, did not get benefits similar to those it is now proposed to give the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, even at the risk of worrying the Department of Finance, he ought to go back with this Order, fortified by the authority of the Dáil, and tell the Department of Finance that the Dáil regarded it as a piece of shabby trickery. There are not many people involved <Col N="61" /> or many people likely to be involved.  I understand that about 40 or so are on extension.  Why you should debar these, or what hope of gain there is by debarring them, I do not know.  It is a miserable, mean approach to the whole problem to exclude a small number of people.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to the health test.  I do not know why that condition is being insisted upon, because no similar condition was enforced when the national teachers were allowed to change over to a new superannuation scheme.  Here, apparently, there is to be a health test.  I cannot understand why that should be so.  In the case of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society, which I took over from the society and transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, there was a blanket transfer to a new superannuation code.  There were no exclusions or health tests.  The staff came in under a blanket Order without any of the fiddling which is characteristic of this Order.</P>
    <P>There is another matter as to which one wonders what the purpose was. The Gardaí, by the nature of their employment, receive uniforms.  I gather that they do not receive any allowance for uniform in the calculation of pension. That seems to be strange, because there is a well-beaten track in the Civil Service with regard to assessing the value of uniform for pension purposes.  It is done every day in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Allowance is made for the value of uniform in the calculation of pensions. It is true that the allowance is inadequate.  In mental hospitals there is also an allowance made.  The same allowance is made in the prison service. Prison officers are allowed the value of uniform for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>Why are the Gardaí selected for this special treatment?  Why are they being denied what has been granted to other classes of State servants?  Surely they have as good a claim in regard to this matter as the others.  I am sure the Minister will agree with the view I am putting forward.  I do not want to impede the Order, but I think the <Col N="62" /> Minister ought to go back to the Department of Finance, or go to their masters, the Government, and say: &ldquo;This is a shabby business.  We should not do it.  It is spoiling a good Order.&rdquo; The Minister has no sympathy with it and should get a Government Order to make sure that these matters which spoil a good Order are eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of Deputy Norton. My approach to this matter is a good deal similar to his.  I feel that this was something which emerged from the Department of Justice with all the trappings of decency and came back from the Department of Finance in the shabby, miserable condition in which it is now presented to the House.  It stinks of the Department of Finance's rigid cutting to the bone of expenditure. The Garda is a force to which the nation owes a tremendous debt of gratitude.  The people who will be affected adversely by the cheese-paring of this Order are some of those people to whom this country owes the deepest debt of gratitude.  Why the Minister allows the Department of Finance to do this I do not know.</P>
      <P>The Minister can be assured that he will have the unanimous backing of this House in any effort he makes to remove this old bone of contention between the Garda Representative Body and his Department.  It is true that, at the moment, the whole question of the reorganisation of the Garda force and of the Guards is under general review.  Therefore, why does the Minister precipitate this Order into a situation where his Department is dealing with an over-all position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, as Deputy Norton has suggested, some kind of an advance.  I would prefer we were rather tardy about this advance if, by doing so, we were ultimately to achieve a better over-all position.  I am reliably informed and I believe that the Minister does not like this queer stepson of an Order that has been foisted back on him by the Department of Finance. The Garda Representative Body does not like it.  The Minister now finds himself in the position that the House is prepared to accept some instalment, <Col N="63" /> but I would appeal to him that, finding the House in that position, he ought not to rush the Order through.</P>
    <P>I would urge him to reconsider the Order generally.  There are some parts of it that can only be described as cheese-paring, and I do not think the Minister himself has any great sympathy with that kind of action.  I feel that, if he accepts it at all, he is doing so under extreme duress from the Department of Finance.  I would ask him to regard this House as the bulwark between himself and his colleague and the Department of Finance.  I suggest to him that he should make the Order something that will not be odious and that will not create as between himself and the Garda Representative Body a further irritant, a further scab in respect of the complacent relationships that ought to be the ultimate objective of his Department in regard to its general concern and intercourse with the Garda Representative Body.</P>
    <P>This is something that everybody in the House has desired should come about, but why bring it about in a cheap way?  Why not, for the infinitesimal increase in cost that might be involved, give the Order a decent and a clean appearance.  I think that the Minister should take it back and do that.  He has the sympathy of everybody in the House in the position in which he finds himself with the watchdogs of Finance.  The atmosphere of gloom which is being created through the country would remind one of the recent snows and would appear to be gripping this House like the recent frost.  The Minister may have difficulties with the Department of Finance, but I suggest to him that he should look to this side of the House and see the smile that will dispel that artificially Government created gloom.  That will encourage and help him if he wants to take this Order back.  As a decent Minister he should do that.  He is the Minister who is held up to us as being a decent, simple, honest Minister.  I suggest to him that he should take the Order back and bring in one that will be in complete harmony with his own plain decent simple outlook.  If he does <Col N="64" /> that the Order will certainly get the approval of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this Order marks an advance on the existing position. There is one matter that I should like to put before the Minister, and that is in regard to members of the Garda who were forced to retire by reason of having reached the age limit. They had retired prior to the granting of the recent increases in the pay of the Garda.  I think that the number of men in that category would be very small.  Men who retired in 1948 are certainly suffering under disabilities.  I am sure their number must be a limited one, that is to say men who had reached the age of 57 before 1948. They had reached the upper age limit at the time of the formation of the force.  I think that their case deserves special consideration.  They have given lifelong service, and I think we may take it that these were men who were admitted to the Garda Síochána, in many cases, because of their outstanding national service.  In view of the fact that their number is so small, their case is one which the Minister should give special consideration to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of the Order.  I do so, first of all, because it is an attempt to bring the Gardaí into line with every other Government service&mdash;the Civil Service, the prison service, teachers and others who are now operating under the scheme similar to this, and, secondly, because of the fact that this Order was arrived at, in the main, in agreement with the Garda Representative Body, and after consultation with it.  I think it is a good idea that, in the preparation of a scheme of this kind, the people and the organisations mainly concerned should be consulted, and, if possible, agreement sought.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in matters of this kind you will not always get agreement.  The people who are to receive think they should get more, while the people called upon to give think that they should get something less.  I imagine, as long as human nature is what it is, that will always be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 21 of the Order deals with <Col N="65" /> Guards who were dismissed in the past and indicates that their cases may now be reviewed in certain circumstances. I think I can say, without any disrespect to the previous Ministers for Justice, that in the political turmoil of the old days certain people went out of the Guards because of the fact that that political turmoil was on.  It may be a fact that, if the offences which were supposed to have been committed, were examined in the calmer atmosphere of the present time, it would be found that those people were in fact entitled to more than they got, and more than they have at present. I welcome the fact that these cases can be reviewed.  I also believe it is a good thing that there has been an increase in the age limit as regards dependents, in certain circumstances, from 16 to 21, that is in cases where children are attending whole-time educational colleges or schools.  It is also a very good thing, even in the case of a Guard who had served for a short period of five years, that there will be a death grant for widows or dependents. These are the good points of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The other side of the story was put very forcibly by Deputy Norton, that is, in respect of the 40 odd members of the Garda who, under the age limit, are debarred.  These, in the main, were foundation members of the Garda Síochána.  It is a very poor tribute to them, in view of the fact that they were foundation members of this magnificent force, that they should now be penalised.  As Deputy Norton has said, age is no guarantee of health and it would appear as if the Department of Finance has not examined the possibility of some of these people dying at a very early age.  I would point out to the Minister, however, that this would be a non-recurring risk. The Minister, imbued with his own spirit of generosity, should ask the Department of Finance to examine into that aspect of the matter and include everybody.  When the teachers received their superannuation scheme there was no question of any exceptions.</P>
    <P>I think that many Gardaí who have given the best years of their lives to the country could attribute their illhealth <Col N="66" /> to-day to injuries received in the course of their duties, injuries which would now qualify them under this scheme.  I think the Minister will agree with me that it is wrong to penalise any section.  There was no health examination in the case of the teachers.  I think the same treatment should be meted out to the Gardaí.  We owe it to them.  We pay lip-service to them on occasions and admit that they are a magnificent body; they maintain law and order without the use of firearms.  Surely they are entitled to as much as other people have got.</P>
    <P>On the point of emoluments, Deputy Norton instanced the Post Office employees, mental hospital employees and those in the prison service all of whom are given a uniform allowance. The Gardaí have a number of allowances which, if added to their salary, would bring about an improvement in their position under this Order.</P>
    <P>It is stipulated in the Order that a Garda will qualify for the full 18 months' pay after completing 33 years of service.  It is not possible under the Act to reach the full amount and when the Minister is reviewing the Order I would appeal to him to make the gratuity available on the completion of 30 years' service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the widows and dependents of Gardaí it is well known that many of them are suffering severely at the present time because of the increased cost of living.  Even if they are omitted from the scope of this Order, I feel that the Minister may come along at a later date and include them under some new Order in order to give them some increase to compensate them for the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Order and I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to bring it into operation at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>This Order is an improvement on the existing position and for that reason it is to be commended. It is timely, if not in fact overdue.  In some respects it is perhaps niggardly. I think that section of the Gardaí who have served since the formation of the force and who helped to build up the <Col N="67" /> State should benefit to a greater extent.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the Order before it is finally put into operation to ensure that any necessary adjustments will be made and that all sections of the Garda will get an even break.</P>
      <P>Those sections which do not appear to be doing so well under the scheme will inevitably suffer because of the gloomy propaganda in relation to the finances of the State.  I feel that propaganda may be used as an excuse for the manner in which they are being treated.  The scheme falls far short of the demand put forward by the Garda Representative Body.  It might be argued that that body asked for more than they expected to receive. I do not think it was an exaggerated demand; I think it was a reasonable one.  Arbitration would probably have given more fair play.  The principle of arbitration has been acknowledged in many spheres.  I think that machinery should have been used in this instance in order to ensure an impartial decision. I hope some adjustment will be made in the case of the small number of Gardaí who do not appear to be doing so well under the scheme because that number is largely made up of the older Gardaí who played an important part in laying the foundations of the State as we know it to-day.</P>

      <P>I endorse all that has been said.  Is it possible for the Minister to do anything under this Order for the widows and dependents of Gardaí who have died recently?  The pensions allowed are very meagre.  I think the Minister should take a stronger stand in the Department of Finance in order to ensure that justice will be done to these widows and children. I know some cases where the husbands gave 15 and 20 years' service and the widows and dependents of these men now find themselves in very difficult circumstances.  I hope the Minister will do something for these.</P>

      <P>I would support Deputy Hickey in what he has just said.  I know some cases in Cork City where the widows and dependents of <Col N="68" /> these men have a very tough struggle in eking out an existence at the present time on the very meagre pensions they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to endorse the remarks of the previous speakers. I appeal to the Minister to do away with the anomaly that appears to exist in relation to those members of the Gardaí who have served since the establishment of the force and who have done very heroic work under very arduous conditions.  They are at least entitled to the same benefits that the Order will confer on the majority of the Gardaí.  With regard to the widows and dependents, I have had numerous applications from widows asking to have their position ameliorated.  Would the Minister at this stage ensure that the pensions that widows of Gardaí receive will not be assessed for the purposes of the Social Welfare Act? Up to the present their pensions are taken into consideration for that purpose. Of course, in the case of the Gardaí the pensions are non-contributory inasmuch as the Gardaí are not insured under national health.</P>
      <P>I consider that it was the destructive act of Finance which cut through the Minister's Order which I am sure he originally intended to be of benefit to the entire Garda force and not a majority of the force.  Finance had some outlook on this matter that is not comprehensible to the ordinary individual. Finance have a mentality that the other branches of the services do not quite understand.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that his original intention was to include the entire Garda force.  I cannot see why that objectionable feature should have been put into an Order which, taking it at its face value, would have been of certain advantage, although not giving 100 per cent. of what the representative body of the Garda would look for.  They are a reasonable body of men and were dealing with a reasonable Minister who had a high regard for the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's prerogative is in this matter.  Is he entitled at this stage to alter the Order?  If he is, I would ask him first of all to do away with the particular <Col N="69" /> section which does not enable the men to opt.  The Minister has all the privileges attaching to this Order.  As a <i>quid pro quo</i>, the Guards should get something.  I do not see why they should be deprived of opting.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to safeguard the widows and children of Gardaí whose pensions are assessed in connection with non-contributory widow's pensions.  The small amount they would receive would help them to carry out their obligations to their families.  I am sure I am directing my remarks to a Minister who is in sympathy with the force and in sympathy with the widows of members of the force.  If it is within his province to do so, I hope he will go the distance of trying to give these people a better way than they have got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate thing about this Order is that, while the Minister has gone some distance in an attempt to provide a pension scheme for the Garda on the same lines as pensions are provided for State officials and local authority officials generally, he has not gone the whole way.  The speeches from this side of the House have indicated our bewilderment as to why the Minister did not go the full distance.  To me, at any rate, it does not seem to be entirely a matter of finance because my personal opinion is that the amount involved in the changes suggested by Deputy Norton and my other colleagues here would be a fairly reasonable amount and, as has been pointed out, it would be a diminishing sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that for the purpose of assessing the pension the annual rate of pay is to be taken merely as that amount of money which a member of the force received during one year.  I am certain that in assessing the pensions of local authority officials who are in receipt of emoluments, whether they are uniform allowances, rent allowances or any other type of allowances, the emoluments are definitely taken into account.  I am informed to-day that these emoluments are taken into account in assessing the pensions of prison officials and postmen. I would not press strongly that <Col N="70" /> an emolument such as a bicycle allowance should be included for the purpose of assessing pension but I do think that the whole House, even the Minister's Party, would agree that such an emolument as a rent allowance should be included and should be considered when the pension is being assessed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say that while the Minister has come a very big way in trying to provide a pension scheme for the Garda on the same lines as is provided in the case of the Civil Service and local authorities in general, he has denied to the Guards the small but important benefits which these other people enjoy.</P>
    <P>I presume that the Government are trying to establish a standard pension scheme but, again, this particular Order provides for a scheme that is different from the schemes provided in the case of local authorities and the Civil Service.  When the Superannuation Act, 1948, became law in respect of local authority officials, it provided that the then employees of local authorities could opt for the pension scheme that was provided for under the 1925 Act which, generally speaking, meant that the pension would be assessed on sixtieths instead of eightieths and plus the lump sum.</P>
    <P>There was no suggestion nor was there or is there any rumour that any of these local authority officials should have to undergo a health test.  That has been asked for in the case of the Garda and I am at a loss to understand the reason why any practising member of the Garda Síochána should be asked to undergo a health examination so that the Minister for Justice or the Government can determine whether or not he is entitled to this type of pension or that type of pension. It is logical for me to say and for the country to assume that if a Guard had not attained a certain health standard he would not be in the force at all.  Whether this provision is to try to save money or not, I do not know.  The number which that provision of this Order cuts out is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the very important <Col N="71" /> point which, from the point of finance, is a very small one, that the 40 foundation members have not now the option of declaring for the scheme which the Minister has introduced in this particular Order.  No matter from what side of the House we come and no matter with which foot we were digging in 1921, 1922 or 1923, we can all say we have the utmost respect for these foundation members of the Garda Síochána.  I think I am right in saying that some of them are at present driving State cars; I am not making any particularisation at all, but the Minister, myself and ex-Ministers on the Front Bench have had a good idea of the loyalty and sincerity of these 40 odd people.  Perhaps the Minister could promise the House that he would reconsider changing the scheme to an extent that would allow this limited number of men to opt, if they cared to do so, for the new scheme.  I do not think he would be subjected to any sarcastic remarks or ribald criticism if he changed the Order in some respects.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the Minister will not change it, for God, man or the devil.  The sooner we get rid of that attitude here the better.  The Minister, as he listened to us now, is probably not unlike other Ministers who have sat there since 1922: they will not change anything, because the Opposition suggest it.  I am not blaming the Minister for Justice in particular about that, but we should not adopt that attitude when we see sensible suggestions or amendments which we could accept, where there is no big point of principle involved.  On a point of principle one could not expect any man to change.  Here is an Order that could be amended for the general benefit of the Garda Síochána and we merely suggest that the Minister would say to the House that he will reconsider it and make the slight improvements we have suggested.</P>

      <P>I remember that I did make a case in connection with a Pensions Order, too, and I asked my predecessor to do what he could, although I realised the difficulty.  I am not going to put it up to the Minister for Finance to do what has been suggested, as I am a member of the Government and we are all responsible and if we run riot where expenditure is concerned we could never keep within the Estimates at all.  This scheme has been carefully considered and the Garda point of view has been fairly considered.  When I met them, although I agree they were not altogether satisfied, they were reasonably satisfied with what was being done.  As regards what they have got, they are getting better terms than civil servants.  If a civil servant wants a full gratuity&mdash;the one and a half years&mdash;he must have 45 years' service. A Garda can get that at 33.  Is not that a big improvement?  When he serves the first 20 years he has only one year for each of those years, but every year after that counts for two, so he is able to get for 33 years' service what it takes a civil servant 45 years to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that the Civil Servants' widows get no pensions but Garda widows do.  I think that is a big difference.  The ex-Minister, my predecessor, mentioned about widows. Since he made his Order in 1950 increasing by 50 per cent. or thereabouts the pensions to widows, the Garda representatives have made no representations&mdash;I suppose they thought it would be no good to do so&mdash;and so they did not come under this.  When I was asking for something similar previously I would have liked a few people to have <Col N="73" /> got consideration but I found it was not possible.  If you start making things retrospective for a few people, it is open to everyone in the service to claim it.  I accept what the Minister for Finance has done in this matter and I think he met us fairly reasonably.</P>
    <P>In regard to the emoluments not being counted, I agree that is not so in the case of all public servants.  However, that always has been done as far as the Gardaí are concerned and there is nothing new in it.  It was done in regard to the foundation members of the Garda and also in the R.I.C. and the D.M.P.  It is done in the British police for conditions in England and has been done in the R.U.C.  That might not be a good reason but that is the case and there is nothing new in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be time to change but that is the present position. In regard to the 40 who have been left out, I cannot see that they have a very great grievance.  Some of the people who were required to retire when they reached the age of 57 would feel that they had a grievance because those who are in this 40 now were allowed to stay on more than three years over the time. These were required to retire before the new Order was made allowing them to make an extension.  Actually they are getting an extension, over the 50 years, as these 40 have had more than three years' full pay after the others had to retire.  They will get a bigger pension&mdash;two-thirds, not 50 per cent., like those who get a gratuity.</P>
      <P>In regard to cases such as Deputy Norton mentioned, where the doctors were wrong and people lived longer, they will get the benefit and the State will not, as the longer they live the bigger the pension they will get and for a longer time.</P>
      <P>Taking all in all, I think the Order is a good Order.  If I were to withdraw it I would be doing a certain number of Guards a bad service.  There must be a few going out every week and it would affect some of them.</P>

The responsible people are the representative body and none of them spoke in any way like that in which Deputies spoke here.  I do not think they expected this attack that has been made on the Order.  Most of them whom I met have been waiting for it. If it is withdrawn some of them may die before a new one is made.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The existing statutory provisions governing the Defence Forces are contained in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1951, of which the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, is the principal Act.  Although the 1923 Act was intended at the time of its enactment to be retained in force for a short period only, it has, as Deputies are aware, been continued annually ever since, with such amendments as were considered necessary from time to time.  The Constitution of 1937, the establishment of a naval element of the Defence Forces in 1940 and the development of the Defence Forces during the emergency were responsible for most of the amendments. It may be said that the Acts operated successfully, and that the delay in the enactment of permanent legislation had the advantage of affording time to determine the type of organisation best suited to the country's requirements and of enabling use to be made of the experience gained over the years, particularly during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill contains those provisions of the existing Acts which are considered suitable for permanent legislation, but amendments have been made as necessary to effect improvements. The Bill also includes a considerable number of new provisions giving additional powers for defence purposes and affording further safeguards for members of the Defence Forces.  Certain of the provisions enacted during the emergency have been omitted, the intention being to reserve them for emergency legislation if the necessity for such legislation should arise at any time.  The principal omissions are the provisions in relation to the precedence of military traffic on transport undertakings during an emergency; the adaptation of the plant of such undertakings to enable military requirements to be met, and the provisions regarding the restoration of civilian employment at the end of an emergency of members of the Reserve called out on permanent service and <Col N="77" /> personnel commissioned or enlisted for the duration of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, the provisions of which are generally similar to those in existing legislation, relates to the date of its coming into operation; its application to persons subject to military law; the declaration of a state of emergency; active service, and a number of other administrative matters. Many regulations and administrative arrangements consequent on the provisions of the Bill will require to be made before it can come into operation. Accordingly, it may not be possible to bring it into operation immediately upon its enactment.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that a member of the Defence Forces remains subject to military law even though he is, for the time being, outside the State or is on board a ship or aircraft.  As far as absence from the State is concerned, the intention is to cover cases such as those of a member attending a course of instruction abroad or travelling with an equitation team.  Service outside the State in that sense is not a liability, because Chapter III of Part IV confines the service liability of members of the Defence Forces to service within the State unless they are employed on a State ship or a State aircraft.  But even when voluntarily absent from the State, members remain subject to military law.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which provides for the declaration of a state of emergency, is necessary because certain provisions of the Bill&mdash;for example, the power to enlist personnel for the duration of an emergency&mdash;become operative only when the existence of a state of emergency for the purposes of the Act has been declared by the Government.</P>
    <P>In Part II, provision is made for the Council of Defence, which has, up to the present, been provided for in Section 8 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  That section is now being repealed.  The Secretary of the Department of Defence, who has hitherto been secretary to the council, is now being added to its membership. He will continue to be secretary to the council as well.  The purpose of the council is stated to be to aid and <Col N="78" /> counsel the Minister on all matters in relation to the business of the Department on which he may consult it.  As the council's function will thus be an advisory one in relation to him, the Minister will not be a member.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act he was a member and chairman of the council.</P>
    <P>That Act, however, provided for a degree of collective responsibility which never operated in practice.  The council has, in fact, never been anything but an advisory body, and obviously the Minister cannot be a member of a body whose function is to advise himself.  While he will not now be a member, meetings of the council cannot be held unless summoned by him and the meetings will ordinarily be held in his presence and under his actual chairmanship, unless he himself chooses otherwise.</P>
    <P>Part II also provides for the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General and for the three principal military branches of which these officers are the head. Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the maximum continuous period of office in these appointments has been three years.  Experience has shown it to be desirable that this period should be five years and Section 12 now provides accordingly.  It has been the practice for the Minister to delegate to the Chief of Staff certain duties of co-ordination in relation to the business of the three principal military branches.  This is now covered in Section 13.  Existing legislation provides for the appointments of Inspector-General and Judge Advocate-General and provision for these appointments is retained in Sections 14 and 15 of the present Bill.  There has not been an Inspector-General for many years and it is not anticipated that the necessity for one will ordinarily arise.  It has, however, been thought well not to remove the power to make the appointment.  The Judge Advocate-General must be a practising barrister-at-law of at least ten years' standing.</P>
    <P>The raising, maintenance, command and general organisation of the Defence <Col N="79" /> Forces are among the matters dealt with in Part III which, generally, follows the lines of existing legislation. Authority is given to the Government to raise, train, equip, arm, pay and maintain the Defence Forces and for the exercise of the military command. The provisions in relation to command will permit, as at present, of delegation by the Government to the Minister and by the Minister to officers.  The existing organisation of permanent and reserve forces is continued.  Except for the formal inclusion of members of the Army Nursing Service, the constitution of the Permanent Defence Force remains unaltered.  Nurses are at present employed as civilians and are not members of the forces.  Their inclusion now is primarily for the purpose of their protection in wartime under the Geneva Red Cross Convention.  They will not, however, be commissioned or enlisted and, under Section 288, will not be subject to the provisions of this Act except to the extent mentioned in that section.  The existing classes of the Reserve will continue to be maintained, but power is taken for the establishment of new classes by the Minister for Defence, if he thinks fit, and for the abolition of any classes which at any time cease to be effective.</P>
    <P>The absence from existing legislation of specific power to acquire lands for military purposes has at times been found to give rise to difficulties and it will be appreciated that, in certain circumstances, the lack of powers of compulsory acquisition where agreement could not be reached would be a very serious matter.  Power is taken, therefore, in Chapter IV of Part III to acquire land for military purposes either by agreement or compulsorily and to enable the Minister to use any land in his possession for military purposes and for the carrying-out of firing and other practices over any foreshore, sea or tidal water adjoining such lands.  In addition, power is taken for the restriction of obstructions and for the erection and maintenance of apparatus on or in the vicinity of military aerodromes.  Similar powers are given to the Minister for Industry and <Col N="80" /> Commerce by the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to billeting both in peace-time and during a period of emergency are similar to those in existing legislation.  Billeting in peace-time has, of course, never had to be resorted to since the establishment of the State and could arise only in the most unusual circumstances.  As, however, the possibility exists, although only very remotely, the provision is being retained.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the appointment of officers and the enlistment of men and for the conditions of their service.  Generally speaking, the provisions in relation to the appointment, conditions of service, retirement, resignation and dismissal of officers are the same as in existing legislation.  Save in exceptional circumstances, it is the practice to grant commissions to Irish citizens only, and this is now specifically provided for in Section 41.</P>
    <P>Some changes from existing legislation have been made in relation to the enlistment, transfer to the Reserve and discharge of men.  At present, the procedure for recruiting is set out in the Defence Forces Acts and, accordingly, is incapable of amendment, except by statue, to meet changes in circumstances as they occur.  Provision is now being made for the procedure to be governed by regulations.  There are new provisions permitting the transfer of a reservist, with his own consent, from one class of the Reserve to another and for the continuance in service of reservists after 21 years' service.  Other new provisions give power for the retention in service for the entire period of an emergency of a man who otherwise would be due for transfer to the Reserve or to be discharged. The present Acts permit of retention for a maximum period of 12 months only, but it will be appreciated that, as a practical proposition, it may not always be possible to release men during a period of grave emergency. The new provisions will, however, apply only to men enlisted on or after the operative date of the Act.  Personnel serving before that date will retain their existing rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It is also considered necessary that, if an emergency is impending, there should be power to enable &ldquo;key&rdquo; personnel of the Reserve to be called out on permanent service in advance of the general calling-out of the Reserve. Provision is, accordingly, now being made in Section 88, empowering the Minister, when so authorised by the Government, to call out on permanent service a limited number of reservists, not exceeding 1,500, in anticipation of an emergency.  Only men who have agreed in writing may be so called out.</P>
    <P>As in the case of recruiting procedure, to which I have already referred, the circumstances in which the pay of officers and men may be forfeited are specifically prescribed in the existing Acts.  The Acts also specify a number of circumstances in which penal deductions may be made and authorise the Minister, by regulation, to make deductions other than penal deductions. It is now proposed, as a more satisfactory arrangement, that all pay matters should be covered by regulations, but that regulations governing forfeiture of or deductions or stoppages from pay shall be capable of annulment by either House of Oireachtas. The matter is dealt with in Chapter IV of Part IV.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Chapter V of Part IV regarding the disqualifications, exemptions and privileges of members of the Defence Forces are generally similar to or based on existing legislation. Section 103, which deals with membership of political and secret societies, recognises the right of members of the Reserve in ordinary circumstances, to participate in political activities, but enables such activities to be restricted when they are called out on permanent service and when they are thus in the same position as members of the permanent force. Section 104, which is based on Section 142 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and certain Defence Force regulations relating to the same matter, deals with membership of local authorities by members of the permanent force and of the Reserve.  The remaining provisions of this Part of the Bill call for no special comment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Under the provisions of Section 113, dealing with the redress of wrongs, an N.C.O. or man can now have his complaint brought to the notice of the Minister, who is required to inquire into the complaint and give a direction on it.  At present the appeal of an N.C.O. or man need not go further than the Adjutant-General.</P>
    <P>Part V, which deals with discipline, differs in many respects in its form and drafting from the provisions of the existing Acts.  This arises from the fact that the 1923 Act was in essence an Army Act.  While it was possible to apply the disciplinary provisions of that Act to Air Corps personnel, it was found necessary, on the establishment of a Naval Service, to provide specially for certain offences by members of that Service and also to apply, by adaptation of terminology, etc., army law to naval personnel.  A code of military law is now provided which will be common to all members of the Defence Forces, whether they are serving with army, air or naval components but which, at the same time, will permit of distinction being made between offences peculiar to the different services.  A small number of new provisions, mainly in relation to aircraft and military transport, has been introduced prescribing additional matters which will constitute offences.  This portion of the Bill can best be discussed at Committee Stage and I shall not say anything more about it now.</P>
    <P>The procedure for dealing with the investigation of charges against officers and men and for the constitution and jurisdiction of courts-martial is practically the same as in existing legislation. The persons disqualified from acting as members of, or judgeadvocate at, a court-martial will, however, now include officers who, in an advisory capacity, have dealt with the charges or with the evidence or with the conduct of the prosecution.  This provision, which, however, merely embodies what has been the practice for some time past, constitutes a very valuable safeguard for accused persons. The punishments that may be awarded by court-martial have been modified in some respects to bring them into line with civilian law.  New punishments, <Col N="83" /> similar to those applicable in the forces of other States, have been introduced to provide for the dismissal of an officer from his ship and for the forfeiture of seniority in rank.  There is also a new provision enabling a court-martial to hold its proceedings <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>A number of important new provisions is included in the proposals dealing with the action on the findings and sentences of courts-martial.  Under the existing Acts, the Government is the sole confirming authority in the case of death sentence and the Minister is empowered to act as confirming authority in all other cases.  It is now proposed that neither the Government nor the Minister will have any powers of confirmation, because it is considered to be incorrect that they should exercise judicial functions.  Provision is, however, being made that a sentence of death shall not be carried out unless and until it has been approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>The intention here is to ensure that no death sentence will be carried out without the fullest consideration and that the Government will be given an opportunity of recommending the President to exercise his powers to commute a sentence under Article 13 (6) of the Constitution.  Apart from this change, the confirming authorities are the same as at present.  They have, however, an additional power of confirmation inasmuch as they can now substitute a lesser punishment for a sentence of death.  This provision is not considered to be in conflict with the Constitution because a sentence imposed by a court-martial is not valid until it has been confirmed by a confirming authority. Because of the possibility that a confirming authority may, owing to his knowledge of the case or of the personnel involved or for any other reason, feel prejudiced or be held to be prejudiced in his consideration of a finding and sentence of a court-martial, provision is made enabling him to refer the finding and sentence to a superior confirming authority.</P>
    <P>Another new feature has been introduced which will operate in favour of <Col N="84" /> persons who have been sentenced by court-martial and whose sentence has been confirmed.  This is the creation of new authorities to be known as superior authorities who will have power, in cases where a sentence (other than sentence of death) passed by a court-martial has been confirmed, to mitigate or remit the punishment or to substitute a lesser punishment.  A superior authority may also hold up the issue of orders for the committal of a person to prison or detention barracks until he has investigated the case and may suspend the sentence on a person, whether or not committal has taken place.  The superior authorities are to be the Minister, the Adjutant-General and any general or flag officer appointed by the Minister for the purpose.  A further new step for the review of sentences is contained in Section 238 under which provision may be made in rules of procedure for the presentation of petitions by or on behalf of persons sentenced by courts-martial.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks on this portion of the Bill, I think I may say that the various new provisions which I have mentioned, coupled with the safeguards already in operation, constitute very valuable advantages at every stage for accused personnel on trial before courts-martial; for personnel in whose cases findings and sentences are being considered by confirming authorities and for personnel whose sentences have been confirmed. In the last-mentioned type of case, particularly, the new system of superior authorities and the powers conferred on them are most important. Hitherto, there has been no provision for the further revision of sentences, which will now be possible.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains provisions as to offences which may be committed by persons in relation to the Defence Forces and military property generally. Apart from provisions dealing with forgery of discharge certificates, inalienation of identity and other certificates and sketching and trespassing on military fortifications without authority, the provisions of this Part are in accordance with the existing Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Part VII, which relates to military manoeuvres, contains no departure in principle from existing legislation.  The powers of the military and the offences which may be committed by the public are, however, now specifically prescribed.</P>
    <P>Part VIII provides for the making of by-laws in respect of lands used for defence purposes.  Except for the provisions relating to roads crossing or running near such lands, which are continued from the 1949 Act, the provisions in this Part are new.  The powers now being taken are considered necessary, primarily to ensure legal authority for the Minister to control the lands and the foreshore in their neighbourhood with a view to the protection of the public against injury when firing or bombing practices or other exercises are taking place.</P>
    <P>Part IX contains specific provisions for the organisation and control of the Army Nursing Service.  I have already stated in my references to Part III that members of the Army Nursing Service are included in the Permanent Defence Force to secure their protection in war-time under the Geneva Red Cross Convention.  It is not proposed to make the members subject to military law in peace-time, but in order to ensure that it will be possible to do so in the event of their being engaged on active service, power is being taken for the Minister to extend, by Order, the application of the Act to members of the Army Nursing Service.  Any Order made by the Minister will require confirmation by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas before it can come into operation.</P>
    <P>Part X contains the provisions necessary to apply the Act to the personnel of the Defence Forces established under the Temporary Provisions Acts.  This part is intended to secure generally that any member serving, either in the permanent Defence Force or the Reserve, immediately before the operative date of the new Act, will retain, notwithstanding its provisions, certain rights and privileges which he held under the former Acts.</P>
    <P>Part XI contains provisions to secure the necessary adaptation of legislation <Col N="86" /> arising from the repeal of the Temporary Provisions Acts and the enactment of the Defence Bill.  Part XII contains miscellaneous provisions not appropriate to other parts of the Bill. The provisions of this new part are substantially the same as in existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule simply sets out the enactments to be repealed.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule specifies the commissioned Army ranks and naval ranks and the Third Schedule the Army and naval non-commissioned ranks.  Two naval non-commissioned ranks additional to those in the present Acts are proposed, namely, senior chief petty officer and senior petty officer.  These naval ranks would correspond for status and disciplinary purposes to the Army ranks of battalion-quartermaster-sergeant and company-quartermaster-sergeant, respectively. Hitherto there have been no naval ranks corresponding to these Army ranks.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Schedule indicates the principal matters in respect of which the Minister may make general regulations and the Fifth Schedule contains the forms of commission to be issued to an officer.  The Sixth to the Tenth Schedules set out the forms of oath to be taken by officers and men of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the present measure does not differ greatly from that introduced by my predecessor as the Defence Bill, 1949, the Second Reading of which was commenced in May last but which was not concluded owing to the dissolution of the last Dáil.  Most of the amendments since made are of a drafting nature.  I may particularly mention, however, that I have omitted from the present Bill a provision of the 1949 measure which prescribed that a person who had completed his period of office as Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General or Quartermaster-General would not be eligible for re-appointment to the same office within the next 12 months.  I expressed disagreement with that provision for a number of reasons when I spoke on the Second Reading of the <Col N="87" /> 1949 Bill and I have now provided for re-appointment on the termination of a period of appointment if the circumstances should render such a course desirable.</P>
    <P>I hope that the outline of the Bill which I have given, coupled with the particulars furnished in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with it, will have given Deputies a foundation for their consideration of its provisions.  I think that what I said in the House in relation to the 1949 Bill, namely, that it could not be described as a very controversial one, continues to apply to the present Bill.  It is, in fact, a measure which does not involve any big principles.  It is largely concerned with questions of detail which can best be dealt with when it comes to be considered in Committee.</P>
    <P>I might say, for the benefit of Deputies who, perhaps, would not be aware of the fact, that this Defence Bill has already been introduced on no less than three occasions, and that this is a second effort which is being made to have the Bill enacted.  I do not have to tell Deputies who are conversant with the situation, as most Deputies are, of the extreme difficulty entailed in the administration of the Acts, as they are at present, so far as the administrative officers are concerned. The present position is that I might almost describe these Acts as being a matter of shreds and patches. They represent practically every Act passed since 1923.  I think it is a great tribute to the persons concerned with their administration that they have been administered so effectively, so efficiently and so justly, I might say, in view of the fact that their administrators have to be continually referring back from one Act to another. It is, therefore, naturally my hope that this particular attempt will be successful in providing the personnel referred to with a Bill which will co-relate all these Acts and give them something which it will be possible for them to handle more easily, more effectively and more efficiently than the number of Acts they are dealing with at the moment.</P>

      <P>There is just one little change that I notice.  Last year, I described the existing legislation as a &ldquo;patchwork quilt.&rdquo;  The Minister says it is a thing of &ldquo;shreds and patches.&rdquo;  There is not very much of a difference between the two descriptions. Of course the Minister did not refer to one of the points which I made then, and it causes me some concern, and that is that the Second House of the Oireachtas will not in the future have a very great opportunity of reviewing Army administration and Army expenditure generally.  It is true, of course, that this House can exercise that function when the Army Estimate comes before it.  I think, however, it would be desirable if some steps were taken by which the Second House <Col N="89" /> would also have an opportunity of discussing the administration of the forces of the State.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the people in charge of the administration of the Defence Forces for the manner in which they have carried out their duties under this patchwork legislation.  There is, however, one thing which, in my opinion, is worse than the patchwork legislation and that is the patchwork regulations.  The Minister indeed may say that the existing Acts are patchwork. Well, I have had some experience of the regulations and, dear knows, they are nearly as bad.</P>

      <P>I think that the word &ldquo;worse&rdquo; would, in this connection, be a better word to use than the word &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;  I suggest the regulations should also be codified and indexed so that one may be enabled to refer to them quickly and effectively.  Time in the Army, as in anything else, means money.</P>
      <P>There are a few powers under the Bill which disturb me somewhat.  They relate to the acquisition of land.  We all know that during the last emergency a very grave injustice and hardship was inflicted upon a citizen of this State because of the seizure of his farm in the Midlands by the Army. So far no compensation has been paid to him for that grave hardship.  I hope to have some amendments tabled to the Bill on the Committee Stage in an effort to protect the rights of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>Is it not better to lose a farm rather than lose the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but the country is, after all, made up of a number of little farms, and when the State starts taking one it can take all. The difference between Uncle Joe Stalin taking a farm and the Minister for Defence taking another farm is infinitesimal.  Deputy Captain Cowan may think that does not matter, but he should remember that the care that should be exercised in such a case is not always exercised.  In this particular <Col N="90" /> instance there was no question of the country being lost had that particular farm not been taken over.  No danger threatened.  Unfortunately, there will always be some people who, when they get a little power, like to show it and show how they can use it; they do not always in the interests of the State or with the approval of the Government.  When that is done the usual practice is to bring in an indemnifying Act to cover the mistakes that have been made and to make provision for compensation.  But even in that eventuality the Minister for Finance keeps a very stiff finger in the pie.  However, these are matters that can be dealt with more appropriately on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I have never been able to understand the validity of the decision not to commission the nursing services and not to make them part of the Defence Forces in peace as well as in war. These people are in uniform.  They serve in military quarters and with military personnel.  I do not know why they should be treated as civilians in uniform.  There seems to be no reason for it.  Any reasons that have been advanced have failed to satisfy me. It now appears that the Department has not changed its view despite a a change of Government.</P>
      <P>There are some amendments I shall have to put down on the provision dealing with courts-martial.  I think one trial should be sufficient.  If a person is tried before a military court he should not subsequently be brought before a civilian court on the same charge and vice versa.  That, again, is a matter we can deal with more effectively on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Many efforts have been made to introduce this measure.  I welcome it now because it does put the seal upon the permanent establishment of the Defence Forces of the State.  I am very proud of that.  I trust that this codifying measure will be of benefit to all the serving forces.  They deserve well of the State.  They have suffered great hardships from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the young man who joins the Defence Forces will, as a result of this measure, be enabled to play a very important part in the service of his country.  If this is properly <Col N="91" /> administered it will give us excellent citizens.  Its administrators should keep in view the fact that it is their function to train men with a high sense of duty and responsibility and love of their country.  In my time there were lecturers in the Army School of Instruction who lectured upon the moral code as well as upon the military code. I think that should be continued and should form part of the education of recruits and young officers.  It is important that the two branches should be co-related.</P>
    <P>I trust nothing unforeseen will occur to prevent the Minister giving effect to the Bill and I hope it will be welcomed now even by those who spoke against it in the past.  I hope it will become law before this Government dissolves as a lasting memorial to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the provision dealing with the acquisition of land, is the reference there to lands already being used by the Army?  We are paying very dearly for land on which our soldiers are being trained in Fermoy.  In 1938 and again in 1942 members of the Defence Forces played football and hurley on ground for which we were paying £224 a year.  The present Minister, who was then likewise Minister for Defence, was summoned as a trespasser.  The case went through all the courts and the decision was against the Minister.  At that time the Minister stated that hurling and football were part of a soldier's training, but because of some technicality it was proved to the satisfaction of the court that the Minister was a trespasser, and the decision was given against him.</P>
      <P>Whatever land is being used for our Army should be in the possession of the State.  I am anxious to know if this Bill will deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from a reply to a Parliamentary Question that was made not so long ago that there are 2,000 acres of land in the Curragh which is a commonage and that anybody who has an acre of land has a right to use that 2,000 acres for grazing.  There is land outside Cork City, in Ballincollig, where the old barracks was, and I am <Col N="92" /> anxious to know if we have complete ownership of that land.  If not, I hope this Bill will deal effectively with that matter.</P>
    <P>The time has long since arrived when the land that is used for the Army should be in the possession of the State.  I would like to know from the Minister whether or not this Bill deals with that matter.  Is there any reason why the 2,000 acres in the Curragh should not be in the complete ownership of the Government?  At present that land is an eye-sore.  It is like a wilderness, full of furze and rubbish. That land deserves more attention. If this Bill does not cover the idea I have in mind, I suggest that the Government should take complete control and ownership of the lands on which our soldiers are being trained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this further attempt to have what we term a permanent Defence Forces Bill.  This is something that officers in the Army, soldiers and persons concerned with Army administration, have been endeavouring for over 20 years to have. I appreciate that, coming as it does after the emergency, it incorporates provisions and valuable experiences that much enhance its value.  Looking through the Bill, one comes to the conclusion that the military and civil advisers of the Minister have certainly done their best to produce a satisfactory Bill.  There are clauses and sections here and there that give cause for some concern but I think there will be no difficulty in smoothing these matters out on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to this old bogey which was trotted out so often as a defence of the old Temporary Provisions Acts, that it gave Parliament an annual opportunity of discussing the Defence Forces.  That was an ingenious defence made by some hardpressed Minister some years ago when he was being urged to bring in a permanent Bill.  Admitting the necessity for a permanent Bill, he said that, after all, the Temporary Provisions Bill introduced year by year gave a golden opportunity to the Dáil and Seanad to discuss the Army and Army matters.  Of course, that is based on the historical position in Britain, which <Col N="93" /> I need not go into, but with which every Deputy is familiar.  There is no necessity to have an annual discussion on such a Bill from the purely parliamentary point of view.  There is necessity, of course, for discussion on policy and administration, and the opportunities for that are still available.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should join in the tributes that have been paid by the Minister and by Deputy MacEoin to the authorities within the Defence Forces who have been responsible for administration over the years.  Looking at it in a broad, general way, they have done an excellent job of work. Public servants who render such valuable service to the nation should be commended in the House.  It is, perhaps, the only way in which their unselfish national service can be rewarded and I am glad of the opportunity of paying my tribute to them, having been associated as I was personally for many years with men who have risen to the most responsible positions in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin has referred to the regulations which are issued under the powers contained in the Defence Forces Acts and, undoubtedly, over the years they have become rather chaotic although very serious efforts have been made from time to time to codify them and bring them up to date.  Very valuable efforts have been made.  I think it is very likely that when this new Bill becomes law the Defence Force authorities will issue a completely new edition of regulations based on the Act, and also incorporating their own very valuable experience over the years.  It is necessary that that should be done for the benefit of the new officers and young recruits, who are entitled to an opportunity of knowing what military law is.  Military law is really contained in the Act and in the regulations that are made under the Act.  Every young soldier is entitled to feel that he has the Chief of Staff's baton in his knapsack, and he will not be able to feel that unless the regulations under which the Army is administered and run are readily available to him so that he may study them and become familiar with them.  I am quite sure that the Minister, the Defence Council and the <Col N="94" /> responsible Army authorities would agree that it is desirable that that should be done and that it should be done at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to the Defence Council.  I did not intend to deal with that now.  It can be dealt with on the next stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, makes provision again for a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. I suppose, in theory, we have at the moment a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I say that is theoretical.  It is an appointment that is made just to fill a statutory requirement but for the moment, and certainly in peace-time the necessity for a Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to exist.  However, as I say, it is a matter that may be considered. The Minister may consider whether or not it is desirable to make provision in the Council of Defence for an appointment that may not in fact be considered necessary from the general governmental point of view.  At one time the Parliamentary Secretary did fulfil certain functions and had no other appointment except that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence.  The situation has altered in recent years, and there now is no person appointed just to that position alone.  He carries it now, and for the past few years, in addition to another appointment.  I think that aspect might be considered.</P>
      <P>In considering a Defence Forces Bill, we have to consider whether the legislation is sufficient to enable the Government to provide an adequate and satisfactory Defence Force for the State and if there is provision in it for the just enforcement of discipline and for just and fair administration.  In a general way, in fact in more than a general way, this Bill fulfils those requirements.  As I say, there are points that can be dealt with at the next stage but, in a general way, the particular Bill under discussion fulfils all those requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> It will be necessary, however, to bring about some change of idea on what is discipline within the Defence Force itself.  Discipline is generally accepted as that procedure by which persons obey the orders of the people who are their superiors, and necessarily in an army you must have discipline. But it has been my experience that &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; has been used too much to interfere with the private life of the soldier or the young officer outside his actual duty.  That is a matter that we might well consider during the progress of this Bill through the House.  After all, whether an individual is a private soldier or a general, he is a man and is entitled to be treated and respected as a man.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for historical reasons, there has not always been that conception within the Army.  When the Army was first established, we took over officers and men and non-commissioned officers who had been trained by another country, trained in ideas that we did not agree with. Those individuals had a tremendous influence on the Army and that influence has persisted and continued notwithstanding very serious efforts by many people in authority to bring about a change.  I accept it that persons of authority, particularly Ministers for Defence in all Governments at all stages, have endeavoured to bring about the change.  They have not been entirely successful, due to the fact that it is difficult to bring about a change which is something almost in the nature of a revolution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very hard.  I do think that while a soldier is on duty he is bound to obey every lawful order that he gets from his superior officer. That is the basis of discipline; although, in a book I was reading the other day by a very distinguished American General quoting a very distinguished British Field Marshal, the British Field Marshal said that when he got an order he did not agree with he just did not carry it out.  That is what you would call the Nelson-Montgomery <Col N="96" /> approach to discipline.  It is very useful and valuable at times if you are in the right place to be able to disagree with or disobey an order, but in a general way on duty the soldier must obey the order that comes from his superior authority.</P>
      <P>When he is not on duty, there should be no interference with his liberty and he ought not to be subjected to discipline when off duty either in the barracks or camp or outside it.  He should have all the freedom that is possible.  If he wants to dress in any particular way he likes, whether it be in an artistic fashion or otherwise, outside duty hours he should have that freedom.  He should also have considerable freedom of movement without inquiry or obstruction. That can be brought about by continuous persistence by the Minister and the superior authorities that the soldier will have that right.  There are growing up to-day young boys, not only in this country but all over the world, who do not take kindly to the form of discipline that was all right at Waterloo or in subsequent campaigns.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that we should have a full-staffed, full-strength Army, and, unless we are going to use some form of compulsion, young men will not join the Defence Forces unless they have the sort of liberties and freedom that I mentioned guaranteed to them, the freedom to do what they like outside their duty hours.  I was upset very often seeing young soldiers in uniform walking with their girls in O'Connell Street being subjected to interrogation by military police.  It was a humiliating thing done in the presence of their sweethearts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endeavoured for a long time to put an end to that state of affairs.  I do not see it remedied even now, but I hope we will see no more of it once this Bill has passed.  I have known occasions when, if a soldier laughed or enjoyed himself, he was considered to be insulting to some superior officer, and I have known times when young soldiers or officers had to become silent immediately some superior in rank came into the room or the place where they were.  The Minister knows very well that such a state of affairs is <Col N="97" /> all wrong and if he knew of these happenings I have mentioned he would not have tolerated or permitted them. Once these things have grown into an army it takes serious effort on the part of every person concerned to eradicate them.  I mention the matter in the House to-night in the hope and in the belief that all necessary efforts will be taken to remedy it.  We can have discipline in the Army without infringing on the individual rights or liberties of the soldier.</P>
    <P>In the old Act there was a provision whereby officers or soldiers who had a grievance could take steps to redress it.  However, the machinery provided for the redress of grievances was a fake and a fraud.  Never in my experience did it lead to the remedying of even one single grievance.  Most grievances of officers or soldiers arise in connection with matters which do not come within the power or control of the commanding officer&mdash;matters of pay, matters of location, matters of deduction from pay, and so forth.</P>
    <P>At the next stage of this Bill I hope to be able to put down an amendment which I trust the Minister will seriously consider so that effective machinery for the ventilation and the remedying of grievances will be incorporated in the Bill.  I am quite sure that in doing so I will have the support of all Deputies in this House who had actual experience in the Defence Forces and of those other Deputies who had no such experience but who have a sense of justice, and I trust that all Deputies in the House possess such sense of justice.  One of the matters which annoyed officers and, to some extent, soldiers, was deductions from pay which were made on the Order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Deputies were not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Deputies being present</i>,</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some individual, generally a civil servant in the Department of Defence, looking through a file came to the conclusion that some officer or soldier should pay a sum of money for some alleged deficiency, some damage or something of that kind.  A letter was sent out to the <Col N="98" /> individual concerned asking him to give reasons why the Minister should not make an Order deducting a certain amount of money from his pay.  I do not know if the Minister ever saw that letter before it was issued, but theoretically at any rate, when the reply came back it was referred to him with a recommendation that he should make an Order for a deduction in pay, the person concerned not having given sufficient reason why the Minister should not make such Order.</P>
      <P>Although I know that these Orders were not made just as a matter of form and that the Minister did look into them as best he could, the procedure did not lend itself to a fair examination of the position.  I hope that an amendment will be accepted whereby that procedure will be ended and whereby the person concerned will be enabled to make his case to either a committee or a board of officers having some experience of Army administration and who are in a position to say whether there was any neglect on the part of the officer or the soldier concerned.  I feel that every member of the House will agree that there is a necessity for such a safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which causes trouble is the appointment of officers to positions that should be filled by officers holding a higher rank.  The general feeling is that, where such action is taken, the officer should be promoted temporarily to the higher rank, that he should be given the pay of such higher rank, and that his service in that higher rank should count for all purposes towards his service and his pension, and that if he continues for a reasonable time having the responsibilities of the higher rank he should be confirmed in it within a reasonable period of time.  That is important for the reason that if an officer is appointed to fill an appointment higher than that normally carried by his rank he is expected to carry all the responsibilities of such higher rank, including the making good of any loss or any damage that might arise through some matter considered to be his responsibility.  If he has to carry that financial responsibility he should <Col N="99" /> at least be paid for it during the period he holds the responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some officers come into the Army as the result of certain professional qualifications, university degrees or something of that kind.  They are paid additional pay, based on their professional knowledge.  You may have those particular officers in the combatant corps, such as the Engineers or Signals.  There is no reason why these officers cannot attain to the highest rank in the Army.  There is no reason why they cannot, some day, become Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General or Chief of Staff.  If they are promoted outside their corps they immediately lose the additional pay that was based on their professional qualifications.  I think there are grounds here for provision in the Act that would prevent those particular people losing their professional pay on promotion.</P>
    <P>I have, in fact, said more on this stage of the Bill than I intended to say.  I realise that the vital stage of this Bill will be the next stage, when each and every one of us should contribute what he can towards sending to the Army a Bill which will enable them to be more successful and more just in their administration of the Defence Forces and which will give to the Government all the powers the Government needs to deal with any crisis that may arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these matters, almost casually, for the purpose of getting Deputies, and particularly the Minister's advisers, to consider in the meantime, between this and the next stage, the particular points I have made.  Each and every one of us is anxious to make a success of this Bill. As I say, I welcome it.  There is no politics in it.  It is a Bill which gives the House an opportunity of showing itself at its best in passing legislation that is necessary for the welfare of the nation.</P>

      <P>It is true that there is a unanimity of thought among people interested as for the necessity of this Bill and as for a wish for its expeditious passage through the House.  There are many features of the Bill to which I intend to refer in a serious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was amusing to hear Deputy Cowan this evening in a completely different vein to the obstructive, effervescent Deputy Cowan he was on the occasion when a Bill, virtually the same as this, was introduced on Second Stage before the dissolution of the Dáil.  Of course, one has become used to Deputy Cowan's will-o'-the-wisp tactics.  He comes into this <Col N="101" /> House, makes his speech and concludes by describing his speech as something that was virtually casual.  I hope it was because there is one thing certain that he painted a picture of menace by the military police of interference with N.C.O.s and men and with junior officers by senior officers which I, having served in the forces when Deputy Peadar Cowan was exempt, never found.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think that Deputy Cowan, drawing on his constant vivid imagination, is painting a picture that has any reality in fact.  To come into this House and talk in a casual way about the right to laughter, the right to speak even by junior officers being denied them by either military police or by a senior officer walking into the room is something that is ridiculous in the extreme to any of us who had the privilege to serve throughout the emergency in the colours of our Army. I do not think he is doing any service to himself or to the Army by making these casual observations about something on which he is obviously completely misinformed, if informed at all.</P>
    <P>I should hate the Minister to feel that there was growing up within the Army, as described by Deputy Cowan, this queer kind of a tradition.  It is not there.  It never was there and God grant it never will be there.  I have known the Army as a private soldier, as a potential officer and as an officer.  I have known the activities of the military police and of my senior officers.  Deputy Peadar Cowan pays a tribute to administration and control and in the next minute he refers to this other matter.  There could not have been good administration and control&mdash;things which he commends&mdash;if the other system had been allowed to grow up.  Why does he in a casual way try to throw mud where it is not necessary to throw it?</P>
    <P>That particular type of activity not only annoys me but distresses me, because we are dealing with a body of officers, N.C.O.s and men to whom this country owes a signal debt of gratitude. That certainly is not being paid to them by lip-service at one stage of Deputy Cowan's speech and by criticism of a system that does not <Col N="102" /> exist, at the end of his speech.  I am glad I was here to refute, and deliberately refute, the suggestion that is being made by Deputy Peadar Cowan.</P>
    <P>It was made in an ill-judged manner by a person who is not talking from either first hand experience or first hand information of the problem to which he adverts.  Deputy Cowan apparently sees something wrong in the idea of this House, the sovereign House, asking the right to review year after year the activity of the Army. When I spoke before on the Second Stage of this Bill I was subjected to interruption by Deputy Cowan asking why I thought it necessary that there should be some provision within the new Bill whereby this review will take place.  At that stage Deputy Major Vivion de Valera indicated that he too was of my opinion that it is necessary, that distinct from the Estimate for Defence this House should have the right, if it thinks fit, to review and discuss the general facets of the Army&mdash; personnel, enlistment, expansion, reservists and all other facets in general.</P>
    <P>This is a most welcome Bill.  Anybody who has any Army experience will appreciate the necessity for it. You recollect that on being commissioned you were presented with a conglomeration of Acts known as the Defence Force Acts, and an absolute myraid of Orders and amendments to those Acts and you were instructed to file them properly and bring your Acts up to date by sticking them where they were relevant.  You finished up with a Defence Force Act.  You could not wade through the sea of amendments and you could not co-relate an original section with the amended section. In so far as this Bill removes those defects and serves to consolidate and co-relate into one Act the experience of that period it is welcome.</P>
    <P>It has been a very large task for the Army, the civilian personnel attached to it, and the parliamentary draftsman, and I think that the commendation of this House should go to all the persons connected with its background and the background work necessary to bring this legislation before the House.  It is necessary, it is desirable, and I trust that on this occasion, even if a general election is <Col N="103" /> imminent, we will have this Bill passed into law before it takes place.</P>
    <P>I feel, as I indicated previously on defence matters, that with the importance of this Bill, the wide range and scope of its sections, and its actual size, it might be well for the Minister and the House to consider a special committee of the House to deal with the Bill on its Committee Stage so that effective work could be done on it. Going through the sections, there are many amendments which I would contemplate; most of them I trust will be non-controversial, and many of them I hope will be accepted to improve the present Bill.  It was inevitable in a work of such considerable magnitude that there should be certain omissions and errors, and they might well be rectified on the Committee Stage.  It might serve the best interests of the House, and ultimately of the Army, to have the Bill dealt with on the Committee Stage by a Select Committee of the House in a non-controversial manner, which would put the Bill into the best possible shape.  It would leave out questions of controversy and remove politics from the arena when we are discussing the remaining stages of this Defence Bill.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why the Minister is in love with the continuation of the provisions making possible the appointment of an Inspector General of the Forces. Are we contemplating some imperial expansion or numbers of armies that we need an Inspector General?  We have a President who constitutionally is the Commander-in-Chief; we have a Chief of Staff, an Adjutant-General and a Quartermaster-General; we have directors of every individual service in the Army.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister why he retains in permanent legislation a feature that is not necessary.  There has not been an Inspector General for years.  I cannot conceive, and neither apparently can the Minister, a situation in which an Inspector General would be necessary.  Why, therefore, incorporate it as a feature of permanent legislation unless, of course, it is to be regarded as a possible palliative or a place to which <Col N="104" /> some distracted soul removed from high Army office may be retired before his ultimate annihilation.  I think it is a bad thing to have it in the Bill.  It sets out that the Inspector General must be a member of the permanent forces.  That means that it would be conceivable that over the appointed Chief of Staff of the Army or the recognised heads of the other departments, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General, an officer could be precipitated into the position of Inspector General.  It is a bad feature and I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to erase it altogether from permanent legislation.  The chain of control with the President as the constitutional Commander-in-Chief is sufficiently broad and effective to deal with an army of the strength proposed.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the stage of the Bill similar to this one, introduced last May, I adverted very positively to the nursing service.  I was glad to see Deputy General MacEoin subscribe to-day to my view.  I do not see any reason at all why the personnel of the Army Nursing Service should not immediately be put on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>If the Army medical personnel, the doctors, are graded as officers according to their various ranks and if the other personnel are graded as N.C.O.s, sergeants, company-sergeants and quartermaster-sergeants, what is the difficulty about having proper commissioned personnel in the Army Nursing Service, responsible for the maintenance of the discipline of their own unit and answerable, in the final analysis, to the Director of the Army Medical Service, who, in turn, is responsible to the higher authority, whether the Adjutant-General or Chief of Staff?  What is wrong with the personnel of the Army Nursing Service being given the full standing in peace-time that we envisage for them in war? These young women are as conscious and as proud of the uniform they wear as the personnel of any other branch of the Defence Forces, and I should like to know from the Minister if there is any real basic reason why they are not put on such a footing.</P>
    <P>It is a fetish of mine, I admit, but <Col N="105" /> I do not see why, if there is not some insurmountable reason, if we are putting into the Defence Forces as integral parts the naval services, engineering services, medical services, air corps, signals and all the various sections, the nursing corps cannot be incorporated in peace-time as well as in time of emergency as an integral part of the forces, subject to the control of the non-commissioned officers and officers who in the normal way are responsible for discipline.  I have often adverted to the fact that there are enough civilians surrounding the Army in the Department of Defence without having civilians in uniform within the Army.</P>
    <P>I come back again to the issue I raised when a Bill similar to this was introduced by the Government which I then supported.  I want to know if there is any concrete or valid reason why the Secretary of the Department of Defence should be made a member of the Council of Defence.  I asked that question previously and got no satisfaction from the then Minister, General MacEoin.  I asked the question seriously, realising that the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Department are distinct from those which fall on the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General or the Quartermaster-General and that his advice is entirely different from the advice or opinions which should be given by serving personnel.</P>

It may be argued that the present occupant of the post is an ex-general of the forces, but what <Col N="106" /> guarantee have we as to whom a future occupant may be?  What is the necessity to constitute him a member of this council?  I cannot see any.  It may well be that a recommendation from the council will have to go through him to the Minister as administrative head of the Department, but, as I said previously, it is a most unwise thing to have him a member of the council voting and taking decisions with the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory provision for it and no statutory appointment of him as such in any Act previous to this.  What I think is wrong with the Army is that there are too many <i>de facto</i> these and <i>de facto</i> those, and, as I said before, infinitely too many civilians guarding too few soldiers, whether officers, N.C.O.s or men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are features of the Bill which are experimental.  I wonder if the Minister has any cogent reason to offer for seeking, together with an extension of the period of headship of a department of the Army from three to five years, power to extend the period of these appointments beyond five years?  There are very few cases in which it could be conceived that it would be necessary for the occupant of <Col N="107" /> the post of Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General or Quartermaster-General to serve beyond five years.  There was much to be said in favour of the argument that three years was too short a period.  Let us accept the principle that five years is a reasonable period. Any extension beyond five years must inevitably react on the morale of senior personnel in the Army because it must inevitably diminish, if not preclude, their chances of occupancy of such a position before reaching retiring age.</P>
    <P>It is true that, as Deputy Traynor, the Minister adverted to the case of General McKenna, who was Chief of Staff during the emergency, and, like Deputy Traynor, we all pay considerable tribute to the services that officer gave; but I do not think his case can be cited as a reason why any power to extend beyond five years the period of service in such an office should be granted.  I think it is a bad principle to establish and the Minister should be well content to accept the unanimous view of the House that an extension from three to five years is desirable and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Any organisation such as an army is jealous of its privileges and very jealous of its chances of promotion within itself.  I should say, in regard to any senior officer with long service in the Army, that it must be one of the coveted aspirations of his life to finish either as Chief of Staff, as Adjutant-General or as Quartermaster-General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan made reference in his speech&mdash;I thought in an unreal way&mdash; to personnel specially recruited with professional qualifications.  He did not seem to advert to the fact that fundamentally the person recruited with professional qualifications was recruited either to the corps or service because there was special use and need for his professional services in that corps or service.  Whether he is an engineer or a master of science, or whether he has some particular qualification that singles him out for a special corps, the only reason he gets professional pay is that his professional qualifications are necessary in <Col N="108" /> that particular corps or service.  It seems unreasonable to suggest if that man is promoted out of his corps or service into a more responsible senior position in the Army not relevant and not in any way appertaining to his professional qualifications, that he should take his professional pay with him.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Cowan knows the situation.  In the main, most officers recruited in that limited way are recruited within a corps or service in which they can attain, on a basis of professional pay, directorship of that corps, which will bring them up to an army rank of colonel&mdash;and beyond that, only by the grace of God, by appointment to Chief of Staff, can anyone go. Therefore I do not think there is much substance in that spurious argument&mdash; as I suggest it is&mdash;advanced by Deputy Cowan.  It is possible for these people to do command and staff courses and be available for advancement in other branches of the service.  If they take that advancement in a corps or in a service to which their particular professional attainment has no application, they take it deliberately, they take it with open eyes; and I think it would be unfair to other personnel if such people were allowed to carry professional pay or preferential emoluments into that appointment.</P>
    <P>The Minister could listen very seriously to one argument advanced by Deputy Cowan.  It is true that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction generally when a junior officer for a long period carries out the duty and appointment of a senior officer, without either promotion or any emolument commensurate with the job he is tackling.  I think that is unnecessary. Where a man is posted to the position or to a command that normally carries a substantive rank higher than his own, when he has served a reasonable period efficiently in that post and when he is in General Routine Orders posted to that command, there should be no delay in promoting that man to the rank commensurate with his appointment.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it&mdash;if the Minister were to be truthful before this House to-day&mdash; that many of the posts and many of the commands are being held by officers not only one rank but sometimes two below the substantive rank to which their appointment would entitle them.  I am asking the Minister to try to incorporate in this permanent legislation that feature which will ensure that where any officer is posted in General Routine Orders to a command which carries a rank higher than the one he holds, once he has been posted and established in that command immediately should follow his substantive promotion to the rank it carries.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will have to face up to the fact that many ameliorations are necessary within the Army Corps, particularly in relation to reservists and to our new Volunteer Army force, An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil. I had advocated when in government, as I do now in Opposition, these ameliorations.  I do not do so to embarrass the Minister in any way, and I think he appreciates that: I do it in the interest of development of a really strong First Line Reserve and a really strong worthwhile Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil.  Both of these are the paramount desire of the Minister himself and, as I said in the House before and as I repeat on this stage of the Bill, where any help that can be given by me is of any service to the Minister, in any drive to get recruits for any section of the Army, it is willingly and unquestionably forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that when we are dealing with this permanent legislation, now is the opportunity for the Minister to get, once and for all, the minimum standards set.  There is discontent with regard to the First Line Reserve, and there is a large reservoir of people, to whom I adverted before, trained personnel who served throughout the <Col N="110" /> emergency, who with a little amelioration of the condition of the First Line Reserve would be a pool readily available to increase substantially the numbers at present on that Reserve.  I know the Minister wants it, and I say to him that now, when the House is in a kind of unanimous mood about this permanent legislation, is the time to try to set minimum standards that will serve not only as an inducement but as a beacon to all people anxious to enlist either in the First Line Reserve or in An Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary on this stage of the Bill to try to deal specifically with sections.  The Bill has been very wisely broken up into Parts and Chapters.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great effort at correlated cohesion in this Bill and that, when it is ultimately enacted into law, it will be a Bill that will be easy of analysis and easy of reference.  I really feel that the Minister is not getting, nor did his predecessor get, from this House the interest and the help to which he was entitled with regard to this legislation.  Many Deputies are inclined to look at the Bill and, seeing the size of it, to say: &ldquo;There are a few fellows interested in this; I need not bother about it.&rdquo;  I think that is a bad feature, particularly when so many soldiers of the first generation and of the second generation are included in the membership of this House.  The fact that it is in their power from their experience to do something better for the Army is something that they should cherish with a jealous pride and anxiously safeguard, because the Army deserves extremely well not only of this House and of this country but of each individual member of the House, and any contribution we can make towards securing better conditions for the Army and towards improving the terms of this Bill should not be withheld.</P>
    <P>I do feel that there are departures in this Bill, particularly with regard to courts-martial, that need careful analysis.  While the general principle laid down is a move in the right direction, it will be necessary carefully to analyse each section, apropos of <Col N="111" /> offences against military law and of punishment of personnel subject to military law.  The departure envisaged in this Bill of an ultimate final court of appeal, if one might describe it as such, is, I think, fundamentally sound. Once the prerogative of mercy, as outlined by the Minister, is in the final analysis vested in the Government, I think the Minister has taken a wise line in having as a superior authority to the court-martial certain officer personnel of senior ranking who would be able to take a more impartial view of certain offences against the military code than would any Government or any civilian.  That is a feature of the Bill that should commend itself to the House.  All the vicissitudes and the various idiosyncrasies on various matters that can arise amongst personnel, are best judged by Army personnel.</P>
    <P>I think that possibly a serving member of the Army, be he private, N.C.O. or officer, in the ultimate analysis, might get a more rational and reasonable deal from senior officers of the Army than he would from an outside authority not aware of the queer little customs, habits, and maybe evasions that grow up under an army code.  I welcome that departure because I think it will make for fairer administration ultimately of the military law.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister seriously to consider the proposition made by Deputy MacEoin.  In the main, I feel that the experience of Deputies who have attended courts-martial is that a man is seldom, if ever, subjected to both the peril of a court-martial and the peril of a civil trial.  Whether that is due to custom or has statutory authority, I cannot find any statutory authority for it, and I suggest that the Minister should consider incorporating into the military code a provision that where penal action is concerned&mdash;say where the offence to try which the court-martial is held is commensurate with an ordinary civil charge such as larceny, thievery or something of that nature&mdash;the man who is tried by the military authorities should not subsequently be tried by a civil authority, or if he has been tried by the civil <Col N="112" /> authority, he should not subsequently be tried also by the Army authority. This theory of not putting a man in peril twice, while in fact I have no experience of its arising, should be made clear in a statutory way.</P>
    <P>In general, I think this Bill is a really worthwhile measure.  It has many very commendable features, but, before concluding, I should like to refer again to something to which I adverted while the Minister was out of the House.  I suggest that it might be possible for the Minister to have this Bill, as distinct from submitting it to a general committee of the House, committed to a special committee where, in a non-controversial atmosphere, we could deal with amendments, get through the general work of the consideration of the detailed provisions of the Bill and come back with a more or less unanimously agreed measure to pass its final stages in this House.  I think that would have the considerable advantage of expediting the passage of the Bill because there seems to be unanimity in the House as to its need, and, once we are satisfied that it is necessary, we should get on with the job of getting it enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the general terms of the Bill, I should like to go a little bit outside the scope of the measure.  I think, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that under the long title, I am permitted to speak on every facet of defence.  I should like to hear from the Minister what I hope is good news in regard to his drive for recruits.  I should like the Minister to tell us if he is getting a reasonable and continuous response that holds forth a prospect of building up the Army to establishment strength.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the very person who alleged at that time that I was outside the scope of the Bill was Deputy Major de Valera.  If the Deputy so desires, I will quote the record.  I sincerely hope the Minister can give us a picture that will encourage us and be of benefit to the country. I make the inquiry not in any anxiety to embarrass the Minister but because I feel, from what I have gleaned, that the Minister is in a position to make a statement that is encouraging and that will be of benefit to the situation as far as the country in general is concerned.</P>
      <P>I thought of asking the Minister some of the embarrassing questions which he, as a Deputy &mdash; aided and abetted by Deputy Major de Valera&mdash; asked.  I feel, however, that it would be wrong to introduce an air of crisis and panic, artificially created by them, and possibly allow mundane politics to transgress on what we hope will prove to be a non-controversial measure.  For that reason, I shall not be so unpleasant as to press inquiries regarding equipment and matters of that nature at this stage.  I feel we have had enough unwelcome controversy where the Army is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am with the Minister to the last step of the road in everything he can do to help the Army.  I am with the Minister to the last step of the road for the betterment in every way of conditions in every section of the Army. I do not intend to thrust controversy on him at this stage.  It might be well for the Minister to consider, between this and the next stage, some way whereby from time to time, if he so desired or if the House so requested, it would be possible to bring in for review, in a limited way, a Defence Bill.  Once we make it a permanent <Col N="114" /> measure we shall not have the hardy annual which gave us an opportunity of expressing our views on Army administration.  I think the Minister will agree that the discussion on the Estimates is not broad enough for the type of review I contemplate.  The only type of review which I contemplate would be necessary and would be one to improve, in the light of experience, the permanent measure.  It might be well for the Minister to consider the possibility of such a periodic review.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider, too, at this stage the possibility of incorporating the nursing service as a regular corps of the Army, with its own officer personnel, responsible for its own discipline and ultimately responsible to the Director of Army Medical Service.</P>
    <P>The Minister should advert very seriously to one feature of Deputy Cowan's speech, that is, the method by which in the Army deductions can be made from your cheque.  You get your cheque at the end of the month and you see that, with reference to some Order or other, the amount of your cheque is reduced by £10, £12 or £14 because of something of which you were unaware until you got your cheque.  You find that every attempt to seek redress is thoroughly and well blocked by the Department which was successful in bringing about the deduction in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The two real features that seriously upset the Army are: (1) Junior officers holding for too long appointments of senior officers without getting their due promotion and (2) stoppages, either by way of barrack damages from the non-commissioned personnel or under some ministerial Order which the Minister never saw, but which was turned out of the administrative monster over which he has control, and which have the effect of deducting a fair portion of a man's pay.  I have some practical experience in this connection.  Without knowing it you might find yourself with a whole stores on charge to you or with a company's equipment, which you never had, on charge to you. Ultimately, some years later, maybe at a time when you can ill-afford to pay it, you may be faced with some surcharge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> The Minister will receive every help and co-operation from this side of the House to make this measure a permanent feature of our legislation as quickly as possible.  I earnestly appeal to him to commit this Bill to a select committee of the House in order to get the Committee Stage effectively and quickly so that the Bill may become law before any temporary Act to carry us on next year should become necessary.</P>

It makes for stability.  It gives confidence both to the country and to the Army.  In the present tense situation it gives the ordinary citizen assurance for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avail of this occasion to pay a tribute to the Army for their immense work during the emergency. When hostilities broke out in 1939 our Army, though it was a very small force at the time, expanded in the shortest possible time and assured our defences. They established the local Defence Force, which later became Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil.  They gave us confidence. The local barracks, whether in Athlone, Longford or Mullingar, was the focal point of duty.  The young men of the country, irrespective of their political affiliations, flocked to the defences.  They left their work, their occupations and their professions and donned the uniform of their country. During the years of the emergency they were a bulwark in defence and a guarantee of our neutrality.  At the end of the emergency, after splendid service, they went back and honourably filled positions on our farms, in our municipal bodies, in the State service or as professional men and, as citizens, they rank second to none.  We feel very proud of them.  We feel that every soldier and every officer in that Army, whether they had years of service or went in during the emergency, were prepared from the lowest rank to the highest to lay down their <Col N="116" /> lives for the defence of the country.  It is only right and proper that, while we welcome this Bill, I hope in a unanimous House, we should pay tribute to what they achieved for us 12 or 13 years ago.  We sincerely hope that the example they have given will be followed by the young men of the present day.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Collins welcomed the bigger effort to get larger numbers into Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil.  I hope everybody will co-operate in that; that they will avail of the services of the able area administrative officers and their good N.C.O.s, who give a splendid training to those who cannot go into the Army.  I hope that in this debate on this very important Bill we will not hear the doctrine of futility preached from any side of the House. If anybody proposes to get up in this national Assembly to throw aspersions on the national Army, to mock them and make little of their efforts, he would be serving the national interest if he gave us a &ldquo;béal dúnta&rdquo; on this occasion.  If he wishes to talk in that way, I would advise him to go over to Egypt and talk in that way to the Egyptians, and he will get very short shrift if he goes over there.  There is very little use in talking of the greater forces which are in existence.  We are proud of the Army.  Whenever an emergency comes, we know that they will be our first line of defence.  Even though this well-thought-out Bill was a long time in coming, we welcome it as a guarantee and a safeguard to every private and officer in the Army, and as a guarantee for the defence of this nation.</P>

      <P>The House seems to be unanimous in praise of the Bill. When Deputy Collins spoke some time ago, the question he raised was not the question of a quorum being in the House, but the question of interest in the Bill.  If attendance in the House is to be the criterion of that interest, I think those on the benches behind him did not give a very good example. I do not intend to pursue that line of argument, but to deal with the aspect of Army life to which Deputy Cowan made brief reference, namely, that the members of the Army in times of peace <Col N="117" /> should be allowed to follow, in so far as may be judicious, their ordinary ways of life.  Those of us who have had some experience of social problems, particularly in the cities, know that, even with a legacy, perhaps a bad one, of military quarters attached to barracks, the married members of the forces find it very difficult to get proper housing accommodation. Very often the father perhaps is in Limerick or at the Curragh, while his wife and young children may be in Cork or one of the other cities, perhaps in a flat or some place that may not be suitable to the raising of a young family, especially with the husband away somewhere else.</P>
      <P>That is an aspect which the Army authorities ought to consider because, after all, our Army was based on the volunteer spirit, the Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil continues on the same basis, and I hope they will never lose their contact with the people or with our national traditions which were a feature of the Army conditions during the national struggle. In consequence, I am not entirely in favour of these military colonies, as I might call them, in married quarters attached to barracks.  I think it would be comparatively easy for the Army authorities to erect small terraces of houses, not altogether perhaps near the barracks, where members of the forces may make their homes and be in close contact with their families.</P>
      <P>It sometimes happens that a widow has a son who goes into the Army. She may be lonely and may wish that he should come home at night if he is within easy reach of the home.  Permission should be given as often as possible for soldiers to do that, because it will be a bad day for the country when any section of our people are forced by circumstances to be away from their homes which mean so much in the life of the community.  Some provision, therefore, should be made for the housing of the married units in the Army.  I join in the general tribute paid to the Army and to the Volunteer forces during the emergency.  I hope that in the coming years we shall have no reason to regret the way we deal with those who are the first and second line of our national defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody remarked on the last occasion, this Bill, being a consolidating Bill very largely, is primarily a Bill for Committee. There are, however, a few general observations I should like to make, although they may be a repetition of something said before.  The Bill is a restricted one dealing very largely with the administration of the Army and it still runs very much on the old lines, conceiving the duties of defence as confined to the forces as we have had them heretofore.  But there is a wider aspect of defence in modern times, even of defence in the narrower sense as within the purview of the Minister for Defence. It arises from the fact that technical developments in a large number of fields have intruded themselves of necessity on that most realistic of businesses, war.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which corresponds to a type of legislation that is now relatively old, is related to an Army in a narrow sense, an Army composed of so many different corps and services thought of as operating more or less independently, of the general national set-up behind it.  To that extent, it is adequate, but behind all defence now there is the necessity for a tie-up between our whole economy and the Defence Forces, particularly when the Defence Forces are called upon to undertake the task for which they are actually there.  One asks oneself, in the light of that, whether a Bill such as this should give, in some regards, consideration to that wider aspect: for instance, whether, in relation to the Defence Forces and, say, production and supplies, there should not be some provisions, whether there should not be envisaged a tie-up, suspensory, naturally, in peace-time and contingent to peace-time, but a thing that would become an actuality in a time of emergency, a tie-up, say, with our transport services, our communication services and with all these other things that, of necessity, enter into the picture when the Defence Forces are needed, and which are, in fact, of paramount importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, how the tie-up can be achieved is something that needs thinking out. I think that basic legislation of the <Col N="119" /> broadest kind and of the most flexible kind to meet such a contingency should be considered at this stage, and should furnish a possible further addition to a Bill such as this.  I mentioned certain services.  I can think of the whole medical services even as being involved in this to some extent.  Now, I shall try to be a little bit more concrete.  I want to avoid limiting the generality of the idea which I am trying to put across now by a few narrow specific instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, to give an example.  In regard to certain medical aspects, if anything like hostilities came our way there would be a big medical problem.  I understand that during the emergency special schemes were considered and, to some extent, were put in force for the special commissioning of people who did not actually mobilise and would not have come into the picture until the need arose for them in hospitals and so on. I think that, if my memory serves me, there were a number of senior commissions made.  There was something done in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering how far it would be desirable to consider such things now.  You see, we are dealing with reserves here and things like the reserve.  Again, in connection with transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I give that merely as an example.  Another thing that would happen in the case of actual hostilities is that the transport system, virtually, has to be integrated with the Defence Forces.  There will be a certain call on it for operational purposes and possibly a call for evacuation, and so there will be a need for liaison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann would be of importance.  The point is, how the thing should be thought out and how that liaison is to be effected.  Now, I am not making actual concrete suggestions.  I purposely refrain from doing so, because this is a problem that wants to be examined.  I know what was considered before.  I know there are a couple of alternatives that can be considered. The important thing is that the problem should be considered and a solution got, and then, whether it is necessary to be tied up with the scheme in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan mentioned, in another connection, the question of professional officers.  There, again, you have a difficulty which is acute in a modern army.  I am going to go outside the officer class now and follow the remarks of Deputy Cowan at the other end.  There was some years ago an actual decision made in regard to, I think, fitters and people like them which had the result in the end of leaving the Army without its quota of trained technical personnel.  There will be a growing need in a modern army for having technicians in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly through the air corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Through all its units, and in a wider sense than before.  You need specialist officers and you need specialist men.  You will not be able to carry in peace-time easily all you require.  First of all, there would be the difficulty of being able to get them.  I am in favour of what Deputy Cowan has said in that regard, that if these men are brought in for these narrow professional purposes, even though they can go higher, it usually means that the fact they are in such appointments they will not go any higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to follow that line at the moment.  What I want to say is that the vacancies in the Regular Army itself and the vacancies in the Reserve will not be sufficient normally to get the quota of personnel required, <Col N="121" /> and the right type of personnel, that you want in that regard.  You may have to consider, therefore, the question of a special technical supplement to your Defence Forces, particularly where what you may call scientific or technical matters are concerned.  When it comes to the pitch you will probably require a certain quota of scientists and technicians of various kinds which you will not easily be able to get on your establishment, and which, even if you do get on your establishment, you will not easily be able to use and keep up to date.  That seems to indicate liaison with the institutions that can produce such personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be the main difficulty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It always is a difficulty.  These are all aspects of a problem that they need consideration under modern conditions.  It is not sufficient merely to approach the Defence Forces as a unit.  Our Army must be supported by something if it is to be effective and reasonably independent.  Up to the moment its organisation has been such as to leave it largely in the position of a dependent unit without having a higher organisation to depend out of it.  That problem was acutely felt during the emergency. The emergency solutions that were adopted got us through then, but they would not be enough for the future.</P>
      <P>Now there is a wide line of country there which, perhaps, we can go back to more properly on the Estimates. It is only of importance in this respect in so far as legislation may be necessary to provide for the co-ordination of defence needs for certain normal essential services which become essential defence services when an emergency arises.  There is a complete absence of that in this Bill which makes one wonder if the conception of this Bill has not been largely concerned with routine and tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Touching on that, there is the question of an officer who relinquishes his commission or who retires.  An officer who retires ceases to be an officer.  I wonder if that is not too sweeping.  These men gain a very valuable experience and knowledge of <Col N="122" /> the machine.  They acquire a certain steadiness.  They have, if I may put it that way, a routine value.  Should an emergency arise there will always be an expansion beyond the point covered by normal reserves.  There will always be administrative problems.  In such cases an active young officer may be wasted in the orderly room; the authorities may have no desire to keep him in that orderly room but he has to fill that post; an untrained outsider cannot take his place because he is not familiar with the system of administration, and in a change-over from normal peace-time conditions into emergency conditions such posts must be filled by experienced men.</P>
    <P>I think there is a strong case for keeping regular officers who retire available to fill such posts.  Deputy Captain Cowan raised this matter on another occasion and I am sure he will agree with me on this.  Such retired officers should continue on the retired list and should be available for recall in case of emergency.  There may be certain financial provisions bearing on that and it might be desirable to have a special class of reserves.  I shall not argue that at the moment, but it does appear to me to be a wasteful procedure to let personnel go before they have reached the end of their usefulness.</P>
    <P>I am speaking now only of the regular officers.  Again, in the case of officers who may retire before their time, for one reason or another, one has valuable potential material which should be very useful in times of emergency. The bald words of the Act in that respect give the Minister no flexibility. It may be desirable to reconsider the matter.  Up to the present century, soldiering was a narrow profession. When war broke out the army was sent to fight one's battles and the civilian population sat comfortably at home.  That type of warfare has gone. It is an all-out effort now for the entire community.  Those best fitted to fill certain posts should be put into them. Officers who have retired would be an asset because of their experience in any expanding organisation.</P>
    <P>Many of the matters arising on this Bill are more germane to the Committee Stage.  Deputy S. Collins mentioned <Col N="123" /> the Council of Defence.  Under the 1924 Act, the idea was that there would be a kind of executive council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Deputy Captain Cowan's pigeon, not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the provisions in regard to the Parliamentary Secretary he will realise that there was very definite administrative business and a member of Dáil Éireann was to be responsible to the Minister for Defence for the finances of the Defence Forces and such other business etc.  In practice, of course, that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That has gone by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Secretary of the Department of Defence was the secretary of the old council.  I think the Minister and his predecessors all realised that this Council of Defence as an executive organisation simply did not work.  It was purely an advisory body, a kind of committee, where the heads of the Department of Defence met and dealt with routine administrative matters affecting the Department, such as promotions; these had their financial side as well as their military side.  I understand the intention now is to continue that council more or less along the same lines.  In no sense will it be a planning council in relation to defence, something I think the Minister and his staff will probably deal with in another way.  But there, again, I see no reason why the Secretary of the Department of Defence as the civil head of that Department should be completely excluded.  It is I suggest a rather narrow concept that he should be so excluded.  It seems to me the secretary should be an essential member of this committee.  I am amused to find myself arguing on behalf of the civil side of the Department because certainly in the past the civil side, particularly the Department of Finance, had an overriding effect on the purely military side and in pre-war days practically throttled it.  Indeed the shackles were only shaken off during the emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They were shaken off to some extent.  I have put it on record as a matter of fact myself, if the Deputy is interested.  The facts and figures are given for actual expenditure and the Deputy will see how that worked out.  Now that balance must be kept properly adjusted.  My views will be found in the debates on the Estimates and I would not like to be taken as in any way going back on the views I expressed in the past and which I have always considered it essential to stress, particularly during peace-time.  But taking a sane view, the accounting officer and Secretary of the Department is a person who comes into the picture and sanity demands that provision should be made for him in that organisation.  It is quite a different matter when another Department comes along and tries to dictate as to type of organisation required. I remember a case in which the Department of Finance tried to override the tactical Defence Force suggested and put forward an alternative scheme.  I think that was going a bit too far. However, that is an old story now and we need not go into it.</P>
      <P>It would be a very good thing if, through such a body, a balance could be arrived at, and I think that since the emergency there has been a balance there that certainly was not there before the war.  That is something and we should leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitution of the force remains very much as it was, a permanent force and a Reserve and Second Line Reserve.  To some extent the remarks that I have made in regard to the Regular Force in connection with experienced personnel who are no longer actually on the strength, could be made in regard to the Reserve, particularly where there is some specialised knowledge available, for instance, if you have somebody who has, say, specialised administrative knowledge and who also had long experience in the <Col N="125" /> Regular Defence Forces.  One could make a case that there is a possibility for a person like that still being available, no matter in what category.  The same applies to specially trained officers or artillery officers, and people like that.  Even though they had ceased to be officers at some time since the last emergency, if they are still available, they should be considered in connection with something corresponding to what I call the retired category for the permanent force.  Considering that our resources are small, I definitely think that where there is an officer with special qualification which is not easily got or special experience, if he is young enough to have served recently enough not to be completely out of touch, even though he has severed his connection, if he is willing to act on some kind of non-active list or something like that, a case can be made for getting such personnel.</P>
    <P>I can think of quite a few.  I think of it in two categories.  I can think of one officer whom I know to have certain service in the Regular Army and service on the Reserve, and who had specialised training as well as experience of administration, who would probably be useful.  I can think of a young engineer who had excellent qualifications, who gave excellent service, displaying initiative and originality, and who, for the type of work he was on, could not easily be replaced, who is still in the country and who is still young and who is no longer a member of the force and who, so far as the Department of Defence is concerned, is forgotten.  I think that is a pity.  At least there should be some arrangement by which such specialist personnel could be gathered up.  How you are going to do it, I do not know.  Certainly, there is no provision for doing anything like that within the framework of this Bill. I think the Bill is too old-fashioned and too conservative in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Army Nursing Service has been mentioned.  It is largely a matter for the Committee Stage.  I can see that there is probably a case for and against incorporation these girls in peace-time as completely subject to military law.  In making the point he <Col N="126" /> did make, Deputy Collins should bear in mind that if they are brought in and given ranks they become completely subject to military law, that there is no halfway there that is easily struck and that there are disadvantages in that from their own point of view which may go a long way to outweigh the advantages.  That is a matter we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to say to the Minister about this Bill.  I know that many Army officers, especially the young harassed Army officer, who will be asked in peace-time something about section such-and-such, if something goes wrong with reference to that section, may find himself, as things are up to the moment, with a heap of amended Acts and the amendments in the form &ldquo;delete line so-and-so from section such-and-such&rdquo;&mdash;that is, by reference.  The same applies in regard to Defence Force Regulations.  He would need not only to be a trained lawyer but to put his whole time into it to get the hang of these regulations and this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is grand to see a nice clean Bill like that coming into force.  I am sure it will be very welcome.  I would like to see all the Defence Force Regulations and other similar regulations knocked into a clean form.  But, thereafter, there will inevitably be amendments and I would recommend to the Minister to make a firm decision now that all amendments in future will be in a form that is easily understood.  In other words, if a section is dealt with, instead of legislation by reference, the whole section should be struck out and a new section put in.  It costs only a little bit of paper.  Paper is an expensive commodity now but the amount involved is insignificant.  The same would apply to regulations.  Otherwise, it can lead to injustice.  I have known cases of soldiers and civilians dealing with the Department of Defence who have not known their rights and I have known cases where their rights have been misrepresented as a result of misinterpretation of these amendments and of the legislation as it is.</P>
    <P>I am going back a long way now, but I once raised this point and the <Col N="127" /> answer was given to me that it was the Attorney-General's Department.  I went to the trouble of checking that and the fact is that this has been the policy of the Department of Defence, not the Attorney-General's Department. I am prepared to go back on that for facts if anybody wants to raise that particular issue.  If that answer is given to me again, there is only one way of dealing with it, because the facts were that it was the Department of Defence that were at fault in that. I would urge on the Minister very, very strongly that henceforth a regulation should be made in respect of legislation in this matter.  It would be better for everyone.  At present it is difficult for the civil officers of the Department; it is difficult for the persons who have to deal with the code and it is impossible for the people who are affected by that legislation.  Now, we start with a nice clean Bill.  It will not remain clean for ever.  Inevitably, there will be amendments, and I would urge that these amendments should be done in a form which will still preserve the position that you have one document. In the case of an important Bill such as this, having secured amendment in that form, it is not too much to ask that the whole Bill be reprinted anew from time to time as may be required and that the regulations made thereunder are amended in an intelligible way.</P>
    <P>The rest of the matters arising under this Bill can easily be lealt with in Committee and should be dealt with in Committee.  The question arises, what kind of Committee?  There is a very large number of sections in the Bill, schedules and so forth.  Frankly, having regard to the business likely to be before the House in the next few months, and the nature of the material, I find it very hard to see how this Bill can be dealt with in the ordinary Committee way.  It is largely in the nature of a Consolidating Bill.  I see little hope of its being quickly disposed of&mdash; that is, effective disposition&mdash;unless it is submitted to a Committee.  Incidentally, if the House were looking for a Committee I would recommend that they would not look only to people who <Col N="128" /> have had some association with defence in one way or another.  I think there should be fresh minds on this.  If the Bill goes through the House in the ordinary way it will have one of two fates: either it does not get through for donkey's years because there is so much of it there if it is seriously considered; the alternative fate might be worse.  The Bill would simply go through without having got any real consideration from the members of the House.  It would go through rapidly. The question, therefore, of a Special Committee to examine the Bill should at least be considered so as to get the Bill through as quickly as possible.  I do not wish to minimise its importance. I have criticised it in some regard.  It is important from the point of view of administration and discipline and the basic aspects of the force, but there are wider and more urgent aspects of defence which are not covered, nor are they, indeed, the proper subject matter for such a Bill.  They will have to get attention separately.  The House should not delude itself into feeling that in passing a Bill like this it has done all it should do in getting it through as rapidly as possible. Members should remember that the broader, more urgent and more practical aspects of the matter still remain to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is naturally very pleasing to me to find that a Bill of this character has been accepted by the various Deputies in the House who have been interested enough to speak on this matter.  It is a voluminous Bill and might, in fact, create the impression that it needed a greater amount of examination than smaller types of Bill introduced into this House.  In actual fact, the position in regard to this Bill is that almost every section of it, with a few exceptions, has been in operation for over 20 years.  It may well be that the Bill in its present form and in its past form does not meet with all the requirements Deputies of this House would demand, but the fact remains, nevertheless, that it is made up of Bills which have been operating throughout a long period of time.  I must presume that it meets the requirements of the <Col N="129" /> Army personnel, who have devoted so much time to its examination before it eventually came to be drafted.  I must also presume that it was similarly carefully examined by the civil side of the Department of Defence, and in that respect I rather imagine that, as far as the Army itself is concerned, and as far as the civil side of the Department of Defence is concerned, the Bill represents the best of their efforts. Having said so much, I am not going to suggest for a moment that the Bill could not be bettered.  Every Bill coming into this House is entitled to debate and has on very many occasions been returned from the House better in one way or another than it came in. As far as I am concerned, I will welcome the fullest possible discussion on every section of the Bill when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Numerous points were raised by Deputies and some were duplicated.  As far as possible I will refer to these points, and I will give what appear, to me at any rate, to be satisfactory replies.  In the course of his speech Deputy MacEoin referred to the fact that a section dealing with the compulsory acquisition of land was one which was used in the past in some kind of unfair manner and that, because of that, it might possibly be used in a similar manner in the future.  First of all, I must say, as far as my own experience goes, that I have no recollection of any incident of the kind to which the Deputy referred.  As the Deputy himself did not give us any evidence of an incident, I can only say that, as far as the compulsory acquisition of land is concerned, the Department of Defence who would, in the main, be responsible for conducting discussions, entering into contracts, and so forth, would not do so lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army, I can assure the House, would not compulsorily acquire land if it could be secured by reasonable negotiation. I do not think any Deputy will suggest that, if it were desirable to acquire land, for instance, for the purpose of establishing an aerodrome in a particular district the land should not be so acquired.  I feel it would be in the national interest that the land should be acquired for such purpose. <Col N="130" /> When Deputy Captain Cowan intervened in the course of Deputy MacEoin's speech to refer to that particular point, I feel sure that he meant just that.  If land were required for an urgent purpose no individual should be allowed to interfere with the safety of the nation in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>The safety of the nation must be the first consideration in matters of this kind, and what is regarded as the greatest good for the greatest number of people must always operate.  Deputy MacEoin, Deputy S. Collins and perhaps one or two other Deputies mentioned the desirability of having an annual Defence Act of one kind or another, or some substitute, which would provide an opportunity for debate on the question of defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason why, if it is necessary to have a discussion at any time on national defence, a discussion cannot be arranged through the medium of a motion.  I think that the fullest possible form of debate would be provided by that means.  There would be very little sense in passing a permanent Defence Act if that particular Act was to be discussed every year.  It is true what Deputy de Valera said: that in the course of time this particular Act will be added to considerably.  Evolution will call for that.  But, as far as can be provided, <Col N="131" /> we do not want to have the Act brought in annually merely for the purpose of providing amendments.  We will be just returning to where we are endeavouring to leave if that is the position.  I believe the fullest possible form of debate will be provided if we operate through the medium of a motion.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of consolidating the Defence Force Regulations. This is actually being done at the present moment and a number of regulations are being prepared in conjunction with the present Bill.  It would be completely and entirely wrong if we were to have the Defence Bill in the form that it should be in and not to have the Defence Force Regulations as compactly and properly prepared.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin also referred to lectures.  The lectures to which the Deputy referred are being continued in the college as usual.  Deputy Hickey referred to the Curragh.  Most Deputies are aware, I think, that the Curragh lands are governed by the Curragh Lands Acts and not by the Defence Acts, so there is very little we can do in respect to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and other Deputies referred to the question of junior officers holding appointments higher than those appropriate to their ranks. This, of course, is necessary at times. It is not desired that we should, so to speak, fill these appointments permanently or semi-permanently.  All the Deputies who are acquainted with Army matters know that there is such a thing as the establishments.  There can only be a certain number of officers of each rank within the establishments, and it is quite impossible to go outside that.  Anyhow, these officers who have been referred to usually fill the higher appointment during a period when the officer who should be there is on leave or is doing a course or, perhaps, may be ill; but in any case it would, in fact, be only a temporary arrangement.</P>
    <P>The question of professional officers was raised by Deputy Cowan also.  I do not know that it is possible to do anything in regard to that.  An officer comes in as a specialised technical <Col N="132" /> officer.  He gets the benefit of the fact that he has professional qualifications, carrying degrees of one kind or another and he fills a vacancy in a specialist corps.  While it would not be impossible to take him out of that to put him into an infantry rank he would strongly object to that fact if he was placed on the pay of the infantry rank into which he might be transferred. However, the question of technical officers is such that the question of transferring such an officer would hardly ever arise, first of all, because of the difficulty in obtaining this technical type of officer and, secondly, for the reason that they have gained a large amount of experience in the Army which it would be very difficult to replace for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also referred to the question of discipline.  I think that discipline is one of these matters in which Ministers should not interefere. I do not believe that any Minister who has occupied the position of Minister for Defence has ever attempted to interfere with the question of discipline in the Army.  If he did, and if the necessity should ever arise for the Minister having to take the type of action that he might desire to take in regard to something that had happened, he could not take that action if, for instance, he had turned down a decision taken by the military authorities in respect to some act of indiscipline.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the discipline is enforced in the manner which Deputy Cowan outlined here this evening. Personally, I would be very shocked and I am sure every Deputy here would be shocked, if he saw a soldier in O'Connell Street or some other main street in a state of intoxication. It would be hopelessly undesirable and it is something that no Deputy of this House would stand for.  Therefore, it is necessary to have the P.A. on duty.  With reference to the case mentioned by Deputy Cowan, I have never seen it happen myself and I have never had a case brought to my attention, and therefore I must presume that if it does occur it is very rare, where a P.A. interfered with a soldier who was talking either to his male or female friends.  I do not think that could come into the category of acts of <Col N="133" /> indiscipline.  Therefore, it is very questionable if I should take action on a matter of that kind.  There is nothing to prevent any officer or soldier who has any grievance in regard to his pay from writing in with regard to whatever action may have been taken in respect to his grievance.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that the Parliamentary Secretary was, in fact, only Parliamentary Secretary in theory.  I do not think that is correct. The Parliamentary Secretary sits on the Council of Defence and he has a voice there.  He can express his opinions on any matter that is under discussion.  My first promotion, if I may call it so, was to the Parliamentary Secretaryship of Defence.  I actually acted in that capacity for six months, occupying the ministerial office all the time.  The Minister himself was, as far as I remember, acting in some other capacity at the time.  I carried out practically all the duties, with the exception of signing documents which it was necessary that only a Minister should sign.  Certainly, I was not there in a theoretical way. I was there in an actual form, carrying out all the duties that are allotted to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of whether the Secretary of the Department of Defence should be a member of the Council of Defence.  The Secretary of the Department of Defence, as far as I remember, has always been, in a manner of speaking, a member of the Council of Defence.  He has acted as secretary all the time.  He is the only civilian, along with the Parliamentary Secretary, who is present at council meetings.  From my own experience, I can say that he has been as helpful to the Army officers who are at present on the Council of Defence as they themselves are to each other. He has not, on any occasion that I have been aware of, taken a line completely in opposition to them.  He has, of course, advised on questions of finance where finance was at issue.  He is the accounting officer to the Department and must accept all responsibility for any expenditure.  Where suggestions were made that involved expenditure of money, he, naturally, voiced his opinion on those and gave his advice; <Col N="134" /> but, there again, only in the form of advice.  The council are only an advisory body, with no executive powers.  They could, if necessary, talk for a week and at the end of that week the Minister's decision will be the only decision that counts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is on record a story of a certain Minister who said: &ldquo;The `Noes' have it,&rdquo; there being only one &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The other question, which, I hope, will not be a controversial one, is that of the re-appointment of a Chief of Staff, Adjutant-General or Quartermaster-General. In this respect, I should like to say that, from my own personal experience, it would be highly undesirable&mdash;I have already said this on the Second Stage of the Bill on a former occasion&mdash;to deprive any Minister for Defence of the right, if he thought it desirable in a time of stress and danger, to reappoint a Chief of Staff who had given satisfactory service. There is nothing whatever to prevent the Minister from changing the Chief of Staff at any time after his appointment if he is not successful.  If, in the event of emergency, you had a Chief of Staff who might have been a good administrative Chief of Staff in a time of peace and who failed to rise to the occasion in time of stress, there is nothing to prevent the Minister from changing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a Chief of Staff who replaced a Chief of Staff was not successful he, too, could be changed again.  Similarly, then, I think that it would be undesirable to prevent the Minister, if he secured the services of an outstanding Chief of Staff, from retaining him in that position in time of emergency. I can hardly imagine that with a five years' period&mdash;and I am fully in favour of the five year period&mdash;any Minister would ordinarily desire to reappoint a Chief of Staff at the end of that period.  From that point of view, I would strongly appeal to Deputies to accept that particular section.  I think that any Deputy who has spoken against it&mdash;there were not very many&mdash;will, on consideration, <Col N="135" /> come to agree with the view which I am putting forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins&mdash;I am not sure if anyone else spoke on this matter&mdash; referred to the question of a special committee of the House.  I think Deputy de Valera referred to it also. I do not know whether we would be entitled to have such a committee.  I take it that the suggestion is that the matter would be dealt with by a special committee in some room in this House rather than in the House itself. I do not know if we would be entitled to do that.  Would it be necessary for the committee to refer back to another committee of the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If it would facilitate the passage of this Bill, certainly I would not see any objection to it.  I do not myself oppose it.  I think it is highly desirable that we should get this Bill through the House as quickly as possible.  Even after this House has dealt with it, the Bill has then to be dealt with by the Seanad.  The President has to put his signature to it.  When that is done the regulations will have to be attended to.  The consideration that will have to be given to the regulations will, in my opinion, take something like six or eight months, so that, with the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, we will have anything up to another six months' delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one or two Deputies mentioned the nursing service.  I do not think that we can do what has been suggested in regard to the nursing service. First of all, it would be very difficult to deal with it as a military unit because there are only less than 100 all told in this service.  In a time of war, as far as I am aware, there is the V.A.D.&mdash;the Voluntary Aid Detachment, but I am not sure if that is the correct definition.  They are the people who in war would be at the front and the nurses would <Col N="136" /> probably be restricted to hospital work.  However, I do not think that to turn the nursing service into a military unit would be desirable except to the extent that, in an emergency, we can do through the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that that covers most of the queries which were raised in the House, with the exception of the question of recruitment.  I am very glad to be able to report to the House that the present recruiting campaign has had excellent results.  We now have what I might describe as a battalion of new recruits.  That represents what I understand is a new record for normal recruiting.  The House I know will be very glad to hear that.  I am very grateful for the statement which Deputy Collins made this evening that any services which he can give towards recruitment either for the Army proper or for the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiuil will be freely given.  I think that that represents the view of most of the members of the House.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the course of the debate that this is in fact a nonpolitical Bill.  It is and I am very pleased to be able to say that it has been dealt with in that way in the House this evening, and I feel that it will so be dealt with on the other stages when we come to them.</P>
    <P>Again I want to repeat that while it may not be possible to accept all the amendments that will be tabled, nevertheless Deputies are entitled to table them and they will be considered and debated.  From that point of view I think we can all say that the Bill will have been given the fullest possible type of consideration by the members of the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Abolition of Capital Punishment&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate on the following motion resumed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be appointed to examine and report to the Dáil on the question of the desirability of the abolition of capital punishment.&mdash; (Seán MacBride, John Tully).</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this motion that the Dáil should set up a Select Committee to examine and report on the question of the desirability of the abolition of capital punishment I gave it as my view that if capital punishment were abolished there would be a grave risk of increase of crimes of violence, and since murders are still committed in spite of the death penalty, I think that it would be imposing too much on people's credulity to try to persuade them that if hanging were abolished in present conditions there would be no more murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that people would not believe that and if the motion were to pass, fears and anxieties would be created in the public mind.  Is there any reason why we should create these fears and anxieties in the minds of honest citizens?  Equally I think that anybody who considers the effect of the setting up of this committee, were <Col N="138" /> the House to accept it, will appreciate that a feeling might also be created in the minds of would-be criminals that since there was a move to abolish capital punishment they could afford to take greater risks in striking down their victims.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride stated that he was influenced by his lack of absolute confidence in human judgement.  If we were to pursue that to its conclusion I wonder where it would lead us?  It would mean that in critical or serious issues in which we were asked to give our judgment and carry out our duty accordingly we would evade our responsibility.  We are rational beings whereas, according to the Deputy, murderers are often irrational, unbalanced and not normal.  They have often proved themselves, however, to be calculating and cold-blooded, and in such circumstances I can see no alternative to the death penalty as the only principle upon which we can take our stand and that the murderer should forfeit his life and that there should be no grounds to expect mercy for the supreme crime.  We have a legal procedure with regard to cases where the punishment is a capital one and we have to look at history and the human experience behind these processes.  I think that they rarely fail.  In the long history of judicial proceedings I think that the mistakes are very few indeed. It would be strange if there were many because ample safeguards are laid down.  If the law is not infallible there is even the prerogative of mercy which can be exercised by the Government in special circumstances and having regard to the considerations which they must have in mind in taking that course.</P>
    <P>I have not time to give the full statistics, but during the past 23 years, deducting from the total the numbers who were judged insane, guilty of manslaughter and so on, 34 were condemned to death out of 176 persons tried for murder.  Sixteen were executed, the other 18 having been reprieved; and there was a period between January, 1934, and June, 1937, during which I believe six persons were sentenced to death and had their sentences commuted.  That shows that, in certain circumstances of peace and <Col N="139" /> growing law-abidingness on the part of the people, the death penalty may possibly, as has happened in the countries mentioned by Deputy MacBride, fall into desuetude.  It is very noticeable that in some of the most progressive of the countries he mentioned the last execution took place very many years before capital punishment was abolished.  There was no question of trying to antedate public opinion or the ordinary evolution in this respect which had taken place in the circumstances of these countries, and I think there is some real hope for the cessation of capital punishment from allowing the death penalty to fall into disuse and from that being the case for a period than through any premature efforts to abolish it by legislation in advance of public opinion.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point with reference to the argument put forward, an argument on which, I think, the proposer of the motion largely based his case, that is, that if capital punishment is not a deterrent, it should be abolished.  This may seem to be a very humanitarian view, perhaps in line with some of the type of idealism which has been in vogue for along time past. Whether we regard it as a deterrent or not&mdash;and I certainly do&mdash;there are other reasons for capital punishment besides its effectiveness as a deterrent and there are very important moral issues involved.  If we ask ourselves what is the justification for capital punishment, if we try to get down to that fundamental, we must regard punishment, whether it be capital or otherwise, from the point of view of the moral responsibility of the individual. That is how it has been regarded through the ages and that is the standpoint from which I think we must regard it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride referred to capital punishment as a doctrine of vengeance and went on to limit that to the term &ldquo;retribution&rdquo;.  So far as I know, Catholic teaching on this subject is that punishment is primarily and essentially retributive in character.  A recent writer, the Rev. Dr. Hawkins, states that to take a just view of punishment, we must remember that the <Col N="140" /> normal adult has a cerain ultimate responsibility for his deliberate actions and if he acts wrongly deserves his punishment.  According to the late Rev. Professor Cronin in his standard <i>The Science of Ethics</i>, whatever other function may belong to punishment such function depends upon and presupposes a retributive or retrospective function.  &ldquo;Punishment,&rdquo; he states &ldquo;supposes this element and would be unjust without it.&rdquo;  His reply to the argument that punishment may be inflicted to prevent others from wrongdoing is that he does not consider that punishment as a deterrent can stand alone and his conclusion in summing up is that he cannot agree that punishment could be inflicted unless it is mainly retrospective.  This is to be found on pages 554 to 558, volume 1.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to add, except to say, with regard to the point that the House may require information about this matter, that Deputies have all the facts.  They have blue books galore, debates and discussions in several foreign countries and they have their own common sense and experience of our conditions which, as I said in my speech earlier, are the things which ought to guide us.  Therefore, there is no necessity to set up a commission.  Should action be necessary in this regard, the Government is obviously the body to initiate it.  The Government has the necessary information at its disposal, and if anything further were needed to point to the futility of and lack of necessity for setting up this commission, it would be the statement of the proposer that he has no confidence in judges and legalists and apparently does not consider that their opinions would be worth having.  What use a commission could have, therefore, beyond creating these unnecessary fears and anxieties of which I have spoken in the public mind, I cannot see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that most of the speakers, including the Minister for Lands, have misconstrued, or rather, have a misconception of the motion before the House.  We are not debating the merits or demerits <Col N="141" /> of capital punishment.  What we are debating is whether an independent committee of this House should be set up to consider the merits and demerits of capital punishment.  But instead of debating the motion, we have gone on to discuss the merits and demerits of capital punishment.  I do not wish to follow in the footsteps of previous speakers and say that capital punishment is a deterrent to the committal of crime.  We have one glorious example in this country&mdash;1916.  A number of men here decided to take up arms against what was then the alleged Government of the country. They decided&mdash;according to their lights, rightly&mdash;to take up arms against what was then considered the lawfully constituted Government of the country.  As a result of their rising, many of them were sentenced to death and a goodly number of them were executed.  Who can say that the executions of 1916 were a deterrent to the ideals of the men who were executed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely quoting what might be described as legal examples.  The very fact that we had ex-Ministers here disagreeing as to the advantage or otherwise of capital punishment, is, in my opinion, an argument in favour of the motion.  Certain States in the United States of America have abolished capital punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> There is something to be said for and against, and all that the proposers of the motion ask is that an independent committee of the House be set up to consider whether we in this State should abolish it or not.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on that.  Possibly only one small fraction of the Deputies have expressed their views here, but if an independent committee of the House were set up, representatives of all Parties, its recommendation could come before the House and we as a House generally could consider the advantages or otherwise of it.  If there is to be a division on this motion to-night, let us remember that we are not voting for or against capital punishment: we are voting for or against the setting up of an independent committee to consider its abolition or otherwise.  That is the only contribution which I wish to make to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion moved by Deputy MacBride.  I believe it is a reasonable one and that if the Government are anxious seriously to consider whether or not capital punishment is to be abolished the least they can do, in expressing their willingness to have the question investigated, is to declare that, in the event of a vote being taken, it will be left to a free vote of the House.  It seems to be the Government's intention, from the views expressed by the Minister for Lands, that this motion should not be entertained and that no commission should be established.</P>
      <P>It is my personal opinion that capital punishment should be abolished.  When a criminal is found guilty in the courts and is sentenced to death for his deed, I doubt very seriously if his execution has any bearing whatever on future crime for or against.  No greater punishment could be inflicted on a person found guilty of murder than to sentence him to life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gravest punishment that could be inflicted on any human being is to deprive him of his freedom in society, prevent him from discharging his everyday duties, from mixing with his <Col N="143" /> friends and from taking part in the affairs of everyday life outside the prison walls.  The person sentenced to life imprisonment is so seriously handicapped by being deprived of his freedom that it is certainly a punishment sufficient for any crime.  I hope and trust we will see the day when capital punishment will be abolished in this country.</P>
    <P>There is another point&mdash;I do not know if Deputy MacBride referred to it or not&mdash;namely, that it is time that execution by hanging was ended.  If we must have capital punishment and if those found guilty of murder must be executed, I seriously suggest that instead of hangings the Government give careful consideration to introducing the electric chair.  Death by hanging is cruel, it is brutal, it is unchristian, and in the age in which we are living, in 1952, it is about time that execution by hanging should be cut out completely.  If the present Government or any future Government determines that capital punishment must remain, there is a more humane way of having it carried out, and for that reason I would express my view in favour of the electric chair replacing the gallows for the execution of criminals.</P>
    <P>If a vote is taken on this motion I mean to vote for it, as I think the question is worthy of consideration by a commission, for which the motion asks, to report back to the Government. For that reason I am prepared to support Deputy MacBride's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Breanndán Mac Fheórais Breanndán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to vote for this particular motion. Whilst it does not commit any member of the House, nor does it commit the Government, to any definite opinion on the desirability of retaining the death penalty in certain cases of crime, I think it would give the country in general a clearer view as to what the death penalty means.  Whilst the Government side of the House may have definite ideas about the use of the free vote, I do not think anyone would condemn them if they left it to every single one of their members, whether Ministers or ordinary Deputies, to decide for themselves whether this committee <Col N="144" /> should be set up or not.  It has been mentioned here by the Minister for Lands and others that the death penalty is a deterrent.  To whom is it a deterrent?</P>
      <P>I suggest that the only one whom it could deter or could be meant to deter, is the unfortunate fellow who committed the crime and who has been hanged.  I venture to remark that the majority of crimes committed in this country are committed on the spur of the moment.  I do not think any one of us could point to a substantial number of crimes in the whole history of the country where murder has been premeditated. Any of the crimes that have occurred at least in the memory of my lifetime have been committed in anger or in moods of unusual temper, but seldom have we had murderers of the type that premeditated their crime over quite a long period.</P>
      <P>Another thing that strikes me and that must have struck the Minister for Lands and the Government in general from time to time, is that even though a man may be condemned to die by a criminal court, having had a sentence of death passed on him by the judge, it still remains open to the Government of the country&mdash;12 or 13 ordinary commonplace men, representative of the people&mdash;to decide whether or not they would recommend to the President that that man should not be hanged.  In effect, the Cabinet, composed as it is of ordinary men&mdash;farmers, lawyers, workers or whatever they may happen to be&mdash;can decide by a simple vote whether or not they will recommend to the President, who usually acts on their advice, that a man be hanged.  Therefore, in a lot of these cases it is merely a toss of a coin that decides whether a man would get the death penalty or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this House would be doing an unusually bad thing&mdash;it would be doing a very wise thing&mdash;in setting up this commission of inquiry to say whether or not the death penalty should be abolished.  It was a very fine example that Deputy O'Donnell introduced when he talked about the 1916 men&mdash;Connolly, Pearse and the other martyrs of 1916 who were regarded as criminals, and criminals of <Col N="145" /> the worst order, by the powers that be at the time, the British Government.</P>
    <P>You and I can recognise, as our people did recognise in 1916, that they were not criminals, and time would have taught even the British Government that they were not guilty.  If at that particular time there had not been a death penalty, it would have been discovered later by the British Government that they were not criminals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this very important question, since there are many kinds of murder, one must ask oneself the question: What is the type of murder for which it is proposed to remove the death penalty?  To my mind we are dealing with what might be termed the cool, calculated, premeditated murder.  There is no use, in my opinion, introducing the question of Easter Week in the debate, because I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House, nor indeed any person outside the House, who would not be ashamed of anybody who described the men of Easter Week as murderers.  I grant you that so far as the British Government at the time was concerned they may have been looked upon as murderers, but by us they were regarded as patriots and, undoubtedly it was the sentences inflicted on these men at that time which started the movement that has each and every Deputy in the House to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us consider the question of murder as such.  To my mind, the criminally-minded person out to commit a murder through motives of jealousy, envy, or for some worldly gain fears nothing but death, if he is found out. Being afraid only of death, he will watch, wait and bide his time to commit the crime until he believes he <Col N="146" /> cannot be caught.  Up to now he has only one incentive to commit the crime, namely, his chances of not being caught.  Remove the death penalty and you immediately give him three incentives to commit the crime.  In the first place he commits it in the hope that he will not be caught.  Secondly, the death sentence being removed, i.e. commits it knowing that, if he is caught, he will not be hanged or otherwise put to death.  Thirdly, he knows that, in place of a death sentence, he will get a life sentence, and whilst there is life there is always hope.  He commits it in the hope, as has happened in this country time and again, that, before his life sentence is completed, he will be reprieved.  There are three incentives handed out to him. I am not a bit afraid to stand up here and say that if the death sentence is removed, this House will be tearing down the structure, or the pillars of the structure, on which social life in this country is built.  Not alone that, but you might unconsciously open up the ports of this country&mdash;both our seaports and our airports&mdash;to the criminals of other countries to come in here and reap their harvest by preying on the lives of our peaceful, law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an interesting contribution by Deputy Murphy, but I am afraid it is not germane to the motion at all.  The motion before the House does not pose the question whether we should abolish capital punishment or not.  It merely suggests that a committee should be set up by the Dáil to inquire into the advisability or otherwise of its abolition.  I, at this stage, think it would be a wise thing for the House to set up such a committee, but may be not for the reason that Deputy MacBride has moved the motion.  I feel quite convinced that such an inquiry, prosecuted successfully, might put a bar on future motions of this nature.  There may be a need for the inquiry.  Whether or not the inquiry should be limited to the narrow terms of the motion is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might have been wiser for the proposer of the motion to suggest that if you set up such a committee it should <Col N="147" /> inquire into the broader aspects of degrees and types of murder with a view to limiting, possibly, capital punishment, as distinct from abolishing it, but the setting up of the committee is, I think, undoubtedly desirable.</P>
    <P>There is one serious aspect&mdash;I do not know that it has been adverted to in this House&mdash;which, it occurs to me, does need inquiry.  There is no doubt at all that decisions and subsequent executions took place in this country in the heat of political controversy and of political circumstances which we, in the light of experience since gained, would be glad to recall and take steps to ensure that they should never happen again.  There is more to this problem than the very laudable sentiments voiced by Deputy Murphy.  It is an involved problem because executions in this country for the ordinary murder, as we know it in the legal sense, have not been remarkably numerous and certainly they seldom, if ever, merited any real appeal for clemency.  But there is the other type of execution that took place in this country, not only in the heat of civil war but in the subsequent heat of political controversy.  It would have been infinitely better if they never had happened, and they would not have happened if an inquiry of this nature had taken place.</P>

      <P>It might be of some benefit if an inquiry of this nature were held, though I do not think it would serve any real purpose within the narrow terms of the motion.  The issue is greater than a mere positive or negative statement on whether capital punishment should be abolished or not. It is very difficult to know what is the best line to take.  Undoubtedly, there is a school of thought that adheres <Col N="148" /> strongly to the principles as set out with regard to the type of murder envisaged by Deputy Murphy, but there is also a definite school of thought on the degree of crime, culpability, and criminal intent to justify a demand for the extreme penalty.  It is true that in the present situation&mdash; to the credit of this Government and of its predecessors in Government&mdash; any reasonable case for clemency, such as the recommendation of a jury or a judge or the concerted effort of people on somebody's behalf, has always been carefully listened to.</P>
      <P>The type of inquiry envisaged by this motion might be of immense value to the Government in a way which they do not foresee at the moment.  This motion should be treated on a non-controversial basis and as indicating a desire on the part of members of this House to have a certain type of inquiry made.  The result of that inquiry would have to be brought back to the House to be acted upon if the House in its wisdom considered it necessary to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion does not seek a decision of the House on whether capital punishment should be abolished or not. It merely seeks a decision of the House on whether it would be of value to the House to have a Select Committee make certain inquiries.  I would not be in favour of limiting the inquiry to the narrow scope of the motion because, if you do, you immediately clash on the question of whether you stand by capital punishment or oppose it.  The question needs a deeper probe than that.  The problem is greater than one which can be answered by a mere &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the simple issue. I think the mover of this motion, Deputy MacBride, would be wise to enlarge the type of inquiry necessary. If it is to be limited within the four walls of the motion I feel you are narrowed down to the question of whether capital punishment should go or not.  That is not the matter at issue.  I feel that the motion was put down by Deputy MacBride purely on the basis of inquiry into the general merits and demerits of the whole capital punishment system&mdash;purely with a view to inquiring into what recommendations <Col N="149" /> this House, in its wisdom, might make to delimit the class that might ultimately be subjected to the extreme penalty.  I urge the House to take the motion in that spirit&mdash;not in the spirit of controversy on whether or not a certain form of punishment should go, but in the spirit of a worthwhile inquiry by the House, to be left as a permanent feature of investigation by the responsible committee set up by this House into whatever merits might be in the general question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I would certainly accept any amendment of the motion which I have tabled if I felt that that amendment would assist the Government to accept the motion.  My desire was to have the whole question examined.</P>
      <P>I think it might be quite feasible, in connection with the examination in question, to examine the question of whether we should adopt the different classifications which have been evolved in other countries of the particular type of cases to which capital punishment is applied; though I have some doubts myself as to the wisdom of such a classification here.  Certainly I should be quite prepared to agree to an amendment of the motion in any way to widen the scope of it and to enable a more general examination of the whole question to be made.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donnell, Deputy S. Collins and Deputy MacEoin have pointed out, I am only asking the House to set up a committee of its own members to examine and report to the House on the question of the desirability of maintaining or abolishing capital punishment.  I think that that motion should be accepted by the House.  I do not know what the outcome of the deliberations of such a Select Committee might be: I imagine that in all probability two or three different points of view would be put forward.  The committee would then report to this House and it would be for the House to decide, in the light of the report of the committee, what action it would take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the whole question had been examined in <Col N="150" /> other countries and that the blue books and books of evidence of commissions that were set up in other countries are available to Deputies.  In point of fact, that is not so.  I searched the Library of this House for the books of evidence and they are not here.  Therefore, Deputies have no way of obtaining these reports here.  On inquiry from the British Stationery Office, I learned that the evidence and the report of the commission which, I think, has not even concluded its work in England, runs into something like 17 volumes at the moment.  Therefore, it would be very difficult for Deputies of this House to try to examine all these books even if they were available in the Library of the House.  I doubt if even the Minister for Justice or his extremely competent officials have read these reports or the evidence.  However, apart from all that, I am not necessarily prepared to accept the view of a commission set up in Britain, Belgium or anywhere else.  I consider that conditions here are different.  I think our outlook on and approach to the question would probably be different. Therefore, I think this question should be thoroughly examined by a Select Committee of members of this House.</P>
    <P>I brought this motion before the House because I consider that the State is entitled to take human life only when the taking of human life by the State is necessary for the preservation, or even for the protection, of society. I do not think that the State is justified in taking human life by way of capital punishment if it is not necessary to do so.  If that view be a sound and correct one, then it appears to me that it is up to the Parliament to review from time to time whether conditions are such as to make it essential to maintain capital punishment, to maintain the right of the State to take human life.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the concluding remarks of the Minister were intended to suggest that the abolition of capital punishment would in some way, or in any way, conflict with Catholic doctrine or teaching.  If that was what the Minister intended to convey, I think it was not worthy of the Minister and I think it does not <Col N="151" /> represent the true position.  I think it would be completely wrong if it went out from this House or any responsible person in this House that the Catholic Church was opposed to the abolition of capital punishment. That is not so.  I did not think the Minister would pursue this line, but, if needs be, I can get authoritative pronouncements to bear out my view that the Catholic Church is not opposed to the abolition of capital punishment.  It is unfortunate that there should be any attempt made in a matter of this kind to draw the Catholic Church into it.</P>

      <P>Surely I have the right to say what my opinion is, as far as my inquiries have gone, regarding Catholic social teaching as regards punishment.

      <P>I explained when proposing this motion that I have certain views regarding capital punishment. I knew these views were not shared by other Deputies but I thought the matter was one which should be examined objectively by a Select <Col N="153" /> Committee of this House.  I outlined the various motives and reasons that were adduced for the maintenance of capital punishment.  I reviewed some of the arguments for and against it which were adduced when the matter was discussed fully approximately 100 years ago, when capital punishment used to be imposed for larceny of anything over the sum of 5/-.  The arguments adduced then would appear to be very similar to the arguments adduced now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Murphy, I should like to make this point.  I think that everybody would agree with Deputy Murphy if one were satisfied that the ending of capital punishment would result in an increase in the number of murders or crimes.  But experience goes to show that there has been a reduction in the number of murders in countries where capital punishment is abolished, after its abolition.  I know that the advocates of the abolition of capital punishment urge that that reduction in crime and in murders is due to the fact that capital punishment has been abolished.  I have some doubts myself as to whether that is so. Probably, it might be largely a coincidence. But the fact remains that the crime of murder has not increased in these other countries.  I do not know whether we are an exception, but most of the countries in Europe, certainly those on this side of the Iron Curtain, have done away with it, and their <Col N="154" /> experience has been a satisfactory one. I think nine of the American States have done away with capital punishment, and a great many Central American States have also done away with it.</P>
    <P>The whole question deserves to be examined, and I think we should examine it here and see whether or not the abolition of capital punishment would be likely to cause an increase in crime.  If the weight of opinion is that it would cause an increase in crime, I would agree.  But the point at issue is to have the whole position examined in that light.  I think the matter has probably been discussed longer than it need have been in the light of the terms of the motion.  The terms of the motion purely and simply ask for a Select Committee to be set up to examine the question.  I appeal to the Minister, even though he has very strong views and may be annoyed at the moment, to indicate even now that he will accept the motion, either in its present form or amended in any way he wishes, so as to secure an examination of the question.  I am prepared to agree to any amendment he wishes.  If he has no amendment ready but will indicate at this stage that the Government will agree to an amended form of the motion, I am quite prepared to let the matter stand.  Otherwise, I ask that the motion be put.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Realising that our national resources are underdeveloped because of chronic underinvestment in our own country, and further realising that emigration and unemployment, which are destructive of family life and of the family unit, upon which Christian society is founded, flow from this underdevelopment of our resources, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the financial policy hitherto pursued, whereby the major portion of the savings of the nation is invested in Britain, should be discontinued in order that credits adequate for the development of our resources and for the provision of housing and other necessary services for our people should be made available.</P>
      <P>This motion was tabled some considerable time ago and we discussed a great many of the economic issues involved in the recent debate on the Supplies and Services Bill just before Christmas.  I felt at first that possibly this motion might be unnecessary. However, I think we might now usefully discuss this motion in a somewhat different atmosphere from that in which we discussed the more immediate problems created by the Central Bank Report and the White Paper issued by the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The debate which took place before the Recess was more or less centred on immediate problems.  The intention of this motion is to induce a long-term view of the future economic development of the country.  I think it might be useful if we could have now an objective discussion on these issues without necessarily adverting to the more immediate controversial topics or without covering the same ground that we covered in the discussions before the Dáil adjourned in December.</P>
      <P>I feel we have never really sat down to examine the economic problems of the country in an effort to determine the line of economic development we should pursue since we first obtained control of our own affairs in 1921.  In 1921, when, for the first time since the Act of Union, an Irish Government obtained control of the political and economic destinies of the country, we were handed over an economic structure that had been devised and deliberately built to meet the requirements of the English nation and not the needs of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the centuries that have gone by <Col N="157" /> it was not in Britain's interest to foster Irish development.  It was not Britain's desire to see Ireland's economy expand in any direction.  On the contrary, we were a convenient market for industrialised Britain and she was determined to keep us as a market.  I think it is seldom sufficiently appreciated that probably one of the causes of Britain's anxiety to dominate this country in the past sprang from the fact that she was fearful in some respects of the strength this country might acquire.  It should be borne in mind that at the beginning of the eighteenth century the population of Britain was in the neighbourhood of 7,000,000 and our population was about the same.  I say, without being unfair to the successive British Governments that ruled this country, that it was definitely part of their policy to reduce the population of this country and to prevent the economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the policy of preventing industrial development, preventing economic expansion here, a policy was pursued by the banking system here, which was largely controlled by England, to export Irish capital and invest it abroad.  One of the results of that policy, one of the results aimed at, I would say, by the British Government of the day, was to ensure that there would be no capital in this country that might be utilised for development, that might be utilised to build industries that might cut across Britain's own industrial programme by supplying goods which we would otherwise have to purchase from Britain.</P>
    <P>That is, roughly, the type of structure which we took over in 1921, a structure which was devised to prevent the development of this country, which was intended to prevent the growth of industries, which was intended to ensure that Irish capital would not be invested in Ireland but would instead be invested in Britain. We did not take over control of the country in normal circumstances. Apart from the fact that we were plunged in a civil war, we suffered from many other defects.  We had very <Col N="158" /> few people who were versed or experienced in government or in economic affairs.  Any Irishman who had any experience in government and financial matters or in economic affairs were Irishmen who were usually in the service of Britain and had been employed by Britain here in order to maintain Ireland as a British possession.  Many of them, all of them I should say, were probably steeped in the tradition that the British Treasury had created in regard to Ireland; in other words, that Ireland was not to be developed and that financial policy should aim at securing the investment of Irish capital in England.</P>
    <P>The civil war, naturally, did not favour dispassionate examination of our requirements and, as I have just said, we lacked people of experience in government or economics who were capable really of undertaking the complete construction of a new economy and of a new economic policy. The result was that we took over more or less the economic structure that was handed down to us from the days of British rule.  To a large extent, we have continued to follow the same financial policies.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in derogation of any of the previous Governments.  I do not think it would serve any purpose to seek to throw the blame on any particular Party or any particular Government in the course of the last 30 years for this fact.  I think they all tried to promote industrial development but, in trying to develop the country, we have neglected the most essential factor, namely, the question of the utilisation of our capital resources for development.  We have pursued a faltering, uncertain and often an uninformed economic policy, gone from side to side, used immediate economic issues as election catch-cries when it was thought they would be popular but without really any long-term planning.</P>
    <P>Economics are not a particularly good or interesting subject politically. There are a great many more attractive issues for the election platforms. Besides which, the public generally are not interested in economics; they regard it as a rather mysterious secret science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> I would like to urge upon the House that the economic structure and the economic policies that are suitable for Britain are not necessarily suitable for this country.  Britain is a big industrial country.  We are a small agricultural country.  Britain is a debtor nation.  We are a creditor nation.  Britain is over populated.  We are under populated.  The population of Britain is close on 50,000,000 now. At the beginning of the 18th century it was somewhat over 7,000,000.  In the same period of time our population has been halved&mdash;I would venture to say&mdash;largely as a result of the economic policies which were foisted on this country by our rulers.  Britain is the nerve centre and the economic centre of a vast colonial empire.  We have no colonies.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these factors in themselves should immediately put us on inquiry as to whether the financial system and the economic system of Britain are necessarily suitable to our needs and requirements.  Yet, we seldom seem to examine economic issues from that point of view.  We have blindly followed the same policy that was handed down to us in 1921. We have kept on investing our money in England systematically, investing the savings of this nation in England, very often at low rates of interest, very often at rates of interest much lower than can be secured here.  I am prepared to concede that possibly up to 1931, up to the 21st September, 1931, that policy was capable of defence.</P>
    <P>So long as Britain was tied to the gold standard until 21st September, 1931, those who favoured that policy had the argument that Britain was a very powerful financial and economic power but her currency was tied to gold and was a stable currency. Indeed, those are the very arguments that were raised by the Banking Commission and the Currency Commission when those policies were endorsed by them.  In 1927, when we anchored our currency to sterling, sterling was on the gold standard.  That position subsisted until 1931, but after 21st September, 1931, when Britain went off the gold standard, was there any <Col N="160" /> justification for maintaining the same policy?  Was there any justification for maintaining the same policy after the 3rd September, 1939, when there was a further devaluation?  Was there justification for pursuing the same policy after the 18th December, 1949, when there was another devaluation? Is there a justification to-day, when we are probably on the eve of another devaluation, for still pursuing the same policy?  Are we going to wait until the earnings and the savings of this nation have been wasted away by devaluation, by loss of purchasing power?  Are we going to wait until then to change our policy?</P>
    <P>We have been told by a recent statement that was issued after the meeting of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers that steps were about to be taken to ensure the convertibility of sterling by the second half of 1952&mdash;in other words, within the next few months. It is quite obvious, from the sterling area's balance of payments position, that that cannot be done by normal means.  Is the true meaning of the statement issued that sterling will be devalued again and allowed to find its own level and thus become convertible? It appears to me to be the only rational explanation that can be placed upon the statement that was issued following the recent meeting of the British Commonwealth Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>The only other solution for the sterling area's difficulty would depend upon the willingness of the United States to put her whole financial resources at the disposal of the sterling area.  So far, there is no indication that the United States, despite the very generous contribution they have made, are prepared, in effect, to open their banking account to the sterling area.  Therefore, I am inclined to the view that the statement made by the Finance Ministers concerning convertibility is an indication that the £ sterling will be what is termed, or what will be termed &ldquo;free&rdquo;; in other words, allowed to find its own level. These are serious matters for us.  We have vast sums invested in Britain.</P>
    <P>In a question I asked in this House a short time ago I ascertained that <Col N="161" /> £1,000,000 in 1939 was worth last August £274,000 in terms of import prices; in other words, for every shilling we had in England in 1939 we now have 3d. as far as import prices are concerned, and, of course, import prices is the only thing that matters in regard to external assets.  Are we now going to find that in another couple of months' time that will be down to, maybe, 1d. or 2d.?</P>
    <P>As I have said before, I can understand the arguments that were put forward in favour of maintaining the existing position, that is, maintaining a large portion of our savings in England, so long as England was the economic nerve centre, if you like, of the world or a large part of it.  But anybody who examines the position realistically must now admit that England has ceased to occupy that position and has ceased to occupy it irretrievably. I am not saying it in any condemnation; I see no reason why she should be blamed or feel ashamed of the fact that she has ceased to occupy that position, but we have to face realities.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to read in today's paper the statement made by Mr. Butler, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he pointed out that the present difficulties of Britain were not new, but that Britain had been increasingly in economic difficulties since the beginning of this century. It is the first time, I think, that any British Chancellor has made that admission.  It is a view which I certainly have held for a long time, and a great many people who have examined the position objectively have come to that conclusion.  It is erroneous to think that Britain's present economic difficulties are due to any abnormal set of circumstances.  The abnormal set of circumstances may have increased the difficulties, but the fundamental defect in Britain's economy has become apparent since 1900.  Between the two wars, 1914 and the last war, Britain was running an annual deficit on her trade of £500,000,000.  That deficit was, to a certain extent, concealed by reason of Britain's investments abroad.</P>
    <P>Such investments were large.  She owned oil wells in Roumania, railways <Col N="162" /> in Turkey and in the Argentine, and various properties right through the world, and the income from these properties to a certain extent covered the trade deficit.  When these incomes ceased to conceal the trade deficits, the investments were sold and the capital helped to balance Britain's trade.  In a great many cases, of course, a number of the investments Britain held abroad were lost completely. These investments, which helped to tide her over her difficulties between two world wars, have now disappeared, and she is faced with the same trade deficit, which is increasing.</P>
    <P>Britain is over-populated and cannot maintain her present population.  The economy upon which she was industrialised was built upon the fact that she had a vast empire.  She obtained her raw materials at cheap prices, converted them into manufactured goods and exported them to the colonies.  However, the colonies are gone.  She is no longer able to obtain raw materials at low prices, or to sell manufactured goods to the colonies because they have grown into independent states.  In most cases they supply their own needs and not only that but, in many instances, they are competing with Britain in the world markets.</P>
    <P>The fact which we fail to realise is that Europe has no particular natural advantages over the rest of the world, but was a growth resulting from a number of historical accidents in which the civilised population of the world became located.  If one were to plan a new world to-morrow, one would not plan the centre of it in Europe.  One would choose countries possessing better natural resources, a better climate, and so forth.  In fact, as a result of the development of transport, of civilisation generally and of the colonial spirit, if you like, other countries have been developed to the extent that they are now competing with Europe.</P>
    <P>Britain has lost her colonies and cannot retrieve them.  All these matters are relevant to us in so far as we have chosen to pursue a policy of relying upon Britain to be our banker &mdash;a policy which involves investing our money in Britain.  I would disagree <Col N="163" /> with such policy even if Britain were in a strong position because it seems to me that it compels us to accept an economic structure, an economic policy which is not suited to our needs. However, I am prepared to see the point of view of the man who says: &ldquo;So long as Britain is in a strong position there is a great deal to be said for keeping our money there&mdash;as safe as the Bank of England.&rdquo;  That is no longer the position; we have had three devaluations.  As I said a minute ago, £1,000,000 in 1939 was only worth £274,000 in 1951 so that our banker no longer keeps our money safe.  Mind you, devaluation simply amounts to this.  Your banker comes along and says: &ldquo;Sorry, boys, but I can only pay you 3/- for every pound invested.&rdquo;  If in the ordinary course of your business life that happened, would you leave your money with him?  No, you would have no hesitation in taking it out and putting it some place else.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to urge that we should utilise, as fast as we can, as much as possible of our money for development at home.  The pursuit of the policy I have outlined finds no parallel in any other country of the world as far as I am aware.  Some countries may have a permanently surplus population, but such is not the case with us but rather are we underpopulated having regard to the standards of other European countries. Our population is 111 people to the square mile, while the population of Belgium is in the neighbourhood of 900 people to the square mile, the population of Britain is 600 people to the square mile, and the population of the Six Counties, which is not dissimilar to us from the point of view of climate or soil, is 260 people to the square mile. It cannot, therefore, be said that we are overpopulated and yet we export a higher percentage of our people than any other country of the world.  Other countries may have a surplus amount of wealth and when they have reached saturation point, or the point of overdevelopment, they can no longer find an outlet for their capital at home and must export it.  Britain was an example of such a country until the beginning <Col N="164" /> of this century.  To-day America is looking for an outlet for her capital, but no country in the world, except this country, is mad enough to export both its capital and its people&mdash;the two most important ingredients in the production of wealth, call it capital goods if you like.  As I said before, I am not blaming any particular Government or any particular Party for pursuing this policy because I feel it comes largely from the fact that we have never examined our economy deliberately, dispassionately or objectively.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with outsiders&mdash;economists from other countries &mdash;and they think we are stark mad and assure me that one would not find a parallel for our actions in this regard in any other country.  I would like the House to examine objectively the position I have outlined.  In examining it let the members not blame any particular Party or the Government of yesterday, to-day or to-morrow.  Let them rather examine the position so that we might endeavour to create a national investment policy for our capital resources in Ireland which would provide for the repatriation of our external assets.</P>

Production is being gradually expanded and it is hoped that within a reasonable time ample supplies will be available to meet farmers' orders.</P>

It is so excepted because it is employment of a class that is ordinarily adopted as subsidiary employment only and not as the principal means of livelihood.</P>
      <P>A part-time cleaner in ordinary domestic and commercial premises is usually employed by more than one employer and the employment is normally the principal means of livelihood. In the circumstances such employment does not constitute a class of employment which should be excepted from insurance under the National Health Insurance Acts.</P>
