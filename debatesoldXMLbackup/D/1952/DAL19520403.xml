      <P>On that.  The Social Welfare Bill will not be taken next week.  We are not going to sit in Holy Week to do Government business which could be done at some other time.  There was an occasion, already, on which we left this House sooner than respond to Government pressure to rush Government business in Holy Week.  I think that the Tánaiste must understand that already.</P>

      <P>The Budget which the Minister for Finance introduced yesterday is a cruel Budget.  It is also a Budget which contains wholly unnecessary taxation.  Therefore, it is an unjust Budget.</P>
      <P>So many topics arise out of the speech made yesterday by the Minister for Finance, in introducing his Budget proposals, which urgently call to be dealt with that it is difficult for anybody like me, speaking here to-day, to select the particular topics in the order of priority of their urgency.  I propose therefore, instead of trying to deal with all these problems, to deal merely with three or four of the outstanding features of the Minister's Budget and to leave over for early and urgent consideration in other places and at other times the other matters which will expose the economic fall aries of the Minister's statement yesterday and further demonstrate the ijustice and inequality of the present Budget proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a recent speech, the Taoiseach declared that was his intention and that of his Government to balance the Budget by hook or by crook.  In the light of the Minister's proposals and in the ligt of the disclosures <Col N="1269" /> which, very shortly, I shall make to the House and to the country, that phrase used by the Taoiseach&mdash;&ldquo;by hook or by crook&rdquo;&mdash;takes on a new and very significant meaning&mdash;a meaning which I at once agree was not attached to it by the Taoiseach when he used it.  The country has not yet even recovered from the impact of the first shock of these Budget proposals. It will, therefore, receive a new and a startling shock when it is demonstrated that the proposals contained in the Minister's Budget statement yesterday contained proposals for the unnecessary collection of from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 concealed taxation.  The Minister gave his figures yesterday.  I propose now, quite calmly and in detail, to justify the statement I have made that there are in the Budget proposals which will, in effect, result in raising from the already over-burdened taxpayers of this country a sum of from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 unnecessary taxation.  To justify that figure, I will give six items.</P>
    <P>In the very few hours which we have had in which to study the Minister's speech on the Budget proposals, since the debate on his Budget speech ended last night, we have been enabled to pick out, from the details of his speech and of his taxation, items which amount, in all, to at least £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 of wholly unnecessary taxation. Not merely, therefore, will the people of this country have to face the burden of the colossal taxation that was indicated yesterday by the Minister in his Budget speech, but they will have the added horror of knowing that those proposals are extracting from the pockets of the taxpayers from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 taxation which is wholly unnecessary to balance the Budget this year.  May I remark, in passing, that figure of £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 is not without its own significance?</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the figure which is given in the &ldquo;Table Explanatory of Current Budget, 1952&rdquo; for capital services is £9,277,000.  Is it not legitimate then to suggest when it is demonstrated, as it will be demonstrated, that this Budget proposes to raise from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 of <Col N="1270" /> taxation which is not required for the purpose of balancing the current Budget, that what has really been attempted here in these Budget proposals is covertly and in a hidden manner to finance the capital services which the Minister pretended yesterday he will finance in the way in which they were financed by the inter-Party Government&mdash;that is, by borrowing? He intends by the covert and concealed methods to which I have adverted, to provide the finances for these capital services out of current taxation.  He is doing that in a covert and concealed fashion because he has not the courage to come openly to the people and say, as he and his colleagues have been saying for the last ten months, and for two years before that, that he and they did not believe in the system of financing capital expenditure by the inter-Party Government, and that when he and they got into office again they would finance it out of revenue, and not by means of borrowing, as was done under the régime of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The first item to which I will call the attention of the Deputies is an item of £2,000,000 of unnecessary taxation.  That item entails over-taxation to the extent of nearly £2,000,000 through the medium of the operations referred to by the Minister in his speech yesterday in relation to food subsidies.  In the &ldquo;Table Explanatory of Current Budget, 1952&rdquo;, circulated by the Government, Item 5 on the expenditure side contains a deduction for what is described as a saving on food subsidies amounting to £6.668 million.  In fact, when the proper calculation is made the amount of such savings represents a sum of £8.58 million.  That calculation, and the figure to which I have referred, is arrived at in the following Manner; in his Budget speech yesterday the Minister for Finance stated that the estimated cost of food subsidies for a full year on pre-war Budget levels represents a sum of £15,250,000 or £15.25 million.  At page 45 of his speech he stated: &ldquo;On existing rations and at present prices, food subsidies reduce weekly expenditure per person on rationed foods by approximately 2/-.&rdquo;  He then goes on to <Col N="1271" /> state that these subsidies, amounting to the sum of 2/- per week, have been cut by 1/6 per week or, in other words, that the subsidies are being reduced to one-fourth of their present level. That reduction will only take place three months hence.  For the first three months of the present financial year, therefore, the cost of the subsidies will be at the full rate and will accordingly in the first quarter of this financial year amount to one-fourth of £15.25 million, namely £3.81 million. I repeat: for the first three months of the present financial year food subsidies will cost the Exchequer £3.81 million because the reduction in food subsidies will not take effect until July of this year.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, calculate what the cost will be for the Exchequer in accordance with the Minister's proposals for the remaining three-fourths of the year.  That, of course, will be one-fourth of three-fourths of £15.25 million.  For the benefit of Deputies may I repeat that once more so that it will be quite clear: the full cost of food subsidies to the Exchequer if they had not been altered in the way the Minister now proposes to alter them would be £15.25 million, and one-fourth of three-fourths of that sum of £15.25 million must be calculated because the full cost of the subsidies will not be in operation for the last nine months of the present financial year?  As the food subsidies have been reduced by one-quarter it is necessary to take one-fourth of three-fourths of £15.25 million to find out the precise cost under the Minister's proposals of the reduction in food subsidies, and that figure amounts to a sum of £2.86 million.</P>
    <P>Add these two figures together&mdash;the sum of £3.81 million, which is the cost for the first three months at the full rate of subsidy, and £2.86 million, which is the cost for the remaining nine months of the financial year at the reduced rate of subsidy&mdash;and the figure arrived at is £6.7 million.  That sum, therefore, represents the actual cost of food subsidies for the year 1952-53 at the full rate for the first quarter and one-fourth of the full rate for the <Col N="1272" /> remaining three-quarters of the current financial year.  To get the savings, the real savings, it is necessary then to deduct from the full cost &mdash; £15.25 million&mdash;that sum of £6.67 million, and that deduction leaves a sum of £8.58 million&mdash;that is, in fact, £1.9 million or approximately £2,000,000 more than the saving which is set out at Item 5 of the &ldquo;Table Explanatory of Current Budget, 1952.&rdquo;  Therefore, instead of that figure of £6,668,000 which appears in that table as being the savings on food subsidies the figure of £8.58 million should have been set out and, deducting one from the other, should have shown a saving on the Minister's proposal in relation to food subsidies of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>I might remark in passing that it is again not without significance that the precise figure, or almost the precise figure, which I have demonstrated as being the actual cost of food subsidies, corresponds almost identically with the figure set out in item 5 as being the savings on subsidy.  £6.67 million is the cost of subsidy this year; £6.68 million is the amount set out as savings. Is that a pure coincidence? However that may be, in that summary I have given I have demonstrated that there is £2,000,000 included in the Minister's proposals under this heading of over-taxation.  I think that it is no mere coincidence.</P>
    <P>The second item of over-taxation to which I wish to refer arises from the fact that the Minister's Budget statement contained no provision for a deduction for reserve stocks which are provided for in the Estimates and which, according to the Minister's own statement yesterday in his Budget speech at page 31, amounted to £1.8 million.  Deputies will remember that that figure of £1.8 million was given in last year's Budget estimate to provide reserve stocks, over and above the normal supply, and that the normal supplies of stocks required for governmental purposes at various Government Departments were provided for and were met out of current taxation.  On page 29 of the Minister's speech yesterday, he stated that expenditure on these stocks amounted to almost £1,000,000 less than was provided for because of the difficulty in securing supplies.  I do not think it <Col N="1273" /> has ever been denied, nor can it be now denied, that there was and that there is necessity for making provision for such reserve stocks and that, in fact, provision is made in this year's Book of Estimates for such reserve stocks over and above the normal stocks.  Particularly may we assume that to be so when it is known from the Minister's statement that it was not possible to purchase £1,000,000 worth of stocks for the provision of which money was laid aside last year.  Therefore we know that such a provision is included in the sum of £94,871,623 provided in the Book of Estimates for the coming financial year and that it is not included in the figure for capital services which is Item 3 in the &ldquo;Table Explanatory of the current Budget 1952&rdquo; of £9,277,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement yesterday admitted that the moneys necessary to finance these reserve stocks are properly chargeable to capital and not to revenue.  Accordingly, as there has been no indication of a change of policy in this matter in the Budget statement or in any other statement, we can legitimately assume that the provision for such reserve stocks to be found scattered through the Book of Estimates&mdash;for Local Government, Health, Army, the Board of Works and various other Government services&mdash;will in this year amount to not less than the figure we provided for in last year's Book of Estimates, a sum of £1.8 million.  That is, as I have said, admittedly an item of capital expenditure to be financed, not out of current revenue but out of capital expenditure.  In regard to that £1.8 million included in the Estimates, what the Minister is doing is raising that £1.8 million, which should be raised in the manner appropriate to capital expenditure, by means of revenue.  Therefore, that gives a second item of over-taxation in this figure of £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>I pass to the third item, which amounts to a sum of £1,000,000.  Again, I point out that in the &ldquo;Table Explanatory of the Budget, 1952,&rdquo; Item 4, the provision for proposals in the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, is stated to be a sum of £3,000,000.  In fact, as <Col N="1274" /> I shall show, that provision of £3,000,000 in the table exceeds by £1,000,000 the amount actually required for social services.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, as reported in Volume 130, No. 5, column 642, the Minister for Social Welfare gave his estimate of the charge which would come in course of payment during the rest of this financial year, if and when the provisions for the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill became law, at a figure of something under £2,000,000.  These are his words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These various features are estimated to have the effect of throwing a charge of something under £2,000,000 on the Exchequer over and above what is in the Estimates already, as compared with the charge on the Exchequer of £2,750,000 in a full year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, the Minister for Social Welfare stated that the expenditure relating to his proposals under the Social Welfare Insurance Bill for the remainder of the financial year, after the Bill had come into operation, would be something under £2,009,000. In the Table Explanatory of the Budget, that figure is given at £3,000,000 so that the inescapable conclusion is that taxation is being raised unnecessarily by a sum of £1,000,000, this being the difference between the £3,000,000 stated at Item 4 of the Table Explanatory of the current Budget as being the proposals for social welfare, and the sum of under £2,000,000 stated as being the sum necessary by the Minister in charge of the Bill.  There is another £1,000,000 of over-taxation.</P>
    <P>The fourth item consists of failure by the Minister for Finance to take any account in his calculations for taxation of the amount of money that would be required to be met by taxation for the traditional item known as over-estimation.  That traditional item of ever-estimation is also sometimes spoken of as economies and consists of departmental savings. We estimate for that, and we think it is a conservative estimate, £2,000,000. That provision for over-estimation, or for normal savings, is the figure which, <Col N="1275" /> since the establishment of this State, has been taken into account by every Minister for Finance in connection with his Budget proposals and the framing of taxation necessary to meet the Budget proposals of each financial year.</P>
    <P>Experience has demonstrated over the years that there has never been less than a saving of £2,000,000 each year on departmental expenditure. The Departments are simply not able to spend all the money that is voted to them by the Oireachtas year after year.  However close the Estimates may be or the efforts of those people who are charged with criticising and cutting down the Estimate prepared by each Department year by year, there has been a saving or an economy or an over-estimation&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;of a sum of at least £2,000,000, and the Minister for Finance ought to have taken that by no means trifling figure of £2,000,000 into account when he was framing the Budget proposals which he announced yesterday and which have caused such an appalling shock to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>There is not a word said about it. Even if he was not to take it into account expressly, and even if it was not there or that he did not think it would be there, at least we are entitled to make this comment: that in a figure of £94,871,623, which is the tot of the Estimates for Public Services for the forthcoming year, he ought to have said to himself and to the country that it was legitimate for him, on such a colossal figure, to say that he would cut those Estimates by the very small and trifling figure of 2 per cent.  He would then reach the sum of £2,000,000 which I have conservatively estimated as being the savings that are almost certain to occur and that will certainly occur in the course of the coming financial year. That is another £2,000,000 of over-taxation.</P>
    <P>I now come to the fifth item, an item that we have very conservatively, I think, estimated at over-taxation to the extent of £500,000.  It consists of excess provision for interest on public debt.  In the White Paper entitled <Col N="1276" />&ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1953,&rdquo; prepared by the Government and presented to Dáil Éireann in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Constitution, on page 4, Part III there is provision for the &ldquo;Service of the Public Debt&rdquo; which is charged on the Central Fund, and is one of the Central Fund services. For the year 1951-52 the figure provided for interest was £4,319,767. For this year the provision is £6,389,000, a sum which represents, by deduction of the two figures to which I have referred, an increase of £2,000,000 in regard to interest on the public debt over what was paid last year.  No explanation has been given of that increased figure for interest on the public debt.  We have had no loan.  There is only hope of a loan.  It cannot be explained or, if explicable, it can only be explained, in part, by the provision that must be made this year for a sum amounting, I think, to £600,000 for interest on the American Loan Fund.  That increased figure of £2,000,000 is unexplained and inexplicable so far as we are concerned, except to the extent of the £600,000 for the Marshall Aid Fund.  I think we are being unduly conservative when we say, in reference to that, that there is at least a sum of £500,000 of over-taxation under this head of interest on the public debt.  That is, therefore, another £500,000 of over-taxation.</P>
    <P>I now come to the sixth and last item which makes up the sum to which I referred at the outset of my remarks, and that is the fact that the Minister has made no provision&mdash;or if he has made any he has made inadequate provision&mdash;for the buoyancy of the revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be very buoyant after this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Table explanatory of the current Budget, Part I, the tax and non-tax revenue was shown as amounting last year to an actual figure of £83.9 million.  I have given the wrong reference.  The reference should be to the &ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure&rdquo; to which I have already referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> In Part I the tax revenue and non-tax revenue for 1951-52, the first two items in the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, show that the actual sum received into the Exchequer was £83.9 million.  In the second column the figures are given for the forthcoming financial year based on the same rates of tax as subsisted last year and those rates of tax are calculated to produce, when you add the two items together, the sum of £86.5 million, or an increase of £2.6 million in the revenue for the forthcoming year.  On the same rates of tax as last year the Government expects a buoyancy in revenue of £2.6 million. It is to be hoped that, notwithstanding the efforts of the Minister and his colleagues to damage the economy of this country, the national income will, in spite of them, expand.  It is undoubted that, with an expanding national income, the same rates of tax produce a higher yield and that higher yield shows itself automatically in revenue buoyancy.</P>
    <P>In the year that has just ended that buoyancy amounted to the sum of £6.5 million.  It is far too much to hope that anything like that buoyancy will be shown in the revenue that will be exacted from the cruelly oppressed taxpayers of this country by the unjust provisions contained in this Budget, and accordingly we make the modest provision that the revenue will show a buoyancy to the extent of £3,000,000. It will probably be more but we are taking these figures very conservatively. Those are the six items and I will give a résumé of them and add them up for the benefit of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The first item consisted of over-taxation on the subsidies proposals amounting to £2,000,000.  The second item consisted of over-taxation in connection with provisions for reserve stocks amounting to £1.8 million.  The third item consisted of the over-estimation in connection with the cost of the social security proposals to the extent of £1,000,000.  The fourth item of over-taxation consisted of failure to make any provision for over-estimation, savings or economy amounting to £2,000,000.  The fifth item of over-taxation was in connection with excess provision for interest on the public <Col N="1278" /> debt amounting to £.5 million; and the sixth and last item consisted of failure to take account of the receipts which will come to the Exchequer by reason of the buoyancy of the revenue to the extent of £3,000,000.  Those sums amount in all to the sum of £10.3 million.</P>
    <P>We believe that they are underestimates but we took the figure that I referred to and which I gave at the outset of my remarks.  I said I would demonstrate, as I have demonstrated, that there are in the Minister's calculations something between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 of over-taxation in this cruel and, as I say, for that reason, unjust Budget.  And taking account of what I have demonstrated and the fact that £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 of unnecessary and concealed taxation has been imposed by the Minister on the people of this country in his Budget yesterday, the whole sinister and concealed purpose becomes apparent.  It would have been too much to expect that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, who had attacked our financial proposals in connection with the financing of our capital expenditure projects and our dual Budget for years, would lie down so softly in this Budget as the Minister apparently did yesterday when he just tossed aside this question of capital expenditure and capital projects by merely saying: &ldquo;We are going to do, because we have not time to look into it, exactly what our predecessors did in connection with the financing of capital projects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason why that was dismissed in the Minister's speech yesterday with those few casual remarks was because he had in his Budget proposals the concealed plan and the object of financing those capital projects by means of concealed taxation.  The figure that I have referred to as being the amount of concealed taxation&mdash; unnecessary taxation&mdash;in this Budget amounts to the sum of £10.3 million. The figures for capital services in the table explanatory of the current Budget amount to a little over £9,250,000.</P>
    <P>The over-taxation items amounting to something equivalent to the figure for capital services are no mere-coincidence, <Col N="1279" /> no mere casual happening, when we know that the departmental or official policy, if I may put it that way, has always been that the capital services ought to be paid out of taxation and that the Minister and his colleagues in speeches in this House, when they were in opposition, and in speeches outside this House, since they became the Government, have always alleged that they did not agree with the system of financing adopted in connection with the productive capital services of the last Government.</P>
    <P>May I say here at this stage that, shocked as we were by the provisions of this Budget which, to use the phrase of my colleague, Deputy McGilligan, &ldquo;contains proposals designed to butcher the taxpayers of this country&rdquo;, we cannot help being saddened by the consideration of the damage, the almost irreparable damage, that is being done and has been designed to be done over the last ten months to the economy and the building up of our natural resources which we, in the inter-Party Government, had designed and from which we had such high hopes for the future of the people in the agricultural and industrial productivity of this country and the development of its resources.</P>
    <P>We had created a financial structure of impressive size.  We had designed that financial structure along conservative financial lines.  We hoped we had designed it in such a way as to make it impregnable against assaults of people such as the present Minister who have subsequently successively assaulted it.  The Minister has been going round this country proclaiming the profligacy of the last Government and its expenditure of American dollars.</P>
    <P>Let me bring to the recollection of Deputies and the people of the country our method of financing the capital projects and that very impressive and strong financial structure which we had erected.  We did not dig our hands into the till wherein the Marshall Aid Counterpart Funds were contained and scoop it out and spend it, as the Minister has done this year.  It has been explained again and again, and I shall <Col N="1280" /> only repeat very shortly the system which we have adopted.  In the first place, we went to the savings of the people.  We first took all the savings which there were in Savings Certificates and in the Post Office Savings Bank and other funds of that kind. Then we did what the present Government had not the courage to do.  We went to the people for a national loan and we told them that we were asking them to lend to the Irish Government their surplus savings.  We told them clearly and frankly and in every detail what we wanted them to give their savings to us for.</P>
    <P>We got those savings from the Irish people on three successive occasions. We did not, for that purpose, eat into any of our now supposedly untouchable sterling assets.  But, incidentally, in asking for and getting these savings from the Irish people, we did a service in connection with stopping inflation. Because we got from the Irish people for productive enterprises in Ireland, for the development of Irish national resources, their savings, having told them what we wanted them for, incidentally, we took away that excess purchasing power out of the current money which might otherwise have exerted an inflationary pressure at a time when real inflation might be said to have existed.  Then, having got the small savings and having got the national loan savings, we then, and then only, had resort to the Marshall Aid Fund to a very limited extent and that was always there as a cushion when we got the loan from the people.</P>
    <P>If the Government at that time, in order to finance the projects of productive national expenditure in which we were engaged, adopted the financial device of getting the moneys that we required before the National Loan had been launched successfully by means of ways and means advances, that money was paid back to the extent that it could be paid back out of the proceeds of the loan.  It was only to the extent of some £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 that a draw was ever made on the proceeds of the Marshall Aid Loan.  That was left there and would have lasted for years had that device been continued.  Had that system of <Col N="1281" /> finance been adopted by the present Government, we would not now be in the position that every farthing of the Marshall Aid Loan is dissipated.  Had the Government gone for a loan, that Marshall Aid Fund could, partially at least, have been kept in funds over a period of the next seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>We did not stop there in our system of finance, because in each and every year&mdash;and this is a thing which, I imagine, is not sufficiently appreciated either by Deputies or the people of the country&mdash;in the Finance Act, we provided out of current revenue raised by means of taxation an annuity of such an amount that would, in a period of 30 years, completely amortise and pay off the entire of the debt we were incurring from time to time and year by year for the purpose of financing our schemes of capital expenditure.  At the end of 30 years, as the result of our financial arrangement and scheme, as a result of that financial structure which we built up, there would not have been a penny increase in the national debt or the public debt in this country.  I want to emphasise that fact because it is not sufficiently known. Our financial arrangement was such that we had made provision for the complete paying off of all the moneys which we would spend on productive capital enterprises and there would not be, at the end of 30 years, one farthing addition to the public debt of this country.</P>
    <P>Where has that structure gone now? The Minister was not able to raise a loan last year.  He gave a childish explanation in his Budget statement. I shall not make more than a passing reference to it.  He was not able to raise a loan last year and he has brought about almost irreparable damage to the business, industry and agriculture of this country.  That is why we feel saddened at the ruin of our hopes, founded on solid facts and achievement and evidenced by the fact that we left behind us capital assets of great value to the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>There are one or two passages in the Minister's speech to which I should like to refer.  In pages 4, 5 and 6 of the statement circulated yesterday to <Col N="1282" /> us, the Minister dealt with a very significant portion of his Budget speech.  I refer to the section which deals with employment.  May I trespass on the patience of Deputies by quoting a few passages?  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All over the world during the latter half of 1950, but particularly in the first half of 1951, an immense volume of advance purchasing took place.  It was based on the belief that the prices of basic materials, which had then begun to soar, would continue their upward flight.  This advance purchasing was reflected in corresponding increases in production and in stockpiling by manufacturers and traders.  The tide has now turned, world prices of raw materials are falling and the abnormal production and purchasing of 12 months ago are being matched by a reluctance to buy because a general fall in the price level is expected.  Whether that will come or not is by no means certain, but at the moment at any rate buyers are not prepared to take a chance on it.  They are holding off so that everywhere there has been a heavy slump in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I skip a sentence there.  Then the Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Even here, however, as elsewhere, the fall in demand and the anxiety of traders to dispose of stocks have naturally caused a reduction in new orders, and this in turn has been reflected in lower output and employment in textile, clothing and footwear factories.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I skip another sentence.  The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government cannot force consumers to buy nor is unemployment in the industries affected of the kind which, as in the case of some heavy manual occupations, may be relieved by public works.  There is, however, reason to expect a recovery in activity and employment as a liquidation of stocks nears its end. Provided the price factor is favourable, trade should revive as soon as the individual need for more consumer goods in the form of clothes and footwear becomes significant and <Col N="1283" /> expresses itself in a resumption of individual purchasing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to talk about consumer resistance.  We are entitled to inquire what contribution this Budget makes or the Government is endeavouring to make to the solution of the problem which the Minister so glibly and accurately stated in the passage to which I have referred. That inquiry reveals the fact that, in a situation where trade is restricted, where stocks are piling, and still pile on the shelves of the business community and industrialists, where unemployment is rife, and where industries are on half time and where half the employees are only kept on in sufferance, the Minister's contribution to help the consumer, to increase demand, to help the revival of business, and to put an end to consumer resistance, or else to ease that resistance, which has been so marked since the present Government came into power, was the Budget proposals to increase the prices of ten major commodities.  These commodities are bread, flour, butter, tea, sugar, oil, beer, petrol and whiskey. If high prices for clothing and footwear and other commodities of that kind have caused unemployment and increased consumer resistance what effect can the increases in the prices of those ten more or less essential commodities have on the problem that has to be faced?</P>
    <P>It is proper, I think, to say here at this stage that the Minister, while purporting to set out the problem that confronts this country, has taken no single step to grapple with this problem or to show that he has the slightest realisation of the real nature and extent of the real problem that confronts the country.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave it as his view that what we were suffering from now was not inflation but deflation. He made that statement within the last few weeks.  How is that deflationary situation being met by the Minister for Finance?  We recall the statement of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce some years <Col N="1284" /> ago, when in opposition, that the Irish people ought to have been made realise that instead of spending their own money they ought to give it to the Government to spend on their behalf and that it would be wise for them to realise that their interests would be served by their savings being mopped up by taxation in order that the Government might do the spending for them.  That is what his colleague, the Minister for Finance, is doing in this Budget.  He has put to use, in this context, Budget devices which are only justifiable in an inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech I have demonstrated beyond question that we are not suffering from that type of inflation here.  Therefore, what has been done in this Budget, by the cruel exaction of taxes which have been imposed on the people, is to attack the income of the people and to take from them their savings, therefore utilising an economic device which is only justifiable in periods of inflation if justifiable at all, but a device which is certainly not justifiable in a period of high prices, consumer resistance, unemployment, and increased emigration. Indeed I may say again in passing that if the Minister were serious in all the things he said in his Budget statement and in all the nonsense which he and his colleagues have been speaking about our people spending too much; more than they earn and living beyond their means, and, if the situation was such as he said it was, he ought really to be creating a deficit instead of creating, as he is attempting to create, a surplus by further taxation in his Budget.</P>
    <P>I refer to a further passage, perhaps one of the most hypocritical passages in the Budget statement made by the Minister yesterday.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When scarcities are caused and prices are raised by rearmaments, the ordinary consumer is bound to suffer.  He becomes the victim of the fact that much more exigent purchasers are bidding against him in the world's market, purchasers with whom money is no object, since they can procure it from him and <Col N="1285" /> his like either by open taxation or more oppressively and inequitably by inflation.  In these circumstances, it is an illusion to think that compensation can be secured by way of an all-round increase in remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is an illusion to think that people whose livelihoods are now to be affected by the present taxation; whose incomes are going to be reduced by this taxation are going to be alleviated by an all-round increase in remuneration.  Here again the real object of this Budget is revealed.  Here again we see the policy of the Central Bank brought into operation, and a policy outlined in that infamous White Paper of last autumn brought into its full effect by the Minister's proposals in this Budget.  He is striking at the incomes of the people and cynically asking them when he is increasing their costs by unjust taxation to give him more from their savings.  He indulged in a clap-trap peroration about the confidence he had in the Irish people and the confidence the Irish people had in him but what his proposal amounts to is this: that while all the rest of the world are scrambling in the markets of the world to get the goods they want the Irish people must accept a lower standard of living for themselves; and in case they might spend more than they earn they are not to touch these precious sterling assets which are day by day and week by week rotting and depreciating in so far as they are not being used for purposes other than advancing the Irish economy in the hands of foreigners.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will not have anything to do with projects of capital expenditure.  Revealed in his statement is his attitude that the capital programme of the Government will be limited by the proceeds of public loans or by hidden taxation in this Budget.  That policy is inherent in the Minister's attitude and in the Minister's proposals.  It cuts right across the policy publicly stated both by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when they declared that the Government's programme for capital expenditure would <Col N="1286" /> be financed not merely from current savings but from past savings as well. That policy, emphasised by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has no part in this Budget introduced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  He will not have anything to do with external disinvestment, which both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues have admitted is necessary if we are to continue to do anything for the amelioration, if not the full development, of our natural resources.  The Minister for Finance will have nothing to do with anything that cannot be financed by taxation, although he pays lip service to savings without any constructive plan to secure savings and although he made a passing reference to the financing of capital projects by public loan.  We are going to have no more houses, no more hospitals, no more capital development in regard to economic amelioration, no development of our resources unless the money can be got either by savings or by taxation.</P>
    <P>How can there be savings with the crushing burden that it imposed upon our people by the Minister's unjust and unnecessary proposals?  How can the Minister hope to get any loan in the circumstances in which this Budget is introduced?  How can there be any excess saving by the people?  How can they be encouraged to save, even small amounts, when there has been no plan or campaign, and certainly no plan and no campaign stated in this Budget that is a practical proposition, in reference to the encouragement of thrift and savings by our people?</P>
    <P>The Minister naively stated, at page 40 of his speech: &ldquo;I presume we may take it as common ground also that the current Budget must be balanced.&rdquo; To that principle, we on this side of the House, in or out of Government, have always subscribed.  The Minister for Finance and his colleagues went throughout this country slandering Deputy McGilligan, the Minister for Finance in the last Government and defaming his colleagues, stating that they were profligate and that the Budget of last year would not balance. We have given the lie to those slanders <Col N="1287" /> and disproved that defamation.  We have demonstrated&mdash;and Deputy McGilligan here yesterday in a few short words produced the figures that cannot be denied&mdash;that our Budget for the year ended a few days ago balanced and comfortably balanced.  I hope we will have an end to those slanders and those lies.  I want to repeat that last year's Budget balanced and comfortably balanced and that anybody who repeats those false statements is indulging now knowingly in what he he must believe in his heart to be a foul slander upon public people who have given their services to the amelioration of conditions for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be an end to that; we have always subscribed to that principle and we now subscribe to it, but what we do not subscribe to is the method adopted by the present Minister in this present Budget of imposing upon the people cruel, unjust and unnecessary taxation by a concealed method, not taking account of the six items to which I have referred and which probably could be ascertained if we had time to do so.  We have not taken account of these.  They have been imposed in a covered manner on the people of this country.  That will be an additional shock which the people will have to learn from this day onwards.  They were shocked to know that they had to bear that colossal burden announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  I do not know whether it will be any alleviation to them or not, or whether they will be further startled by the facts which we have brought out to-day, that of that colossal sum £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 was unnecessary and ought not to have been imposed in this present Budget.</P>
    <P>What is going to be the effect of this Budget?  We have no doubt as to the effect it will have on the working people.  It has been expressed to me last night that the effect upon the middle classes is that nothing was left undone by the Minister and his colleagues in his Budget except to provide for the unfortunate middle-class people a lethal chamber in which to get rid of their troubles and their <Col N="1288" /> miseries.  The impositions that will be placed upon the workers will undoubtedly bring about an additional demand for increased wages.  There can be no question whatever about that.  Those wages are going to be demanded on far more solid grounds than they could have been demanded a week ago and with greater justification. But they are going to be asked from employers who will not be able, however much they wish, to give the increase that not merely will be desired but that equity will demand should be acceded to.  How can employers be expected to meet such demands, having gone through the frightful period through which they have gone in the last ten months since the present Government came into office, with recession of trade and industry, with consumer resistance, with the situation of uncertainty and lack of public confidence existing through out the country, with the position that they did not know whether to buy or sell, what was going to be the movement in international markets or what was going to be the trend of prices? There are very few businesses or industries in this country which have earned even sufficient to pay their way in the last ten or 12 months. Those employers in such industries will now be faced, as a direct result of the taxation imposed by this Budget, with an increase in wage demands. They themselves are subjected by this Budget to further increases and further difficulties in the way of carrying on their trade.  How can they meet those demands in those circumstances? That is what the position which will have to be faced will be. The Minister for Finance cynically, with the approval of his colleagues, has done another very significant thing. He has carefully avoided taking any step, even a step which was open to him to take, for the alleviation of any set of taxpayers in this country.  The Minister and his colleagues would not even raid the Road Fund, which was the traditional method for any Minister for Finance in the past to get money in ease of the hard-pressed taxpayer. They avoided that.</P>

      <P>When the Minister came to make his final calculations yesterday he found that he was only £800,000 short.  He had to close a Budget gap of something like £15,000,000 or £16,000,000, and he found himself only short of £800,000.  What did he do.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot reduce food subsidies.  I cannot pave the way for the increase which everybody in the community will have to suffer in connection with food and other essentials by the proposals I am making.  Therefore, I must give a belt to the income-tax payer.&rdquo;  Although it was not necessary in this Budget, the income-tax payer, who is a soft mark for every Minister for Finance, was attacked and it is necessary for him to pay 1/- extra in the £.  Some ridiculous and very limited alleviations are put in to try to give a face to the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said enough to show that I was more than justified in the statement I made at the outset of my remarks to the effect that this Budget is not merely a cruel Budget but an unjust Budget.  I feel I am also justified in saying that, far from the people in this country rallying to the clap-trap cry which was comprised in the Minister's final peroration in the Dáil yesterday, they will rise up at the first opportunity they can get and put this present Government out of office. So far as we are concerned, the sooner that day comes the better.  I have no illusions as to the task which will face any Government that comes into office as the successors of the present one. I do not like to think that any group of Irishmen would deliberately do such damage to their own country as the present Ministers have been doing, are doing and did as the climax of their operations by means of the Budget that was introduced yesterday.  In my view, we can describe the Minister's proposal as a terrifying combination of stupidity and courage, and in that combination tyranny consists.  Fianna Fáil, as a Party and as a Government, always like the lash of taxation and the fetters of Government Order and Regulation.  They prefer to tax rather than to alleviate the people.  They prefer to do the spending of the savings of the people rather than allow them to do it themselves.  It will not <Col N="1290" /> be an easy task for any Government which succeeds the present Government to undo the damage they have done and which will come as a result of their Budget proposals when put into effect.  At least, I think we can have some hope that by the application of wisely-conceived policies in a national patriotic impulse all may eventually be well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The calculations which Deputy Costello made to support his contention that taxation is being imposed unnecessarily were based upon three asumptions, firstly, that the Revenue Commissioners are incapable of estimating accurately the yield from taxes; secondly, that the Department of Finance is incapable of estimating accurately the interest on the public debt; and thirdly, that the accounting officers in every Department are incapable of estimating the cost of the services administered by their Departments. Does anybody believe that? Deputy Costello's calculations were based upon such obvious fallacies that, I am sure, most Deputies saw them at once, and that it is not necessary to expose them further.  Why did he take that line?  Why did he choose to build upon ridiculous assumptions and fallacious calculations a case that taxation was being imposed unnecessarily? He did it, because he wanted to avoid putting before the House any alternative to the Budget proposals. Whatever the basis of the calculation was, and the basis is the experienced judgment of the Government and its advisers, a deficiency of £15,000,000 approximately is expected this year. Somehow or another, that deficiency has to be met.  Deputy Costello, in the course of a speech lasting an hour and a half, made no suggestions as to how that gap could be closed.  Mr. McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, speaking yesterday, equally avoided making any suggestion for the solution of that problem.  I will admit that there is a possibility that the estimate may be slightly wrong.  At this time of the year, it is not possible to calculate to the last penny the probable cost of a variety of Government services or the probable yield of a number of taxes.  However, our <Col N="1291" /> experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.  Even if we assume that it is in this year as great as 10 per cent., it is obvious that a very substantial addition to the revenue must be secured by higher taxes, or, alternatively, that expenditure must be drastically curtailed. That is the problem the Dáil is being asked to consider.  The Minister for Finance has put before the Dáil a number of proposals for bridging that gap involving both higher taxes and reduced expenditure.  Any Deputy who wants to criticise those proposals has an obligation to put forward some alternative to them.  We cannot bridge that gap in the national revenue by passing resolutions here, by recording protests here.  The gap is there.  It is a hard fact and either we have to cover it by higher taxes or we will put the Government in a position in which it will not have the money to pay for all the services set out in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputies cannot be expected to approach this serious financial problem without regard to Party political considerations and that it is an obvious political handicap for any Government to have to come to the Dáil with proposals such as the Minister for Finance made yesterday.  But is it not ridiculous to suggest that we are doing that unnecessarily?  Do Deputies opposite think that members of the Government do not realise, as clearly as they have shown that they realise it, the unpopularity of increasing taxes?  Do they think we have done it for the fun of it?  Do they think that we regard ourselves as having any obligations in this matter except to keep the impost on the people at its minimum having regard to our other responsibilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the situation may be next year or the year after, the present Government has in this year the responsibility of making proposals to the Dáil for covering the gap between revenue and expenditure.  We could have approached the problem of that gap from one direction or another.  We could have said to the House that the <Col N="1292" /> undesirability or the unpopularity of increasing taxes was so great that we proposed instead to spend less and then we would be under obligation to indicate the particular expenditures we were going to curtail.  Or we could have come to the Dáil with proposals to cover by increased taxation the whole of the expenditure set out in the Book of Estimates.  We have combined both methods and we have presented our proposals here.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government was to spread the burden, the unquestionably heavy burden, over the community in such a manner as to produce the least hardship and to minimise its economic consequences.  If Deputies want to deal with this matter seriously, to live up to their responsibilities, then they cannot criticise these proposals of the Government without submitting some alternative proposals in their place. The former Minister for Finance has not done so.  The former Taoiseach has not done so.</P>
    <P>Just in case anybody might take seriously his calculations, I want to deal briefly with them.  I have said that the fallacy underlying each of them was obvious.  In fact, as I listened to him, I had a picture of the discussions that must have proceeded within the Coalition Government whenever these financial problems were being considered there and, through that picture, an explanation of the financial mess that the Government is now trying to clear up.</P>
    <P>We are told that we have underestimated the saving from the reduction in food subsidies.  Deputy Costello went to considerable trouble to justify that assertion but he left out of account several things that many Deputies, I am sure, noted.  First of all, they know that we are now eating last year's wheat.  It is obvious, therefore, that the decision of the Government to give a higher guaranteed price to the Irish farmer in this year for wheat which will not become available for consumption, or the cost of which will not have to be borne upon the subsidy until next September, and the fact that we will have to pay a higher price for imported wheat of this year's harvest which will not become available <Col N="1293" /> until next August and the cost of which will not be borne on the subsidy until next August, mean that the cost of the flour and bread subsidies in the second half of the year will be very much higher than in the first half. Therefore, simply deducting one quarter of the total cost of the subsidies as representing their cost in the first three months of the financial year is completely fallacious, completely erroneous.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday that with the abolition of bread rationing the quality of bread will be improved by the reduction of the rate of extraction from 85 per cent. to 80 per cent., which will further increase the cost of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>The House can take it that the calculations made by the Minister for Finance as to the saving on subsidies following all the changes he announced, including the changes in the social welfare services, have been accurately made.</P>
    <P>I could not follow Deputy Costello in his reference to deductions from the cost of supply services in respect of reserve stocks.  May I say that the cost of each of the supply services has been accurately calculated and there has been deducted from that cost every item of expenditure which Deputy McGilligan last year chose to describe as a capital investment?  There is, therefore, no element in that sum which could be so described and in so far as any expenditure is contemplated upon reserve stocks in this year and that expenditure could legitimately be described as an investment, then the amount has been deducted in calculating the bill which the taxpayer has to meet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello said that in providing £3,000,000 for the cost of the Social Welfare Bill we were providing £1,000,000 more than was required. He, of course, made that calculation by the simple process of misquoting what the Minister for Finance said.  The Minister said he was providing, in addition to the amount which the White Paper showed to be necessary, £3,000,000 to cover the estimated cost of the Social Welfare Bill and other charges expected during the year and contingencies which may arise.</P>
      <P>In calculating the amount required to be provided against costs not covered in the Book of Estimates the Government had in mind legislation which it intends to ask the Dáil to enact during the course of the year and there is no excess provision in that item.</P>
      <P>Last year, in similar circumstances, Deputy McGilligan provided £1,500,000 against the cost of the Social Welfare Bill then under discussion and other charges expected to arise.  In fact, the additional charges that arose against which that £1,500,000 was provided amounted to £7,500,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello then fell back on the old expedient of assuming that there was over-estimation of the cost of the supply services.  May I say that in its anxiety to minimise the charge falling upon the taxpayer this year the Government, long before the Budget was prepared, went through every supply service with a fine comb and eliminated from each Estimate, from each sub-head of every Estimate, any charge that it was thought might not fall for payment during the course of the financial year?  It is not true that provision for over-estimation has been made in every Budget.  It was not made last year and it would be completely improvident to assume any substantial over-estimation this year knowing, as we do, that each Estimate has been cut down to the bone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if any Deputy seriously believes that the Department of Finance cannot calculate the interest that will have to be paid during this year upon the national debt. <Col N="1295" /> Deputy Costello I think was not very confident about that figure.  He did, during the course of his remarks, begin to see that a new charge would arise this year, a charge of £600,000 in respect of interest upon the dollar loan.  I think that the outcome of the year will show that the estimated cost of the interest on public debt is accurate to a £.</P>
    <P>Then, in order to bring his total up to the £9,000,000 he wanted to reach, he assumed that the Revenue Commissioners could not calculate the yield of taxes and that in fact the Government would get some £3,000,000 more than the Revenue Commissioners advised it is going to get.  As the House will have known from the White Paper, the Government is in fact assuming that the taxes which were in force last year will bring in more money in this year and in making that assumption the Government went to the limit that prudence would justify.  It is, I know, not an easy matter to estimate in advance the yield of a number of taxes in any financial year.  It is a matter upon which the Government must exercise its own common sense, applied to the Estimates furnished by those who are competent to advise upon the matter.</P>
    <P>What I have said, I think disposes of Deputy Costello's suggestion that we are imposing taxation unnecessarily to the extent of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000.  Will anybody tell us why we should do it?  Is there any sane man in the country who thinks that the Government would impose taxation to the extent of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 unnecessarily?  We realise exactly how large is the political burden which we are carrying and will have to carry in the future because in the discharge of our obligations to the country we have to impose heavily increased taxes this year.  Does anybody think that we are carrying that burden for the fun of it?  Yet that was the whole basis of Deputy Costello's speech here to-day.</P>
    <P>I refuse to take seriously, in the course of this discussion, any Deputy who criticises the proposals of the Minister for Finance for bridging the <Col N="1296" /> gap between revenue and expenditure and who does not at the same time give his own idea of how the gap should be covered.  If they think that there are other taxes which should be substituted for the taxes proposed let them say what they are; if they think that instead of taxing we should have cut expenditure then they are obliged to indicate the expenditure they think should be cut.</P>

      <P>It is an easy matter to describe the Budget as brutal and cruel; we are dealing with a brutal and cruel situation; there is no easy way out of it.  For a number of years the national finances have been allowed to get into a condition because, of which sooner or later a Budget of the kind introduced yesterday would be necessary.  The whole position of the national revenue has to be adjusted brought into closer relationship with the increased expenditure, and we have at least this consolation; it is almost a once-and-for-all process; if the Government can succeed in its intention of keeping the overall expenditure on public services within the present limit then we know that no similar adjustment of taxation will be necessary in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to consider whether in fact, the taxes which we imposed are likely to have the drastic economic consequences which Deputy Costello described.  During the course of many discussions here it was suggested by Deputies that the effort to end the partitioning of Ireland would be strengthened if we maintained here a level of social services and of health services at least as good as those operating in the Six Counties and the force of that argument was obvious to everybody.  I am sure, however, that Deputies who used it did not contemplate that it would be possible for us to have equivalent social services without equivalent taxation.  Yet we are improving the <Col N="1297" /> position for social services and expanding the scope of State activity in the improvement of social conditions while at the same time, even with these new taxes imposed by the present Budget, the cost of all the commodities affected is still very much less than it is in the Six Counties.  Even with the additional 4d. taxation the price of petrol here will be the lowest in Europe; even with the additional 7d. to the cost of cigarettes the price of cigarettes here will be very much less than it is in the Six Counties or in Britain; so also will the price of beer and the price of spirits.  We cannot hope to avoid forever the tax burden which other countries have had to bear in order to meet the expansion of State activity, an expansion which is taking place here just as definitely as elsewhere. We do not like to have to bear increased taxes upon these commodities and it is not much consolation to know that the present taxes are still much less than the corresponding taxes in neighbouring countries, but Deputies cannot urge all through the year that our expenditure on various services should be brought up to the same relative level as in Britain or in Northern Ireland unless they are prepared to contemplate taxes rising as well.</P>
      <P>I thought it desirable to intervene early in this debate because the House will desire to know what is contemplated in respect of the foodstuffs affected by the subsidies.  I think that insufficient publicity was given in this morning's newspapers to the fact that there will be no change in the cost of any of these rationed foodstuffs or in the rationing arrangements relating to them until 1st July next.  I think it would be desirable and would prevent the possibility of misunderstanding by traders or by members of the public, if the newspapers would give wider publicity to the fact that no immediate change is contemplated in respect of these commodities.</P>

      <P>I am talking about subsidised foodstuffs.  It is the Government's intention that simultaneously <Col N="1298" /> with the disappearance, in some cases, and the reduction in the case of flour and bread, of the subsidies and the operation of higher prices for these foodstuffs, there will come into operation increased payments under all social welfare schemes.  The aim is to effect both changes simultaneously in the first week in July.  The effect of the subsidy changes contemplated is, as the House has been told, to increase the cost of these foodstuffs to each individual by approximately 1/6 per week.  In July, because of the higher rates of benefit which will become operative when the Social Welfare Bill is passed, all persons who are out of employment and in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit or of national health benefit, or who are widows or orphans, will be very much better off than they are now.  The additional payments they will receive will very substantially exceed the additional charges they will have to meet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will introduce forthwith amendments to the Social Welfare Bill designed to increase the old age pension and the unemployment assistance payments so as to ensure that the beneficiaries under these schemes will be no worse off either in July next. It is clear, therefore, that the effect of the higher food prices will be confined to persons who are in employment and for them it is contemplated that the burden will be substantially eased by a rather considerable extension of the children's allowances scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, under that scheme, the head of a family with three or more children is entitled to draw 2/6 <Col N="1299" /> per week in respect of every child from the third on.  Under the new proposals which will be submitted to the Dáil in the near future, there will be paid in future 2/6 in respect of the second child and the payments for the third and subsequent children will be raised to 4/- per week.  The effect therefore of the changes in food prices on families with two or more children related to increased children's allowance is to raise their weekly expenditure by 3/6 per week.  In respect of a number of these families, however, and particularly workers in city areas and tradesmen in all areas, the changes in the income-tax code which the Minister has announced will reduce considerably the amount they will have to pay in income-tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello spoke here as if the effect of the income-tax changes was to impose new burdens upon the majority of income-tax payers, and particularly upon what he described as middle-class people.  The fact is that under the arrangements proposed the great majority of income-tax payers will pay less, and, in respect of persons with earned income, in the case of a single man earning up to £850 per year or less, his tax will be reduced; in the case of a married couple, a reduction will apply if the family income is £1,000 per year or less; in the case of a family with one child, it will apply if the income is £1,100 per year or less; and in the case of a family with two children, it will apply if the income is £1,200 per year or less.  Even in the case of people with unearned incomes, there will be a reduction in the tax payable where the income is £400 a year or less.  The Minister for Finance has drawn my attention to the fact that reductions in the tax payable are greatest in the range from £300 to £500 per year.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies have ever considered these food subsidies to be a permanent arrangement.  They were certainly never introduced as a permanent arrangement.  When they were first inaugurated away back in 1941 and when they were considerably extended in 1947, it was made clear that they were regarded as a temporary <Col N="1300" /> device to stabilise the cost of living over a period in which abnormal factors appeared to be operating.  With the disappearance of these food subsidies and their replacement by increased social welfare payments, however, it must be noted that a temporary aid is being withdrawn but a permanent aid is being substituted for it.  It is certain that the food subsidies and the rationing they necessitated would have ended some time.  The improved social welfare payments for which provision is being made will remain permanently in force.  In the case of flour and bread, there has been from many quarters a demand for the abolition of rationing and the House, I think, is aware that rationing of flour and bread could not be terminated without increasing the price, because the danger of providing rationed flour and bread at a price so subsidised that it would be the cheapest form of animal feeding was so great that it could not be risked.  The Government, in deciding upon the modification of the flour and bread subsidy and the abolition of rationing of these commodities, had necessarily to put the price of flour at the lowest point at which the danger of the purchase of flour for animal feeding would be eliminated. There are, in fact, some reasons to think that at present prices the margin of difference is not great enough, but I rather think that in the course of the year the margin will vary so as to minimise the risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be cross-examined.  There are obvious advantages in ending the flour and bread rationing.  The present rationing system operates most unfairly.  It is true that in the cities there are many people who find that the existing ration is more than enough for their needs.  On the other hand, there have been repeated complaints from rural areas, and particularly counties on the western seaboard, that the existing ration is altogether insufficient.  There was, for a time last year, evidence of a black market springing up in some western counties for bread and flour <Col N="1301" /> sold off the ration.  Restrictions on traders and the elimination of trade competition and rivalry also produced undesirable consequences.</P>
      <P>With the change now contemplated, bread rationing will cease.  It is known by the House, I think, that in addition to the 85 per cent. flour now being produced and sold on the ration at the subsidised price there is also available a 75 per cent. flour which is being sold at a price higher than would be justified by its cost production, a 75 per cent. flour which is sold at a profit to the Exchequer.  The intention is to make available for all purposes an 80 per cent. extraction flour.  That will be a very much better quality flour than is now available. It will not merely be more nutritious but it will also be less wasteful.  By reducing the extraction from 85 to 80 per cent. we also will make available an increased supply of bran and pollard which is also desirable.  It is clear however that the abolition of rationing means that subsidised flour&mdash; flour subsidised at the new rate&mdash;will be available for the producers of fancy bread and biscuits who are now paying an uneconomically high price for the 75 per cent. extraction flour; and therefore some reduction in the price of biscuits and other foodstuffs produced from the 75 per cent. extraction flour is to be anticipated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, open to any flour miller who wants to do so, to continue producing the 75 per cent. extraction flour.  There are some people who consider that their health requires that they should consume flour of that extraction.  It will still be possible for them to get it at the full economic price if any flour miller wants to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to estimate to what extent the consumption of flour and bread may increase by reason of the abolition of rationing.  In calculating the cost of the flour and bread subsidy under the new conditions and at the new rate, we have assumed that there will be some increase in consumption&mdash;<Col N="1302" /> and that fact also invalidates Deputy Costello's calculations as to the saving following upon the subsidy alterations. I have had some concern about the possibility of a substantial increase in the consumption of flour and bread. We do not know yet what the outcome of our own harvest in this year is going to be and there may be some difficulty in maintaining full supplies of imported wheat.  On the whole, we have thought it reasonable to assume that we could maintain a supply of wheat from home and outside sources sufficient to provide all the flour and bread which our people wish to consume.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to tea is somewhat different.  Most people have forgotten that before the war there was a variety of teas on sale at different prices and intense competition between tea blenders to get sale for their particular products by improving the quality and by cutting prices.  All that competition in the sale of tea disappeared with the introduction of rationing.  We set up then a bulk-buying organisation which bought all the tea we could get and that tea is sold to wholesalers at a flat selling price, so that it is available for purchase at the present time, on the ration or off the ration, at fixed prices without any variation according to quality or blend of the tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable that we should get back not merely to free sale of tea but to competitive trading in tea. Experience in other countries has suggested that if we do so there will be available on the market blends of tea at prices much lower than the average prices if all tea were sold at that price. The position, however, is slightly complicated by the fact that we have available in the country a substantial stock of tea at the present time, purchased by Tea Importers Ltd. and held as a general national reserve.  While different grades of tea can now be priced separately and sold at varying prices to tea blenders who will themselves decide the blends they wish to prepare, there may not be in it a sufficient variety of all teas to permit <Col N="1303" /> in this year of the multiplication of blends to pre-war numbers.  I think that we can do something to improve on that position, however.  May I say that it is necessary to maintain for the present bulk buying of tea by Tea Importers Ltd.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will buy it in competition, then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a difficult process, at any time, moving from the position of a central bulk-buying organisation to one in which wholesalers make their own purchases abroad.  We have, as national policy&mdash; which.  I initiated and which my successor supported&mdash;withdrawn from the London Tea Market.  We are now dealing direct with the countries of origin.  We know that the Government of India would regard it as an unfriendly act if we were to cease the practice of buying tea direct in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the transition from the position in which all our tea is purchased by one bulk-buying organisation to one in which private independent firms would be able to buy, will be conditional upon methods being devised to ensure that direct trade with India and other producing countries will be continued.  In this year, however, any tea blender who wants to put upon sale a blend which is not possible from the varieties held by Tea Importers in stock, will be able to extend those varieties by placing orders with Tea Importers Limited, for the kind that he wants.  We will facilitate Tea Importers, if necessary, in purchasing that tea in London or elsewhere in the present year.  For next year the arrangement will be that wholesalers will make known their requirements to Tea Importers Limited, and Tea Importers Limited will buy tea in bulk in accordance with these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The derationing of butter also offers some problems.  I think the House is <Col N="1304" /> aware that the consumption of butter per head has doubled since before the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That calculation may credit us with the substantial quantity of butter exported across the Border but in so far as we have to rely upon known statistics that would appear to be the position.  The bulk of the butter used in this country is produced in the summer and even if we have had this considerable increase in consumption per head there has not been a corresponding increase in Irish output.  I did not hear any &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there has. Did we not produce all the butter we wanted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that there will be a problem of cold-storing butter to meet winter needs and possibly of importing butter for a limited period to supplement our production.  The intention is that the price of butter to the consumer will be related to the economic cost of its production on the present price of milk, and to maintain that price throughout the year so that if cold-storage charges have to be met or if expenses should be incurred in connection with the importation of butter to supplement home output then some continuing subsidy payment of a limited amount may be required to achieve that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sugar, again, is in a different position. There is no Exchequer interest in sugar.  The alteration of the price of sugar or the derationing of sugar will not mean anything to the Exchequer.  At the present time one half of our sugar requirements are purchased at 4d. per lb. and the other half at 9d. per lb.  On the face of it, that seems to be a foolish arrangement.  In any event, it would be undesirable to maintain in existence all the apparatus of rationing merely to continue that position in regard to sugar.  The average price, therefore, of all sugar will be 6½d. per lb.  That is a simple calculation which any Deputy can make.  If half is sold at 4d. per lb. and the other half at 9d. per lb. it can <Col N="1305" /> now all be sold at 6½d. per lb., and that will be the price that will prevail. It means that the price of sugar to manufacturers using sugar in their productions will be reduced from 9d. per lb. to 6½d. per lb.  Therefore, there will come into operation, almost simultaneously, a substantial reduction in the price of jams, marmalades and other manufactured foodstuffs in which sugar is an ingredient.</P>

      <P>I wish, a Chinn Chomhairle, I could be allowed to speak without these stupid interruptions from Deputy Dillon.  I think it is desirable that these facts should be made known to the public and that they should realise that this change in food subsidies is not made merely to save money for the Exchequer and will have consequences other than imposing burdens on consumers.  There will be the additional advantage of the end of rationing.  May I interject here to express my personal satisfaction that as the author of all these rationing schemes I also have the task of winding them up.  There will be an improvement in the quality of flour in consequence of the lower rate of extraction. There will be a substantial reduction in the cost of jams and other foodstuffs in the manufacture of which sugar is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope no Deputy was misled by any of Deputy Costello's observations regarding capital expenditure.  There is no intention of curtailing capital expenditure upon what he described as &ldquo;productive capital enterprises&rdquo;. <Col N="1306" /> In fact, the capital expenditure undertaken in the financial year which is now ending was considerably greater than anything which the Coalition Government achieved.  The capital expenditure contemplated in the coming financial year is greater still. There will be substantial difficulty in financing that capital expenditure.  We do not believe it is desirable to minimise that difficulty in the least.  We believe that that capital investment programme is not possible at all unless the Exchequer finances are straightened out.  We believe that people will not be prepared to lend money to the Government for the purpose of financing these enterprises unless there is ample evidence that the Government is taking its own financial responsibilities seriously and is not afraid to face the political consequences of doing so.  Deputy Costello, however, attempted to show that the £70,000,000 added to the national debt during the Coalition's term of office imposes no real burden on the people and is offset by productive capital enterprises.  Will somebody point his finger to these productive capital enterprises?</P>

      <P>A sum of £70,000,000 was the addition to the national debt during that period, of which £40,000,000 is a dollar debt.  I share the view of the Minister for Finance that it is undesirable that we should disinvest abroad or incur debt abroad for any purpose which does not have the effect of increasing our own production to an extent equivalent to the loss of purchasing power abroad for any purpose which does not reduce our imports or extend our exports in corresponding degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> We cannot afford to dissipate the external assets of our people upon other than productive purposes, and I mean productive in the economic sense. To the extent that we wish to invest in hospitals and houses and social improvements, we must endeavour, if we are to keep our financial position straight, to raise the money for that purpose from the savings of our people. Every week now produces a newspaper report that some other country has reached the end of its ability to live on capital.  Deputies have only to read the headlines to understand that other countries have been trying to do what we were doing for the past three years and have come to the end of their ability to continue it.  We are not at the end of our ability yet&mdash;that is true &mdash;but we do not want to get there because, if we ever reach that stage, then the prospect of securing the investment in productive capital enterprise here, which is necessary as a permanent solution of our economic problems, will become impossible.</P>

      <P>Deputy J.  Costello asked what contribution the Budget makes to our particular situation.  It is quite true that we have at the moment, like all other countries, difficulties in many directions due to slackness of demand; whether that slackness is due to an expectation that prices will fall or a reluctance to pay present prices in any event, it is difficult <Col N="1308" /> to say.  It is impossible to forecast how the &ldquo;price cat&rdquo; will jump. There are many indications that the prices of basic raw materials will come down.  There are other indications which suggest the opposite.  It is a period of uncertainty and a period of uncertainty is always a period of trade difficulty.</P>
      <P>I think that it is possible for us to take measures here which will minimise for our industrial producers the consequences of that world situation. Many of these measures have been taken already and it is largely in consequence of them that the Minister for Finance was able yesterday to say that the effect here has been less severe than in many neighbouring countries. There are other measures of a similar kind open to us and in so far as these measures are in line with the general policy of reducing the deficit in our external trade they can, I think, be taken without risk of serious detriment either to the present trading position or to the country's economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>We recognise, of course, that the increased cost of beer and spirits and tobacco may involve a reduction in their consumption.  The estimates of the yield of revenue from these increases have been made upon that assumption.  The House is, I think, aware that there has been a very extraordinary increase in the consumption of beer and spirits in the past few years and the arresting of that increase, or the reversal of that friend, would not be regarded by many of us as a disaster.  On the contrary, we think that the House, and the country as a whole, is entitled to be perturbed at the very substantial rise in the consumption of beer and spirits in recent years.</P>

      <P>The effect, if any, on employment in the tobacco and brewing industries is not likely to be considerable. I have one further comment to make in relation to some <Col N="1309" /> general observations made by Deputy J.  Costello.  He said it was my policy, as expressed by him, that the Government should spend for the people money that they would otherwise spend for themselves.  That is not my policy at all.  On the whole, I do not think it is desirable that the Government should increase its spending except in proportion to an increase in the national revenue as a whole. The serious aspect of our present position, however, emphasised by the Minister for Finance yesterday is that the total cost of Government&mdash;the total amount that the Government is spending upon the provision of public services&mdash;is rising much more rapidly than the national income.  But if we come here with proposals for social welfare schemes, for health schemes, for an expansion of our education schemes or for any of these projects in which Deputies are interested, we do so because we believe that to be desirable in the interests of the people as a whole that the public should give some of the money that they would otherwise spend for themselves to the Government to spend for these purposes.  If we did not believe that, we should not undertake these projects at all.  The justification for every one of these schemes is the belief that the interest of the whole community requires that the Government should take from the people some of their incomes to spend on these schemes rather than leave them in their pockets to spend as they themselves think fit.  If we cannot convince the people that it is in their interest that they should give up some more of their income in order to make these schemes possible, then there is something wrong with the schemes.</P>
      <P>I believe that the position is that the great majority would clearly prefer to see the Government go ahead with these projects which it has in contemplation for the expansion of social welfare, health and similar services even though it means higher taxation rather than that these projects should be dropped altogether and tax increases avoided in consequence.</P>

      <P>By now the popular reaction to the Budget proposals will <Col N="1310" /> be starting to make itself felt outside this House.  It might well be that in the light of the nature of the proposals the members of the Opposition Parties would be inclined to devote most of their attention to the individual burdens that will flow from these Budget measures so far as individual citizens are concerned.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, however, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in making his speech to-day&mdash;a piece of very nice skating on thin ice&mdash;has in fact posed a question to which it is more important the members of this House should find an answer.  While not admitting it, he has used the phrase &ldquo;a brutal Budget&rdquo; and he has inquired why members of the Opposition should consider that the Government would impose a Budget so described if there was no necessity for it.</P>
      <P>It is from that point of view, I think, we should concern ourselves with the nature of the Budget proposals even though the time that has elapsed since we received them yesterday hardly affords a reasonable opportunity of dealing with them in detail.  Having listened to the Tánaiste to-day, it may be very nice to describe the Budget, so far as the mass of the ordinary people is concerned, as one under which, if they cannot eat as much bread, they can eat cake, or a higher quality bread; if they cannot put butter on their bread, they can put cheaper jam on it.</P>
      <P>I think we should concern ourselves now with what we, as members of this Assembly, have to try to decide in regard to this Budget.  It is all very well for the Tánaiste to come along and say that if the Opposition Parties do not like these proposals they should put up their own proposals.  He did not do that on a previous occasion when he stated it was the responsibility of Government to devise policy and justify it and the responsibility of the Opposition to criticise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must stand over its proposals both here and outside.  If they have any doubt about it there is a remedy in their hands.  It seems to me that the challenge he lays down is one that in the past we saw the <Col N="1311" /> members of his own Party anxious to avoid, but that does not necessarily mean that the rest of us will seek to avoid it in the same way.</P>
    <P>My concern is not so much with the descriptions applied to the Budget, and I have read all of them in the newspapers this morning; I have read a number of opinions from what is called &ldquo;the man in the street&rdquo;.  But there has been one very noticeable exception: the <i>Irish Press</i> has no opinion from &ldquo;the man in the street&rdquo;&mdash;a marked change in respect of their publicity in regard to the two previous Budgets.  Maybe they do not want to hear what the man in the street is saying as some of us have already heard it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we should consider the Budget not merely as an indication of the method of State bookkeeping that the Minister for Finance proposes to follow but, more important still, in relation to the economy and industry of the country.  The Tánaiste, to some very limited extent, did touch upon that because it was quite clear following the speech of Deputy Costello that somebody on the Government side had to deal with that very awkward subject.  The Minister occupies the position not merely of bookkeeper for the Government, although it would seem that the present Minister sometimes regards that as his sole function, but he has also a certain responsibility placed upon him as main adviser of the nation as a whole in respect to economic problems, industrial problems and even social problems.  Therefore, we are entitled to expect from him something more than the headline in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&ldquo;Gap of £15,000,000 closed&rdquo;; we are entitled to expect from him also an understanding of what is the significance of this Budget and its possible effects.  We are entitled to expect that he will examine the position not merely at second-hand through the Statistics Office, or through the officers of his Department, but that he will examine, as a responsible political leader in the country, the whole economic situation, the trends and the immediate future prospects. <Col N="1312" /> It is on the basis of that examination that his bookkeeping will be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Earlier in this House there were a number of attempts to twit the Minister on the manner in which the Government has been recently following the measures adopted by the Conservative Government in England.  I do not think that I could ever be accused of being a Conservative or of being very much in love with the Conservative Party but, in the present situation, I think it might even be of advantage to the country if Mr. Butler sat where Deputy MacEntee is sitting at present.  I want to point out some of my reasons for saying that.</P>
    <P>When the pre-Budget discussions in England were taking place, there was a very widespread view held that the Budget would be an exceptionally harsh Budget.  All sections of the community were preparing themselves for such an eventuality and, when the Budget came along subsequently, one of the criticisms directed against the British Chancellor from members of his own Party and from the City of London was that the Budget was not, in fact, sufficiently harsh.  One thing certain here is that the Minister is not going to have any criticism of that type even, I think, from members of his own Party.  The answer made by Mr. Butler was that when he was considering the final proposals for his Budget he found that he had to have regard to the overall economic position and the changes which, in his opinion, appeared to be taking place, changes which indicated to him the possibility that we were moving from what he regarded as a period of inflation into one of deflation and that, in those circumstances, a tough and harsh Budget might be the very means of intensifying and increasing the rate of progress towards that deflationary period.  Whether that is correct or not is not important, except to the extent that, on this view, his milder Budget has been accepted by the more conservative elements in his Party and by financiers in the City of London.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask from the Minister for Finance, even now that he has <Col N="1313" /> presented the Budget, has he yet made up his own mind or has the Government made up its mind as to what we are facing in this country, because it is not an unfair criticism to say that, since July of last year, almost in every week that has passed, we have had differing statements from every member of the Government?  Therefore, the Budget is interesting not merely in regard to its more intimate aspects &mdash;that is, in regard to the manner in which it affects immediately the lives of the people&mdash;but in regard to what we may expect as a result of the Budget in regard to our present economic position.  I do not think it would be challenged if we described the present position as being one of recession, to use a mild word, so far as industry and business are concerned. We have had the rise in unemployment of 11,000 within the last 12 months. That increase in the main has shown itself in regard to workers employed in industries producing consumer goods and, more remarkable still, in regard to workers who had been enjoying fairly constant and remunerative employment in comparison with the general mass of workers in this country. That recession is not only present in the manufacturing industries but is also reflected in the wholesale and retail trades, and, while there has been some slowing up in the rate of increase in unemployment in the last four or five weeks, we have not yet made any absolute gain as compared with last year.  In other words, we are still in a situation in which we have these enhanced figures for unemployment and this recession; in fact, one could use the word &ldquo;stagnation&rdquo; in so far as two main industries are concerned&mdash; boots and shoes and textiles and clothing. We have a general recession so far as the retail and wholesale trade is concerned.  We have had as a consequence of that a certain increase in emigration.  We have had widespread complaints by manufacturers and traders in regard to the drop in the public consumption of articles of a consumer character.  We have, in addition, the old problem of a static figure for agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;it is something which had taken place before the Budget&mdash;we <Col N="1314" /> have had the increase in the bank rate.  Is that a situation in which we require a Budget of this nature, one which is going still further to restrict public consuming power, particularly in relation to articles produced in these industries which are very heavily affected by unemployment at the moment?  Are we going to benefit by a Budget which, in the eyes of the masses of the people, will represent more difficult living conditions here and, therefore, induce them to seek more equitable and easier conditions outside the country?  Are we going to contribute by a Budget of this character to a revival of trade, both wholesale and retail?  Are we going to make it easier to overcome the recession in the building trade or to provide consuming power in the pockets of our urban dwellers in order that they may assist agriculture to increase production?  Are we going to leave in the pockets of our people money which they could make available without having to have recourse to the banking and credit institutions of the country who have now decided to charge a higher price for the money which they make available?</P>
    <P>It is from these aspects that I think the Budget has to be more particularly examined.  I, personally, feel that, whatever hope we had of a reasonably rapid overcoming of our economic recession, at the moment that hope has very largely disappeared when one examines the Budget proposals. I feel at the moment that it is most unlikely we are going to see the figure of 71,000 unemployed disappear from our records or of our getting back to last year's figures.  I hope that, at the best, there will not be a further increase.  I am very doubtful that we are going to see a restoration of the level of activity that we previously had in the building trade.  I am certain that, so far as most of the wholesale and retail business people are concerned, the outlook for them is going to be fairly good.</P>
    <P>If that is the case in regard to the economic aspects of the Budget, and if we tie that up with the question asked by the Tánaiste: &ldquo;Why do we think that the Government have taken these <Col N="1315" /> measures&rdquo; I think the answer is very plain.  It is not so long since we debated at great length in this House a series of proposals emanating from the Central Bank, designed to meet what they regarded as the fiscal, economic and social problems which they see present in our economy at the present time.  While the Tánaiste, in this House and in his public speeches, accepted the analysis set out in the report of the bank he did refuse to accept on behalf of the Government, or on his own behalf, the proposals put forward.  We have had a very long and detailed discussion of that whole report, the analysis of it and the proposals it contains, and yet I think it is no unfair criticism to say that if the board of the Central Bank had come in yesterday and presented the Budget, instead of the present Minister for Finance, there would hardly have been a comma changed.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, then we have to start and find reasons for it.  It must be quite clear to the Tánaiste, and to every individual member of the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Budget is going to be unpopular, and that they will find great difficulty in defending the proposals put forward in it as the Government's policy. From that point of view, it might make good political capital for the Opposition to forget altogether about the basic problems that lie behind the Budget and to twit Fianna Fáil: to make as much capital as we can as to what are going to be their political difficulties, because I do not think that even the most optimistic member of Fianna Fáil, or even the Minister for Finance can feel that there is going to be any great measure of enthusiasm or popular support for it amongst our citizens generally, or even amongst the stalwarts of the Party.  I could understand the Opposition Parties seeking merely to look at the political consequences of the Budget in so far <Col N="1316" /> as the interplay of forces between the political Parties is concerned.  I could understand, to some extent, Independent members of this House taking the view that, as between one political Party and another, there is not very much to choose, or that, having made their choice, they proposed to stand by; but, in making that decision, they have no right to ignore what is underneath the feet of everyone of us and that is the economic problems and the economic situation.</P>
      <P>May I say, with due respect to my friend Deputy Cowan with whom I have had many old associations in the past, that I think it is regrettable and is a peculiarly cynical reflection on Irish politics that his comment on the Budget yesterday was that it would not suit him to have an election for twelve months.  It might not suit any of us to have an election for twelve months, but at least we do make some attempt to explain our personal difficulties in the light of some reasonably acceptable standards of political and economic principles.  We would find ourselves in a most peculiar position in relation to Parliamentary Government if each and everyone of us, and the Parties, were merely to take that stand.  It would be peculiarly bad if the approach which was shown not merely by Deputy Cowan but also by Deputy Browne, so far as the divisions last night were concerned, were to appear to be concentrated not on an analysis of the serious problems which confront us, but was purely in relation to our personal feelings as individual members of the House, or if the standards which we accepted twelve months ago had to be completely changed and redressed now to justify our present position.  Everyone in politics has to make adjustments from time to time, but I think there are limits to the occasions on which that may be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in so far as this Budget is concerned, we are to have the approach made by Independent Deputies that, because they are so interested in certain features of legislation which they hope to see coming before the House, they have got to ignore the basic economic problems which face us in relation <Col N="1317" /> to this Budget, then they are not doing a service either to the people with whom they are concerned or the country as a whole, particularly when we find that, in relation to the Budget, there is not merely in it a most cynical attitude to the old proposals for improving social services but that it and the legislation regarding the new Social Welfare Bill are being nicely linked together in the very interesting manner revealed in the Tánaiste's speech this morning.  Personally, I feel that the whole approach by the Minister is one that is not going to make for the welfare of the country and will not enable us to overcome our immediate problems.</P>
    <P>I believe that our main danger at the moment arises more from deflation than from any other economic cause.  I believe it was imperative that, in this situation, measures should have been taken by the Government which would help to restore the level of business and industrial activities rather than to repress and confine the natural recuperative forces which are at present within our country.  That is one of the effects that will flow from the Budget and that, I think, is particularly likely to be the result when we not merely examine the whole basis on which the Budget was formulated but when we connect it up with the advance of our bank rate to the English level some weeks ago.</P>
    <P>In so far as the extra taxation and the withdrawal of the food subsidies are concerned, it has been suggested that compensation is being provided for those sections of the people who, quite clearly, will require it.  I submit that that is not merely a wrong but it is a deliberate misstatement of the position. In the first place, it is seeking to work on average figures and, in the second place, it is seeking to ignore certain social aspects that flow from the economic position of the individuals in the families in our community.</P>
    <P>We are told that, in so far as the withdrawal of the food subsidies is concerned, it will represent an annual cost of 1/6 per head per week on the community. Anybody who knows the living habits of our people knows very well that the standard of food consumption <Col N="1318" /> is different.  The particular types of food that are bought by the old age pensioner, by the unemployed man with a family, by the worker in fairly steady and well-paid employment, by the higher-paid middle-class clerical worker and by the person of affluent and independent means are entirely different.  The percentage of certain foods eaten by certain families is entirely different to the percentage of those foods eaten by other families. In effect, what we have done by removing the food subsidies is to increase the price not merely of the basic foods but also of those foods the greatest quantities of which are eaten by the poorer members of the community. We have left untouched the foods that are eaten by the more wealthy sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has examined the economy of a man with a wife and three or four children will note the change that takes place when he is working and when he is unemployed. He will note that the first change which becomes apparent is the very big increase that takes place in the amount of bread bought for that family.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I had to make some inquiries and I actually came across the case of an unemployed man with an income of 40/- a week, 28/- of which were spent on bread.  That was an extreme case but, nevertheless, the fact is that the lower the income of a family the greater is the amount of money that is spent on bread.  That will also apply to sugar and tea and probably to some extent, because of certain habits, to butter.  It is in regard to those particular foods that the full effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies will be felt.</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to provide compensation for those people through the increase in certain social services and also through the provision of a new payment in respect of children's allowances.  Of all the proposals put forward in the Budget probably the most cynical&mdash;it is the one that smacks more particularly of the Central Bank than anything else &mdash;is the suggestion that they are going <Col N="1319" /> to compensate the old-age pensioner for these changes in respect of food subsidies and taxation.  They are going to do that to the extent of 1/6 per week.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party know as well as I do the kind of life the old-age pensioner lives who is completely dependent on his pension.  I wonder would they like to sit down and work out what it would cost to continue to have the very minimum of what might be termed comfort rather than luxury in regard to a smoke and a drink and say whether that can be covered by 1/6?  I have been trying to estimate it very roughly. The cost of the very minimum of food, smokes and a single drink in the week would wipe out the whole of the 1/6. That is the compensation we are going to give to the old-age pensioners!</P>
    <P>If we look at the unemployed so far as the present position is concerned there is no immediate gain but we are told by the Tánaiste that out of the goodness of their hearts they are not going to bring about the changes in the food subsidies until the 1st July, and that simultaneously with those changes they have the improved benefits available under the Social Welfare Bill and also provision for improved rates in respect of assistance payments.</P>
    <P>If we take the case of an unemployed worker with a wife and three children and measure what it is proposed to give him under the Social Welfare Bill in the form of increased unemployment benefit, we will discover that, taking the very minimum quantity of the subsidised foods for which he has to pay the enhanced prices and allowing him to pay the very minimum in respect of tobacco or on a drink, the whole of the increase in the payment of unemployment benefit will be completely wiped out by the additional charges he has got to meet.  That is going to be the position right through the whole scheme of social welfare as set out in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Last week, we listened to the Minister for Social Welfare explaining at great length that, right through the whole of the year 1947, he and his <Col N="1320" /> officers were voluntarily engaged in devising and drafting new schemes to provide improved and enhanced social security for the people in this country and that only for the regrettable interlude of the inter-Party Government and Deputy Larkin all these improved measures would be operated.  The Minister now brings his Bill into the House and instead of the people of this country being given a higher level of social security than they have enjoyed before, instead of having the gap closed as between their level and the level in the Six Counties, instead of, in fact, bringing this country into better alignment with the modern trend and modern thought in regard to social services, all we are going to get out of this legislation, this popularised Social Welfare Bill, is merely an increase in the rates of benefit to cover up the increased costs that will flow from the Budget.  That is the kind of trap that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party have fallen into.  That is the position that we have got to get ourselves out of.</P>
    <P>Even if the Social Welfare Bill of the Minister for Social Welfare becomes law there will be no net gain for any recipient of social security as soon as the effects of the Budget proposals make themselves felt.  The recipient of social security will be no better off.  If you examine in detail the circumstances in respect of different families you will find that, when they have received the benefits of the Social Welfare Bill and when they have met the burdens imposed on them by the Budget, they will be worse off than ever before.  And this is the Party that has set the standard and set the pace for improved social services in this country!  As was pointed out in the debate, all they have ever done has been to allow themselves to be pushed from behind and to take one hesitating step after another in the direction that they have been compelled to go by popular feeling and by the issues raised by other political Parties.  On this occasion, while they have sought to step out in front in order to obtain the political value of it, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank have stepped in on top of them and the whole benefit of their social security <Col N="1321" /> code will be taken away from them and people will turn in disgust from what has turned out to be a very cheap three-card trick.</P>
    <P>One special feature of the present Budget can be commented upon.  In 1947 we had a Supplementary Budget under which increased taxation was imposed on tobacco, drink and cinema seats.  Let us be quite frank about it. A great many housewives felt that that was a good measure because, while there was an increase in the price of tobacco and drink, they believed that they were getting a benefit in so far as the proceeds of that increased taxation was to be used to bring down the price of certain basic foods.</P>
    <P>I can imagine, because I have already heard some of the comments, what will be the opinions of these housewives on this occasion when, not only have they to pay an increased price for the foods now covered by subsidies, but, in addition, as many of them have explained, they claim that a man who has worked hard during the week is entitled to some modicum of comfort and luxury to the extent of a couple of packages of cigarettes and one or two pints.  As housewives, as mothers and as women charged with running homes, they believe that that is a reasonable and proper charge on the money available to run a home.  They will have some interesting comments to make.  I hope that not only members of the Fianna Fáil Party will hear these comments, but others who feel that the Budget is worthy of support, even though they have not to obey the same degree of Party discipline as the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I want to make a comment on what is probably one of the most important aspects of the matter so far as employed persons are concerned, those enjoying wages and salaries.  A statement was made by the Minister that earnings have gone up by a greater percentage than the cost of living since 1939.  I wonder is the Minister aware of one very peculiar fact, that the figure given for the percentage increase in earnings has not been accepted by any responsible body charged with the duty of speaking on behalf of workers. that no trade union or trade organisation <Col N="1322" /> has accepted that figure.  Even the Central Statistics Office cannot explain how they got that percentage figure.  If that is the case, and if the cost of living has increased by nearly 111 per cent. since 1939, nevertheless, on this figure, which has so far been inexplicable and has not been justified, we are asked to accept the position that workers drawing wages and salaries at least have maintained their position in relation to the rising cost of living.  Everybody knows from actual experience that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have another figure given in this House by the Taoiseach, that, while the cost of living to-day is 110 per cent. up on 1939, the increase in rates of wages&mdash;and they are much more reliable and can be much more readily checked than earnings&mdash;in respect of Dublin and 20 of the main towns in the country is 91 per cent. over 1939.  Therefore, with the Budget coming into operation, the wage earners and salary earners are losers to the extent of 19 per cent.  in the comparison between wages and the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The situation to-day becomes some what similar to the kind of atmosphere we had in 1947.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach told us of the terrible burden placed on the country and how there was nothing to do but tighten our belts and increase taxation and for workers to accept the view that they must not look for any increase of remuneration to offset the increased expenditure they were called upon to bear.  He warned us on that occasion that if the trade unions would not accept his advice then the Government would have recourse to legislation and would take powers to prevent workers and trade unions seeking the increased remuneration they thought they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Finance, or the Tánaiste say anything like that on this occasion, that if we are not good boys there will be another Standstill Wage Order, or if they have learned their lesson, if they have found that it is much more clever and will not create the same difficulties to use the financial manipulation recommended by the <Col N="1323" /> Central Bank and by that means force down consumption and rake off portion of the personal income of wage and salary earners rather than run into a headlong conflict with the great mass of the people as they did over the Standstill Wage Order from 1941 to 1946.  Possibly they have become a little wiser after the three years they were out of office.</P>
    <P>It should be plainly stated that during the last ten months, when there has been a rise in the cost of living of 11 per cent, there has been one very marked feature in the trade union movement&mdash;a peculiar kind of quietness. In the three years preceding that, if there was a rise of one point in the cost of living, those of us who have experience of trade union meetings knew that the first meeting we went to we would be faced with a clamour for an immediate increase in wages or salaries because of that rise in the cost of living.  We then discovered that the clamour was always coming from one section, that it was coming from the gentlemen, who, although good trade unionists, preferred to take trade union policy from Fianna Fáil Cumainn.  Deputy Ó Briain knows nothing of what we are talking about in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the very nice picture of the Party, which imposed the Standstill Order on wages and which so manipulated wages and prices that they finally created a gap of nearly 30 per cent.  to the disadvantage of wages, sending henchmen into the trade union movement deliberately to stir up industrial discontent, raising issues in regard to wages and conditions in the hope that by that means they would create political differences. Unfortunately for Fianna Fáil, trade unionists are fairly competent and able. We made claims, not because of Fianna Fáil, but because that is our job, and we shall continue to make claims.  We got the claims adjusted and the result was that in those three years the gap between wages and prices was closed <Col N="1324" /> to a greater extent than in any previous period.</P>
      <P>During the last ten months, however, we have had a rise in the official cost-of-living figure of 11 per cent., the second biggest increase that has taken place in the cost of living since 1939 within a comparable period.  The boys are quiet now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose I answer you as you did us when you were in opposition: that you do not count the index figure but what the people are able to pay.  We know what the index is because we have had to examine it very carefully and to discuss it across the conference table.  We also know that if the index is calculated a little differently, it may be a little more helpful to us in making our case but it is there and we have to accept it. We cannot, like Fianna Fáil, play with the cards up our sleeves as well as with the cards on the table.  We, at least, know, however, where the queen is.</P>
      <P>Another serious aspect of the Budget is that for the last ten months we have had, as far as the trade union movement is concerned, a relative period of quiet.  It is, of course, correct that the cost of living has increased and that claims for increases in wages have been made but it is also quite true and the responsible Minister knows it to be quite true, that there has been an exceptional period of moderation exercised by all sections of the community in dealing with these questions of wages and prices.  Only in a very restrained manner have claims been formulated and put forward by workers during the last five or six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is now going to be a limit to the extent to which trade union officials can limit their members. Trade union officials have exercised limitations on their members to the extent of advising them on their claims as to where they might fail and the success which might meet their claims, <Col N="1325" /> but the trade union movement, unlike the Government, have no legal power of compulsion.  We cannot stop our members from making decisions and giving effect to them.  As I said, we can give them advice on their claims and the difficulties with which they might meet but they can accept or reject the advice and give effect to their own decisions.  That is a circumstance in which the Government must accept responsibility for anything that may happen because quite clearly where we have a period of a very sharp rise in the cost of living without any equitable adjustment of wages and salaries during the past 12 months and a further sharp imposition so far as basic foods are concerned there is and there will be a reaction by people in the wages and salaries classes.  I hope the Government will bear that in mind and accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if they feel that that situation can be dealt with by having recourse through legislation and by seeking to impose legal limitations on the activities of the trade unions that they recall what happened in 1947 and what put them for three years into the wilderness.  I think you will find that many members of Fianna Fáil have come to realise since 1947 that whatever political changes take place one thing is unlikely to happen and that is that Fianna Fáil will ever again have an over-all majority.  That is something worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has made a challenge, which he was of course careful to avoid when in opposition, that if the people did not like the Government's proposals they knew the road that was open to them.  There is one course which the Government should not follow, in my opinion, and that is that they should not be led by bodies such as the Central Bank or the Joint Stock Banks.  I am not making that statement in any sense of hostility to those gentlemen but because I believe that they are as completely wrong in relation to the type of policy to meet the needs of this country as they are in other matters and are completely different from the things which would make possible the policy of Fianna Fáil.  The tragic mistake of Fianna Fáil since they became the Government <Col N="1326" /> of this country and certainly since the years 1937 and 1938 is that they have been too prone to follow the type of policy instituted by the banks and commercial interests in this country.  Accepting their policy on their word and their sincerity, I think Fianna Fáil will themselves admit that the possibility of realisation of their policy is not best met by following the advice of these people.  It is quite clear to anyone with ordinary common sense that the courage of the Fianna Fáil policy cannot be met by a policy of men who have been manipulating money and at the same time are too far removed from the day-to-day problems to know what is best for the country.  It is a remarkable thing that up to the moment no responsible political group in this country has been prepared to accept publicly, without qualification, the advice given by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I think if the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and there are many sincere and progressive-minded men and women in that Party, take and examine in the present situation what is to be the possible future development of this country in the next ten or 20 years, they will not find a solution in the present Budget that seems to be built on the advice given by the Central Bank.  There must be something wrong because it was almost impossible for us to imagine that a single Party such as Fianna Fáil, with its background and history of development and its outlook on national economy and development, can allow itself to be swayed by the Central Bank and the joint stock bank groups in this country.</P>
    <P>It is true that, quite clearly, if we are going to have certain standards of social services, the money must be found to pay for them but it should not be found only through indirect taxation on the ordinary man in the street.  It is a burden that should be borne not only by the ordinary working people but those who are better able to afford it and who have avoided it. It is quite clear that the ordinary individual citizen's ability to consume food and drink is limited by his personal capacity.  From that point of <Col N="1327" /> view, put 3d. on the pint and one is not going to collect any more, within reason, from the man with £5,000 a year than from the man with £5 or £10 a week.  That has always been the objectionable feature of indirect taxation. Secondly, it is hidden taxation, which the ordinary man in the street does not clearly appreciate, and it is the means of allowing those with large incomes to evade their proper share of responsibility.  During recent weeks, there have been many comments made public on the defects in our income-tax code.  Since July last, the Minister and the Department of Finance have mentioned in public statements that in April of this year we would have to face in the Budget the problem of what they regarded as the correction of the finances of the State.  Surely, within the last seven or eight months, it could have been possible for the Minister for Finance to examine the machinery of income-tax to see if it could not be improved and, if that could not be done, that an endeavour would be made to ensure that the bigger section of the community, who have got a responsibility to make their contribution just the same as the present section who are covered by the income-tax machinery have, would be brought within that machinery.</P>

My view in relation to the agricultural community is that I do not expect the farmer to pay any more than the man in the city or town.  Surely, the man engaged in agriculture has the same duty as the town and city worker has at the moment to submit himself for examination to determine whether or not he should make a contribution.</P>

      <P>In regard to income-tax itself, the proposal in the Budget is to increase the standard rate by <Col N="1328" /> 1/-.  That is a flat increase applying to everybody, irrespective of the difference in their resources and their reserves.  Surely if this gap has got to be closed, we could have a graduated system of income-tax.</P>
      <P>Of course, I will be told immediately that there are very few rich people in the country and that there is no use in increasing income-tax by too great a figure because the yield would not be worth the trouble.  I am not in a position of having machinery available to me which the Government has to examine the practical problems that might arise in regard to a proposal like that.  What I am concerned with is that the approach to the problem by the Government and the Minister for Finance is an approach through channels which will inevitably put the whole of the burden on the great masses of the ordinary people.  Their approach ignores differences in income and reserves and differences in standard of life and merely says: &ldquo;You have got to pay your share in the most convenient way we decide.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I recall looking for the restoration of the excess profits tax.  I recall, when I was sitting in the Government Benches for three years, being sniped at by Fianna Fáil because we had not brought back the excess profits tax. I frankly admit that that was not merely a mistake but something for which we are entitled to be held up to criticism.  Bearing in mind that we have to face the problem of providing money, we know that, in the last year of their operation, the excess profits tax provided somewhere between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000, and the possibilities for that tax are still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last list of company reports that I saw again showed their very healthy condition.  In the meantime, although they have issued their bonus shares they have managed to maintain the old rate of dividend.  If there is a company paying 10 per cent.  and they double their capital by issuing the necessary number of bonus shares and still continue to pay a dividend of 10 per cent., that means that there is now a dividend of 20 per cent.  being paid on the old capital.  That is a common feature. I know of one company outside the city <Col N="1329" /> the net profits of which have increased in one year from £24,000 to £98,000. It may be argued, as it was argued before, that excess profits have a dragging effect on the development of industry, that they are difficult to collect and that they are inequitable in their application to various types of companies. We have heard all these explanations both from the Tánaiste and from Deputy McGilligan.  Again I would point out that there never has been on any side of this House any objection in principle to excess profits tax.  It was imposed by Fianna Fáil, and Deputy McGilligan was not opposed to the principle of it, but he did question the machinery that was being utilised to collect it.  I would like to put this following question: &ldquo;Why was this particular channel not explored? If it was not possible or practicable, then we could be told the reasons for it?&rdquo; However, it is just put on one side.  There is no extension in income-tax alleviation, no graduated scale of income-tax and no excess profits tax.  Finally, a very definite tax is being put on some of the most essential foods for working-class homes and on the few luxuries, if one likes to call them by that name&mdash;tobacco and drink.  There was not even a suggestion that there might be a purchase tax placed on luxuries, even though it might only yield a small amount by way of revenue.</P>
    <P>It is the social approach which is the most important one in relation to the examination of the Budget, because, it seems to me, it is indicative of the future lines along which this country is going to develop.  These lines are being determined, in my opinion, by people who have proven year after year not only in this country but also in every other country, to be completely incompetent to deal with basic economic problems. In relation to this country, they have proven year after year to have very little sympathy with the policy which we in this House feel is the correct policy.  It is probably a tragedy for this country that a Party like Fianna Fáil should be pursuing this particular line of policy.  Bearing in mind the situation in this country at the present time and the statement made by the <Col N="1330" /> Minister that there would be a gap of £15,000,000, I feel that, with the present economic and industrial situation in the country and while everybody agrees that we must balance the current year's account, it might have been a better contribution to restoring economic activity in the country if we decided we could have a deficit this year.</P>
    <P>If we were not so much concerned with the application of orthodox principles, that both sides of the column must always balance, we would see that there is something more than figures involved in this.  I am very much afraid that in our attempt to strike the balance in regard to State book-keeping, we are going to create further upset in regard to our economic book-keeping as a nation.  That balance may not show itself in the form of increased public debt; it may not show itself in the form of a growing difficulty on the part of the Government to obtain money for its purposes; but it is going to show itself in the form of an increased number of our men and women idle in this country, living under depressed conditions and, worse still, deciding that so far as they are concerned&mdash;I have already heard such comments&mdash;whatever future life holds for them, it is not to be found in this country.</P>

      <P>I wonder, if the impact of this Budget on a man or woman living to-day in Drimnagh, Crumlin or in a labourer's cottage in any part of Ireland, were correctly assessed what weekly burden would this Budget put upon them?  Would I exaggerate if I said that for an ordinary man or woman still unblessed with a family the charge would lie between 8/- and 10/- a week?  Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies look up in horrified amazement, but if they take out their pens and work it out, I think they will find that it is a fair calculation. For the house in which there is a man and his wife and two or four children, the burden of this Budget will lie somewhere between 10/- and £1 a week.  I have not worked it out but I think those who are about to defend these proposals to the country have a <Col N="1331" /> duty to work it out themselves for the conditions with which each one of them is most familiar.  Some will think of it in terms of rural dwellers; some will think of it in terms of city dwellers.  Each Deputy of this House has upon him the duty to bring to the attention of the Leader of his Party, if he belongs to the Fianna Fáil Party, or to the Dáil at large if he belongs to the Opposition, what burden he believes this Budget will put on his constituents, whatever strata of society they belong to.</P>
      <P>I want to read from column 49, Volume 126, No. 1, of the Official Debates, of 13th June, 1951, the date on which the present Government was changed.  I spoke in this House on that occasion and used these words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I only hope and pray that the work we have started, that we have only just started, will not be destroyed in malice or envy or spite.  I heard so many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies jealous of our achievements denigrate the things we had done.  I knew they were doing it because they were jealous.  I implore them, if they do not consider it a sin against consistency, to label the Deputies of this House as purchasable merchandise and glory in their right to form an Irish Government by their sufrage, so far to strain their consistency as to allow the plans they so much blew upon to carry on for the benefit of our people.  If they are not able to build, let them not destroy; if they are not able to create, let them not sterilise; and if they are not able to treat the work of governing Ireland as a glorious adventure, in which it is a privilege to give all that one has, let them not turn it into a base, mercenary traffic of corruption and intimidation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there were Deputies in this House who thought that that foresight was unduly pessimistic.  How many think it now?  Deputies on all sides of this House have found themselves at a loss to explain what philosophy can lie under the reckless, wicked, stupid proposals contained in this Budget.  Study them by any canon of <Col N="1332" /> common sense and there is no explanation. But there is an explanation rooted in rotten politics.  Does this House remember that I told them six months ago that the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, had warned the Fianna Fáil Party he intended to retire?  Does this House remember that I told them six months ago that the Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, and the Minister for Finance, Mr. MacEntee, refused to serve under Deputy Lemass, and had announced that when the Taoiseach retired they would retire with him.</P>

It is designed to extract from our people in this financial year a revenue out of all proportion to what the legitimate charges which will come in course of payment would require, providing a means for the present Tánaiste to lead what he hopes to be the remnants of the Fianna Fáil Party into a general election next June.</P>

      <P>Having presented a Budget for 1952-53, having used the surplus finances of this year for the purpose of bestowing benefits in 1952-53, Fianna Fáil, the same person but in different clothes, will emerge as the saviour of the nation with a new ambitious Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Ministers who want to retire.  Why should not they? They have given 15 years' public service. Is there any reason to blame them if they want to return to civil life?  The only conceivable reason why any man would want to remain in politics in this country is ambition and the love of power.  These two essential qualities the Tánaiste has got.  He wants to be Taoiseach, and these are <Col N="1333" /> qualities a man ought to have if he wishes to continue long in politics.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is getting to-day a salary from the State of £1,525 a year. It is certain that he was earning over £4,000 without any trouble 12 months ago, and that he gave that up to take service again in the public service for one-third of what he could easily earn outside.  No one but a man with the highest sense of political ambition would make that exchange.  He has got it and he wants to get there.</P>
    <P>When Deputies around this House say: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;, when the Tánaiste says: &ldquo;Do you think we put on taxes for fun?&rdquo;, let someone explain it on more specious grounds than those I now propound to you, for I will prove this.  What is criminal is that in this dirty political manæuvring, if these proposals are endorsed by Oireachtas Éireann, hundreds of small businessmen in this country will put up their shutters for the last time; hundreds of people at present employed in this country will buy single tickets to Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Bootle.</P>
    <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the bank rate in England.  That is all he did.  The rest of his Budget was eyewash and everybody knows it.  The only thing of significance he did was to raise the bank rate.  Why?  &mdash;Because he wanted to squeeze out of certain sections of industry the labour required for the armament factory and the mine.  Our Government, in this country, is squeezing out of employment, in our country, our people, to send them to Birmingham, Bootle and the mine.  That is a dastardly thing for Fianna Fáil to do in order to facilitate the Tánaiste to become Taoiseach with a bang.  That is a dastardly thing to do.</P>
    <P>At least those chaps who are driven out of their country can come back, but think of the small business man, who, if he has to close his doors this year will never open them again, who has been a respectable and respected member of the community in which he lives, not rich but secure, who before the end of this year will shut his shop for the last time and, in later middle age, go out and look for work.  It is <Col N="1334" /> only those of us who live in the country, and know what that means, who can fully appreciate the hateful tragedy of that repeating itself a thousand or two thousand times up and down the country.  It is revolting.</P>
    <P>The principle laid down by the present Taoiseach is that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs. That is a sublime doctrine so long as you are not the egg.  This Parliament was not elected to achieve great imperial designs or to face the gloomy fact that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  We were sent here by our neighbours so to run this country that it would not be necessary to break human eggs in order to make the wheels go round.  I claim that in the last three and a-half years there were no eggs broken in this country; there was not even a crack put in the most addled Fianna Fáil egg in the whole gang.</P>

      <P>This Budget is just stupid as finance.  This Budget is not finance; this Budget is politics.  I think Deputy Larkin is mistaken when he appears to deprecate the existence of what I heard the Leader of the Opposition describe and what I describe as the Treasury point of view. There is an abstract thing, the Treasury point of view, which it is the duty of certain high public officials of State to formulate and maintain, and the Government which is not sustained by that sort of help and guidance is very much the poorer for the want of <Col N="1335" /> it.  The tragedy is, if you have a weak, vain, silly man as Minister for Finance, instead of understanding the function of those advisers who propound the Treasury view, he starts strutting in front of them to prove himself more orthodox than they and this silly little man who is at present the Minister for Finance in this country wants to prove to posterity that the Central Bank is radical compared with him, just because he does not understand what the memoranda they sent him are designed to do.  They are designed to state a case to which regard must be had by a prudent Minister for Finance in formulating his proposals, but I never met a responsible economist yet who, ever in his heart, believed that the financial memorandum should be accepted literally as meaning what it said.  There is only one man in Ireland who ever did that, and that is Deputy MacEntee, the present Minister for Finance, and there must be nobody more embarrassed in Ireland than those charged with the responsibility of formulating the Treasury view when they discover that the vain, silly little man to whom the Constitution requires them to address their memoranda has not only read them, but fundamentally misunderstood them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste is right when he says: &ldquo;We are not putting on the taxes for fun.&rdquo;  They are not.  They are putting on the taxes for spite, for vanity and for politics.  They are putting them on in spite because they want to present the picture to our people that their predecessors left them a heritage which requires them to cripple the community to-day.  It has been proven to them now that that is not true.  The Minister himself is induced to do it in vanity because he wants to out-Butler Butler; he wants to qualify for the pedestal to be erected at the portico of the Central Bank.  They are doing it in politics for the reason I have told: so that the new Taoiseach may bestow benefactions on a grateful electorate. There will be a fair exchange such as the exchange which has been negotiated with the dance-hall proprietors: if they will vote for him he will see that they are treated right on Budget day.  One cannot but admire <Col N="1336" /> the cynical arrogance of a Tánaiste who in the Budget which taxes butter, bread, tea, sugar, incomes, the very right to draw our breath in Ireland and takes the tax off dance-halls because their proprietors had the prudence to make their bargain with the Tánaiste of to-day and the Taoiseach of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>On that model he plans to make the next rate bargain: if the electorate of Ireland will emulate the dance-hall proprietors they will get their 1/-, too, and from the same liberal hand.  Must one not admire the cynical daring impudence of that?  Must one not admire the aspirant to power who tries it out on that docile tail over there and who then turns to the four moulting hairs of that tail and says to them: &ldquo;We will be looking for you in the lobby when you are wanted and if you are not there you will be on the hustings.&rdquo; To which Deputy Cowan replies: &ldquo;not for 12 months yet, if you please, sir&rdquo;; and does not blush to repeat it in public in this House.  Is that not so?  Did he not say yesterday: &ldquo;I am going into the lobby for I do not want an election for another 12 months&rdquo;?  Monte Carlo, close your door when you see the Tánaiste arrive &mdash;the greatest bluffer, the best poker player that ever stood in Irish politics. The busted flush in front of him&mdash;when they woke up they discovered that they had dwindled into four cards&mdash;an illegal hand.</P>

      <P>£70,000,000, says the Tánaiste, was added to the national debt, and there are groans of admiration from the illuminated hordes who sit behind him.  &ldquo;We must not borrow dollars to build hospitals and houses.&rdquo; Is there anyone so dense on the benches of Fianna Fáil as to believe that?  There must be some, for the Tánaiste knows the material with which he has to deal, and he would not tell them fairy tales which none of them would believe.</P>
      <P>His colleague published a White Paper, showing the amount of the national debt and the assets to be set against it, but, knowing his colleagues, he confidently relies upon them to read the figures set out on the liability side and obediently to turn their eyes from the sacriligious item: assets.  In Table 5 of the financial statement, 1952, there is a list of assets.  Take the statement showing the capital liability of the State on 31st March, 1951, and on 31st March, 1952, and the assets (including the Exchequer balance) held on these dates.  Do the members of the Fianna Fáil Party know the meaning of the word &ldquo;assets&rdquo;&mdash;A-S-S-E-T-S?  If they do not, they can ask their Minister for Finance to explain it to them.</P>
      <P>I hear a murmur of protest that they do.  Very well then, they will understand what I am going to tell them.  If they look at the foot of the column of assets in the ownership of the Treasury on 31st March, 1952, they will see that the last item is the balance on the American Loan Counterpart Fund: £41,137,518.  Let them look at the liability side.  Now they all understand that word.  They have been well tutored in that during the last six months&mdash; liability, liability, liability.  There is a popular song about that if I could think of it.  Dollar borrowings under United States Loan Agreement: equivalent of proceeds received: £40,671,086.  If you have a liability of £40,671,000 and if you have assets of £41,137,000 are you rich or are you poor?  I propose that as a nice weekend riddle to the financial pundits of Fianna Fáil, to get a bit of chalk, go out to the gable of the house, add it up, subtract it, then run twice around the house and look at it again.</P>

Is it not time that the Minister for Finance or Deputy de Valera explained to the House and his own colleagues what the Marshall Aid loan was?  I do not believe that Deputy Vivion de Valera would be party to a fraud on his own colleagues.  I challenge him to tell the House when he comes to speak whether he alleges to his own colleagues that the borrowing of dollars under Marshall Aid was in any sense a foreign debt, as his colleagues understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Deputy Vivion de Valera not know that it was a pure exchange transaction providing dollars for current transactions pending the arrival of the day upon which convertibility would be restored, and that in respect of every dollar borrowed from the United States there was put an equivalent amount of our currency in the Central Bank and that we said to the Marshall Aid people: &ldquo;On the due date we will have ready for you on deposit the full amount due in our currency or in sterling, but we will not have dollars.&rdquo;  They said to us: &ldquo;Nobody knows what the situation will be five years ahead.  If we are prepared to take the risk of your having only sterling and not dollars, why should you worry about it?&rdquo; We reiterated our position&mdash;and this is the source of all the &ldquo;blah&rdquo; about why <Col N="1339" /> there was a change in the Cabinet as to whether we would take Marshall Aid or not: the Minister for External Affairs, if my memory serves me right, would not be a party to leaving the United States of America under the shadow of a doubt&mdash;because we wanted to carry conviction to their mind that we were prepared to confirm to any provision in the legislation of Congress subject to the honourable understanding between the two honourable parties that, while we would do our best to get dollars on a given date, our confident belief was that, unless the United States of America Treasury and the British Treasury had, in the wide arena of the world, restored convertibility between sterling and dollars, we would only have sterling wherewith to pay our instalment, but that we would have sterling.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to Fianna Fáil Deputies and I ask Deputy Vivion de Valera to tell them: Do not let people like Deputy Cowan fool you with tripe about this country selling itself to the United States of America.  The United States of America never sought to buy this country.  The United States of America is this country's best friend. I am going to have something to say about the United Soviet Socialist Republics who may have some aspirations to buy this country, or bits of it. There are five bits I have my eye on and they are beginning to walk like ducks.  If they quack I will name them, because when someone walks like a duck, has feathers like a duck and quacks like a duck, even though he says he is a guinea pig, I am entitled to believe that he is a duck. Do not let Deputy Cowan fool you with that kind of tripe.</P>
    <P>I propose to Deputy Vivion de Valera that at least we should, he and I, combine in the service of truth&mdash; objective truth.  Is there not a distinction between international debt, as members of the Fianna Fáil Party ordinarily understand that phrase, and the Marshall Aid transaction?  Is there not in the Central Bank sterling to meet every penny due in respect of dollar borrowings from the United States of America, and did Ireland not honourably and faithfully perform what <Col N="1340" /> she undertook to do, to have dollars, if they were available, but, if they were not, to have sterling or Irish currency, whichever the Americans chose to take?</P>
    <P>I have heard that dirty phrase used again and again <i>en passant</i> by spokesmen for Fianna Fáil, nor was the Minister for Finance beneath the dishonesty of using it himself when he wound up these 71 pages yesterday. Listen to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When Fianna Fáil left office in 1948 this State stood high in credit with the world.  It owed no foreign debt.  The encumbrances which the preceding Government assumed we shall, however, honour, as Deputy Costello rightly said, to the last dollar.  But we shall not add to them.  We shall rely on our own people to provide by their industry and thrift the capital necessary to build up the nation.  We relied on them before during stringent and terrible days.  They did not fail us then, and they will not fail us now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Foreign debt!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the solid basis thus laid, we can build a future worthy of the sacrifices of the past, worthy, too, of the men and women of this generation, the first to be born in freedom, but for that reason the more determined to preserve it.  When Fianna Fáil left office in 1948, this State stood high in credit with the world. It owed no foreign debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the dirty implication, that the inter-Party Government financially committed this country in a way that prejudiced or abridged its sovereign right to settle its own policies in its own way.  The last man in Ireland who should speak of owing no foreign debt is the Minister for Finance, who sponsored the legislation in this House to expunge the foreign debt; and a large percentage of the payments under that Act went into the coffers of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Let none of us forget that the last deliverance from foreign debt has as its endearing monument: &ldquo;Truth in the News.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Irish people know damn well where the money went.  Do not imagine for a moment that they have forgotten it.  It was the first of many seedy transactions.  I had sympathy with the Tánaiste to-day.  The fluency was gone, the resilience was flagging and the speciousness was unconvincing. He was telling us, going back to this Budget, about sugar, and he said the price of sugar was going up to domestic consumers but coming down to manufacturers: Is it unfair to paraphrase that by saying that he soothes his soul with the thought that those who cannot afford butter will at least get cheaper jam.  I asked him then did this apply to our export industries, to chocolate crumb, not to speak of that Fianna Fáil industry, sweetened fat.  He said no.  He had not made up his mind about that.  I wonder what is going to happen to the chocolate crumb factory.  Are they going to get the sugar necessary for them to make chocolate crumb and pay the farmer 1/9 a gallon for milk, because if they are not, there is a blue lookout for the boys.</P>
      <P>Butter is going to be sold in Ireland hereafter at its economic price.  Deputy Tom Walsh, the Minister for Agriculture, says that his costing commission is going to raise the price of creamery milk to 1/8 per gallon, at least.  That means that the economic price for butter in Ireland at 1/8 per gallon for milk will be 4/8 per lb., unrationed.</P>

      <P>Now, the last time that we produced 700,000 cwt.  of butter was in 1950.  We bought it all, we paid for it all, and we ate it all, in Ireland. We produced the 700,000 cwt.  of butter <Col N="1342" /> also in 1935, in the middle of the economic war.  That year our people ate 300,000 cwt. and we shipped 400,000 cwt. to Great Britain; the British put down 54/- per cwt. and the Irish Government put down 86/- per cwt.; the British ate the butter&mdash;and we got the empty boxes.  What is going to happen when the price of butter is 4/6?  Do you think our people will be able to afford to eat 700,000 cwt. of it?  Is not the purpose of this Budget stated to be to cut down consumption, because people are eating too much?  What is going to happen to the butter that this Budget provides our people will not be allowed to eat? Where is it going to go?  The economic price of butter manufactured from 1/8 milk is approximately 500/- a cwt. in 56 lb. boxes ex-creamery.  The current price for the same butter in New Zealand is 271/- per cwt. f.o.b. a ship at Auckland.  Riddle that one out; and when you are laying the soothing unction to your soul, that those of our people who are no longer able to reach on butter will be allowed access to cheap jam, then ask yourself: &ldquo;What will we do with the butter?&rdquo; The poor Minister for External Affairs has gone out&mdash;to look for alternative markets for it.  I wish him luck.  As certain as we are on this carpet, we will end up delivering the butter in Spain or Italy or Peru; The Peruvian will be putting down 2/- and we will be putting down 2/6, and the Peruvian will be eating the butter and we will be coming home with the empty boxes.  If there is going to be a surplus of butter, I would sooner have let our people eat it than pay the Peruvian to eat it.  This Budget says that we must pay the Peruvian to eat it&mdash;and like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tea.  We are going to take the subsidy off tea.  The subsidy on tea was a dirty racket; it is a dirty racket.  The tea subsidy can be taken off to-day and as a result the cost of buying tea would not be increased by a farthing.  Those who wanted cheap tea could get cheap tea, those who wanted tea at 3/4 could get it at 3/4 and those who wanted tea at 4/4 could get it at 4/4, if the tea trade were taken out of the hands of the racket running it at present&mdash;Tea Importers Limited.  When I am told that we are going to take <Col N="1343" /> tea off the ration but that the only way a tea wholesaler or retailer can get supplies is by going hat in hand to Tea Importers and telling them what he wants and they will buy it for him, I know that the net result is that instead of paying the money into the Exchequer, we will be paying it into the bank account of Tea Importers Limited and those who constitute it.  There never was any need for a subsidy on tea; there ought not be a subsidy on tea.  If the racket which was established by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Tánaiste, had not been established, the need for this excess cost would never have arisen.</P>
    <P>Yet, he has the impudence to tell us to-day that India would be vexed with us if we do not go on buying tea direct from Calcutta.  Do you know the way India indicated her love for us and her grateful appreciation of our going to Calcutta?  By clapping a large export duty on tea.  And when we tried to buy it in Ceylon, she gave the high sign to Ceylon: &ldquo;Come on, sister, you do the same.&rdquo;  Both of them clapped an export duty on tea.  The Indian Government and the Ceylonese Government will extract out of the tea consigned to the Irish teapot the last farthing they think the trade will carry.</P>
    <P>If India does not like our withdrawing from the Calcutta bulk market when it suits us to do so, so far as I am concerned they can lump it.  Divil a-much we got for nothing from India and divil a-much we asked for nothing from India and we do not expect anything for nothing.  It makes me physically sick to be told that we would vex the Indians if we should withdraw from the bulk market in Calcutta.  Vex them my foot.  The fellows in Tea Importers Limited, constitute the nicest little monopolistic racket in this country&mdash;and that is saying a mouthful, because there are rackets in part of this country that would paralyse the trust-busting machinery of the Federal Government of the United States. &ldquo;India would regard it as unfriendly if we stopped buying direct from Calcutta.&rdquo; Do you know, somebody ought to write that up in letters of gold on the facade of the establishment in <Col N="1344" /> Upper Mount Street.  It would be most edifying for the British Ambassador who lives right opposite.  No, I suggest that Tea Importers should register a house flag with the Irish Office of Arms in Dublin Castle and inscribe upon it as the motto: &ldquo;India would not love us if we did not deal in Calcutta.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Just imagine an Irish Government being able to come into this House and call upon this Legislature to exact remedial measures for the abuse that our people are eating too much.  I remember the day when that Treasury view was propounded to me, as duty dictated, in my ministerial capacity. The propounder of that view to me is running still&mdash;but in the best of friendship. I do not believe there was any man in Ireland better pleased to be put running like a redshank than that particular public servant whose duty it was to put the Treasury view to me. The Treasury view in this country is that our people are peasants and that they ought to stay peasants.  The Treasury view is that if there are any aspirations abroad for our people to rise above the level of peasants, farming on a subsistence basis, they are to be looked upon with suspicion and distrust. The Treasury view is that if radios are coming into this country it is a certain sign that our people are going berserk with radios coming to them and what next will they want.</P>
    <P>The Treasury view is: lipstick, powder, nylons and radios&mdash;the country is going daft.  If the same warriors went out to paint the West End of London red they would be greatly disappointed if they did not see nylons, the lipstick and the face powder and hear the radios.  But if they hear the radios or see these things in a house or a cottage in Kerry, Mayo or Donegal they come home to consult the Central Bank as to whether budgetary measures should not be taken to banish nylons and the powder and the lipstick and the radios from rural Ireland. &ldquo;The people are getting too up in themselves.  They will not work hard enough and they will start eating too much.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am talking about the Treasury view and about the damn fools who accept it.  Denmark accepted that philosophy.  Denmark would not let their people eat too much.  Denmark rationed butter in order to provide the wherewithal to build up trade with Britain and they shipped butter in far greater quantities to Great Britain than Ireland did.  Denmark has this distinction in the realm of pathology as well as commerce.  It was in Denmark that was first identified the deficiency disease begotten of a shortage of the butter vitamin. Danish children died while scientists sought to diagnose a complaint until then unrecognised and unknown.  It was finally established to be due to the fact that the Danish people were shipping their butter abroad for sterling assets and eating oleo-margarine that had not been fortified with vitamins A or D.</P>
      <P>The Danish Government were fortified that that scientific discovery would right the wrong but the poor yokels who constituted the Irish Government did not require instruction from pathologists or biologists instinctively to react against the view that our people were eating too much. The sound basic instinct of the Irish Government avoided the peril into which another Government unwittingly brought their people and from which they were turned back, not by any social consideration but by the emergence of a dietetic danger which threatened the population.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister for Agriculture has come into the House just now. I wonder if he will tell us what he is going to do with the butter manufactured out of 1/8 milk which his Costings Commission has undertaken to arrange.</P>

To whom is the Minister going to send it and what does he think they will pay us for it?

It is not possible to take the year 1913 as base since price data for that year is not available.</P>
      <P>(2)  A similar linkage between the two series of agricultural price index numbers (with bases 1911-13=100 and September, 1938-August 1939=100) gives a figure of 335 for the index number of agricultural prices to base 1913=100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his attention has been drawn to the leading article in a provincial newspaper of 25th March, 1952, in which it is stated that the former Minister for Agriculture ordered <Col N="1363" /> 100,000 tons of fertilisers from Belgium at £9 per ton, that these fertilisers would now cost £24 to £26 per ton, and that the new Government inherited from him 40,000 tons of fertilisers on hands when the inter-Party Government went out of office; and, if so, whether this statement is correct, and how the price of £9 per ton in Belgium can be related to the present prices of fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the article referred to by the Deputy.  No contract was made for the importation of superphosphate from Belgium, but the former Minister for Agriculture entered into contracts for the supply of 100,000 tons from the Netherlands.  The Irish Sugar Company Limited were appointed agents for the importation and sale of that superphosphate, and in the course of the season imported 83,000 tons approximately.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of June, 1951, 56,000 tons had been disposed of, leaving a balance at that time of 27,000 tons approximately, of which 9,000 tons were taken over by the sugar company in lieu of short shipment of quantities purchased by them.</P>
      <P>The contract price at which the 43-44 per cent.  superphosphate was bought varied from £9 8s. to £10 8s. per ton.  This was the price of the material lying in the ship in port; to it had to be added the cost of discharge, cartage, store rent, inland freight, merchants' commission, etc.; so that at no time was the material available at £9 per ton.  The wholesale price last season was £11 per ton at store.</P>
      <P>The present season's imports have been bought at contract prices over 60 per cent. in excess of the previous year's imports; the balance carried over from last year has had to bear heavy storage and rebagging charges, and the prices at present quoted for the superphosphate are in all the circumstances the most favourable that could be arranged.  The wholesale price this season is £17 at store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A regrettable feature of the existing situation in relation to superphosphates is that, while the need for the application of such fertilisers not only to tillage crops but also to grassland <Col N="1364" /> is very great, there is very little being used, with the result that stocks are piling up.  If these stocks are kept over until next season they will attract in the meantime extra storage and other charges, which will not only make those fertilisers dearer next season, but will also hamper the importation of further quantities.  It is, therefore, in the farmers' best interest to order as much phosphatic fertilisers as they can during the present season.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister for Agriculture at one time spoke of 100,000 tons and at a later period decided that he would only import 56,000 tons as a result of the difficulties in regard to shipment, and so forth.  The sugar company who were acting as agents for the Minister for Agriculture were unable to fulfil their own order and, consequently, had to take 9,000 tons out of the order of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Shipping could not be arranged by the sugar company for the month, I think, of September, and the 13,000 tons which they could not lift for want of shipping in the two earlier months had to be forsworn.

Assuming average yields, this tonnage would be equivalent to the produce of approximately 7,000 acres or slightly more than half the acreage under flax in 1951.

      <P>The Tánaiste told us to-day, Sir, about the extra cost of wheat, and he pointed out that the extra price payable for home-grown wheat would impinge upon the subsidy next autumn.  He did not go on to tell the House that freight rates on foreign wheat have in the last month fallen by 50 per cent.  Tramp shipping rates from the Atlantic coast and the Pacific coast and from Australian ports have fallen by 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Tánaiste think that if he directs the attention of the House to an element in the price of wheat which he expects will raise the price, he has a corresponding duty to tell the House of an element in the price of wheat which he knows brings down the price?  He does know that because the price of imported wheat is fixed by an international wheat agreement made by our Government at a maximum of $1.80.  The only element in the price of foreign wheat that fluctuates is freight.  Freight rates went up by more than 100 per cent. when the inter-Party Government was responsible for the bread supply of this country.  They have fallen by 50 per cent. in the last month.</P>
      <P>Did any Deputy note the explanation of why bread rationing is coming to an end?  &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says the Minister, &ldquo;by removing a part of the subsidy on bread, we brought the price of flour and bread above the price of animal feeding stuffs.  I believe the gap will widen as the year goes on.&rdquo;  What does that mean? What did that mean?  Did it mean the price of bread was going up still more or could it mean that the Minister for Agriculture had promised to bring down the price of feeding stuffs?  If he has, Deputy Blaney says that there ought to be enough feeding stuffs produced in Ireland this year for all the needs that may arise.  Is the gap going to be widened by bringing down their price?  I have no doubt that the vigilant and independent eye of Deputy Cogan is fixed upon the Minister.  He will want to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose Deputy Cogan has not got much to do with the Resolution right enough.  The Tánaiste practised the age-old hoary device&mdash;it is unworthy of him as he is too resourceful a gambler&mdash;of challenging the Opposition to show him the place where economies might be made or how taxation might be reduced.</P>
      <P>I will show him, after a cursory perusal of the Book of Estimates, two items which are manifestly, openly and incontrovertibly fraudulent.  There is in the Estimate for Agriculture a subhead provided for the loan of £400,000 sterling to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann for the purchase of superphosphate to be sold to the farmers within the financial year.  The money must come back into the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision for £300,000 for the lime subsidy, which is to be financed ultimately out of the Grant Counterpart Fund, which is at present lying in the Central Bank.  Technically, the Minister may cover himself by an <Col N="1370" /> Appropriation-in-Aid or an extra Exchequer receipt in respect of the £400,000, but there is no corresponding receipt in respect of the £300,000 for the lime subsidy.  He has not told this House that he abandons the American Grant Counterpart Fund at present.  He cannot touch it on account of their own laches in completing the necessary formalities, formalities that should have been completed before the 8th June.  I believe they will get it owing to the friendship of the American Government.</P>
    <P>Our people are going to be taxed this year to produce the surplus which the Tánaiste intends to employ in his election campaign in June 12 months, after the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, is in the ash can with Deputy Dr. Ryan, the present Minister for Health.  It is part of the gamble that the present Minister for Finance shall be party to the rotten political confidence trick that is going to throw many into unemployment and close down small businesses during the next 12 months, so that the present Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, will have the wherewithal to invite the electorate of this country to make the same bargain with him next June that he has successfully negotiated with the dance hall proprietors this March.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; says the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, &ldquo;clamours for social services, but they cannot have social services if they do not pay for them. Look all around the world and you will see that the social services have increased. Yet in Ireland the prices of tobacco, beer, spirits and petrol are lower than anywhere else in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder did Deputy Lemass, the Tánaiste, or the Minister for Finance ever hear the name of a man called Eisenhower, popularly known as &ldquo;Ike&rdquo;?  Did they ever hear of an institution called N.A.T.O.?  Do they know what General Eisenhower and N.A.T.O. have been interesting themselves in&mdash;tanks, guns, armaments and aeroplanes for the defence of Europe? Do they know that the tanks, guns and the planes cost money?  Do they know that Ireland has no charge on its Exchequer in respect of that?</P>
    <P>Is it not queer that in Europe these <Col N="1371" /> high taxes finance N.A.T.O. but it is only in Ireland that these high taxes, plus the reduction of the subsidies on all foodstuffs, go to furnish forth a Social Security Bill which does not levy 3/6 a week on the poor working man, like William Norton's criminal Bill, but only increases his subscription by 5d. a week but which raises his subscription by from 8/- to 10/- a week in the Budget introduced the day after?  Is it not funny that all over Europe tobacco, beer and spirits and all the rest have grown dearer to purchase guns and ammunition &mdash; they have better social services, according to the Tánaiste, than we have in Ireland or are about to have&mdash;but in Ireland all this extra money is needed simply for the social services that our petulant people keep on crying for?</P>
    <P>Are Fianna Fáil Deputies so blind as not to see through that?  I think they see through it.  I think they have been sold the grandest gamble that a politician ever staged in Ireland.  I think that the Tánaiste's game is like that of the ragged, down-at-heel man who came up to Joe Lee, the Scots bookmaker, at Aintree and asked him what odds he was laying on a horse. Then he said: &ldquo;How much will you take?&rdquo;&ldquo;Any sum you can lay,&rdquo; said Joe Lee, and the ragged man handed him up £10,000.  The horse won and Joe Lee paid him.  Somebody asked Joe Lee what was the explanation of that and he said: &ldquo;It is very simple. That was the last time he could safely put his hand in the till, and it was either £330,000 for him or the Mersey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, as certain as we are in this House, the Tánaiste's game is this.  If he can pull off the gamble of holding that motley collection together for the next 12 months, he thinks he has backed a red-hot outsider and that he will come steaming down the electoral Grand National course at 33 to 1, scattering largesse wherever he goes, while the four hopeful jockeys are decking themselves out in red, white and blue to come trotting after him.  That is lots of fun for the Tánaiste and the passengers.  But I am thinking of the small business men in this country who will have to shut their doors.  I am thinking of the individuals who will <Col N="1372" /> have to take single tickets to the armament factories and the mines because it is much more important to earn sterling so that our invisible exports will be enhanced to maintain the balance of trade than it is to multiply unduly ambitious peasants on the insufficient resources of this island.  Remember, that is the Treasury point of view&mdash; there are too many of them and they eat too much.  Public finance is a science and one of the difficulties about indicting at the moment what this Fianna Fáil Government have done is that public finance is a science which a good many people fail to comprehend.</P>
    <P>We made up our mind as a Government quite deliberately three and a half years ago that it was possible to develop the resources of this country so as to raise the national income to a level which would justify the standard of living our people now enjoy and to keep it there.  We had strong advice to the effect that we were attempting the impossible, that our people aspired to too high a standard of living and there was no solution except to bring down the standard of living within the capacity of the people to bear.  We heard that advice with respect and rejected it and proceeded to build up a programme of capital development, taking what people might call the risk that that investment in Ireland and our people would in time yield a profit amply sufficient to sustain the standard of living which we thought was the fair and minimum standard that the people of this country should enjoy.  To do that we had to make provision for the current annual recurring expenses and for the money we intended to borrow each year for capital development.</P>
    <P>We brought before this House for the first time in its history a Book of Estimates which stated on the cover, before there was any question of a Budget discussion: &ldquo;This is what we intend to borrow.&rdquo;  Now what happened? We were held up before the country as rogues, twisters, deceivers and people who borrowed to balance the Budget.  This little man here had the impudence to stump the country and say that his sense of financial rectitude was all upset because of this wicked departure from orthodoxy.  I <Col N="1373" /> respected the poor little man and said: &ldquo;He is silly and narrow-minded and vain and maybe he believes it, and you have to respect him for stumping the country and stating what he believes, even if you despise his intellect.&rdquo; But he comes trotting in yesterday to announce, having denounced this procedure up and down the country, that he had changed his mind. He got his mind changed for him.  The ball and chain that accompanied him to Downing Street rattled and he was told: &ldquo;Brother, I am boss now.  You toe the line or go out now, whether it suits you to go or not.&rdquo;  It did not suit him to go.  Deputy McGrath, of Cork, was recently sent by Deputy Corry for his visit to Canossa.  The Tánaiste has sent the Minister for Finance, naked except for his hair shirt, to the Canossa of his own Budget statement.</P>
    <P>Look at his Book of Estimates.  It is adorned with eloquent protestations that to have recourse to the method employed in the previous Book of Estimates would degrade the noble citizen who now defends our finances.  The ball and chain have rattled since that document was circulated and the Minister came in yesterday to ask our pardon for having failed to present the Book of Estimates in the correct form, and he told us that that notwithstanding he proposes to proceed on exactly the same basis upon which his predecessor had proceeded.  Have they no shame, the Deputies who are sitting behind him?  Do you not think that a man who can change like that, who can be kicked about like that, do you not think that it is time that he quit being Minister for Finance?  Next to the Taoiseach, he is supposed to be the principal adviser to the Government of the day.  Can you appreciate an adviser of the Government of the day who gets kicked all around the oblong table every time the Tánaiste goes out to find someone he wants to kick around?</P>
    <P>We built up, and I want to tell the House how it was created, a credit creation device to serve this House and the country for the next ten years, and it consisted of the small savings of our people; the annual national loans that we estimated we needed, and for which we could get support; <Col N="1374" /> the Marshall Counterpart Fund, the Central Bank's Report, and behind that by the reserves of the joint stock banks, and behind that again, a judicious section of the currency reserve.  These, in fact, provided ample reserves for the next ten years, and we bound ourselves, under the 1950 Finance Act, to charge on the Central Fund for 30 years an annual annuity every year to amortise in 30 years every penny borrowed in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And you were charging to the next generation what you should have paid in the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that, in 30 years' time, you have the next generation.  Many of the Deputies here will still be around in that time, and the Minister and I will possibly still be here, though we may be hobbling a little.  I would be prepared to pay a tax in 30 years' time on my own and the Minister's bath-chairs as a contribution to the building up of this country instead of accumulating mythical assets in the sterling area.</P>
      <P>That is the difference.  We had provided so that we could amortise each year's borrowing in 30 years.  Is that passing it on to the next generation? I think it is not; I think it is bearing it in this generation.</P>
      <P>What does this man do?  He came into office in the month of June, and in one six months he spent the whole of £28,000,000 Counterpart Fund. Observe our plan when we decided to borrow.  We first went to the small lender; we then went to the market and took off the consumer market of this country as much purchasing power as we could induce the people to subscribe to a national loan, in so far as that was wanted for the development programme.  If we found that we did not get as much in this way as we wanted, we then borrowed from the joint stock banks, and then, if we required to do it, we would come into the House to use the guarantee of the currency reserve.  By the Minister's action, the Marshall Counterpart Fund, which was the first reserve, has now gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have announced to-day that they have increased their rates by 1 per cent. to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the damnable position into which we have got to-day. We had the position that if we decided to borrow £10,000,000 or £14,000,000 we could go and get that and it was our job to advise the House against getting too much in any given year lest it would upset the balance of our economic capital but this House is no longer the person to decide.  If this House wants to borrow the £15,000,000 to bridge the present gap where is it to get it?  The only place you could get it is from the banks, the moneylenders, and they will tell you what you have to pay and how and when you will pay it and whether or not you will get it.  We have no resources left to us whereby we could say to them &ldquo;do not get tough because we can continue without you&rdquo;.  When the bank rate was raised in England that issue was raised and the Minister then told us that there was no use in trying to restrain the joint stock banks because the money would go to the English banks and for that reason he had to give way.  That is all being done to advance this Party political racket to make Deputy Lemass the Taoiseach when Deputy de Valera retires.  Is it not criminal to have done that especially damaging act?  I am convinced, and saying this carries no political advantage, that if we were returned to power to-morrow we would not be able to repair the damage that has now been done to this country. Deputies should not laugh lightly when I say that I am making that statement as an ex-Minister of the Government. Deputy Morrissey and myself and the others were elected members of the Irish Government by the people, and it would become Deputies of this House to respect the position of a Cabinet Minister even if they do not have respect for the person himself. I am proud to have been a Minister of an Irish Government, and Deputies should not grovel at the feet of any British Minister or French Minister or Greek Minister or Sudanese Minister, and then presume to despise an Irish Minister.  As I have said, I do not <Col N="1376" /> believe that, if we got back to power to-morrow, we could repair the damage which has been done to our financial structure.  That is one of the most tragic features of this whole business.</P>
      <P>How is it that when discussing the balance of trade in the 17 pages devoted to it in his statement the Minister, when discussing exports in the context of balance of payment, deals not with volume but with prices?  I want to direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to this.  There was reference in this Budget statement to the balance of visible trade, January and February.  Did the Deputies in this House notice this interesting fact, that we have not got these returns yet; they have not been published?  It is said here they are not reassuring.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  The value of our imports in January, 1952, are 44 per cent.  higher than the value of our exports in January, 1951.  The value of our exports in February, 1952, are 40 per cent. higher than the value of our exports in February, 1951.  Why then is the adverse trade balance on visible trade the same?  Because the imports being brought in nine months after the Fianna Fáil Government took office are substantially greater than they were this time 12 months ago.  If our blood is to be made run cold with the imminence of disaster, may we not legitimately inquire of the Minister who has cried havoc for the last six months: If you believe that that is the method of putting right what is wrong, why let the imports run at their present level?  We never advanced the doctrine that you could correct the economic problems of this country by cutting down imports.  Our thesis was: Draw surplus purchasing power off the market by prudently administering national loans, raise the production and exports, and restore equilibrium by raising the value of our exports, visible and invisible, and allowing your imports to meet the requirements of your people as they develop, and control price inflation which must supervene if you allow excess income to chase diminished supplies of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance's policy is physically to check imports why does <Col N="1377" /> he not do it?  Why does he conceal from the House that the increasingly adverse trade balance is not due to stability in our exports, but to an increase in our imports representing the 44 per cent. increase in our exports in January and 40 per cent. in February.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; the Tánaiste&mdash;has given us the official Government view on whether we are dealing with a problem of inflation or deflation.  Speaking at column 241, Volume 130, No. 2, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputies opposite have been talking about the present situation in which we are and in which other countries also find themselves, without reference to the changes that are taking place right now and the changes that have taken place during the past month or six weeks.  There have been critical changes in the whole world situation in the past few weeks.  Almost every country in the world which, like ourselves, was concerned at the beginning of this year or towards the end of last year, at the danger of the inflationary forces, which were then active, getting out of hand, are now no longer worried, any more than we are, about the danger of runaway inflation.  They are beginning to get much more worried about the possibility of deflation, of the downward spiral beginning to move.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 246, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These dangers are quite considerable. I will concede&mdash;and Deputies can make any point they like out of it&mdash;that right now they look to be very different in character than what they looked 12 months, or even six months ago, but they are not less serious in their significance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking last week, warned us that he is getting apprehensive about the danger of deflationary forces beginning to operate which may multiply unemployment and expedite emigration from this country.  The Minister for Finance yesterday said at page 5 of the Budget statement: &ldquo;The Government cannot force consumers to <Col N="1378" /> buy.&rdquo; At page 6, he said: &ldquo;Provided the price factor is favourable, trade should revive as soon as the individual need for more consumer goods in the form of clothes and footwear becomes significant and expresses itself in a resumption of individual purchasing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take the case of a woman who has four children and a husband to provide for.  She makes up her mind to-morrow that the time has come to buy two pairs of shoes for the children, and she goes out with £2 to make the purchase. She finds that the impact of the increased charges made upon her as a result of this Budget will leave her nothing out of the £2 wherewith to buy the shoes.  Is the hopeful development envisaged by the Minister for Finance going to take place?  No. The only difference is that a month ago the woman had the money but she thought she would not get value for it if she went to buy the shoes; she waited till she would get better value for the money.  To-morrow she will not have that question to resolve at all. She need not worry because, whether the shoes are dear or cheap, she has not the money to buy either and she need not even go to price them.  From the point of view of inflation or deflation, employment or unemployment, it does not matter what reason prevents that woman from going to that shoe shop; the shoes still stay on the shoemaker's shelf and the man who hopes to make their replacement can leave for Bootle, Liverpool, Birmingham, the armament factory and the mine.  No doubt Mr. Butler and the Minister for Fuel will be glad of the opportunity to announce amidst murmurs of approval from the Tory Benches that the problem of labour in the mines is not so stringent as it was heretofore.  Doubtless the Minister for Finance will be proportionately gratified by the murmurs of approval.</P>
    <P>Some people may doubt that there was ever a Treasury view expressed in this country that our people ate too much.  On page 11 of the Minister's oration yesterday, the following statement is made:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In other words, as a result of the excessive increases in consumption in recent years and the corresponding <Col N="1379" /> diminution in saving, the additions to internal assets which have taken place&mdash;mainly, I may say, in nonproductive capital such as houses and hospitals&mdash;have been effected largely by drawing on our external investments and by incurring external liabilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>External liabilities?  What did he mean by that?  He meant to fool the poor silly-billies who sit behind him into believing that the Marshall Loan represented a net debt on our people that there was no asset in hand to meet.  And, God help them, they believed it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan said that the Minister's speech should not be circulated in manuscript form.  I do not agree with that because I think it is a most valuable document.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce contributed to our deliberations to-day.  He went all pious in the middle of his speech.  I do not know if the Deputies noticed that he suddenly assumed the mantle of Fr. Mathew and of the Pioneer Association and said that percipient Deputies who could not divorce from their minds the hidden purpose in the Minister for Finance's action to contribute to the uplift of the public morality by the taxes he proposed to impose on beer and spirits, of which he felt too much were being consumed in Ireland.  He said that, apart from fiscal reasons, there were certain moral considerations which would commend this tax to the far-sighted moral citizens of Ireland.  He must have forgotten what was in the manuscript because the Minister for Finance was assuring us of special concessions to the smaller brewer which were designed to ensure that he would brew as he never brewed before.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was spent in hearing the Minister for Finance say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the Minister for Industry and Commerce say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but the Minister for Finance was determined to have the last word and said: &ldquo;You will get no undertaking from me,&rdquo; as much as to say: &ldquo;Whatever the other yob gives you.&rdquo; Are we to look upon the Minister for Finance as a Fr. Mathew, as reported by the Tánaiste, or as a cunning villain trying to promote the <Col N="1380" /> consumption of alcohol amongst the weakly Irish?  &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  Those who want to think that he has the motives reported by the Tánaiste will look upon him as the spiritual child of Fr. Mathew, but those who think about him as I do will see in him the offspring of &ldquo;Demon Rum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will now quote from page 51 of the Budget statement in which the Minister says: &ldquo;I am obliged to forgo the customary £300,000 because of the need for increased outlay on the roads, a need so great as to render inevitable an increase in rates of motor taxation in the near future.&rdquo; I understand that in England they have reduced the taxation on motor cars to a level £12 10s. 0d.  I also understand that that country is on the verge of collapse, fiscally and economically.  We are the largest creditor nation in Europe.  Per head of the population we are the largest creditor nation in the world at the moment.</P>
    <P>We are going to raise the taxation on motor cars, having already put 4d. on the gallon of petrol to be company for the other 2d. which we put on it last year, and which caused our versatile Minister for Finance to lament.</P>
    <P>Now comes the crowning glory of the Budget.  In effect, tea has been taxed, butter has been taxed, also bread, beer, tobacco and cigarettes, and motor cars will be taxed.  However, dances will be free.  How understanding. Picture the whole community yearning to rush out on to the streets and dance in jubilation at this new birth of freedom.  We are to shovel our substance into the Tánaiste's election chest for 1953.  To crown our aspiration, there at the door stands the Minister for Finance, like the good fairy he is, saying: &ldquo;Strike up the fiddle, proclaim a jubilee and join us in the dance.&rdquo;  The Mock Turtle of Irish politics says: &ldquo;Will you, won't you, will you, won't you come and join the dance?&rdquo; He is like Alice in Wonderland, or, if you like, Alice Through the Looking-glass.  Do you remember that picture of Alice and the Mock Turtle?  The Mock Turtle says: &ldquo;Won't you come, won't you come and join us in the dance?&rdquo; Then <Col N="1381" /> we see Alice and the Turtle prancing around in a soup tureen enjoying the dance.  That is a ridiculous sight, but is it so ridiculous when it transpires that the Minister for Finance, who has decreed universal austerity, was obliged to include in his Budget this most egregious concession?  When he was asked why, here is his explanation: &ldquo;I am proposing a concession as regards entertainments duty.  Dancing has been the victim of varying fortune in this regard.  The duty on entertainments was first imposed in 1916 but payments for the right to take part in dances did not come within its scope until 1932.  In 1946 the tax as applied to these payments was abolished, but was restored by my predecessor in 1949.  Dancing is the only amusement which is discriminated against by levying a tax on active participants as distinct from spectators.&rdquo; Can you picture the heart of the Minister being moved at the jubilation of the dancing?  All-in wrestlers have to pay their levy, but the dancers are to go free.  That is the explanation given in the Budget speech to an Irish Parliament: all-in wrestlers have to pay their levy for groaning and rolling on the floor, or rather they are free and it is only the lunatics who want to go and watch them who have to pay.  Hereafter we may all go and look at the populace prancing around the floor glorying in their freedom from taxation, on the grounds that the Minister for Finance has come to the conclusion that these and the all-in wrestlers are entitled to a square deal.</P>
    <P>This justification might be used for providing a free ration of beef to the lions in the Zoo.  What is the truth behind this?  That is the best he could cook up for what was bound to cause a growl.  That is all he himself has to tell us, but what was the truth?  The truth was that the Secretary of the Dance Hall Proprietors' Association had a letter from the Tánaiste saying: &ldquo;If you will vote for us, we will take the tax off dances&rdquo;, and when the noble five, now shrunk to four, in stalled the native Government, the credit did not go to the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;, but the dance hall proprietors turned up for their pound of flesh and the astonishing thing to me is that, in that <Col N="1382" /> set-up, they were able to get it.  I want to ask any Fianna Fáil T.D. in this House will he justify the removal of this tax from dancing on the ground that it is not paid by the all-in wrestler?</P>
    <P>If he does not accept that explanation, does he think it was becoming for the Tánaiste to put the jack-boot on the Minister for Finance and to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No matter how ludicrous it makes you look before the public, you have got to pay my piper, for I said I would pay him if he would pipe the proper tune.&rdquo; He did so to the tune of £100 subscription to the election fund.  I think that is rather disreputable.  It does not surprise me much.  I am accustomed to seedy and disreputable goings-on wherever Fianna Fáil appear.  They are a seedy lot.</P>
    <P>What distresses me about this is that we had started on an enterprise in this country which was fun.  It was fun because, for the first time, we had succeeded in getting a Government that believed in this country, our people and their potentialities.  For the first time we had a Government that correctly valued and set a high value, quite genuinely and without any irony whatever, on the Treasury view cogently, resolutely, even ferociously put, who recognised it for what it was, the Treasury view to be carefully considered by a responsible Minister for Finance, who would consider it in evolving his policy, sometimes complying with it, often departing from it.  We had established that, in the last analysis, the wealth of our country came from the land and we had declared, to the admiration of every stranger who came to the shores of our country, the right of an Irish Government to invest our people's savings in their own country and not to be afraid to do it.  The first fruits of our spending visible to every man's eye were 200,000 acres of arable land that were not there, just were not there, three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Born on the agricultural horizon of West Belfast, I cannot expect from the Minister a clear or cogent appreciation of the value of agricultural land, but I am obliged to admit that not infrequently I feel that the Fianna Fáil Government accept the views of Falls Road and Capel Street as coercive in all matters of agriculture, and reject as contemptible a view on that matter which comes from Kilkenny or Mayo.  I prefer the Kilkenny outlook on that.  I think it is more likely to be right than the outlook of a man who was born, bred and reared in a city and never saw the country except when he was on a holiday, a man that would not be able to walk across a ploughed field without falling and getting lost in it, and having to be dragged out of it.  That is no disgrace to him.  He is a city-bred man. He is always accustomed to have his food come to him in a packet or a bag or a jug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am approaching this from the point of view of the people who live on the land and get their living on it. They know the difference between land that was rehabilitated and land that was not.  The Minister, if he goes out with any of his colleagues, would see this&mdash;and this he will understand&mdash;land that is green to-day that was brown four years ago.  That is a simplification that would appeal to him and that simplification has so fascinated him that he has authorised one of his junior Ministers to undertake a great <Col N="1384" /> new national enterprise for which he is providing thousands of pounds.  Can you conceive what it is?  The Falls Road agriculture, growing grass on the bogs of Bangor-Erris.  There are 11,000,000 acres of arable land in Ireland better than any other land in Europe for growing grass, but Fianna Fáil economics have spread their sails and set forth for the bogs of Erris whereon to grow grass for the purpose of drying it to sell it in Northampton. That is what he calls land rehabilitation. That is what I call Bangor-Erris midsummer madness.  That is the difference.</P>
    <P>We have 200,000 acres of land that we had not here before.  We have farm buildings.  We have machinery.  We have this interesting fact, that our exports are rising and that our people are eating more than they ever ate before and that in every international survey that has been made one thing has stood out, that the people of Ireland are better fed and better provided for than any other people in Europe.</P>
    <P>What has changed since this time 12 months?  Everybody in this country felt they were going places this time 12 months.  Everybody in this country who was working felt that, in addition to the monetary reward for his work, he was taking a share in something that was worth doing.  There were more people working in Ireland 12 months ago than there had been for years and years.  I have told the story and I will tell it again, of the men working on the land project who had come from Africa and Suez to use their skill at home on our own land in the land project.  Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House and often troublesome.  It was jealous of what we were doing.  Even Deputy Allen used to grind his teeth at me for hours at a time to prove that I was not doing anything at all.  What is happening to the country?  On what side of the House to-day is there jubilation about anything?  Where is there a cheerful face or a confident man?  Of stiff upper lips I see aplenty.  I never saw such an array of stiff upper lips in my life as I have seen in the last few days on the Fianna Fáil Deputies, but it is whalebone they have in them.</P>

It is the wickedest thing which has ever been done in this country.  I doubt if we can repair it and it is certain that before we get the chance to try thousands of our people will suffer bitterly from what Fianna Fáil is doing now.  I have no hope that the busted flush will come to realise their duty and prevent what is about to be consummated.  I have really no hope that there is any element in Fianna Fáil who will do it either. My one hope is that the endless resilience of our people and our nation will survive the third war which Fianna Fáil has declared upon the Irish people.  They led us through the civil war and the economic war and now we are going to have the dollar war.  We have survived the first two; God grant that we will survive the next.</P>

      <P>It is natural with such a subject as this to find the Opposition exploiting it to the full from their point of view.  Nevertheless it is noticeable that hitherto in this debate, although most members of the Opposition have spoken, few have really addressed themselves to the problem which faces the country and which must be faced by whatever Government sits on these benches at this time.  It is all very well to complain of taxes.  No tax is popular. It is never popular for a Government to have to find the money necessary to run the country in times when it is difficult to find it and when the trend is adverse, but nobody has suggested any alternative.  Now Deputy Larkin, who was perhaps the most sober and <Col N="1387" /> objective in his approach, very rightly remarked that it is the privilege&mdash;I am paraphrasing him&mdash;of an Opposition to parry such a challenge from a Government. He was the only person, however, who went any distance to meet that challenge when he frankly suggested that he would consider deficit financing.  It is a hard fact, however, that apart from complaints and, I might say, the understandable exploitation of the situation as they find it by the Opposition, there has been from that side no examination of the problem as it exists or the Minister's proposals for meeting it, and no contribution towards the solution of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps then I might be permitted to try to supply some factual basis for the discussion for the rest of the way. No matter whose fault it is or what the historical facts are, there is a situation at the moment where a considerable gap has to be bridged between the revenue and the expenditure estimated for the coming year.  It is not sufficient to hope that circumstances will improve, as there has been at least one year's experience to show how far the situation can deteriorate.  There has been a picture of a growing disproportion between State revenue on the one hand and State expenditure on the other.  The problem is what to do in that situation.  I do not think that anybody in this House will suggest that money is something which can be printed off, or that you can simply scrap the financial system.  Nobody has gone that far.  The furthest the Opposition has gone is to say that we can borrow.  Nobody suggested that the money is not to be found or must not be found.  Assuming for the moment that we are agreed on that premise&mdash; because I freely concede that if you take that away we are in a different line of country&mdash;the problem is how that money is to be found and for what purpose, how far that money should be found from current resources, and how far it is legitimate or prudent to pass on the burden to the future or, if you like, to mortgage the future of the country.  A mortgage can be a perfectly justifiable business transaction, and I <Col N="1388" /> do not use the word in a completely condemnatory sense, but it is an accurate description.</P>
    <P>This problem is one which, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, cannot be completely answered on a fiscal basis. It is one in which we have to take into account social and other factors. Broadly speaking, for a Government in this country at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for any Government, the factors to be considered are &mdash;how far, in meeting the gap which has to be met between the money at present returns available and the expenditure you envisage, can you actually effect monetary economy&mdash;in plain language, how far can you cut down expenditure.  On the other hand, if you are not going to cut down expenditure, what policy will you adopt to find the money for the expenditure which you think you should maintain?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Leary wants me to depart into a comparison between people's statements and their performances I will do that to oblige him, and the balance, I think, will be on my side, but for the moment I would prefer to try to deal with the problem and its solution, and I will be obliged if the Deputy allows me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to approach, there would be one group which might go far in saying that we should economise. But when you say that you are going to economise, are you going to stop the development which is undoubtedly necessary for this country?  In other words, you are up against the question <Col N="1389" /> of how far right will you go or how far left in that approach.  I think there is a rational and prudent answer to that in this country as we stand to-day.  There is still a need for development here.  There is still a need for expanding our own resources and limiting our dependence on outside. While that situation is still there, we must go as far as we can with the development programme, and we have to find the money to do it.  That is, broadly speaking, the answer, that we cannot solve the financial problem completely on the balance sheet basis of reducing the gap between expenditure and income by cutting.  We have rather to face the problem on the basis that a certain amount of development has to be provided for; in other words, life has to go on and the money has to be provided.</P>
    <P>If you adopt that approach, you must answer the final question: how are you going to find the money?  I am pausing there again, because it is there, logically, that the parting of the ways can come.  It is there, logically, that certain people whom we used to associate with Fine Gael in the old days might say to you: &ldquo;Cut down,&rdquo; and that other people might say to you: &ldquo;Go very much further.&rdquo;  I am accepting the position, which I think the Government had to accept in this respect, that certain things had to be provided for, both on the current and the capital side, that there was a limit to the economy that could be effected there, that progress and even the maintenance of the State demanded that the funds required for this purpose should be found and, therefore, the Government had no alternative but to find the money.</P>
    <P>That is limited by another proposition. It is limited by the capacity of the community to find that money in whatever way it choses.  I have not yet come to the point of discussing the methods of finding the money.  Any community, big or small, will have a limit to its overall capacity and there will be a limit, after it has provided for its current living needs, to what it can make available for investment for its own development.  The parallel there is close enough of the ordinary individual <Col N="1390" /> in more than floating circumstances. Let us take the case of the man who can provide for his ordinary living expenses and those of his family from day to day.  That eats up a proportion of his income and must be provided for first.  He has a certain amount over for providing for capital betterment, if I may put it that way, for his future, for improving his house and other such purposes, but there is a limit to his capacity to provide these things, and, if he goes beyond the limit, he can only do it by getting into debt, and even in the process of getting into debt he is putting a further commitment on himself.  Very soon, you find that there is an overall limit to his potentiality to provide what would, in his personal life, be the analogy of capital services where the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>Assuming for the moment that the bill for this year is within the capacity of the country for any one year, taken over all&mdash;and that, I think, is a matter that could bear examination at another time and in another place&mdash;it is proper, subject to that reservation, to provide for what has to be provided for, and then I say we are back to the problem of finding the money.  I should like to put this to the members of the Opposition, not by way of a challenge but by way of a hard, cold question that must have faced them if they were sitting on these benches as it faced the Government. Faced with money as you have it&mdash;and as I said earlier, nobody has challenged that&mdash;faced with the discrepancy between estimated expenditure for specified items, both current and capital, on the one hand, and estimated revenue on the other, what are you going to do?  You have only one of two courses to choose from&mdash;you either cut the expenditure or you raise the money to meet the deficit.</P>
    <P>Let us take the first alternative.  If you are going to cut expenditure, what are you going to cut it on?  It is fair to ask that question and I am not asking it specifically of the Opposition as an Opposition.  I am posing the question as one for us to examine here in the House.  Are you going to cut some of the capital development envisaged, <Col N="1391" /> like the development of our power resources, the first primary in any industrial development?  Are you going to cut services which are not really in the nature of capital development, the social services for which we have all been clamouring?  Are you going to cut any of the other items provided for?  Are you going to cut the size of the Civil Service or cut remuneration? If you are going to save you must do one of these things concretely and it is only fair to ask that the particular items to be cut should be specified.  I have not yet heard from anybody any concrete suggestion for cutting the expenditure on that side.</P>
    <P>If we are to have that expenditure, we must provide for it.  If we are to have an expenditure over all of approximately £133,000,000 in the coming financial year, we will have to provide for it, and if our revenue is going to fall short of that by something over £40,000,000, then provision for that £40,000,000 will have to be made. There is no escape from it unless you start playing with the whole monetary machine.  I have not heard anyone suggest that yet in this debate, and if anyone does suggest it, I would take this opportunity to say: We will consider it if you get down to a real hard and fast concrete proposal.  At this stage of the nation's history, this is no time for theoretical and half-baked assertions in relation to the financial machine.  Any suggestions will have to be considered in the same hard, concrete way as we have to consider taxes.</P>
    <P>That bill of £133,000,000 has to be met.  The money has to be found.  I will be bold enough to say, and justified in saying, that I think we are agreed on that.  We are agreed that that bill has to be met.  How is it to be met?  The Minister cannot print banknotes.</P>

I am assuming this, <Col N="1392" /> however, and I think it is fair to assume it, that from what has been said so far, nobody has asserted that the money should not be provided.  As I understand the hostility and the opposition to this Budget, it is based on three heads&mdash;(a) the money is raised in the wrong way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the arguments and I will try to answer them in a moment&mdash;(c) by borrowing, all the problems of the State could be solved. Lastly, there is another suggestion. Much of what Deputy Larkin said in this debate is worthy of attention&mdash;he was the only person who went so far as to make a concrete suggestion and he said&mdash;face a deficit.  We should consider that, too, I suppose.</P>
      <P>The money has to be found.  How is the Minister for Finance to find it?  He must raise it from the public or borrow it.  He has to do pretty well the same as any private individual&mdash;raise the money through his own efforts or borrow it.  That hard fact has led to what is a general feature of public finance nowadays&mdash;the Minister normally has to employ both methods. The fairly common-sense principle has been developed and evolved&mdash;and I have not heard anyone assail it very seriously&mdash;that where it is ordinary current living needs you raise the money directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The current annual charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to adopt those words unqualified.  The analogy which I admit is broad and undefined is, in the circumstances, a more accurate vehicle for conveying the general idea than a technical definition. On the other side, where you want money for something which will give a return, it is legitimate to borrow, on the theory that what you have built, or what you have invested the money in, will give you something, when exchanged&mdash;that it will give you <Col N="1393" /> the money to pay back your debt and your interest, so that at the end of the transaction you have a net gain or at least no loss.</P>
      <P>Like all such propositions, these are quite simple in the clear cut cases, but you meet that undefined &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo; where it is difficult of definition. Consequently, over the years there have been variations from time to time in the approach of different people to what is or what is not properly chargeable to current revenue.  In one sense, that is very relevant to this debate here to-night.  On the other hand, as the Minister pointed out in his Budget statement, it is not so vital, having regard to the size of the sum to be found. For that reason, I do not think we need pursue the point.</P>
      <P>The practical fact is that there is a figure round about the £40,000,000 mark to be provided.  The Minister, like his predecessor and like that Minister's predecessor, has but two ways of finding that sum&mdash;by borrowing it or raising it through current taxation.  Of course, the solution has to be a combination of both methods. The discrepancy is a very great one. One may argue as to how it came about, but the fact remains that the money must be found.  It is not loading it excessively on the current side to divide it in the proportions in which the Minister has divided it.  I grant you that that is a financial argument, but let me get down to the more concrete aspects of the matter.  Having regard to the capacity of the country and to the Minister's borrowing capacity, having regard to his actual position, I do not think he could have cut his deficit on current account to anything less than he has cut it. Having regard to the items comprised within what he has allocated to current account, he could not cut it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the significant point in this, and I think the Opposition should appreciate it, that although we have not forgone our point and the differences we have had with you on the question of what is properly chargeable to capital account and what is properly chargeable to current account, nevertheless, for the purposes of this transaction <Col N="1394" /> your method of reckoning has been adopted, and even on your method of reckoning there is still this deficit.  It is to meet the deficit on your method of reckoning that these taxes have to be raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that this would be an appropriate moment to make some retribution for all the abuse that was heaped on that method in the last three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy asks the question I will be frank in my reply to him.  I think not&mdash;and for the following reason.  I still maintain that much of what has been considered, if not all, and eventually passed off, if I might say so, as capital in the former Estimates is hardly properly so chargeable.  It may be necessary to charge some of it as a matter of expediency.  In principle, I should say that it is not chargeable at all. From a practical and a social point of view, it might be necessary to have some of it so charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point that, on your method of reckoning, there is a deficit of £11,000,000 to be made up and that the Minister, having provided for that deficit, currently, still has the over-all problem of providing for the balance of the £40,000,000 mentioned. How you are going to do it is the problem. You are in opposition and it is your privilege to criticise the Government without putting forward a concrete proposal here.  But in a matter of such seriousness, if you can show some other practical way of dealing with this problem, I assure you that the Minister for Finance and the Government would be very relieved because in the imposition of taxes of this nature it is no pleasure to anyone to have to meet a problem like this in the way it has to be met.  We have yet to hear the alternative proposals.  Faced with that position, I have got it down to this: that, on your method of accounting, a deficit of £11,000,000 had to be met from current account.  I understood Deputy Costello, the Leader of the Opposition, to make the case that much of this could be written off.  I will join issue with that viewpoint in a moment, and <Col N="1395" /> the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, has already done so.  What I say now is said in a full realisation of the points made by the Leader of the Opposition and the answers made to him.</P>
    <P>We have got this far: that this money has to be found and that it is on current account.  The next question for the Minister for Finance is: &ldquo;How am I going to tackle this problem?&rdquo; It is a pretty hefty sum of money to have to find.  It has to be got from the community at large.  Nobody will believe the fiction of a few rich people or a few companies from whom you can take it. Deputy Larkin pointed out that the number of well-off people in this country is not sufficient for the purpose. The fact is that the money has to be got from the people at large. What should be the social concern of the Minister?  It should be the social concern of the Minister to see how he can adjust the burden so that it will fall lightest on the people who can least afford it&mdash;and then, of course, he has to take into consideration the over-all interest of the entire community.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody will deny at present that the hardest pressed elements of the community for the last few years have been the families with the lower middle incomes.  Many of us have mentioned their case in this House before.  It is the people with salaries of, say, under the £700 mark, and corresponding people in other strata of society with comparable incomes, and so forth, who are in the most straitened circumstances.  After that there would be certain people such as the aged.  What reliefs could be given or how could you adjust the burden you will have to impose so as to treat them as equitably as possible: that was the problem which faced the Minister for Finance.  Unfortunately, the hard facts of our financial situation being what they are now, it is not, this year, a question of being able to give benefits.  It is unfortunate, but that is the way things have developed over a number of years.  It is not a question of being able to give benefits. It is a question of having to find money to maintain your existing <Col N="1396" /> standard of living, if I might call it so, for the State.  If that is so, it is then primarily a question of trying to adjust the burden.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done?  I think that what he did is very commendable. In the first place, coupled with the social service provisions which are coming and will benefit the class which is more immediately liable to the repercussions of an economic situation, as we know in the past, a good measure of protection is being given to them by these provisions. Secondly, the Minister has provided for children's allowances&mdash;not only increased allowances for the third child onwards, but also the introduction of the allowance for the second child. Then the income-tax provisions are an important relief in that regard.  It is rather difficult for a private Deputy to make calculations in this connection, but from such figures as are available, it appears that the actual increase in income-tax will operate largely by way of a redistribution of that tax rather than an over-all increase in tax. Admittedly, it will lie more heavily on the people in the upper income grades.</P>
    <P>The man earning a higher salary will pay more, but, with compensatory reliefs on the lower scale, it will benefit the people in the class of which I have been talking.  It would seem, offhand, that the bulk of income-tax payers in the country will pay less tax than formerly, notwithstanding the fact that the rate has gone up.  From figures which have been made available to me, it appears that about 188,000 individuals are liable to income-tax at the moment and that, of that 188,000 individuals, 170,000 will pay less tax than formerly in spite of the increase of 1/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy seriously suggest that the effect of the increase in the rate of income-tax will be to reduce it for 170,000 income-tax payers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>From the figures available to me, I understand that 170,000 persons, out of 188,000 persons, will actually pay less tax than formerly, but that 18,000 persons will pay more.  That substantiates the point I am making for the Deputy <Col N="1397" /> though the Deputy may not have appreciated it.  This increase in income-tax is not an increase in the over-all sense; it is an adjustment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene? The result of increasing the standard rate of income-tax by 1/- without making any further changes in the income-tax structure would undoubtedly involve an increase in the over-all tax upon everybody.  We, however, are making such significant changes in the earned income relief and in the reduced rates relief that in fact the people who are in the lower income groups will pay very much less next year as compared with what they paid last year.</P>

      <P>Of 27.5 thousand married tax-payers without children approximately 22.5 thousand will benefit; of 25.5 thousand married tax-payers with children almost 20,000 will benefit.  Because of the adjustment of rates, in spite of the increase in the standard rate, an unmarried person with an earned income up to £850 a year will actually be better off from an income-tax point of view than he was last year.  In other words, if one takes the income-tax paid for last year and compares it with the income-tax that will fall due for payment in the current year the difference, large or small, will be in the tax-payers' favour. In some cases it may be £10.  In other cases it may be small.  Beyond the £900 level there will be an increase.</P>

      <P>An unmarried man with an earned income of £200 per year would have paid, in the year 1951-52, £3 5s.  In the year 1952-53 he will pay £1 10s., leaving a net difference of £1 15s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The differential is as much as £10 13s. for a single man under the present system; where in the year that has just gone he would have paid £61 15s, he will only pay in the current year £51 1s. 10d.  That gives a differential in his favour of £10 13s. 2d.  I am dealing now with the single man.  In the case of a married man on a salary up to £1,000 per year, he and his family will be <Col N="1399" /> better off by sums varying from £1 to £13 up to £14.  In the case of those between £550 and £800 the income-tax relief will amount to anything between £10 and £14.  A married couple in the income group from £600 to £900 and up to £1,000 will get relief varying from £10 to £15, or £16, and so on, with comparable results in regard to other categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>These income-tax reliefs are particularly favourable to married people, but even unmarried people will also receive some benefit. There will be reliefs in regard to the wage earning classes up to roughly £1,000 a year in the case of a married man.  There will be some benefit&mdash;it may be small or it may be substantial&mdash; depending on the variation from last year to this year.  Above that level of £1,000 a higher rate of tax will be <Col N="1400" /> paid.  The people who are earning over £1,000 a year will pay a proportionately larger tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says that if I am accurate I have a good point, and I think he will find that I have been accurate in my over-all description. Now, that was a rational step for the Minister to take.  These burdens have to be borne by the community and, in imposing them, the Minister has very properly made some adjustments so that they will fall heaviest on the shoulders best able to bear them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given what relief he could to the disabled and so on.  We have heard suggestions here about the tax on the poor man's luxury.  When the 1947 Supplementary Budget was introduced, I begged the then Minister for Finance to forgo the tax on the pint.  I know we shall hear more about it now.  I think there is a point there but, nevertheless, the gap is so big now that it almost seems as if the Minister has no alternative but to go to the sources to which he has gone in order to bridge that gap.  He has, however, made the burden heavier on the higher income groups.  Everybody will have to bear them but heretofore everybody, rich and poor, had the benefit of the subsidies.  Now everybody will have to forgo these, and it is only on the higher income groups that the income-tax burden will fall. That is a point which might be remembered.</P>
      <P>I am not going to repeat either the social services or the reliefs, the very substantial reliefs, given by the Minister in regard to income-tax, what I shall call the overall benefits.  Unfortunately, we are faced with straitened circumstances and it is not so much a question of conferring benefits as of minimising the disadvantages of the situation in which we find ourselves and I think it is good that the Minister has been able to make these adjustments.  I think it is good that he has been able to envisage a programme for next year and to maintain such provisions for a capital development as are included in the Government's programme.  But, as I say, if you are going to do it you have to find the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> Perhaps at this stage it would be no harm if we soberly looked, without any recrimination, at the general trend of financial history in this country for the last four years.  I have here the Finance Accounts going back to the year 1947-48.  There are some general trends in them which are worth examining and worth adverting to, both from the point of view of seeing how we got to the position in which we are and also from the point of view of seeing what would be your future, if you continued on the road on which you were going.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not quarrel, I think, if we try just to find what was the position.  It is not a question of apportioning blame or a question of recrimination, so far as I am concerned, but I think it is very relevant to know where we stand and where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be all very nice if we could arrive at that position in this House, but seeking motives that are not properly inferable from the facts does not help us to get there.  The Finance Accounts for the year 1947-48 disclosed the situation that you had a total revenue of £65,000,000 and a total expenditure of £73,000,000. There was for that year a discrepancy between total revenue and total expenditure, as shown on the right hand side of the account, of £8,000,000.  We move then to the next year, and we find that the discrepancy between total revenue and total expenditure has jumped to £27,000,000.  In 1947-48 it was, as I have said, only £8,000,000.  In 1948-49 the total revenue was £71.7 million and the total expenditure was £99.4 million or £99.5 million to the nearest point.  Thus the approximate discrepancy between total revenue and total State expenditure&mdash;I have not subtracted the small balance items, but I do not think they matter for the general argument&mdash;was £27,000,000. That expenditure included Central <Col N="1402" /> Fund, Supply Services and capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>We then come to the Finance Accounts for 1949-50 and again we find that the discrepancy has risen by an additional £2,000,000.  It jumped from £8,000,000 in 1947-48 to £27,000,000 in 1948-49, and then there was a further addition.  We find that the revenue in 1949-50 was £74,000,000 odd and the corresponding total expenditure was £103.5 million, showing a discrepancy of £29,000,000.  In other words, the gap has been widened very significantly between revenue and expenditure.</P>
      <P>We come, then, to the last set of Finance Accounts available, that for 1950-51, and we find that, while revenue was £77.4 million, expenditure reached £109,000,000.  Subtracting, we get a gap of £32,000,000; the discrepancy has jumped again.  Then during the last year the figures, if my memory serves me, show that total revenue was £83,000,000 and total expenditure £129,000,000, disclosing a sum of nearly £40,000,000 as a discrepancy. The House will pardon me if I read the sequence of these figures again. Beginning with 1947-48 the sequence for revenue was £65.2 million, rising to £71.7 million, rising to £74,000,000, rising to £77,000,000 and, finally, to £83,000,000.  While there was that, shall I say, ordinary or normal expansion in revenue, corresponding to external monetary conditions largely, you had on the expenditure side the figures rising from £73,000,000 in 1947-48 to £99.5 million, to £103.5 million, to £109.6 million, to £129.7 million, and then you have your estimate for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the feature of all this sequence?  The feature is a widening gap between revenue and expenditure. Although revenue was increasing somewhat, expenditure was increasing at a much greater rate and, of course, that was reflected in what the Government at the time had to do in regard to money raised by the creation of debt.  The other receipts shown in these accounts are insignificant and I think we can ignore them.  They are less than £1,000,000 in any particular case.  If one looks at the money raised <Col N="1403" /> by the creation of public debt in these years one finds that in 1947-48 the total of the money raised by debt was somewhere round about £8,000,000&mdash;£7.8 million&mdash;roughly corresponding to the deficit.  By Ways and Means Advances there was only £3,500,000 raised.  We come to the following year, 1948-49, and we find that the money raised by the creation of debt had jumped to £27,000,000, of which Ways and Means Advances were a substantial portion. There was an Exchequer loan which, I think, in that case was fully subscribed. You close the gap by the creation of debt and your Ways and Means Advances have gone up.</P>
    <P>In the next year, 1949-50, you are up to £28.2 millions.  You have roughly balanced the gap between your revenue and your total expenditure, but Ways and Means Advances are up now to £15.9 million.  Of course, in the bonds second issue the public did not subscribe just as much as was wanted, and the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; started to run dry.  In the final year, 1950-51, for which I have the financial accounts, Ways and Means Advances amounted to £13.5 million. The total borrowing, the money raised by the creation of debt, was £31.5 million, which roughly corresponds to the £32,000,000.  To complete it for last year, the money raised by the creation of debt rose to £44.9 million.  What do all these figures show, and these are accepted accounts?  There was that growing, widening gap between expenditure and revenue.  In order to meet expenditure, that gap had to be met by increased borrowing, and was met by increased borrowing.</P>
    <P>Now, could that go on?  Before we go into the actual figures relating to the particular case, in principle could that thing go on?  Take the simple case of an individual.  Can he go on and on when he gets into debt and still finds that he wants more money?  Can he go on and get further into debt, even supposing that his bank manager will allow him to do it?  Supposing that the source from which you are going to do the borrowing still continues to be available, are you going to be able to do it, and, if you try to do it, will you get the money?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> These are the problems that are in it.  Now, over these years it is quite apparent that, for whatever reason or motives, we were increasing the indebtedness of the State.  That is shown by the figures.  The figure relating to Ways and Means outstanding at the end of the financial year, is a very interesting one from that point of view.</P>

      <P>Yes, but there was a very interesting figure published the other day.  It is an indicator if you like. It is a simple indication of the amount of your overdraft, so to speak, or of how much was outstanding at the end of the financial year.  The Ways and Means Advances on the corresponding dates for two years had risen from £20,000,000 to £57,000,000.</P>
      <P>Now, it has been perfectly clear from all that that we had got to the point whether either expenditure had to be cut or where the proportion of the money that came from current revenue, is not going to be sufficient any longer. Let me put it this way: that you cannot go on any longer by simply letting expenditure drift up or go up, and just trust to the normal fluctuations of expenditure, hoping to fill the gap completely by borrowing.  That just cannot be allowed to continue any longer.  The gap has already got too wide and already there should have been, in previous years, a corrective applied to that.  If there had been, we would not find ourselves in quite the same position as we are in to-day.  It has now got to the stage where remedial action has to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember this, that even on the figures which the Minister has given himself&mdash;nobody, I take it, is challenging the accuracy of the accountancy returns furnished to the Minister&mdash; there is that deficit over all in the region of £40,000,000.  Granted that the Minister finds the £11,000,000 which he is going to find by taxation, there is still £35.9 million to be found.  Perhaps that may be misleading, and that I should say there is the substantial figure of well over £30,000,000 to be found by borrowing anyway.  It will be for the Minister a question as how to get it.  It is questionable whether the <Col N="1405" /> capacity of the State can ever be expanded to bear an annual sum very much greater than the sum which the Minister has here.</P>
    <P>Now, have regard to that figure and the sequences which have gone before. We have already got the capacity in the last published accounts of two years ago.  As far as the accounts are concerned for 1950 and 1951, on the borrowing of £13,500,000 for that year, the Minister was forced to seek £13.5 million by Ways and Means Advances and only got a little more approximately&mdash;£14.8 million by a loan.</P>
    <P>In order to get that loan, he had to put up his interest rates.  As a result of his having gone to the well for water earlier, he had to put on another ½ per cent. on his rates to get the money.  Though I have no figures to guide me, my impression is that the Government of that day did not get that loan fully subscribed, and had to have resort to practices which, no matter how we look at them, were inflationary, and they had probably to realise important revenue bearing investments to meet the liability there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Sterling assets, if you like.  I will deal with that in a moment.  I am glad that the Deputy reminded me of it, because there are some interesting points in regard to it. The fact is&mdash;I am putting the argument in another way&mdash;that, on that showing, already two years ago, we had probably got to the limit of our borrowing capacity.  That seems to be borne out by the subsequent history, for the sum to be provided is equal to that.  Two years ago we had got to the limit of what I may call our annual borrowing capacity, so that, even if the Minister provides the £11,000,000 on current account, he still has a sum to meet on capital account by borrowing, which is in excess of that sum which was indicated as the limit by the accounts of two years ago.  It seems, therefore, on that showing, that there would be no chance, even if the Minister tried to do what some Deputies allege they would like him to do&mdash;that is, go and <Col N="1406" /> borrow the lot&mdash;of his being able to do it.</P>
      <P>There are very serious grounds for wondering as to whether the Minister could get that money and could borrow on economic terms.  I am using the word &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; there as distinct from frittering away existing assets&mdash;that is eating in on your capital, which is not borrowing.  Now, add to that the current difficulties in the financial market, and I think it will be conceded that the Minister, no matter who the Minister is, has not a pleasant task in facing the raising of a loan.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not the whole condition of securities in the sterling area is the one that will rule and not any local conditions here.  When one has regard to the various facts of the recent past, including the fall in Government security prices and the tendency for investors to go towards the higher-yielding stocks and shares, one feels that borrowing is becoming an increasingly expensive process as well as everything else.  Let us not forget that borrowing is loading an increase on to your expenditure side in the Central Fund services.  Already the charges for the service of debt have increased over the period of years to which I have referred from £3.5 million to over £7,000,000, that is, double itself.  £3.5 million merely to pay interest and Sinking Fund on debts incurred in the last three years would be a substantial relief to the Minister if it could be taken off now.</P>

      <P>Central Fund Services, Service of Public Debt, Interest, £6.3 million, Sinking Fund, £1.7 million. That is over the £7,000,000 I mentioned and the interest is higher. Had the Deputy asked me on the spot I would have told him it would be less. The proportion is £6.3 million.  If you look back on the accounts you will find that the corresponding figure was £3.5 million three years ago.  The point I want to make in all objectivity is that borrowing is not an unmixed blessing even if you can get away with it.  Already in three years the Minister has a burden of £3,500,000 more approximately in relation to debt than he had three years ago.  If that £3,500,000 could be taken off the £11,000,000 he has to meet by taxation his taxation would be correspondingly less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a fair argument to say&mdash;<Col N="1408" /> it is legitimate criticism without any-bitterness-that fundamentally our financial criticism of the Coalition Government was that it failed to see where the drift was going.  The drift was one where expenditure tended to outpace revenue although revenue was buoyant.  The trouble was that the expenditure tended to outdrift the revenue at a fast rate.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, I am taking it as an incontrovertibly good thing to have done in those cricumstances, but by adding to your expenditure side in regard to capital, items which, strictly speaking, were not capital in the sense that they were going to give you a money return that would pay for themselves, you were aggravating that gap and allowing that gap to widen and the drift to accelerate.  In allowing that drift to continue and that gap to widen this year it inevitably drifted towards the position where some day some Government would have to bring that up with a jerk.</P>
    <P>That is what we are up against.  We are feeling the jerk now because the necessary controls were not applied during the three years.  In 1947-48, there was only a gap of £8,000,000. That was almost met in a routine way but it had widened to a gap of £40,000,000 this year.  The corresponding borrowings had risen to £31,000,000. But it is significant that it is not even what you might call straightforward borrowing.  You have the mix-up of Ways and Means Advances coming into the picture.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me to go into the mater of the Grant Counterpart Fund.  I shall not forget to do so.  You had that situation of drift, the widening discrepancy between revenue and expenditure.  The result is that we are faced with the ultimatum, if you like, or the dilemma, that £40,000,000 has to be found.  What proportion are you going to raise on current account and what proportion <Col N="1409" /> are you going to borrow?  Only £11,000,000 on current account is very far from being either orthodox or conservative. I think we will agree with the Government that they are right to keep the programme there and that the Minister was right to make the adjustments in the incidence of the burden which has fallen upon the country largely as a result of the drift I have mentioned.  I say objectively and without meaning to hurt anybody that, largely as a result of that drift, this burden has to be met and the Minister has made the best effort he can to place it on the shoulders that can bear it.</P>

If the Coalition Government had only tried to keep revenue and expenditure comparable, then we would not be faced to-day with the gap with which we are faced.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is simply that it was the failure to keep that gap closed which has led us to the position where one has, so to speak, just to come up against it and cross it.  It is perfectly evident that Deputy McGilligan, while Minister for Finance. was apprehensive of this.  The only criticism I shall levy at the Coalition for the moment is that fundementally, with their divergent views, coalitions are weak.  The indications are here in Deputy McGilligan's own approach even to this problem.  They are worth noting and, for that purpose, I propose to put some matters on record in connection with this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  On the 28th February, 1951, Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, when presenting his Vote on Account, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It would appear that the increase in the consumption of essential goods is put at 9 per cent. while the consumption of drink and tobacco have gone up by 16 per cent.  The consumption of other goods, as the phrase is used has probably&mdash;it would certainly mean non-essential goods&mdash;increased by 32 per cent. Taking these two tables together it would appear to be the case that the standard of consumption is being maintained by imports, such imports not being paid by current earnings or by current savings.</P>
      <P>The details of the situation will be known to Deputies, but there are one or two I should like to stress.  I said already that the lack of the balance which has figured in the 1950 accounts is partly the result of a rise in import prices and that rise is not yet matched by a corresponding increase in the return for exports.  The rise in import prices is to some extent the product of devaluation. Certain delayed effects of that began to make their appearance in the early summer of 1950.  But, more particularly, the rise is due to rearmament and the scarcity which that caused.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to deal with the ratio of prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Volume 124, column 786 of the Official Reports.  He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The developments in 1950 are, of course, disquieting and it is clear that we could not for very long expand consumption at the present excessive level without inflation in the limited sense of price increases. Most of the blame can accordingly be put on external forces outside Government control.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister at <Col N="1412" /> that time was nervous of the way things were developing.  As I say, it was probably unfortunate that things took that particular turn at the time. But already at that time, as he pointed out in the part I have quoted, the terms of trade were going against us. On March 8th, in closing the debate, as reported in column 1614 he refers to five sources of financing.  The last two of these five are the American Loan Counterpart Fund and the sales of sterling investments of Government funds.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said with regard to the last two that I brought these under criticism as being &lsquo;unrelated to current savings.&rsquo; I distinctly said in regard to these that any resort to them would undoubtedly be of an inflationary type and, therefore, caution in resorting to them had to be exercised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear that at that particular stage Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, was apprehensive about the turn things were taking and that becomes more clear when you come to his Budget statement a year ago.  It might be interesting to Deputy Leary to read this passage for him.  As reported in column 1877 of Volume 135, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I refer later to the need for moderation on the part of all sections of the community&mdash;employers and employees alike&mdash;in the pursuit of higher monetary incomes unrelated to increases in prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcome development....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was that we were not able to produce enough.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...indeed, they can only accelerate the process of inflation and cause social injustice as between those able to improve or maintain their position and those who cannot enlarge their incomes and are, therefore, forced to assume an undue burden of hardship. For this reason, the Government ask for restraint in the putting forward of wage and salary claims and have taken measures intended to limit <Col N="1413" /> price increases to those justified by increases in costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, by drawing on our external assets to pay for consumer goods.  As reported in column 1882 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is still proper and eminently reasonable to draw on our external assets if thereby we speed up the process of capital development at home.  What is abnormal and, if it persists can be seriously damaging, is to use up our external resources for consumption purposes.  Have we been doing that?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the tea and the sugar depend on this and if Deputy Leary realised that, we might be able to make better provision in regard to these matters.  As reported in column 1884 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The conclusion to which the analysis leads is that, while the extra external disinvestment we incurred in 1950 was balanced as to roughly two-thirds by new home investment and increased stocks, there still continues to be a substantial use of past savings merely to lever up standards of consumption.  Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.  The implication is obvious.  We cannot have both consumption and capital development on the present scale unless we save more and produce more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from these quotations that the Minister for Finance at that time was already feeling the seriousness and gravity of the situation which we had to face.  Unfortunately, however, no adequate provision was made to meet that situation.  Nothing was done to adjust the revenue position in those three years.  I know it is difficult for any Coalition Government to meet matters of this sort.  It is highly unpopular for anybody and for any Government to do it, but the trouble is that if we do not do it sooner we must do it later and cause the greater suffering <Col N="1414" /> as a result.  That is the situation which has to be faced now.</P>
    <P>All the other palliatives and barriers have been exhausted.  There was the Counterpart Fund, to which both Governments resorted as a buffer. However, the moneys under that fund must be paid for and will be paid for but the advantages of that barrier, such as it is, are not there now.  What was that dollar loan spent on but things for which mostly there is no large return, and the answer of the Minister given in the Dáil was that it was mostly on wheat, flour and grain. These figures are familiar to most of us but the important thing is to what extent it was spent on capital equipment and machinery and such matters. Only 6.9 or approximately $7,000,000 out of a total of $146,000,000 was spent on those important items.  Further sums were spent on raw materials which may have been justifiable in the circumstances of the time, but if we take off a sum for these we find that two-thirds of the money was spent on consumer goods.</P>
    <P>It is an old argument as to the advisability of spending dollars in America for the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs which could be grown at home.  We have gone into that argument often.  The fact is that this was a dollar loan and a commitment which, no matter what distinction Deputy Dillon makes, must be met. It is a loan and a commitment for this country, no matter what way you work out the financial transaction.  I think it was seriously wrong to spend this money on goods which we could have produced at home, and Deputy Dillon knows that I think that is so and there is no use in mincing words about it. It was a considerable factor in the situation in which we found ourselves. That money has to be paid back and it is a payment on the wrong side for us, and the goods are gone.</P>

      <P>I did not, but I say if that had continued it would have led to a very serious situation. These are all factors which we must take into account in this difficult situation. We are not trying to pretend that this taxation can be anything but a burden, but our people will realise that one has to pay for the things that the Government can give them in spite of the fact that they have been misled in so far as some irresponsible people in certain quarters are concerned; and I am not referring to Deputy Morrissey in this connection, because Deputy Morrissey has been very responsible in these matters here frequently in the House.  There are, however, others who have not been responsible in representing to the people what the situation actually was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money for the social services and capital development and other purposes <Col N="1416" /> has to be found, and if it cannot be provided out of revenue it must be provided by some other method.  I think the Minister and the Government are trying to provide for a continuance of the development programme, but there is a limit to the country's capacity to do that.  I would rather take the view that we will find the money to do the work rather than that we will only do the work for which we have money available.</P>
    <P>While taking that attitude we can make the remark that again, unfortunately if you like, there is much to show that the orthodox economists have a lot of right on their side in post-war economic development.  These are the hard facts which must be taken into account and faced, whether we like it or not.  We will hear much about these taxes and much about this Budget, which is designed to meet a situation where there is a gap between income and expenditure and where the State was living beyond its means. Not only the Fianna Fáil Party were saying this.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, had his fears that the State was living beyond its means from a consumer point of view and that we were borrowing more than we could afford.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am proposing to say now is not quite germane to what I have been saying all along, but it is interesting. I think it was Deputy Dillon who said something about the new taxes aggravating emigration.  I wonder how far these taxes can do that? Although it is necessary to say that this Budget will impose a strain, still there is a big discrepancy between the prices of petrol, cigarettes, whisky and stout in the Six Counties and in the rest of Ireland.  Although petrol will go to 3/6 per gallon here, it is 4/3 per gallon in the Six Counties.  I feel the Deputy will concede that there is a practical problem, unfortunately, resulting from Partition, where big discrepancies in prices on either side <Col N="1417" /> of the Border are involved.  Where there is a big discrepancy in price there is an immediate problem.  I am not suggesting that this is a major consideration with regard to the Budget but it is one to which we might advert. In the Six Counties and in Britain the cigarettes are around about the 3/6 mark per packet, whiskey is 5/- per glass and stout 1/11 per pint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, Deputy. We have said the same thing before. We should not condition ourselves and we do not condition ourselves to circumstances in Britain.  That can be said in fairness to both Government and Opposition.  Unfortunately, if you like, we are associated in the one financial structure; we are part of the sterling area and certain comparisons are therefore, legitimate as regards prices and living conditions in both countries. Quite frankly, I do not see the force of Deputy Dillon's argument that we are encouraging our people to emigrate and chasing them out of the country in view of the differential between prices and living conditions in Britain and here.  In my view, that problem is rather one of another sort which we can discuss at another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to refer to a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition, which I jotted down.  He said: &ldquo;We had created a financial structure of impressive strength.&rdquo;  I must say that I fail to see the strength of a financial structure which is characterised in the widening gap between income and revenue, which I have demonstrated from the accepted figures which I quoted.  I fail to see the impressiveness of the structure which is built largely, if it is a structure at all, on a debt basis.  I fail to see how a situation in which one has to look to borrow money and at the same time increase the cost of borrowing so as to get the money at all, could be called impressive; a situation where, at the same time, the balance of payments, which is fundamental to this picture, as the Minister has said, was going against the then Administration in the way in which it was; a situation where, coupled with that financial structure, <Col N="1418" /> the Government responsible for it should go out of office handing over at a time when the cost of living had started to soar and trends had started to go wrong.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance last year, said in his Budget speech: &ldquo;Many things are outside the control of the Government.&rdquo; The experience of everybody in this House, acting in or behind a Government, shows that there are great limits to what it can do.  I think we are all agreed on that.  In these circumstances, frankly, I fail to see that, in the first place, there is any great credit due to the inter-Party Government or, in the second place, that there was anything very impressive about their financial structure. However, I suppose it is too much to hope that this matter can be approached on a hard factual basis.  It seems a peculiar thing that, apart from Deputy Costello making certain deductions and making the case that there was overtaxation, there has been a great evasion of figures and facts by members of the Opposition.  This is not a challenge, but I feel it would be helpful for us all if those very facts and figures in the Budget with which I have dealt had featured more in this debate.  We could have found grounds for commendation or criticism of the Minister if that had been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Just now Deputy de Valera challenged us to give more attention to the figures and the facts&mdash; the accurate figures&mdash;which the Minister had given us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here.  This morning Deputy Costello described this Budget as being not merely a cruel Budget but an unjust one.  I want to go further. I want to say that in this Budget there are figures that are neither true nor accurate.  In this Financial Statement&mdash;the most important document that issues from the Government of this country in any year&mdash;there are figures which are false.  I ask Deputy de Valera not to leave the House now, because what I have to say will be <Col N="1419" /> worth waiting for.  The figures in the Budget statement are not correct, and they are the figures upon which the Minister has sought to justify one of his major impositions on the people of this country.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies and the Minister to page 50 of the statement issued yesterday.  I quote the Minister's words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There has also been a spectacular increase in the registration of motor vehicles, which numbered 99,662 in 1939, 173,234 in 1949, and 223,444 in 1951.  In the light of these figures, we may assume that petrol will readily bear an additional 4d. per gallon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May I again draw Deputies' attention and the Minister's attention to the statement: &ldquo;There has also been a spectacular increase in the registration of motor cars.&rdquo;  Some of those figures are out by as much as 50,000.  The figures given in this Budget statement, upon which are reared impositions on the public of something in the neighbourhood of £50,000,000 additional taxation, and the preparation of that statement by the Minister, are fraught with criminal negligence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. The Deputy has purported to quote from page 50 of my Budget speech. He has stated that I said there was a &ldquo;spectacular increase in the registration of motor cars&rdquo;.  I said nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy deliberately used the words &ldquo;motor cars&rdquo;, which is quite a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did, I apologise to the Minister.  I meant to say &ldquo;vehicles&rdquo; in any case.  It does not correct the figures.  I accept the Minister's correction and I apologise to him for inadvertently using the word &ldquo;car&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;.  I say the figures are completely wrong and I will prove it.  The Minister says that the number of motor vehicles registered in 1939 was 99,662.  Actually-and I quote from the report of the <Col N="1420" /> Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1939-40, page 209- the total number of vehicles, all classes, in that year registered was 73,813.  But the total number of driving licences issued was 99,662.</P>
      <P>This is the Budget statement in which every figure is supposed to be checked.  That was 1939.  The Minister told us yesterday that the number of motor vehicles registered in 1949 was 173,234.  Again wrong, wrong to the tune of 51,000, because the total number of vehicles of all classes-and I hope that is comprehensive enough for the Minister-registered in 1949 was 122,536, but the total number of driving licences issued was 173,234.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Accuracy of figures. Let me go on to 1951.  We are told that in 1951 there were 223,444 motor vehicles registered.  Actually it was 70,000 short of that figure.  The number registered was 155,982, but the number of driving licences issued was 223,444.</P>
      <P>I feel, Sir, that this is an unprecedented happening in this House and I would venture to say in any other Parliament wherein a Budget statement, particularly a Budget of this type, that there is such a glaring and a major blunder made.  It is quite obvious that in respect of at least one of the major impositions the Minister based his decision to impose that tax on false premises, on a foundation that was not there.  I venture to suggest that this debate ought to be adjourned and this financial statement ought to be withdrawn until such time as the Minister and the Government have an opportunity of checking both the figures I have quoted and the other figures which are given throughout the 71 pages of that statement, so that the House may know what they are really dealing with.  At the moment we do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest with respect, Sir, that having regard to the immense importance of this, not merely to this House but to the people outside, this debate should be adjourned, that this financial statement should be withdrawn and the Minister given an <Col N="1421" /> opportunity to correct it.

He said: &ldquo;In the light of these figures&rdquo;-mark those words&mdash;&ldquo;we may assume that petrol will readily bear an additional 4d. per gallon.&rdquo;  May I ask the Minister whether, in the light of the fact that those figures are shown now to be untrue, he is prepared to withdraw that imposition of 4d. per gallon on petrol? Or does he want the House or expect the House to go on discussing this Budget statement and, in particular, the Resolution which imposes this 4d. per gallon, in view of the fact that he imposed it believing, as I am perfectly satisfied he honestly believed, that he was dealing with the real figures of registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear, in case there might be any misunderstanding about this, that not for a moment do I suggest, or has it entered my mind, that there was anything deliberate in regard to this matter of the figures.  But I do allege negligence, negligence amounting almost to the verge of being criminal, in bringing in such an immense impost as this on the citizens of this country, that figures of a major kind such as that would not be properly checked.  I <Col N="1423" /> cannot understand it.  It is beyond me.</P>

      <P>In your absence from the Chair, I pointed out to the House and to the Minister that, on page 50 of the Minister's Budget statement yesterday, there was a mistake, a major mistake, in figures which bear great importance in relation to the Minister's whole Budget structure. The Minister stated on page 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There has also been a spectacular increase in the registrations of motor vehicles which numbered 99,662 in 1939, 173,234 in 1949 and 223,444 in 1951.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not going to weary you, Sir, by going into it as fully as I did go into it in your absence, but I will say that these are not the figures for motor vehicle registrations; these are the figures for the issue of motor licences, which is a completely and entirely different matter.  The Minister went on to say, immediately after these figures:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the light of these figures we may assume that petrol will readily bear an additional 4d. per gallon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A major blunder of this magnitude in a Budget is unprecedented and I respectfully suggest to you and to the Minister, but first to you, Sir, that I now make a motion that, in view of that, either the Dáil adjourn or the debate on the General Resolution be adjourned to give the Minister an opportunity of having his Budget statement further checked and represented to the House.

I was prepared to invite the Minister, any of his colleagues on the Front Bench or anybody in the House to challenge the accuracy of what I have said. How am I to know, how is any other Deputy in this House to know, that the same blunders and mistakes were not made in relation to the figures on which it was decided to remove the subsidies?  Deputy Costello showed that this morning to the tune of £2,000,000 in respect of subsidies alone. How do we know that we have not the same miscalculation, the same wrong sets of figures, basing the decision to put 1/- on income-tax?  I do not know. Is there any member of Dáil Éireann on this or on the other side of the House who will get up and, in the light of what I have now exposed, say that any of the other figures in the Budget <Col N="1428" /> statement are watertight and have been checked and re-checked to make sure that they are absolutely sound? Of course there is not.  The Minister is trying to be cheap in jibing at me. If I were in the Minister's position and that major blunder were disclosed in this House, the first thing I would do would be immediately to tender my resignation to the Taoiseach.</P>

He was just following, or attempting to follow, the line set for him this morning by the Tánaiste.  Those of us who know the Tánaiste over a long period of years were not a bit surprised at this line: having regard to the compensation provided in this Budget and in the Social Welfare Bill for those on lower incomes, they would be better off when the Budget became law than they were yesterday.  Is there any Deputy even on the Fianna Fáil side who will swallow that an old age pensioner who gets 1/6 under this Budget is going to be better off next Friday than he or she was last Friday?  Does anybody believe that for one moment?  Does anybody believe that they will be better off after the 1st July?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan does not believe it, and there is no man in this House, whatever he may say, who can more readily grasp the full implications of this Budget and realise to the full how it will hit the people of the country, particularly the poorer people, than Deputy Cowan.

Notwithstanding all that, however, I will lay you 100 to 1 which lobby he will be in.  Johnny, do not draw me any further on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are going to be better off.&rdquo; When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce Fianna Fáil Deputies and other Deputies used to tell me, just as they told my predecessor and successor, Deputy Lemass, that 6 lb. of bread per head per week was not enough for the people of the country, particularly the people of rural Ireland.  We recognised that, and met that point of view&mdash;both he and I as Minister&mdash;to the fullest extent possible in the circumstances, by making available not merely to bog workers and others, but over the whole harvest period, additional supplies of bread.  Let us say that a <Col N="1430" /> fair ration would be 7 lb. per week, 1 lb. per day per head.  Allowances are to be increased by 1/6 and the 2 lb. loaf is to be increased 2 ½d.  Just take that without taking tea, sugar or butter, and let us forget for the moment any idea of a bottle of stout, a pint, an ounce of tobacco or a packet of cigarettes.  Does anybody think for a moment that 1/6 per week will compensate for that enormous load which starts now, but the impact of which will not be felt until after the 1st July?</P>
    <P>We had cheap little interjections from the Minister and from Deputy Vivion de Valera to the effect that the Minister was going to give more to the poor and was getting after the rich. Robin Hood!  Deputy de Valera also set out to prove that everybody with a salary under £1,100 per year would, as far as income-tax is concerned, be served by this Budget rather than injured by it.  How many rich people have we in this country over that ceiling?</P>
    <P>Have we enough to give us an additional £15,000,000 taxation?  Is it not all sheer nonsense?  I listened on many an occasion to Deputies behind the Government, when they were on this side, bleating about the cost of living. I read a debate two years ago that was dragged out for the best part of three months by Fianna Fáil Deputies on the cost of living, on emigration and on unemployment.  How did the cost of living then, which they said was unbearable for the people, compare with the cost of living after ten months of this Government, even before the introduction of this Budget?</P>
    <P>Does anybody in the House believe for one moment that the full effect of this Budget is not going to have a more severe impact upon the real cost of living in the country than any single action or group of actions has had in our time?  Do we not know that, due to the gloomy speeches, due to the the depressing speeches, due to the untrue speeches, before this Budget hit the country at all, business in certain lines had been brought practically to a standstill; that production in most of our factories had either almost ceased altogether or had slowed down very considerably; that distributors <Col N="1431" /> were finding it almost impossible to get buyers for their goods; and that unemployment, or rather, disemployment of persons who were in what they thought to be safe and secure positions has proceeded in the past nine months at the rate of 1,500 for every month Fianna Fáil has sat on that side of the House?</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who has any knowledge of the economic or social conditions of the country who is in any doubt as to what is going to happen almost immediately?  Are we not being thrown back by this Fianna Fáil Budget into the position out of which the inter-Party Government brought this country in 1948&mdash;let Deputy Allen allow me to finish and he may smile on the other side of his face&mdash;back to the time when we had the old vicious circle of prices and wages chasing each other?  Does anybody believe for a moment that there is a working man or working woman inside or outside a trade union who will not demand increases, or insist upon the leaders of his or her union furnishing demands immediately to their employers for increases, sufficient to meet the additions which are being imposed by the Budget?  Does everybody not know that, and, as was said earlier by Deputy Dillon, how many of the employers, without still further increasing prices, will be able to meet and pay the increases which their employees will be seeking and insisting on getting?  Is there anybody in the House or outside who believes that this will not increase rapidly and by thousands still further the number of unemployed?  Does anybody doubt that not merely are we going to have the old vicious circle back, but that it will be a circle more vicious than anything we had before?</P>
    <P>I invite some of the Deputies on the opposite side and some of the Ministers who read some of the speeches they made two, three and four years ago inside and outside this House before they seek to justify this Budget.  I am perfectly satisfied that a great deal of this taxation is entirely unnecessary.  I am perfectly satisfied that this country and its people are <Col N="1432" /> in a much worse position to-day than even 12 months ago to meet and cope with this very heavy imposition, whether they be workers, shopkeepers or anybody else.  I hear some adverse comment on that and I can only suspect from where it comes.  All the long talk, all the quotations and all the repetition by Deputy Vivion de Valera does not change it one iota. I invite Deputies who know the country just as well as I do, who are as conversant with the lives of the people and the sort of life the average person lives as I am and who have as intimate a knowledge of the life of an ordinary working man and his wife and family, and the way in which they have to work their household economy as I have, to get up here and say that the proposals offered in this Budget will more than meet the impositions contained in it.  The compensations would not meet the increased charges and the increased prices of the essentials, much less adding in what some people talk about as necessaries and others, depending on which side of the House they are, describe as luxuries.</P>
    <P>Deputies cannot cod themselves that the compensations offered for the poor are going to compensate them, because most of us know that it is the poor who will be hit, and the poorer they are the more they will be hit by this Budget, because the poorer they are, the more bread, the more tea, the more sugar, and, in so far as they can, the more butter they will use.  They have to use proportionately much more of these items of food than the better-off person and Deputies know that.  I want to ask the House, as I am sure everybody in the country is asking himself, what has happened in this country to bring about this economic revolution. The Minister and some of his colleagues, such as Deputy Vivion de Valera, glibly speak of world conditions, world forces.</P>
    <P>In some of the countries which have to provide for European defence and perhaps even far beyond what is required for defensive measures and which are spending immense sums on armaments, there has not been as revolutionary a change in their Budgets or their financial structure as there is <Col N="1433" /> made here in ours by this Budget, and the impost, the increased impost, over a period of 12 months on their people, not excluding provision for armaments, has not been as considerable as it is here.  This Government and the Party behind it know quite well that this is a bad Budget, that the country will be dead against it.  They would not dare to face the country on that Budget to-morrow morning.  They would not dare to seek a mandate for it, because they would not get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy what he knows and his colleagues know now, and what they will know much more clearly before they reassemble here.  This is a bad Budget, a Budget that is going to place a savage burden on the people, a Budget that will make unquestionably for more unemployment on a very big scale, a Budget that will hit very hard our industries and the whole manufacturing and distributing organisation.  I am as sure as I am standing here that, when they learned of the details last night and when some of them read them in the papers this morning, men and women working in shops and offices throughout the country said to themselves: &ldquo;That is enough, we have not been doing enough for the last month, three months or six months in some cases; this is the final straw; I wonder will I be getting my week or fortnight's notice with the pay envelope on Friday or Saturday next.&rdquo;  Does any Deputy think that is an exaggerated picture? Does any Deputy think there are not hundreds, if not thousands, of working men who are wondering whether this Budget will mean not only an increase <Col N="1434" /> in their cost of living but deprivation of their weekly wages and the substitution therefor of the queue at the labour exchange?</P>
      <P>Let us not try to pretend that there is nothing in this but sugar and no pill inside.  Let us remember the increases that will come upon the people on the 1st July&mdash;an increase of practically 40 per cent. on sugar, 100 per cent. on tea, practically 25 per cent. on butter, 30 to 35 per cent. on a loaf of bread.  In the face of that, I am prepared to say, and I do not care how it is misrepresented, that the imposition on the pint and even on the tobacco is not as serious.  May I remind the House of what Deputy McGilligan said yesterday, truthfully, that when the present Ministers were in office in 1947 and introduced a Budget to impose taxes very considerably less drastic than the charges in the present Budget, they sought to justify them on the grounds that the money they would receive by imposing these taxes they were going to use to subsidise essential foodstuffs. When we came into power, at a cost of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £6,000,000, we reduced or removed the additional taxes on beer, tobacco, cinemas and so on imposed in the Supplementary Budget and we did not reduce the subsidies by one brass farthing.  Not only that, we increased some of the rations without increasing the subsidy price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not forget that a very important part of this Budget&mdash; in case the Deputy has not read it or did not listen to the Minister&mdash;is the Minister's proposal to borrow a very considerable amount of money this year&mdash;which those of us who have some interest in the country and some concern for those to-day employed in capital development schemes, hope will be fully subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Deputy Allen sometimes takes the Minister for Finance as his model.  I would not care to see Deputy Allen&mdash; for whom I have a very fine respect, notwithstanding the cracks we may exchange across the House&mdash;modelling himself too much or too often on the Minister.  This particular Budget not merely puts on increased taxes over and above those which were put on in the Supplementary Budget but it puts on a number of new taxes that were not even attempted in the Supplementary Budget; and on top of that it removes almost entirely the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to Deputy Cowan &mdash;and I am not trying to put him in any particular corner.  He made several contributions to the debate.  How can he seek to justify voting for that set of circumstances that I think I have quite fairly and I hope pretty accurately outlined, that he would have denounced as vehemently and as effectively as he did the comparatively mild proposals in the Supplementary Budget?  As a matter of fact, we could thank the Supplementary Budget for giving us the honour of the Deputy's presence in this House.  I hope we will not have to thank this Budget for depriving us of that presence.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back to where I started in relation to the figures I quoted.  The Minister heard them, the House heard them and they are on the record.  I gave page and column for the figures which I gave.  I assert that this is not a true Budget, that it is based upon a wrong set of figures, conclusions drawn from figures which did not relate to the registration of motor vehicles, which did not come, in one of the years, within 70,000 of the number.  I am sorry that the Minister refused to adjourn to have this further examined so that Deputies might at least approach the Budget and make their contribution in the knowledge that the figures which they were using and criticising or trying to analyse were true and accurate figures.

      <P>My motion was overruled by the Ceann Comhairle in the exercise of his judgment and his duty in the Chair.  All he said was that he would not accept the motion which I tendered.  By the time this is finished, the Minister will be fully welcome to whatever kudos he can get out of it. I only hope for the Minister's own sake and for his reputation, as well as for the sake of the House, that he will not try to suggest that the figures which I have quoted are other than accurate.  I hope that he will not try in any way to justify and prove as accurate in relation to their context the figures which are in his financial statement.  The facts are there and the figures are here.  They can be quoted from official documents.</P>
      <P>No talk, no eloquence, no flights of fancy can make this a good Budget or can make it anything but a harsh and a savage Budget&mdash;a Budget that will have a terrific impact on the whole economic and social life of this country. It is a Budget that will leave us much poorer in relation to money and services and infinitely poorer in relation to our boys and girls many more of whom, I am afraid, will now be forced to leave this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious, from the tremendous noise that Deputy <Col N="1437" /> Morrissey made about his discovery of some figures which he alleges are not correct, that if there were any more figures in the statement that were not correct we should have heard about them.  I wonder if Deputy Morrissey realise that an extra sum of £15,000,000 has to be found this year? Deputy Morrissey did not advert to that matter at all in his statement. He spoke as if there was no need whatsoever for any sort of additional taxation.  Apparently, he has even thrown over his leader who has admitted for months past that there is a problem to be faced.</P>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House will contend that this Budget is something that anybody would like to impose if it could be avoided. However, the facts of the situation must be faced.  I do not want to repeat the quotations which Deputy Major de Valera read out here this afternoon of speeches made over the past few years by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Finance, pointing to the trend in financial affairs.  Deputy McGilligan spoke about that trend, and drew attention to it, but apparently he allowed the Government of which he was the Minister for Finance to do the other thing.  We are now facing the result of that default on his part.  One need not be deeply versed in high finance to recognise that if the trend were allowed to continue for a few years more, what would have to be done then would be infinitely worse than what is being attempted to-day, and would have infinitely worse consequences for the country.  I think that the members of the Coalition Government, in view of what their own Minister for Finance told them over the years, must have been aware of this trend.  They must know that the present situation is, to a large extent, the result of the policy they pursued, and they ought at least now face the facts and try to find a way out.  Maybe our method is not the best method, but it is a method, and the Coalition Government did not try to remedy the situation at all, but just let things drift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not heard any constructive <Col N="1438" /> suggestions from the Opposition Benches.  Instead, there has been an attempt to ignore the position that does, in fact, exist to-day.  An attempt was made to tell us that a number of the statements made by the Minister are not correct.  Take, for example, the question of income-tax.  An attempt was made to assert that the Minister's statements last night, and elaborated on to some extent to-day by Deputy Major de Valera, are not correct, and that the bulk of the people will have to pay more under the rearrangement of the income-tax code.  I have some figures here which have been worked out.  I do not want to bore the House, but they are worth bringing to the attention of the House. Let us examine Schedule E, earned income.</P>
    <P>We find that an unmarried man earning £500 a year will actually have to pay £10 2s. 6d. less for income-tax in the coming year.  At £600 a year the reduction would be £8 and at £800 the reduction would be £3 15s.  At £900 a year he will actually have to pay 5/- more for income-tax than he paid last year.  All the above figures are in respect of an unmarried man.  Now let us take the figures for a married couple.  At £400 a year the husband gains £3 10s.  At £700 a year he gains £12 17s. 6d.  At £800 a year he gains £10 15s.  At £1,000 a year he gains £2 15s. and at £1,100 a year he will have to pay £1 5s. more than he paid last year.  The figures for a married couple with one child are as follows.  At £500 a year they will gain £4 5s.  At £800 a year they will gain £4 15s.  At £1,100 they will gain £2 15s. and at £1,200 a year they will have to pay £1 5s. more than they paid last year.</P>
    <P>A married man with two children earning £600 a year gains £5; on £800 a year he gains £15 5s.; on £900 a year he gains £14 15s.; on £1,200 a year he gains £2 15s. and on £1,300 he will have to pay 25/- extra.  A married man with three children earning £900 a year will actually gain £16 3s. 6d.; with £1,200 a year £5 18s. and he will have to earn £1,400 before he will be asked to pay £2 2s. extra. A married man with four children earning <Col N="1439" /> £800 a year will gain £6 18s. 6d.; earning £1,000 a year he will gain £16 12s.; and earning £1,400 a year he will gain £1 1s. 1d.; and he will have to earn £1,500 a year before he will be asked to pay £2 19s. extra.</P>
    <P>Let us hear no more about the ordinary man having to pay extra income-tax under this Budget for the ordinary man is getting a fairly substantial relief.  In some cases that relief will represent the equivalent of at least 5/- per week to make up, admittedly, for what he will have to pay because of the removal of the subsidies.  In addition to that&mdash;and this is something I have not heard mentioned here to-day although I have been in the House almost continuously since 12 o'clock&mdash;there are increased allowances for children.  I remember that Deputy Dillon, when the first Children's Allowances Act was introduced, praised the then Government for its introduction.  In future, instead of having 2/6 for the third child there will be 2/6 for the second child and 4/- for each subsequent child.  I regard these allowances as one of the best social services we can give our people. From the Christian point of view, it is an excellent social service.  In relation to the extra burden which will fall upon families because of the removal of the subsidies these allowances will go a long way towards making some compensation; I have not actually worked out the details but it is clear that they will go a good part of the way towards meeting the increased cost of food.</P>
    <P>Nobody on the Opposition Benches while I was in the House referred to that particular aspect of the matter but we had several people telling us that it was the poor who would have to bear the burden.  I think an honest attempt has been made in this Budget to face the fact that money had to be found but the burden has been placed, as far as it was humanly possible to do so, on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to Fianna Fáil in relation to its social security programme and its social services as being pushed from behind and only <Col N="1440" /> taking one hesitating step at a time. It seems to me rather extraordinary that a Labour leader, who was so recently linked with the Fine Gael Party, should try to insinuate that Fianna Fáil did not do anything in connection with social services.  As Deputy Dr. Browne said the other day, social services started in 1933. Because we were not foolish enough not to take account of our finances, because we tried to live within our means and not kill the goose that laid the golden egg, we proceeded bit by bit and parctically every year saw some new aid for the under-dog.</P>
    <P>There are £3,000,000 provided in this Budget for the implementation of the Social Welfare Bill at present before the House.  Under the Coalition Government Deputy Larkin's leader was in charge of that Department but he did nothing in the three and a quarter years he was there.  Instead of being a Welfare Bill it was, as some of us predicted, his farewell Bill.  Even if he had remained in office for the remainder of the five-year period it would still have been his farewell Bill because the Coalition Government never had any serious intention of putting it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were too many differences of opinion about it.  Perhaps it was not Deputy Norton's fault. He was in earnest about it, I believe, and I give him credit for it, but it would have been another matter to get it through the Coalition.  We have heard a good deal about the removal of the food subsidies but those subsidies are being replaced by a permanent increase in social benefits.  Food subsidies were always regarded as being of a temporary nature and nobody contemplated them as a permanency.  They will now be replaced for those who really need them by permanent social services.  I think every reasonable Deputy will agree that that is right. I think every reasonable Deputy will agree that it was time we got away from the position in which the poor were actually helping to pay taxes to give subsidies to those who could well afford to meet prices.  That is what we were doing up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> I have dealt with the change in the income-tax code.  That change will affect every tradesman, the lower middle classes, the white collar workers, the lower civil servants and the huge bulk of those who pay income-tax. Under Schedule E, of 151,000 income-taxpayers 145,000 will pay less. Only 6,000 will pay more and therefore 95 per cent. of the working people who pay income-tax will actually benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also referred to the increases in the cost of living over the last nine months.  As I pointed out here, the cost of living was rising even before the Korean war.  Undoubtedly the Korean war and the world situation had their effect on prices in this country.  So far as that goes, I am not blaming the Coalition Government, for no Government could avoid the consequences of that but there were certain other things which happened here.  We know that they were elected on the plea that they were going to reduce the cost of living and the only attempt that was made, was made in panic when the Standstill Price Order was brought in, an Order which had the effect, to my own personal knowledge, of legalising the profiteer in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not doing too badly now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That Order, to my own personal knowledge, legalised the profiteer and when we asked what were the legal prices on the 2nd December, the date set out in the Order, we were told that they could not be given, that it was not feasible to give them.  That was the attempt of Deputy Norton and the men who came into this House and told us all about what this Order was going to do, to deal with the price situation while they were in power. Deputy Larkin knows perfectly well that every increase, except one or two that were refused for policy sake by the then Government, has been sanctioned and approved of by the Prices Advisory Committee set up by the Coalition Government.  He knows that a large number of these Orders were already in the hands of the Minister in the Coalition Government before the change took place and he knows that the present Government had to face <Col N="1442" /> the odium of putting those Orders into operation.  If they had not been put into operation, we would have had to face another problem, with places closing down completely and not being able to carry on.  Surely nobody is going to suggest that the Labour representatives on the Prices Advisory Tribunal are agreeing to those increases unless there is necessity for them and they have been justified. Nothing that this Government did at that time could possibly have increased prices.</P>
      <P>I think it is time, considering all that we heard about the matter in 1948, and the lack of effort there was on the part of the Coalition Government to carry out their promises to the electors, or to deal with the question of prices at all, that they would keep silent about it.  We all have to face the fact that this money must be found.  Facing that fact, I think that anyone who tries to examine this Budget as impartially as he can must be driven to the conclusion that it is a courageous and a good Budget, that it is trying to meet the appalling gap in our finances by putting the cost of meeting that gap on the shoulders of those best able to bear it.  I do not think we shall gain anything by trying to run away from the fact that these deficits have been accumulating over the years and that the sooner we face up to this the easier it will be for the people, hard as it may now seem&mdash;and I am not denying it is going to create a certain amount of hardship&mdash;to get over the present difficulty.  I think anybody who examines the position will realise that it is much better to face it this year than to postpone it to next year, or a year later, when the hardship would be far greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I miss the portly figure of Deputy Burke from these deliberations. At least, if he could not give any advice to his Minister in his great trouble, he might do what he does for his constituents now and again&mdash; he might lead the Fianna Fáil Party and its adherents in supplication.  I think the nearest point he hovered to the Chamber since the debate began was to put his head inside the door to see how things were going, to see <Col N="1443" /> was the Dáil dissolved yet and had we to go to the country.  Of course, this is a Budget of a sadist.  It is a Budget that could be conceived only in the mind of a man who was completely cut off from the people of the country, who cared nothing about what the people felt, how they had to live, how they had to work, what they got for working or what their problems were.  Not, indeed, that there is anything new in Deputy MacEntee's displaying these sadistic proclivities when it comes to dealing with the working people.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in that.  Those of us who have any kind of memory will recall the days when men were compelled to do what Deputy Dr. Browne has described as unproductive work, and inferred in a certain fashion as being a despicable occupation&mdash;when men were compelled to take up road work, and there are thousands of them who have to do that work because they can get no other.  It is not very long since, when these men were seeking an increase in their wages of 37/6 per week, the present Minister for Finance said: &ldquo;A shilling a week is enough for them&rdquo; although the cost of living was sky-rocketing at the time.  It is no great surprise therefore for us to find Deputy MacEntee in his capacity as Minister for Finance coming in with this savage onslaught on the people of Ireland.  All the vaporising that went on here yesterday and this afternoon when we were treated to a sample of Deputy Vivion de Valera's eloquence for over two hours, about the balance of payments, the dollar gap and our external assets&mdash;all that airy effluvia that went on, is of very little good to the people of Ballyfermot or the people of my constituency the bulk of whom have to find their living by the sweat of their brow and many of whom have to find their living in underpaid white-collar occupations.  When they picked up this morning's paper they read &ldquo;Bread gone up again by 50 per cent.&rdquo; I suppose the Minister for Finance has not been in the household of an agricultural worker or a road worker since he was down inciting the small landholders of Kilsallaghan some 25 years ago to get the Carter estate divided amongst themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been, as I have said, a good deal of reference to the gap which is stated to exist between the income and expenditure accounts as presented to this Dáil, and to the need for bridging that gap.  I say &ldquo;stated to exist&rdquo; because I want <Col N="1446" /> to bring the minds of members of the House back to Deputy Morrissey's revelation here this evening where it was proved beyond yea or nay, and not contradicted by the Minister for Finance, that the Budget figures are not accurate and cannot be relied upon in relation to the number of motor registrations in the country.  If that is true of one set of figures in so important a document as the Budget, then, as has been truly said, what reliance can be put on the rest of the figures that have been brought before us for our consideration?</P>
      <P>Of course, there are some figures that represent hard facts that we cannot get away from, such, for instance, as those relating to butter. Deputy Colley when speaking, referred to Deputy Larkin's speech which was made this morning.  Deputy Colley said that there had been no increase in any commodity since the advent to power of this Government without the prior recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body.  Deputy Colley has a short memory.  Do we not all remember that, in a frantic effort to curry favour with the farming community, the gentlemen now in government were not there two days until we learned that butter was going up by 2d. per lb.?  There was no reference to the Prices Advisory Body.  The people of Dublin could pay it; they were going to be made pay it, and there was going to be no examination of farmer's costings or anything else.  There had to be ground recovered which had been lost, or at least an effort made in that direction.  There was political ground to be recovered, and the farmers were given 2d. per lb. of an increase within a couple of days of this Government's re-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That was followed, of course, by an increase in the price of milk, and, again, who was going to pay that but the ordinary working people?  &ldquo;Sure, they will put up with it as long as we are doing it; we are the party which represents all the people,&rdquo; as Deputy Burke is so fond of saying&mdash;all things to all men, mar <Col N="1447" /> dheadh, on every side of the fence at once.</P>
      <P>However, that was not enough.  It was not enough that the working people of this city were asked to pay exorbitant rents in many cases in the new housing schemes at Ballyfermot and Finglas.  It was not enough that these people have had to work for so little wages and found the cost of living during the past 12 months making it next door to impossible for them to live.  It was not enough that those people should have to pay another 2d. per lb. on butter, bringing it up to 3/- a lb., but along comes this sadist of a Minister to put 10d. a lb. on butter yesterday.  I will be happy to see the acrobatics that Deputy Burke and a few more of the gentlemen on the Government side will go through in the next few months trying to explain that away.</P>
      <P>Sugar was likewise increased by almost 25 per cent.  We were told this morning by that impartial political organ, the <i>Irish Press</i>, which is famous for its absolute impartiality and for the degree of fairness that enters into its political articles, that tea will average 5/6 a lb. and that the price of the loaf of bread will be increased from 6d. to 9d.  Have they no conscience at all?  Is there no stir of independence in the minds of any member of Fianna Fáil that they would troop into the Lobby, just like so many sheep, and vote for this crime against the people of this country?</P>

Of course, there are people who will say that cigarettes and tobacco are luxuries and that people can do without those things.  My <Col N="1448" /> view always has been that, when a consumable commodity comes into widespread use among normal people and among average people, then it is no longer a luxury.  It does not enter into the category of being a necessity. People can live without it but, nevertheless, it is no longer a luxury.  In putting the impost of 7d. on the packet of 20 cigarettes an added burden of immeasurable proportions has been placed upon the working people.  Of course, it does not matter to those who have plenty of the world's goods and plenty of money.  Another 7d. on the packet of 20 cigarettes does not mean so much to them but it means a great deal though to the thousands who live on a wage of £3 10/-, £4, £5 or £6 a week and who try to bring up a family at the same time and who have always been used to indulging in a cigarette or, perhaps, a pipeful of tobacco or a pint of beer.</P>
      <P>It is of interest to note that there are in this country approximately 150,000 farm workers working for wages, the average wage being between £3 10/- and £3 15/- per week.</P>

This Budget in my view&mdash;I say this as seriously as I can and with as much knowledge of and contact with the agricultural workers as any man in this country&mdash;will decimate the number of people working on the land. It will drive them from the land.  It will drive them from the land the man who is earning £3 15s. a week throughout the country and who is living in a county council cottage.

      <P>I was about to say that these people are usually blessed with large families.  I suppose that the average family of a farm worker would be four or five children.  How is he out of £3 15s. to pay more for his butter?  Many farmers do not give him butter at all although some would try to give the illusion that they do.  He has to pay more for sugar and tea and he has to pay half as much more for his bread.  If that type of man is in the habit of smoking a cigarette he can forget about it now.  If he has gone off the cigarettes for Lent, the rest of his life will be Lent so long as Fianna Fáil remains in power.  The same applies to beer.  However, he has the tremendous satisfaction of answering the appeal of the Minister for Finance to save his money and put it in the Post Office Savings Bank.  When he has paid all these increased taxes, fed, clothed, educated his children and sent them to the university out of the £3 15s. he can put the rest in the Post Office Savings Bank!</P>

      <P>We have had a good deal of talk about political honesty and the desirability of letting people know what the actual economic situation is.  In the 1914 war, the slogan used was that it was to make the world safe for democracy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to add, if the Deputy will be sufficiently orderly to allow me, that this present Government is trying to make Ireland safe for hypocrisy.  When I hear certain Deputies talking about political honesty and consistency, it tends to make me physically sick.  How anybody can justify a Budget which grinds further down the ordinary mass of the people and at the same time takes the tax off dancing, so that when the people are reduced to a condition of near starvation, they may indulge in the terpsichorean art&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>That is a good word, Joxer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I make you a present of that.  I will spell it for you sometime. Any Government which would introduce a Budget such as that is completely out of touch with the people. It has been obvious to those who sat through the long, dreary homily of the Minister for Finance yesterday that very few people knew what was in the Budget.  It is quite obvious that the Tánaiste was very perturbed over the Budget and, being the wily politician that he is and knowing how the political winds blow, he was not in love with this policy which was obviously forced on the Cabinet by the Minister for Finance, ably abetted, I am sure, by the Taoiseach, because nobody will suggest that the Taoiseach is in touch with the lives of the ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He lives in a world of his own, held up there by the Party in a kind of cocoon.  He is inviolable and dare you say a word about him.  I recall that some years ago, when a Deputy now supporting the Government ventured a word or two of criticism, he was <Col N="1452" /> almost assassinated by some of the gentlemen with whom he is now consorting.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that this Budget represents the imposition by the Minister for Finance of his peculiar atrophied outlook on life upon the Fianna Fáil capitalists, who, regardless of whether or not they care for the people, have one thing in common &mdash;they care for their own political self-preservation, and that instinct for self-preservation was obviously thrown to the wind yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  It was a study to look at the faces of the Fianna Fáil Party while the document was being read. Deputy Burke could hardly stomach it and had to leave the House.  If we have an election very shortly, I hope he will not have the unfortunate experience of leaving it permanently. The Budget, in all its aspects, shows the complete failure of the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>Last week some Deputies took part in a discussion about social welfare. It was boasted then that the present Government were bringing in a Bill to provide social welfare benefits, but they were not half as good as those set out in Deputy Norton's Bill last year.  The most important provisions of that Bill, such as death benefits, increased maternity benefits and attendance allowances were left out. It was boasted then by the Minister for Social Welfare that he was only looking for 5d. additional contribution from the workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are not going to discuss the Social Welfare Bill now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say that the additional 5d. now becomes something in the neighbourhood of 10/- or 12/- a week as a minimum, because until yesterday the plan that Fianna Fáil had in store for the workers was concealed from them.  The workers are to be asked to pay 5d. additional per week, but Fianna Fáil propose to rob them of every single advantage which had been won for them by Labour and trade union agitation during the last 20 years.  They are to be deprived of the subsidies on butter, sugar, tea, <Col N="1453" /> bread and flour and the price of cigarettes, tobacco, beer and spirits is to be increased and no matter what Deputy Colley may say, there are many workers also who will have their income-tax increased as a result of the imposition announced yesterday.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly plain now that the social welfare benefits which are supposed to come into operation on July 1st will be paid for over and over again by the workers of the country. When Deputy Norton wanted a contribution of 3/6 a week, that was a crime.  This butcher of a Minister for Finance we now have, who is picking the bones of the workers of the country, demands anything from 12/- to £1 from every household.  I cannot find any more adequate words to describe the activities of this Minister. I regret that he is not here.  Perhaps his presence might inspire me to greater heights in regard to a suitable description for him.  But, as surely as we are in this House, this Budget will reduce to a &ldquo;new low&rdquo;, the standard of living of the people.</P>
      <P>There have been challenges thrown out to the Government to have an election and some Deputies who support the Government have announced that they will not advise having a dissolution for at least another 12 months.  I suppose we will find a difficulty in forcing this Government out.  We all know very well that they will hang on for dear life at least until the terrible impact of these things wears off and the people become a bit drugged again. I make this challenge to my colleague &mdash;I will charitably describe him as my colleague&mdash;in County Dublin in regard to this Budget: I will resign my seat if he will resign his, and I will fight County Dublin on the issue of this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

Some effort must be made to bring them to a realisation of their responsibility. We cannot put them out by discussion or debate because they will hang on like barnacles because they know that the next election will mean their political doom.  It is impossible to express adequately the feelings of the people whom I represent on this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the people of my own constituency of County Dublin but I think I can also say a few words on behalf of the vast majority of the rural workers throughout the country who as I have indicated are living on bare subsistence level and in many cases far below it.  Many of these men trooped to the polling booths to put many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies where they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, will be accepted by everybody in this House and the introduction of a Budget which is not popular suggests some sense of responsibility.  Any Government that is irresponsible may introduce what is known as a popular Budget, but a Budget is simply financial provision for the year based on the facts and circumstances at the time the Budget is introduced.  If the Government is satisfied that the facts and circumstances justify increased <Col N="1455" /> taxation and, because of a desire for popularity or a desire for political success, do not make the provision in taxation that is necessary or which they consider necessary, that Government, in my view, would be irresponsible.</P>

      <P>Clearly, that was accepted by everyone as a joke, but I only mention the matter to-day because Deputy Larkin has used that observation in a way entirely different to what I intended to make the case that it was a cynical comment on Irish politics that my approach to the Budget was that it would not suit me to have an election in the next 12 months.

I want to say that, having known him so long, having known his ideals and objectives, I have been as disappointed with him as have many of the people who had faith and confidence in him in the Labour movement.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is interested in the price of beer.  That is what we had here to-day.  We had an attack on the Government's policy in removing subsidies.  When Deputy McGilligan introduced his Budget two or three years ago I spoke on this problem of the food subsidies.  I gave it as my opinion then, supporting the then Government and Deputy McGilligan at the time, that I would like to see this whole problem of food subsidies examined&mdash;what benefit a household got through the subsidies and how much they contributed in taxation to provide those subsidies, because, if I may use a word of Deputy Seán Collins, I was not &ldquo;wedded&rdquo; to this idea of the food subsidies.</P>
      <P>I was interested to-day to refer back &mdash;I seldom do it&mdash;to the debate in 1947 when these food subsidies were under discussion.  Here is what Deputy Norton said about them at column 435. Volume 108 of the 15th October, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The highlight of the documents put before us is, I take it, the subsidies to reduce the prices of tea, bread and sugar.  I think these are sham reductions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Norton said, that the subsidies are &ldquo;sham reductions&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Here is what Deputy Morrissey said at column 641 of the same volume on the 16th October, 1947, dealing with this Supplementary Budget:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The people do not know all the blessings that will be poured upon them.  The reliefs are spread over three items&mdash;bread, sugar and tea. Fortunately, the three of them are rationed, and we know what each citizen is entitled to&mdash;6 lb. of bread, 2 oz. of tea and ¾ lb. of sugar for a week.  Let us measure the fullness of this blessed relief that the unfortunate taxpayer will get and to what extent the cost of living will be reduced.  With 1½d. off the 4 lb. loaf that means 2¼d. on 6 lb. of bread. Each person is entitled to 2 oz. of tea.  There is a reduction of 2/2 in the lb.  One-eighth of 2/2 is 3¼d. You are entitled to ¾ lb. of sugar and a reduction of 2d. in the lb. is a 1¼d. on that.  Tot it up and what do you find?  This relief, this blessing, this gesture of Fianna Fáil to settle this dangerous situation, is equivalent to 1d. per person per day. This is the Budget that is going to reduce the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is what Deputy Morrissey said in 1947.  I have quoted what Deputy Norton said that day in 1947, and now, when these subsidies are removed, we heard what Deputy Larkin said to-day, what Deputy Dunne said to-night and what Deputy Morrissey said about them this evening.  I consider, and I said it on the Budget in the years from 1948 up to last year, that the question of the food subsidies ought to be examined, because I felt, and it has been brought to my notice, that there has been a tragic waste of food under the subsidy system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> Take butter.  What do we find in regard to butter at the moment?  We find that rations of butter are being distributed from the creameries with a subsidy on them to shops in the West of Ireland.  The taxpayers are paying subsidies on that butter, and we find racketeers going to the shops, collecting the butter there, taking it up to the city here and selling it to retailers, who sell it over the counter at 3/10 or 4/-.</P>

      <P>I do believe it. Credo.  Let us examine the question of bread.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us to-day and the Minister for Finance told us in his Budget statement yesterday that there is going to be a whiter loaf&mdash;a more edible loaf.  Everybody knows and, indeed, attention has been drawn to the fact very often, that bread, baked <Col N="1461" /> in loaves, has been fed to dogs and to pigs because it was such a cheap food.  There has been a wastage of bread because people found that when threequarters of the loaf had been cut it was left aside for a while, and that it was difficult to eat the remainder. Therefore, there has been an extraordinary wastage of bread all over the country&mdash;bread for which a subsidy has been paid by the taxpayer.  I feel that is a situation which is known to every Deputy in this House.  I know myself that Deputy Mulcahy is not a great lover of the food subsidies.</P>

Now we will not have a waste of bread all through the city and country in respect of which a subsidy is being paid by the taxpayer. That has been happening long enough, and it is time something was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of tea.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us to-day that people will have an opportunity of buying different brands of tea at different prices, that some of the tea that can be purchased will be cheaper than the present rationed tea and that some of it will be dearer.  I feel there are many thousands of families in this country who will be glad to be able to get a better quality <Col N="1462" /> tea, even if they have to pay more for it, than they are getting at the moment.</P>

      <P>The abolition of rationing in regard to these commodities is a good thing for this reason also. Customers will not be tied, as they have been up to now, to particular shopkeepers.  They can buy the goods that have been rationed up to the present wherever they like.  In my view, that is desirable.</P>
      <P>We come now to the other items which are taxed, namely cigarettes, beer and spirits.  We had a very valuable contribution last night from Deputy O. Flanagan on this subject.</P>

      <P>Three main items on which additional taxes have to be put are cigarettes, beer and spirits.  Is it not better that a tax should be put on those articles which are, in effect, luxuries than that it should be put on necessities?</P>

If we compare the price of cigarettes with the price <Col N="1463" /> in England, we will find that there is a big difference.  The same holds good as regards the price of beer and spirits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget provides for additional taxation, but, if it does, it makes a counter contribution which I consider to be very valuable. The increase in children's allowances from 2/6 to 4/- is a very valuable increase, and the granting of a new allowance at the rate of 2/6 for the second child in a family is a very welcome addition to the finances of that family.  There are many families in the State who will benefit by this transfer of cash from the central funds to the family.  The increase in the weekly contributions to the old age pensioners, to the widows and to the unemployed will be very helpful to them.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, and as has been stressed to-day, the alteration in the income-tax code makes very valuable contributions to the worker&mdash;the white-collar worker in particular who is earning up to £1,000 or £1,200 a year.  The allowance provided in the Budget is very satisfactory so far as the person in receipt of £300, £400, and £500 a year is concerned.  What are we to consider when we come to examine the Budget?  We are to consider the state of the national finances and the provision that must be made to meet them in the coming year.  We have to do as any prudent housewife has to do.  We have to do an ordinary bit of housekeeping budgeting.</P>

If we as a nation do not tax ourselves and provide the money necessary to run the State we have to get it from somebody else and there is only one place where we can get it without any trouble to-morrow.  We can get it from America.  All the money that we need to balance our Budget, we can get it to-morrow from America.</P>

      <P>Many words have been used to describe this Budget.  I am afraid I am going to add two new ones.  I emphatically assert that this Budget is both outrageous and spiteful, as I will clearly demonstrate in the course of my argument.  We have no doubt in our minds that the answer given by the Irish people to the Fianna Fáil Administration as a result of the catastrophic Supplementary Budget that they introduced in 1947 is one of the root causes of the spite that we see in this Budget.  On that occasion <Col N="1467" />&mdash;and the Provost Marshal may giggle but it will not get him out of this&mdash; they introduced taxation for the purpose of paying food subsidies.  On this occasion, the &ldquo;Great I-am&rdquo; having been transgressed upon, they are going back to the country to impose with a vicious thrust greater and more severe taxation in the same direction and at the same time they are eliminating the food subsidies.  That is interesting.  It is going to be more interesting as the story unfolds itself, particularly when one appreciates the political background to the mandate that Fianna Fáil now allege they have for their activity.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mandate&rdquo; was a wonderful word of the Taoiseach's, Eamonn de Valera, and I am going to demonstrate in the course of my speech that Fianna Fáil have no mandate for this and that, far from the Independents having a mandate, they were elected, and sought election, on a policy positively, categorically and diametrically opposed to what they are now voting for in the Lobbies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to see the disappearance of the Cork heroes.  I have their election address here.  The four heroes were Deputy Alderman McGrath, Deputy Alderman Seán MacCarthy, Deputy Alderman Jack Lynch and the Lord Mayor of Cork, who has since seen the light and left the fold, Alderman Furlong.  They campaigned viciously and virulently throughout the City of Cork declaring that the last Government was wrong, outrageous and had let the cost of living increase&mdash;mark you I am going to quote this document&mdash;that everything had gone up under the inter-Party Government.  Deputy McGrath, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, and Deputy MacCarthy, all conspicuous by their absence, campaigned, saying that in 1947 beef was 2/- a lb. and under the inter-Party Government sirloin beef had gone up to 2/8.  They must not have bought beef since Fianna Fáil came into office, because we now know that it is 3/2.  Mutton had gone up according to them by 51/2d. per lb. and reached the astronomical <Col N="1468" /> figure of 2/4.  Now try and buy a sirloin chop or a centre mutton chop or a mutton joint and you will find that it costs 3/- per lb.  They were howling about the increase in the cost of living and this was before any of the impositions which are now to come. They said that under their Government streaky bacon cost 1/11½d. and back bacon 2/11.</P>
    <P>They say that we let them go up to 3/4 and 3/7.  I would like those &ldquo;bould&rdquo; heroes to go out any Saturday instead of their respective wives to buy either streaky bacon or back bacon at the price to which they said we allowed it to rise and which they said was fantastic. This was long before the present impact from our hair-shirt, doleful, mournful, bad-tempered Minister for Finance, who got up to give us his 71 pages of fallacy yesterday.  Throughout the length and breadth of the City of Cork these worthy warriors moaned and groaned.  They said that backs were creaking, that the burden was getting impossible to carry, but that the housewife was safe in the hands of Fianna Fáil.  God help the poor disillusioned woman this morning.</P>
    <P>The national advertisement of the Fianna Fáil Party is worthy of note and of a place on the records of the House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil began the system of food subsidies to keep down the cost of living by reducing the price of essential foods.  Do not let the Coalition propagandists deceive you. The workers' interests are safe with Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have a new Deputy in the House.  I regret that he is not present, but his worthy pal is present, so I will not do anything unfair in quoting from the circular of Deputy Dr. french-O'Carroll to the poor misguided people of his part of Dublin which includes part of Crumlin. I would love him to go there next Sunday and see what the people of Crumlin think of him.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If elected by you, I promise to <Col N="1469" /> focus attention on the cost of living and to press for increased subsidies on food.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cerebral gymnastics of Deputy Peadar Cowan are in no way comparable with those of Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, who walked into the Lobby with his new-found political masters, not to increase the food subsidies, not even to keep them at the present level, but to ensure that the burden on the already over-burdened back of the housewife in his constituency, the working-class person with a small or large family, would be made intolerable.  Interesting: he is going to focus all attention on the cost of living!</P>
    <P>In the course of his election address he made some further interesting observations apropos of food subsidies. They were his <i>pièce de résistance.</i>  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All political Parties have failed in their undertaking to the electorate to reduce the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I can assure the Chair that if my back was inadvertently turned to him it was in the exuberance of the debate and not in discourtesy.  He goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While Fianna Fáil did endeavour, rather too late, to stem rising prices by subsidising essential foods during their term of office, the Coalition Government, by refusing to increase these subsidies, knowingly permitted a rise in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll strolls nonchalantly, boldly, into the Lobby to ensure an increase of 3d. per loaf of bread for the citizens of this country, thanks to his gaining election on a document such as that.  I advise the Deputy to be wary in his visits to the Crumlin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the campaign during the last election, where Fianna Fáil <Col N="1470" /> set itself up as the custodian, the protector, against the drastic increases in the cost of living, the custodian and protector of the housewife, the poor man's friend, I wonder how some of their Deputies are going to face back this week-end to their constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that Deputy Seán Flanagan may be able to go back nonchalantly in his car and say: &ldquo;I am young at the game.  I had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;  But some of the hardy warriors around him are going to be in a tough spot.  If some of the asides heard going up the steps to the Lobbies last night are any foreshadowing of the future, the Minister for Finance must be more adroit than he has ever been before to explain this away to some of his own supporters.  I am sure that there is no doubt in the mind of any reasonable Fianna Fáil person that there is no explanation.  The sudden sensitivity on the Fianna Fáil benches only indicated that they were the most staggered, stupefied and amazed people in the House yesterday as the picture of ghastly butchery unfolded itself in all its sadism, designed as it was by a person well known in political circles and in the public life of the country for his lack of concern for the interests of the poorer sections of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can be proud of your Budget, a Budget that marks one further doleful milestone in the tragedy of breach of confidence by a political party to their electorate.  If there was one thing which stood out in the background of the election campaign of Fianna Fáil, it was the issue of the cost of living, and let the Minister not think that he is going to sell the pup of small ameliorations for old age pensioners and other oppressed groups and get away with it.  A sum of 1/6 for the old age pensioner, a miserable digusting pittance to offer him, in the teeth of taking with the other hand the 1/6 in his rationed goods, together with 7d. if he smokes a packet of cigarattes in the week or 4/1 if he smokes a packet a day.  The Minister's heart is bleeding for the poor old age pensioner so much so that he offers this insult of 1/6, while robbing him with the other <Col N="1471" /> hand of not less than 1/- more than the relief of 1/6 he gives.</P>
    <P>Then, we have an effort made to boost the Minister's greatness on the flagstaff of increased children's allowances.  A very welcome feature is the increase in children's allowances, if it were not a deceptive increase, a bit of duplicity on the Irish people&mdash; 2/6 for the second child and an increase to 4/- for the subsequent children. Take the unfortunate working man with a wife and three children who gets, by way of children's allowances, the munificent sum of 6/6.  He loses in respect of the abolition of the food subsidies the sum of 7/6 and, if he smokes one packet of cigarettes a day, we can add 4/1 to it and if he drinks a modest four pints of stout in the week, another 1/-, and if his wife, as in many cases the wives do, smokes, another 2/- or 3/-.  We find, then, on one side, 6/6 graciously donated by the munificent Minister for Finance, while into the other pocket goes the searching, hungry fist that takes out 16/6.  Wonderful economics and a grand story for Deputy Seán Flanagan to tell them in Mayo!</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>At a special meeting of the executive of the association held on 8th inst. it was decided to communicate with the Fianna Fáil Party, they being the Party responsible for the abolition of Dance Tax in 1946 and having since vigorously opposed the re-imposition of same by the Coalition Government, requesting them to inform the Association of their intentions regarding the abolition of tax should they be returned to power.</P>
      <P>I am to inform all members of the Association that I have received what the executive consider to be a favourable reply from Mr. Lemass on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party a copy of which you will find enclosed.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of this reply from Mr. Lemass, a further executive meeting was held to-day, the 15th inst., when the meeting confirmed their pledge of support to Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that the Association is entirely non-political and that having failed utterly to impress the previous Government or Minister for Finance though it pointed out the hardships caused to ballroom business, to clubs hiring the ballrooms, musicians, staffs, etc., the Association has now no alternative but to support the Party who has indicated that they are prepared to repeal this tax as soon as it is practicable.</P>
      <P>The Association has decided that the support to Fianna Fáil should take the form of substantial financial help and also that all members both city and country should lend a hand in every possible direction to secure the return to power of the one Party who has given the Association an indication that they as a Party are opposed to this undesirable entertainment tax on dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that in order to have the desired effect our financial aid must of necessity be generous.  I may mention that one leading commercial ballroom in <Col N="1473" /> Dublin has headed the list of subscribers to this fund with the generous sum of £250 and other members of the executive have also indicated their willingness to subscribe very generously.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Association does not specify any particular amount to be subscribed they request you in your own interests to give as much as possible.  I shall deem it a great favour if you will reply promptly as time is getting short before the General Election and if we are to help it must be done immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We now turn to a further tragedy in this Budget.  This morning, in a quiet deliberative way, we heard a scathing analysis of the figures in it, by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J.A. Costello.  In that he revealed a situation that bears restating, one that was added to to-day in a devastating way by the revelation of figures by Deputy Dan Morrissey. Whether it is an error or due to carelessness, or whatever the purpose, we see a figure of actual cost for the subsidies for this year described as the savings for the year; and we find that if you substract a figure of £6.7 million from the real cost of the subsidies for any one year you get the figure of the savings, which is £8.8 million, leaving a discrepancy that needs more than a casual explanation, leaving a concealed tax gathered into the coffers of £2,000,000.  We have the position revealed, of Deputy Dr. James Ryan, the Minister for Health, announcing and reiterating here that the cost of social services for this year will be something less than £2,000,000, and his colleague in the same Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, in the Budget figures saying £3,000,000&mdash;another £1,000,000.  These points are worth repeating, as it is time that the public of Ireland were given a full lesson in the real extent of the bluff, codology and stupidity that goes to make up the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Deputy Morrissey comes into this House and tells us about something that it will be very difficult to wash away.  How, in a document 71 pages long, carefully documented, laboriously read to this House, at page 50, can the figures appear that were quoted to-day by Deputy Morrissey, alleged in this statement to be the figures of new registration of motor vehicles, taking the years as he did, 1939, 1949 and last year, and what figures are in fact disclosed?  Not the figures of the registration of motor vehicles but the figures of the numbers of driving licences issued to people. As pointed out by Deputy Morrissey, the discrepancy in the first year is only 20,000, in the second year of choice <Col N="1476" /> 50,000, but in the last year under review there is over 73,000 of a discrepancy. Mind you, the Minister has emphatically and with his grandiose eloquence on paper adverted to those figures in a very positive way and asserted that they showed him a certain figure.</P>
    <P>Where does the duplicity of this Budget end?  What figures in this Budget, if any, can we rely on?  There is the demonstration in the items taken by the Leader of the Opposition, and in those items of registration of motor vehicles taken by Deputy Morrissey, that there is a complete lack of accuracy in these figures.  Is the whole structure and facade on which this Budget is built and sold to the dumb cattle behind the Minister false? Where is the end of the errors in the figures on which these tax estimates are based?  How far do the errors go and where do they end?  Why is the Minister not anxious to adjourn this discussion to enable him to recheck the figures?  Why has he not intervened, when he got the opportunity when he was challenged, to deny that the official figures in the official documents of this House are wrong but that he is right in his 71-page typewritten, doleful elegy of misery, holding out to this country nothing but gloom?  We had a wealth of good will at home, a wealth of co-ordinated expansive endeavour by a people confident in their Government, believing in the investment of their own money at home, believing in the gradual building of their own State into something that they had dreamed about; and all that confidence has been dissipated and shattered by the gloom, the misery of people accidentally returned to ministerial posts by the consistent votes of people like Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, whose sole worry is going to be food subsidies and the increases on tea and butter, or Deputy Peadar Cowan who can always be trusted to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>It is indeed significant that in their queer wanderings around the political arenas of this country those weird specimens have wandered home to the arms of a Minister for Finance who was once described in moving eloquence by Deputy Cogan as the &ldquo;senile delinquent&rdquo;.  Permission was sought from the Chair on one occasion <Col N="1477" /> recently by his new-found enthusiastic defender, Deputy Peadar Cowan, to know if it would be in order to describe him in a most offensive way.  Nice bedfellows.  You are fully welcome to him.  Unfortunately, the tragedy of this Budget will go far beyond the whim of these people.  It is unfortunate that its impact will be felt in every home, no matter how humble, throughout the length and breadth of this State.  No effort by a bemused and befogged spokesman for the Government will cloud the fundamental issue that no matter what section of the community may get back 1/- or 2/- they will pay three, four, five or six times over in the indirect yield of taxation which they will have to give back.</P>
    <P>This is a cruel and a vicious Budget. If it were even equitable in its distribution of the load, one would not be so scathing in one's condemnation, but it is certain sure that the vicious spite is there that says to the Irish people: &ldquo;You threw us out in 1948.  We are now back a minority Government by the whim of a number of Independents and as long as we are there, you will feel the lash for that affront&rdquo;&mdash;offered to the alleged great &ldquo;I am&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This Budget is deliberately designed to retard progress. It is deliberately designed to break down the decent financial structure that was being built up.</P>

      <P>What about the Marshall dollars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that, too.  You are interrupting a bit too soon.  This Budget was designed to break down a financial structure that was built in such a way as to give the people a burden of taxation which they could bear.  The Irish people were encouraged under the inter-Party Government to use their small savings for development at home and they were asked for their other savings for the purpose of investment in Ireland&mdash;and they gave them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has interrupted about the Marshall dollars.  The sooner Fianna Fáil wake up and cop themselves on, the better.  In their ten months of office they have succeeded in dissipating what was left of the Marshall <Col N="1478" /> moneys, £26,000,000 odd, and the balance was all that we had spent in the previous three years.  Work it out even on your own mathematical scales. Fianna Fáil should keep quiet about American dollars.  What was the reserve of £26,000,000 for?  It was there as a cushion against this type of cruel economic and unnecessary impingement on the Irish people.  It was there to ensure that we would have adequate money to finance national development and, at the same time, that we would not have to come down with the crushing heel of the oppressor on the taxpayer of the country.</P>
    <P>This Budget is simply and plainly unbludgeoned tyranny activated not by the best motives and manifestly activated by a vicious spite.  I feel a tremendous amount of sincere regret because this Budget will do damage that, even with all the courage and ability that may come in the next Government to right the wrong, it will take years to overtake.  This Budget represents a crushing burden on every section of the community without exception.  There was, however, a great flag at the end of it: &ldquo;We propose to take the tax off dancing.&rdquo; They propose to take the tax off dancing in the light of the correspondence I have put on the records of this House.  It is a shameful and disgusting performance.  It is a miserable travesty on the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I assert that with an intelligent approach to the finances of this country most of this taxation is completely unnecessary.  I assert further that the inevitable outcome of this Budget will be increased emigration, increased unemployment and a continuation and increase of the vicious circle of unrest in industry in this country for which the inter-party Government had found a remedy and eliminated.  The inter-Party Government had found the basis of conciliation and co-operation between employer and employee.  It had found the machinery by which fair demands were made.  That put employers in the position that, with expanding industry, increased output, increased consumption, they were able to improve the lot of the workers. <Col N="1479" /> Now the vice is clamped down and again we have the mentality of men who once preached that 50/- a week was enough for any man and that £1,000 a year was too much.  We now have the mentality of a Minister for Finance who, in a previous capacity as Minister for Local Government, would not sanction an increase of 1/- a week for the road workers in rural Ireland. That is the foul, vicious, dead hand that has come into Irish politics to-day. I say deliberately to the Government: Face again our masters&mdash;all our masters&mdash;the public of this country, and we on this side confidently await their verdict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the speech made by Deputy J.A. Costello to-day and I must say that his contribution, as a former Taoiseach of this State, was very poor.  He said that this Budget was dishonest.  That criticism was not worthy of him.  He alleged that the present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, who has had wide experience of public life, and the Fianna Fáil Party in general, are asking for money by way of taxation that is not, in fact, required.  Deputy J.A. Costello also alleged that the officials of the Department of Finance and of the Revenue Commissioners are incompetent and incapable of assessing the amount of money required for the coming financial year.  I must say that I have never heard a more dishonest speech in this House than Deputy J.A. Costello's speech, especially in view of the fact that he had the honour of being Taoiseach of this country for three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely he does not believe that the Irish people will swallow his misrepresentations. Would it be proper for any Government to impose taxation if it were not really necessary to do so?  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The task of balancing the Budget, which is the task of every Minister for Finance in every country in the world, is a difficult and a thankless task.  If Deputy Costello had said: &ldquo;I am against all this taxation&rdquo; I would have said that he was an honest man and his criticism was worth having.  Instead of that he tried to twist it around&mdash;that the Revenue <Col N="1480" /> Commissioners and the officers of the Department of Finance were people who were not worthy of the confidence of the people of this country and that they were dishonest.  That was the implication of his speech and his general contribution lasting one and a half hours to this debate.</P>

      <P>I have heard a number of speeches here to-day.  The same type of speech was made in Europe during the last seven or eight years and prior to the last war&mdash;the same destructive speech, misrepresenting the facts in certain European countries.  It is the type of speech that has made the nations of Eastern Europe subservient to another nation to-day.  Do you want this country to stand on its own feet?  Do you want us to try and clear up the mess that the previous Government left to us here?  Do you want us to do that or do you want us to carry on in the same way as in other European countries that have been made subservient to a foreign power because the same misrepresentation went on when the finances of the country went down and when chaotic conditions existed there?  As far as I know we hope to keep this country for the Irish people.</P>

All they are able to do is to criticise but they never ask themselves how was the Minister for Finance to balance this Budget and to meet the outgoings of this State during the coming year.  I have seen none of the previous speakers face up to the position good, bad or indifferent.  The only thing they were able to do was to pretend that they were crying salt tears because of the position created by them, and by them alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about what we are trying to do in this country. We are trying to make this country a decent, self-supporting nation.  If any citizen inside this House or outside it is misguided enough to believe the misrepresentations that have been made here by speakers on the Opposition Benches criticising this Budget he <Col N="1484" /> will have to ask himself a few very pertinent questions.</P>
      <P>They will have to ask themselves, &ldquo;What would I do in similar circumstances, if I were Minister for Finance?&rdquo;  It is easy enough to try to make a cockshot of the present Minister and to call him names across the floor of the House, or to indulge in cheap misrepresentation, but let any citizen place himself in the same position as the present Minister is in to-day and see what he is going to do. Did any member of the Opposition tell us where we could have saved under the Budget?  Do they want us to cut down on social services, on the widows' and orphans' pensions or on the numerous social services that we introduced since 1933?  Do they want us to cut down on the Army or the Guards?  These are questions to which I expected to hear answers from any person who wished to treat the House to an honest sound criticism on the Budget.  Instead of that we find them all shying away from these questions. They started to misrepresent the facts and resorted to calling the Minister names.  That is the position we are now facing.</P>
      <P>I challenge any one of them to get up and make an honest-to-goodness speech and tell the House how they are going to balance the Budget in the conditions facing the Minister to-day. They bring in cheap gibes about letters written at election time.  I am sure the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Collins as a member of that Party, knows well enough what the publicans' junta tried to do with the Fine Gael Party and we hear nothing about that from Deputy Collins.  There is nothing about the Fine Gael Central Finance Committee which collected money from the publicans to reduce the beer tax and the sell-out they had on that occasion.

He said that he was anxious when Minister for Agriculture to increase production in this country.  The Deputy who has just left the House, and others who are here present and who were here during the session from 1948-1951, know full well the contribution that that honourable Minister made towards increasing production in this country.  As I have just pointed <Col N="1487" /> out, the tillage farmers, the market gardeners, the fruit growers and tomato growers of my constituency know how he succeeded in almost putting them out of existence.  Then the great leader and archangel of the workers, Deputy Norton, had nothing to say about it.  He was just as anxious in supporting Deputy Dillon in trying to run people off the land of old Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have already referred to other countries in Europe which suffered from the same misrepresentation. We are suffering now.  I hope that the people will realise that this Budget, no matter what can be said about it, is honest and true, and that the Minister for Finance has squarely faced up to the position.  He had no other alternative, and now has to bridge a very substantial gap by borrowing.  That shows us what the Minister is up against.  He has not tried to put over something on the country&mdash;a popular Budget&mdash;and let the country drift and drift, until some day we would find all our social services so disrupted that we would have our country in a position where it would be subservient to other countries.  To the Minister for Finance I will conclude by saying: &ldquo;You have a tough job, you have faced up to it and you are doing well&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals which the Minister introduced in the Budget yesterday were the culmination of a lengthy campaign initiated by the Minister and other members of the Government shortly after they were elected last June.  The start of this campaign was the Minister's speech to the House on the 18th July.  The House and the country will recollect that the Minister's policy was initiated <Col N="1489" /> on that occasion in order, according to himself, to rectify the financial position in which the country found itself, and especially to rectify the disequilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>That was one problem.  The other problem was to pay for current expenditure out of current earnings.  When the Minister, supported by other Ministers, initiated that campaign, it was anticipated that the introduction of this Budget and of the Estimates this year would mark a departure in the financial policy adopted by the inter-Party Government.  A whole series of speeches, emphasising the alleged critical condition of our finances, were made by Ministers at different functions varying in degree and intensity.  The country was led to believe that, whatever measures would be adopted, would have as their aim a rectification in the import excess and would result in an improvement in the terms of trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister yesterday, in his speech introducing the Budget, covered a great number of topics and dealt somewhat briefly with this problem.  He admitted that, in the first two months of this year, the improvement was negligible.  There was something approximating to £1,000,000 reduction in the import excess in the month of January over the same month last year.  The reduction in the import excess for the month of February was substantially less, and the March figures are not yet available.  It is quite obvious that the campaign which was initiated, the speeches which were made, and the public alarm created caused dislocation, disturbance and lack of confidence resulting in serious unemployment as well as in a serious dislocation in the economy of the country, have not, at the end of that period, resulted in any effective measures being proposed or even in any remedy being anticipated. The country has been deluged with speech after speech, at meeting after meeting, by Ministers, all pointing to the serious economic condition of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country was led to believe that, <Col N="1490" /> when the present Budget would be introduced and the Estimates circulated prior to the Budget, a change in policy was likely.  It is true there has been a change in policy but it has not shown any accept on the measures designed to improve the terms of trade or the remedies which the country was led to believe would be adopted as a result of the criticism which was voiced against the inter-Party Government's capital development programme or the description which was applied to the method of financing.  We were led to believe from the first page in the Book of Estimates, circulated in February, that, when the Budget would be introduced, a change would be announced in the description applied to capital and current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates issued in February contained a note on page (iii). That note referred to the fact that it was not proposed to follow the procedure of designating particular items in the supply services as capital services and that it was only in the context of the Budget that a full estimate of Exchequer outlay on capital and current account would be available.</P>
    <P>The Budget was presented to the House yesterday and the Minister dismissed in a few words the distinction that was drawn between capital and current expenditure and the division which was introduced by the inter-Party Government in the dual Budget. It is obvious from the remarks that he made in dealing with this matter that it was not the intention of the Government to make any real change.</P>
    <P>While that in itself may not appear to be a matter of any great significance, the country is entitled to an explanation from the Government and from the representatives elected to the House who supported the Government of the campaign which has continued since the Government was elected criticising the capital development programme and which now, when the Budget has been introduced, makes no serious alteration in the method of financing that programme.</P>
    <P>It is, indeed, worthy of comment that the Government has not departed from that policy.  It is not sufficient to say that they had not time to do it and <Col N="1491" /> that it will have to be considered later in the year.  It was quite reasonable, in fact, only human for the Government, in the early months and early weeks after they had assumed office, to lay the blame on their predecessors for unpopular decisions, for any deterioration which had occurred in the economy and for any alterations which were taking place.  That was fair tactics, even good tactics.  But time has caught up with them.</P>
    <P>The changes that have since occurred, the measures that have been proposed during the last ten months and, in particular, the measures which have been proposed in the Budget now presented to the House cannot be defended by attempting to cast the responsibility on their predecessors or by refusing to accept responsibility for the proposals now announced for the heavier burdens now placed on all sections of the community, burdens which have been so spread that the leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> is headed: &ldquo;Everybody in the Casualty List.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan may be in the casualty list as a result of this Budget.  The position is that this Budget has been copied from the Budget proposed recently by the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It is customary, when jockeys go out to ride a race, to give them riding instructions but it does not always follow that the instructions are obeyed.  When the present Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste went to London they had discussions.  They were so modest about the results of these discussions that, with the exception of a very brief statement published after they returned, the country was given no indication as to what occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> Judgment was suspended until the proposals were introduced and no replica was ever produced of any original which bore the same similarity of origin which this Budget bears to the British Budget.  When it bears that resemblance it is pertinent to inquire what the British Budget set out to achieve.  It is pertinent to inquire what caused the British to get into the position that these measures were required.</P>
    <P>The British, as many people are aware, recently fought the biggest war in history and their second biggest war in 30 years, wars which absorbed every thing that they had in the way of strength both physical and economic and which utilised their resources to the last drop.</P>
    <P>No such war affected this country. It is true that the recent war affected this country in a variety of ways but we were not injured in our economic strength or resources and our assets were not depleted to the extent they were in Britain.  In fact, while the war continued, a great number of our economic assets were strengthened. There is no valid comparison between the conditions in which the British people found themselves at the end of the last war and the conditions in which the people of this country found themselves.  There is no valid comparison which justifies the imposition in this country of measures calculated to extricate the British people and the British economy from the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no reason for similar methods being adopted here in entirely different circumstances.  Of course, the real defect in this Budget is that it follows the British pattern without apparently considering what the consequences of that pattern would be if it were applied to our economy.</P>
    <P>In recent years a great number of people have become familiar with the word &ldquo;austerity&rdquo;.  The word was first brought into common use by the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps.  He was a munificent Santa Claus in comparison with our Minister.  No Budget ever introduced in Great Britain was so austere in its effects or so severe in <Col N="1493" /> its results as the Budget introduced here yesterday.  No measure designed there to protect their economy impinged so heavily, so severely or so unjustly on all sections of the people as the Budget introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government and which has been supported by a number of their satellites in the House.</P>
    <P>The proposals propounded in this Budget, while a replica of the proposals adopted in Great Britain, fail to make provision for the impact of the changes which will inevitably result from the drastic curtailment of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>Considerable attention has been given in debates in recent years in the House to the problems of the cost of living.  When a far steeper rise occured than has occured since the advent of the present Government, there was very loud clamour through the country, a clamour initiated and fanned by the then Opposition, and, indeed, a clamour that was to some extent assisted by some of those who are now supporting the Government.</P>
    <P>When some of the causes of that situation were attributed to external circumstances, very little attention was paid to the reasons then given. Criticism was voiced that the remedies applied were ineffective.  It was asserted that the external influences operating, that the impact of world armament and of stockpiling resulting from the Korean war could not have a very great effect here.  That type of propaganda was reasonably successful and, no doubt, in the early stages a great number of people were under the impression that it was difficult to imagine how the effect of that war could impinge on the economy of a small island such as this.</P>
    <P>When the present Government assumed responsibility for dealing with the situation, the effects attributable to the Korean war loomed largely in the reasons put forward by them for the deterioration of the situation and for the rise which has occurred in the prices of a number of commodities.  But all these considerations are subordinate to the proposals which the Minister and <Col N="1494" /> other Ministers have suggested to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue and to correct the import excess.  As I said, none of the remedies propounded in this Budget will correct the import excess.  In fact, when the increases in the duties on tobacco, beer, and spirits were announced by the Minister it was expected that they would not result in any diminution in consumption, because the revenue expected is based on consumption remaining approximately the same. Consequently, the arguments we have heard about saving dollars and reducing the drain on the dollar pool have no validity in the context of this Budget and no validity when applied to the figures which the Minister gave a couple of weeks ago on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>The Government hope that the increased tax on tobacco will not result in a diminution in the quantity consumed because, if it did, the revenue from that source would be reduced. No remedy for reducing the imports from the dollar area was propounded either on the Vote on Account or during the discussion on this Budget.  It is obvious that the Government do not expect to achieve a saving of dollars in tobacco imports and we have not yet been informed of the other measures which it is proposed to take to reduce imports from the dollar area. It is significant that that aspect of the problem has been passed over in silence.</P>
    <P>During the debate it was suggested that we were living on American dollars for the last three years. Deputies opposite must appreciate the damage that statements of that kind do to our relations with our friends in the United States.  This country appreciated the help afforded by the granting of American dollars through Marshall Aid.  It is not without signifinance that last May the head of E.C.A., who might be accepted as an impartial expert on the problem, expressed the view that Ireland had achieved results in the short space of three years, which otherwise would have taken a generation to achieve, as a result of the granting of American dollars.  The fact that we <Col N="1495" /> were able to use these dollars for development purposes and to avail of the technical assistance projects provided by E.C.A. cannot but have resulted in an improvement in the technique and experience of those who were enabled, through that assistance, to go to the United States and to avail of the courses provided there. It is ungracious at this stage, when Marshall Aid is ended, to allege that we were in any way subordinated to the decisions or beholden to the Government of the United States in either economic or military matters.  The members of the Government know that that was not the case.  In fact, it is common knowledge that discussions have been proceeding since the enactment of the Mutual Security Act with a view to availing of the sum of over £5,000,000 which still remains available and which this Government did not succeed in spending out of the Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>That money is still available and the discussions are still proceeding. Deputies opposite should remember that before they make the allegation that we were in some way or other pledging to act and direct our policy because of the acceptance of Marshall Aid.  The only obligation we undertook in accepting Marshall Aid was the obligation, which will be honoured, to repay the loan which was thereby granted.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that, because this Government is making heavy weather, because the Party opposite find it difficult to defend the conditions at present for which it was responsible, because they recognise unpopularity of the measures proposed, because they appreciate that any straw will be clutched at by a drowning man, they now seek to introduce the suggestion and allegation that, in some way or another, this country, by its acceptance of Marshall Aid, had pledged its independence or forfeited its right to take independent action economically or militarily.</P>
    <P>Those, of course, with a knowledge of the facts&mdash;and it is reasonable to assume that the present Government have some knowledge of the facts&mdash;<Col N="1496" /> recognise that that situation and that picture presented by some Deputies opposite and some of their supporters is not in accordance with the facts, but it is wrong nationally and bad the prestige of the country and bad for the welfare of the State that any suggestion should be voiced of the fact that that loan was accepted.  It was accepted because it was recognised that it was given in a magnificent spirit, so that we might develop our economy and adopt plans on the assumption that this money was given to rehabilitate the economy of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Budget fails to provide a remedy is significant.  It is significant because of the harsh proposals incorporated in it, because it came at the conclusion of a campaign in which the country was led to believe that it would result in specific proposals being introduced which would provide a remedy for the import excess and for the reduction in the heavy import excess over the last years.</P>
    <P>It is true that this Budget will effect reductions; it is true that it will effect a reduction in the amount of food consumed by many families; it will effect a reduction in the standard of life of large sections of the people; it will affect intimately the lives of every single section of the community, and affect some of them intensely.  No Budget in recent times has affected the people so much but the reductions provided for here will not result in any serious alteration in the import excess. The Minister's references to it yesterday showed that he recognised that whatever proposals are incorporated in this Budget cannot achieve any serious change and cannot effect any really important improvement in the situation that has occurred.  The Government took the responsibility of bringing in an early Budget in order to clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious the situation is clarified.  It is quite obvious that this Government had decided to adopt the remedies proposed in Britain and to apply them to the situation here.  But it is also quite obvious that they have not faced up to the results of these remedies or to the consequences which <Col N="1497" /> will follow.  We had here to-day a defence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the increases in food prices and we had the suggestion that, because these increases were to give beneficial improvements under social welfare and children's allowances, benefits would accrue to the community. It was alleged that the increases which were to be granted in these social services would more than offset the increases in food prices.  I challenge the Government, and I do not believe they have made any calculation to prove it, to show that these added benefits will offset the rise in the cost of foodstuffs. Does anybody believe that the increases which will follow will in any way be offset by the social welfare benefits?  When this Government announced its programme after the last election, one of the proposals in the 17-point memo which was published was one to increase children's allowances.  It was not then announced, either as one of the 17 points or subsequently, that it was proposed at the same time to increase the cost of living.</P>
    <P>No calculations have been made, or <Col N="1498" /> if they have been made they have not been given to the House, with a view to estimating the rise in the cost of living that will accrue.  It is quite obvious that the Government was staggered by the estimate of the rise in the cost-of-living index that would result from the alterations in the food subsidies.  It is probably only academic to consider what the rise would be. The real rise will be felt by the people who have to pay these increases; the real impact will have to be borne by all sections, and it is obvious from the increases now proposed and which will come into operation that applications for wage increases are inevitable.  The Government appears to have avoided any consideration of this problem, or if any consideration has been given to it, then the results that will accrue from these increases have not been fully understood or sufficiently investigated. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.</P>
