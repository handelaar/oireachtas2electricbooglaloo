      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware (a) that copies of the report on the economic survey of Ireland by four United States experts were inadequately distributed to the Press; (b) that only a limited section of the newspapers was supplied with copies of the report notwithstanding the international implications of the report and possible repercussions from countries with whom the Republic trades, and (c) that Press representatives who made requests to the Government Information Bureau for a copy of the report were met with a refusal; and, if so, if he will take steps to ensure that distribution by the Government of reports and documents of public importance will not, in future, be confined to any particular section of the Press but will be issued without similar discrimination.</P>

      <P>The number of copies of the report received from the United States was sufficient only for limited circulation.  The Stationery Office has arranged for the printing of the report here and I hope it will be on sale later this month.</P>
      <P>It might be inferred from the Deputy's question that the Government Information Bureau refused to give copies to certain Press representatives. It was not a case of refusal to supply; there were no further copies then available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of meetings of the Prices Advisory Body which have been held since its establishment; the number of recommendations submitted by the body to him and the number of cases in which the recommendation was (a) accepted and (b) rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>From the date of their establishment in January, 1951, to the 9th December, 1952, the Prices Advisory Body have held 152 meetings and have submitted 268 recommendations <Col N="1139" /> of which 260 have been accepted, seven have been rejected and one is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received complaints regarding the short notice given by the Prices Advisory Body of their intention to hold public inquiries, which has made it practically impossible for interested bodies to prepare their evidence to oppose applications for prices increases, and if he will arrange that the Prices Advisory Body will give more reasonable notice of public sittings and, if possible, notify interested bodies of the proposal to hold public sittings, in advance of the usual Press notice advertising such public sittings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I received one complaint of the kind mentioned in the question.  Under the Prices Advisory Body Order, 1951, it is a matter for the body itself to determine its procedure. I have, however, been informed by the body that as long notice as possible is given of their intention to hold a public inquiry and that at the opening of, and during the course of each inquiry it is made clear that an adjournment will be granted should any interested party require time to present further evidence.  A Press advertisement is inserted as soon as it is decided to hold an inquiry and interested parties are notified at the same time.  The body informs me that no inquiry has been closed before all interested parties appearing have been fully heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has made representations to the British Government regarding the two-price policy pursued by British exporters in respect of steel, pig-iron and other metals supplied to this country; and, if so, when the last representations were made and what reasons were put forward by the British Government for continuing the discrimination against this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the <Col N="1140" /> Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar question on 4th December. Every opportunity to impress on the British authorities the desirability of supplying metals to this country at reasonable prices will be availed of but I do not think it would be appropriate for me to try to explain the reasons why the British authorities have continued to pursue this policy of differential pricing, a policy which is not confined to exports to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that this issue was raised when the Irish delegates were at the last conference of the Council of Europe at Strasbourg and surprise was expressed by British representatives of all political Parties who were present at the conference that this policy was being pursued in respect of this country?  Bearing that fact in mind, would the Minister give further consideration to the question of reopening the matter with the British Government because of the adverse effects of that policy so far as our secondary industries are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will be reopened with the British Government whenever a suitable opportunity arises.  I must point out, however, that the policy is not confined to this country nor is it confined to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the great uncertainty amongst the trading community and the near approach of the new taxation year, he will make a definite statement to the Dáil regarding Government policy towards the suggested mileage limitation on privately-owned lorries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 22nd October last, I have felt bound to consider and investigate fully the proposals made by Córas Iompair Éireann for a mileage limitation on privately-owned lorries.  I have already received views from some 65 trade associations, public and local bodies and individual firms, and further memoranda continue to reach me daily.  The matter is also under consideration by the Consultative Committee of Trade Unions with members in the employment of Córas Iompair Éireann.  As the Córas Iompair Éireann proposals have such far-reaching implications I feel it is essential that before asking the Government to make a decision I should consider very carefully the reactions of those interests most likely to be affected.  The work of examining and analysing the various views which have been expressed is proceeding as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to give fair consideration to all these proposals would it not be advisable for himself to give good example and to refrain from making provocative speeches in which he is attempting to prejudge this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the motor taxation increase which will come into operation in the New Year would the Minister consider making a definite statement between now and the New Year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I think it is unlikely that any final decisions of policy in this regard will be made before the New Year.  It will be appreciated that any change in legislation can only be effected by a measure submitted to the Dáil.  There is no likelihood of any such measure being submitted, much less passed, within the course of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that within the next few months the hand-won turf season will be starting <Col N="1142" /> and that it is essential that producers of hand-won turf should know whether the distribution of their turf will be confined to this radius?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be confined. The proposals of Córas Iompair Éireann could not be given effect without legislation and there is no suggestion yet that any legislation dealing with transport firms will be submitted in the early future.</P>

    <P>An application by Córas Iompair Éireann for an Order authorising the permanent discontinuance of train services on the Clara-Banagher branch line is at present before the transport tribunal and, as the Deputy is aware, under the Transport Act of 1950, the <Col N="1143" /> consideration and determination of the matter rest entirely with the tribunal. I have no function in relation to the application.  I assume that all information relative to the application, desired by the tribunal, will be made available by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister objects to and protests against, as he has done quite recently here, the chairman or executive officers of Córas Iompair Éireann giving information of this kind direct to Deputies why does he refuse to give the information himself to Deputies here?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board dealing with the subject matter referred to in the questions was received on the 18th November, 1952. Under the terms of the agreement concluded with the Civil Service staff associations, the Government is required to present to Dáil Éireann a report from the chairman of the board within three months of its receipt, or, if at the expiration of the three months the Dáil is not sitting, then on the first day of the next sitting.  No report is to be published before submission to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Prolonged investigation and consideration will be necessary before the Government is in a position to take a decision in this matter.  The report cannot be submitted to Dáil Éireann until that decision has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in consequence of the increased cost of living, increases are being granted to workers in both private and municipal employment?  Is he further aware of the fact that those employed in the State service had every reason to expect that they would receive an increase as a consequence of the hearing by the arbitration board of their claim and that that increase would be paid before Christmas?  Does the Minister now suggest that he proposes to hold up this report until the Dáil resumes in February next and <Col N="1149" /> that no increase will be granted in the meantime notwithstanding the substantial increase that has taken place in the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no justification whatever for the implications contained in the Deputy's supplementary question.  The terms governing the conciliation and arbitration scheme are set out in black and white and the Government is not obliged to submit the report to Dáil Éireann until three months have elapsed after its receipt by the Government.  The position is so serious that I think the Government is entitled to have time to consider the implications of any action which may be taken in consequence of the report and I do not propose, therefore, to add anything to the reply I have already given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that the Tánaiste, who is now acting as Taoiseach, made a statement at a public meeting in Dublin on 12th May, 1951?  Is he aware that that statement was published in the Press on 13th May, 1951, and that the Tánaiste stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has been suggested also that Fianna Fáil would terminate the arbitration systems which had been set up for civil servants.  He did not know if those systems had worked to the satisfaction of public officials. They seemed to have delayed rather than facilitated the adjustment of salary rates.  But if the Civil Service organisations were satisfied with them they were quite prepared to allow them to operate unchanged, and would give effect to any wage or salary increase resulting from them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not propose now to implement the promise made by the Tánaiste together with his own promise made to the staff associations when he saw them in March of this year?</P>

      <P>In accordance with modern architectural practice in a building of this kind, the greater part of the rainwater pipes and vent fittings are situated in closed ducts within the framework of the building and are not accessible for maintenance repainting.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that Irish workers employed in England during the past three years are requested to report for military service by the British Government or leave the country; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that no liability to be conscripted into the British armed forces exists in the case of Irish citizens who do not ordinarily reside in Britain for permanent purposes for periods over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, however, Irish citizens become ordinarily resident in Britain for two years they are held by the British authorities liable to be called up for military service under the provisions of the British National <Col N="1156" /> Service Acts if they come within the statutory age limits and are not classified within any of the prescribed categories of exemptions.</P>
    <P>By arrangement made with the British Government, following representations by the Irish Government, such Irish citizens, even if called up for service, will not in fact be conscripted if they choose to return home.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that there are any further steps open to me to take in this matter.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report in to-day's papers to the effect that an Irishman from County Kerry appeared yesterday before a magistrate in Bristol for refusing to register for national service and&mdash;despite the fact that the magistrate upheld the defence &mdash;that a representative of the Crown has stated in public that an appeal would be made on the magistrate's decision, and, if so, will the Minister take steps to see that the Department of External Affairs are represented at the hearing of the appeal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the fact that this country is a member of the sterling area, the Government have been kept informed of the progress of the discussions at the recent Commonwealth Conference in London and if it is proposed that representatives of the Government will have discussions with the British Government on the results of this conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. With regard to the second part, the conference to which the Deputy refers is not a sterling area conference; but I am sure if any conclusions emerge from it which might affect our interests as a member of the sterling area, they will be communicated to us in the normal way and arrangements made for their discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> Forestry labourers are recruited from amongst men registered as unemployed at the local employment exchange and are, as a rule, taken on in the order of preference in which they are put forward by the exchange, subject, of course, to their suitability for forestry work.  In decreasing staff the same general principles apply.  Regard is had to each man's circumstances and to his performance of work during the period of his employment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that a review of an official publication under the name of a district justice which appeared in a daily newspaper of 1st November, 1952, under the caption &ldquo;Names and Numbers,&rdquo; would seem to hold up to ridicule the work of a statutory body, and, further, that a book review under the same name appeared in a daily newspaper of the 30th September 1952, in which the writer advises his readers to obtain a copy of a certain book without delay, while hinting that the novel in question was likely to be prohibited shortly, as, in fact, it was; and if, in view of the fact that such action is not in keeping with the conduct expected from a district justice, he will state whether he has taken or proposes to take any action in the matter under the powers vested in him under Section 21 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1946.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that a person who is a justice of the District Court ought not to have contributed to the Press an article of which the evident purpose was to hold up to ridicule the performance by the Censorship Board of a statutory duty and that there can be no two opinions about the impropriety of members of the judiciary ridiculing the members of a statutory body, the more so if the latter are acting under powers which the former may have to enforce.  But while I deprecate the publication of the article in question I am not satisfied that a single publication of this kind amounts to such misbehaviour as would warrant the justice's removal from office in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Article 35 of the Constitution and, therefore, I do not propose to take action under Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, so that milk producers shall obtain from the dairy disposals board and the co-operative societies the full price for milk used for chocolate crumb production purposes without any deduction being made in respect of the butter fat content of the milk returned from the creamery or of wastage due to spilling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) (for Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question which he asked on 21st May, 1952, creameries which sell milk for use in the manufacture of chocolate crumb do not purchase the milk from particular milk suppliers specifically for that purpose.  Each creamery group purchases milk on the basis of its butter fat content only, and in fact, they are obliged to do so under the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  The actual price which the creamery can pay for the milk depends on the various uses to which the milk supply generally is put, including butter making, cream, liquid milk, chocolate crumb, etc., and on returns from other trading activities.  Where, however, the creamery requires to use whole milk such as for sale for chocolate crumb, the suppliers who do not receive back their skim milk are paid for the skim on a gallonage basis.  Normal mechanical losses in butter fat in the day to day working of creameries cannot be prevented by legislation and the suggestion in the latter part of the Deputy's question is quite impracticable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 58 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the expenditure of the considerable amount of official time which the compilation of the special statistics requested in the Deputy's <Col N="1172" /> questions would necessitate would not be justified.  It is possible, however, to give the Deputy some general information.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to import clay drainage pipes only to the extent necessary to make good the deficiency in home production.  Concrete drainage pipes are not imported.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 20,000,000 drainage pipes are needed annually for the purposes of the land project.  Of this total number, approximately 15,000,000 must be of the baked clay variety.  The present estimated home production of clay drainage pipes is 5,000,000 pipes. It is necessary, therefore, to import 10,000,000 pipes annually.</P>
    <P>This year orders were placed with continental concerns for 10,500,000 pipes.</P>
    <P>No orders were placed either for home or for foreign-manufactured drainage pipes which were not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The question of placing orders with continental firms for drainage pipes during the year ending 31st December, 1953, is under consideration.  It will probably be necessary to continue the policy of importing a sufficient quantity of pipes to meet the deficiency in home production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House is aware that this Bill has already been passed by the Seanad in which it was introduced.  Its purpose is to implement the 1948 international convention for the safety of life at sea.  That convention was signed in 1948 by the delegates of the Irish Government <Col N="1174" /> and came into force last month.  All shipping and labour interests in the State were fully consulted before the conference in 1948, and were again consulted during the preparation of the Bill.  This is an agreed measure so far as the industry is concerned.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Dáil will not require me to give a close analysis of its provisions which are very technical in character.  The Bill, as those who have read it will know, is mainly an enabling Bill.  The Orders which may be made under it can be annulled by the Oireachtas.  I have given an assurance to the industry that, if these Orders should at any time go beyond the strict requirements of the convention, they will not be made without full consultation with the ship-owners and traders concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one matter that I want to raise.  This Bill, as the Minister has said, is an enabling Bill and provides for regulations to deal with the safety of life at sea. There is one problem which has caused a good deal of trouble around the coast this year.  I do not know whether it arises directly on this Bill, but there is a provision in it for the use of oil as a safety precaution.  The point that I want to bring to the Minister's notice is that almost all the bathing resorts this year were rendered unsuitable for swimming by reason of the presence of oil and, in some cases, of tar in close proximity to the coast.  I understand that there is a regulation which prevents ships from discharging oil, tar or any other obnoxious substance within close proximity of the coastline. That regulation, however, appears this year to have been more honoured in the breach than in the observance, and so a great number of coastal areas were affected by the presence of oil or tar.

      <P>I may say that the problem to which the Deputy has referred is not, of course, confined to this country.  In the south of England and in certain European countries, the same unpleasant experience has arisen. There are regulations prohibiting the <Col N="1175" /> discharge of oil in estuaries and harbours here, but, of course, we cannot, by our own law, control anything which is outside our own territory.  I have communicated with all the shipping lines using our ports requesting them not to discharge oil or clean bunkers within 50 miles of the coast.  It must be appreciated, however, that the problem is not caused solely or mainly even by ships calling to this country.</P>

      <P>It was only a request. There is an international committee investigating what can be done by an international regulation to control the nuisance.  A recent investigation carried out by the British Government has indicated that the cleaning of the tanks of oil tankers in the middle of the Atlantic has resulted in the accumulation of pitch and tar on certain European coasts and certain investigations are proceeding as to the drift of currents, and so forth, with a view to ascertaining whether some benefit would arise from prohibiting the cleaning of oil tankers in certain parts of the ocean.  It is obviously something which we cannot remedy by ourselves and, as I say, it is under consideration by this committee.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do not think it is necessary for me to speak at length on this Bill.  The House will remember that, about two years ago, an Act was passed to enable a pension to be paid to the widow of the late Terence MacSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork.  The present Bill provides in the same way for the widows of two murdered Mayors of Limerick, Micheál Ó Ceallacháin and Seoirse Mac Fhlannchadha. The Bill was also intended to provide for a pension for the widow of Tomás Mac Curtáin, former Lord Mayor of Cork.  Unfortunately, before the Dáil reassembled, Mrs. MacCurtain died on the 10th October last.  Provision is made, therefore, for the payment of a gratuity to her daughter, Miss Síle MacCurtain, who nursed Mrs. MacCurtain through the last years of her life.  The gratuity is of an amount equal to what would have been one year's pension to Mrs. MacCurtain.  I am sure the Dáil will approve this Bill.</P>

      <P>Of course I am agreeing with the Bill, but I should like to say that we have been dealing in a piecemeal way in the past couple of years with cases such as this and I would much prefer if the Government, even with the assistance of a committee from all sides of the House, would consider the question of an all-embracing Bill which would give power to deal with special cases such as these. There are children of leaders and signatories of the Proclamation of 1916 who I think ought to be brought within legislation of this kind.  There would be no difficulty whatsoever about it.  While I know it cannot be brought within this Bill which is limited in its scope, I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a Bill which would enable gratuities or pensions to be paid to people such as I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>During the period of office of the last Government, I asked the then Taoiseach if the question of a civil list might be considered.  I understood from his reply that the matter was under consideration.  I see that the same question was raised in the Seanad recently and I think the reply given was that it was under consideration. I avail of this opportunity to say that the Minister might consider the introduction of legislation at a very early date to deal in an all-embracing way with the persons I have mentioned.  It is unsatisfactory to be bringing in Bills dealing with named persons.  If we could have a Bill passed that would govern the matter in principle, I think it would be a much more satisfactory way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Aviation and Meteorological Services.</P>
      <P>The reason for the introduction of the token Estimate is to afford me an opportunity of making a statement to the Dáil concerning arrangements which are contemplated for the operation of a transatlantic air service by Aer Línte and of allowing that statement to be discussed and, I hope, approved here before final commitments are made.  It is only a token Estimate, as Deputies will have noticed, and I think that at the very outset I should make it quite clear that it is not intended that the taxpayers will have to provide anything for the purpose of this service either in initial capital outlay for the launching of it or, on the basis of present plans, make any provisions against operating losses should they arise.  Certain interjections made in the course of the debate last week by Deputies, which indicated that they had assumed otherwise, require me to emphasise that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked how it arises that Aer Línte Éireann, Teoranta, is in a position to initiate a transatlantic air service and contemplate carrying it on in its early stages without requiring some financial support.  The explanation of that can be given briefly and, I <Col N="1179" /> think, clearly.  Contrary to what I understand is the general belief, the original transatlantic air operation plans which were initiated in 1947 and terminated in 1948, produced a clear profit.  The total amount which was invested in that undertaking was £1,425,005.  When the decision was taken to terminate the undertaking and the company was instructed to dispose of its assets, it did so for a sum of £1,882,010.  The result, therefore, was that there was an excess of receipts over capital outlay of £457,005.  That money held by Aer Línte on the termination of its operation and the disposal of its assets was loaned to the Exchequer free of interest.  It is proposed to give them back the amount of profit earned upon the realisation of the assets, £450,000, and it is estimated that in accordance with the arrangements they have made, that sum will be adequate not merely to cover the initial outlay contemplated in connection with the inauguration of the service but to meet any operating losses that may arise.</P>

      <P>From the Exchequer. The decision of the Government is, in fact, that there will be made available for the purpose of this service that amount, £450,000, and no more, that is to say, the amount of the profits realised upon the sale of the Constellations and other assets of Aer Lingus in 1948 and that if it should prove to be inadequate, this second attempt to inaugurate an Irish transatlantic air service will terminate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was also loaned free of interest to the Exchequer and is still there.  It is contemplated that Aer Línte will require approximately £200,000 for initial expenditure on capital account, and the balance of the £450,000, namely £250,000, will be available to it for working expenses. If the service should not succeed it will be wound up with no greater outlay than that, that is to say, the utilisation for the second attempt to <Col N="1180" /> inaugurate the service of the profit accruing from the first attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may, I think, be useful if I recount briefly our experience in this connection.  When the Government decided in 1946 to ask Aer Rianta, which as the House probably knows is the parent air transport company established under legislation here, to establish a transatlantic air service, it promoted the formation of another company for that purpose, the company which was known as Aer Línte Éireann, Teoranta.  That company was incorporated in 1947.  The decision taken to inaugurate that service was influenced by the fact that many other small countries had established such services.  We were aware that a considerable expansion in American tourist traffic to Europe was contemplated and we felt that an Irish transatlantic service would help to ensure that this country would receive its due share of that traffic.  We were also of opinion that if an Irish service was to compete successfully for that traffic it should be started at that time.  The existence of a large Irish population in the United States seemed to justify the assumption which we then made that an Irish transatlantic service would do just as well as other similar services which were being started or had been started by other European countries. There were other considerations also in our mind, considerations of which the House is aware&mdash;the fact that there is a general sentiment in favour of having this country control its own means of communication with foreign countries, a desire to prevent a situation developing in relation to air transport similar to that which had existed in regard to shipping and which caused us so much concern at the outbreak of the war, and also a desire to have in this country at least one wholly Irish owned air transport operating company.  Aer Línte Éireann was, as I have informed the Dáil, set up for the purpose of operating that service.  Its issued capital was £1,425,005, all of which was held by Aer Rianta with the exception of the five directors' shares. They purchased the five Lockheed Constellation aircraft, recruited the <Col N="1181" /> necessary staff, arranged for their training, and proving flights were actually carried out with the intention of inaugurating the service on St. Patrick's Day, 1948.</P>
    <P>When the decision was taken by the succeeding Government in 1948 to abandon that project, Aer Línte Éireann was requested to take all proper steps to put that decision into effect.  Accordingly the company dispensed with the services of the staffs which had been recruited and sold its aircraft and other equipment.  These sales amounted to £1,882,010 which was, as I have stated, then loaned free of interest to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The company was not in fact wound up and it is on the basis of that company that it is now intended that the plans for the new service should rest. Since 1948 statistics show that American tourist traffic has expanded even beyond the expectations entertained in 1947 and it is perfectly clear, I think, that that expansion of traffic has not yet reached its peak.  In this year the number of transatlantic passengers travelling from America to Ireland and disembarking in Ireland and the number of people travelling to America from Ireland shows an increase.  Statistics relating to traffic between this country and the United States of America for the 1952 season, excluding transit traffic, show a very remarkable increase of almost 100 per cent.  The number of such passages in 1951 was 5,400; in this year it was 10,600.  That increase in what I may call local traffic between this country and the United States of America took place simultaneously with an equally remarkable growth in the total number of American tourists travelling to Europe by air services and, within that figure, the number passing Shannon airport increased by 70 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if these are air passengers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Air passengers only. The number of transit passengers passing through Shannon this year was 70 per cent. higher than in 1951.  The advice available to us from travel agencies and Government authorities, as well as from companies engaged in <Col N="1182" /> the operation of transatlantic air and shipping services, is that a further and perhaps equally striking increase in traffic is to be anticipated next year and in the ensuing years.</P>
      <P>Next year, as the House knows, we are inaugurating An Tóstal.  The main object of that festival is to increase tourist earnings by attracting tourist traffic to this country during the slack period.  An Tóstal will begin on Easter Sunday.  During the period around Easter transport accommodation is never fully taxed and it is reasonable to expect that An Tóstal will result in an increase in the number of persons travelling by air to this country and it is the desire of Aer Línte, therefore, to have this new transatlantic air service in operation for that occasion.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I discussed with the board of Aer Rianta the general development of air transport services to this country and particularly the practicability of transatlantic services. The board of Aer Rianta were definitely interested in the possibility of transatlantic operation and various possibilities were mentioned during the course of our discussion.  After considering the suggestions of the board and the possibilities which were mentioned during the discussions I requested the board to arrange for its officers to go to the United States of America for discussions with an American company called Seaboard and Western Airlines Limited, an American company which is at the present time licensed to operate scheduled freight services across the Atlantic by the American Civil Aviation Board and which is also operating passenger services on a charter basis. This is a company with a good operating and financial record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the discussions between the officers of Aer Rianta and the representatives of Seaboard and Western Airlines an agreement has been completed between the two companies under which the American company will lease Skymaster aircraft to the Irish company.  These aircraft will operate under the licence and in the name of Aer Línte Teoranta and will carry that company's insignia and <Col N="1183" /> markings.  Under the provisions of the lease Seaboard and Western Airlines will supply the operating crews and supply also the personnel and services necessary to keep the aircraft in operation. Aer Línte will supply the passenger handling personnel, will deal with all passenger handling and most of the bookings.  Aer Línte will need to set up a traffic office in New York and passenger handling and ticket counters at New York Airport and possibly at Boston Airport also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean there will be no Irish pilots?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point in a moment.  It is hoped to commence the service by Easter of next year.  The intention is to start with three round trips per week, rising to six per week during the summer period and reducing by degrees to two per week during the slack period.  All these services will be of the tourist class and the charge will be that in operation by other airlines for tourist-class traffic.</P>
      <P>Seaboard and Western have on order Constellation aircraft of which delivery is expected in 1954.  The agreement provides for the leasing of these aircraft to Aer Línte as soon as possible in substitution for the Skymaster aircraft.  At that stage Aer Línte will operate two round trips per week during the slack season and up to six round trips per week in the peak season, depending upon the availability of traffic.  The Constellation aircraft will have a higher carrying capacity than the Skymaster aircraft. The normal route which it is proposed to operate is Shannon-Gander-Boston-New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I should say a few words about the type of aircraft with which it is proposed to inaugurate this service.  The Skymaster aircraft is, I think, generally accepted in the aviation world as the safest aircraft flying.  It has been in use on the North Atlantic route since 1946 and has shown itself to be as completely reliable as its smaller brother, the D.C.3, which is the main type of aircraft operated by Aer Lingus on European routes.  It is, <Col N="1184" /> however, not pressurised and somewhat slower in flight than Constellation aircraft.  The fact that it is not pressurised means that it cannot fly at very high altitudes, which may on occasion be a disadvantage.  The Super-Constellation aircraft with which the service will be provided in 1954 is, of course, completely up-to-date and represents the most modern type of aircraft designed for transatlantic operation.</P>
    <P>The type of operation contemplated by the agreement between the two companies is, of course, dictated entirely by expediency.  Obviously, it would be more satisfactory for Aer Línte to go into operation with its own aircraft manned by its own crews. Personally I should much prefer to come here with a proposition of that character.  Since the Press have begun carrying stories about the possibility of a resumption of transatlantic operations by Aer Línte I have received many letters from former Aer Línte pilots who were trained in the operation of Constellation aircraft and who are anxious to get back into the service of that company.  Unfortunately I had to convey to them that the prospect is not likely to arise in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to propose now the establishment of this service by Aer Línte with its own aircraft because of difficulty in obtaining in any reasonable time by purchase, aircraft of the type considered most suitable for transatlantic operations.  In fact, these aircraft are not becoming available yet in sufficient numbers to meet the demands of the existing operating companies.  It is contemplated, however, that Aer Línte will eventually change over from the operation of this service with leased aircraft to its own aircraft.  It is not a disadvantage, from a long-term point of view, that its capital commitments should be minimised at this stage when the service is still largely experimental.  Nobody can be dogmatic about the traffic that will be available for the company.  In the operation of the service with leased aircraft, the company will obtain very valuable experience which will be utilised later when deciding what type <Col N="1185" /> and what number of aircraft to purchase for the purpose of these operations.  I must explain that while the service will be operated with aircraft leased from Seaboard and Western, and will be serviced by that company in respect of flying operations, the whole undertaking will be completely controlled by Aer Línte, Teoranta.  The aircraft are being leased at a fixed rate per aircraft mile. The rate covers the provision of flight crews, maintenance, fuel and the payment of landing fees.  The aircraft will also carry full passenger liability insurance, effected by Seaboard and Western.  All revenue will, however, accrue to Aer Línte.  In general, the agreement is for payment in dollars in New York but Seaboard and Western have agreed to notify Aer Línte each month of the amount of their expenditure in the preceding month which can lawfully be paid in sterling and Aer Línte shall have the right to pay such amounts in Irish currency or in sterling and to deduct an equivalent amount from any dollar payments due.  The total amount to be provided for the purpose of all payments arising out of the agreement is not to exceed £450,000.</P>

Of that £450,000, it is estimated that something less than £200,000&mdash;about £190,000&mdash;will have to be expended before the first flight takes place.  It is estimated that it will have to be expended in the provision of the organisation which Aer Línte will need to build up in order to conduct its share of the operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it is difficult to estimate how this service will fare, financially.  From one point of view we are not as suitably placed for the operating of a transatlantic air service as we were in 1948.  We are not now operating with our own aircraft and we are entering the business in the face of much greater competition than existed in 1948.  On the other hand, we have the compensating advantage that the total traffic available has increased substantially in the intervening years.  I think that we must face the possibility that the service will operate at a loss in the first year and possibly in the first two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors to which I personally gave great thought before approving of this arrangement was the intention of commencing the service with Skymaster aircraft.  The argument which swayed my opinion in favour of starting in 1953 with Skymaster aircraft instead of waiting for 1954 and starting with Constellation aircraft is that the service is not likely to pay in its first year, when good-will is being built up for it, and that the lower operating costs of the Skymaster aircraft will minimise the loss.  That represents from some points of view, an advantage.  Against the fact that the Skymaster aircraft, because of their characteristics, may be less attractive to passengers than the Constellation aircraft, there is the fact that it is estimated that the total carrying capacity available amongst all the air companies operating on the Atlantic next year will be less than sufficient to meet the demand.  That was another <Col N="1187" /> argument advanced by Aer Rianta, Teoranta, in support of the proposal to start with Skymaster aircraft in 1953 instead of waiting for the larger and more up-to-date aircraft and starting in 1954.</P>

      <P>I shall try to find out. The Deputy need have no anxiety as to the suitability of the aircraft for transatlantic operation.  It is generally regarded, as I have said, as a very reliable aircraft designed for long-distance flights of that character. Some attempt has been made to estimate the operating revenue and expenditure in the first and subsequent years of the agreement.  These estimates have been conservatively made and assume that this service will not succeed in attracting any part of the transit traffic between North America and Europe.  The assumption is that it will have to depend upon what I have described as local traffic&mdash;that is to say, upon the availability of passengers from America to Ireland intending to disembark in Ireland and of passengers from Ireland to America. I have mentioned already that the total number of persons travelling from America to Ireland and disembarking in Ireland or returning from Ireland to America and not coming from anywhere else was 10,000 in 1951. There were 10,000 in 1951 and in this <Col N="1188" /> year it is estimated that there may be 17,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who landed in Ireland and later went back again would count as two.  It would, however, be wrong to assume that the number of flights either way was half that figure.  Anyway the estimate which has been prepared by the board of Aer Línte, following their consultations with travel organisations in America and elsewhere, and from the information concerning the expectations of other transport companies, is that the number of passengers travelling between North America and Ireland in 1953 will be between 20,000 and 25,000.  On the basis that I have mentioned of six trips each way per week in the peak season, falling down to two trips each way in the off-season, Aer Línte would need to get approximately half that traffic in order to clear their operating expenses.  If they get 13,000 passengers in the first year, they will make a profit of £64,000, but if the numbers carried fall to 10,000 they will make a loss of £48,000.  These calculations are based upon the traffic schedules which I have mentioned but it will be appreciated that the policy of the company will be to relate the number of flights operated to the traffic offering.  By the time Constellation aircraft are available, there will need to be a further increase of traffic commensurate with the increased capacity of these aircraft to get the same financial results. In the expectation that the traffic available will continue to grow, if not at the same rate shown this year at some commensurate rate, it is assumed that the company should be able to attract in 1954, if Constellation aircraft are then in operation, approximately 16,000 passengers which would enable a profit on these operations to be shown in that year.  The arrangement is that Aer Línte will pay Seaboard and Western $5,858 for each Skymaster flight.  Afterwards when the Constellations are available the charge will rise to $10,193.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for a single flight. On these rates the company estimate that they can make profits if they get a reasonable share of the traffic and a reasonable utilisation of the capacity provided.  There were statements made somewhere to the effect that under the agreement Aer Línte will have paid Seaboard and Western $11,000,000 in a period of four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very rough estimate which might prove to be correct in certain circumstances.  In point of fact, the agreement will not run for four years.  It will operate for a maximum period of three years and nine months.  There is some doubt yet as to the date on which the Constellation aircraft will be available.  They are due for delivery on the 1st January, 1954, but they are not expected until considerably later in the year, but if they are delivered in time the effect will be to reduce the maximum duration of the agreement to three years and two months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can state that precisely.  The company's expectation is no doubt that, during the peak season, they will be able to sell all their seats and will be unable to do so only in the off season, and its intention is to relate their service to the traffic available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with this statement that there will be a payment of $11,000,000 over four years.  I pointed out that on the assumption that the <Col N="1191" /> agreement will be operated for the minimum period, its duration will be three years and two months, and on the further assumption that under the agreement only the minimum number of flights provided for will be operated, then the payments made to Seaboard Western will amount to $8,500,000.  If the agreement runs its full course to the 31st December, 1956, and if the maximum number of flights provided for are operated then the payments may rise to the figure of $12,000,000.  It will be appreciated, however, that the figure given in the Press report, that payments involving $11,000,000 would be made, makes certain assumptions which may or may not prove to be correct. It is, of course, the hope and expectation of the company that they will get in passenger fares more than the amount required to meet these payments to Seaboard and Western.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I have indicated is this, that 17,000 local flights between America and Ireland took place in 1952.  It is estimated that they will go up to something like 25,000 in 1953.  If the growth of traffic which is expected in fact takes place, then of that available volume of traffic Aer Línte would need to get half in order to make a profit.  Now, its reasons for assuming that it will be able to get <Col N="1192" /> half are first of all the tendency there will be for passengers flying to Ireland and intending to stay in Ireland and of passengers leaving Ireland for America to use the service.  The next consideration is that in the peak season the companies operating planes on the transatlantic routes and carrying passengers to destinations beyond Ireland, will prefer to take passengers the longer distances and leave the short distance traffic to Aer Línte.  There is also the belief that in 1953, at least, there is going to be an insufficiency of carrying capacity on transatlantic air routes.</P>

The Deputy, I think, will understand that it would be quite unfair to this company entering into a competitive service with a number of other companies if the details of its commercial arrangements were published.  The Government is not concerned with these details but with the questions of policy which arose, and on the basis of its approval of the proposal on policy grounds, the Government will decide, I presume, following this discussion in the Dáil, to grant the licence.  The agreement is not to come into operation until the appropriate licences have been given by the Governments here and in the U.S.A.</P>

      <P>The agreement provides for the payment of a fee on cancellation of a scheduled flight.  It provides also that if Aer Línte decides to suspend operations for any period or <Col N="1196" /> reason it may endeavour to lease the aircraft to somebody else and anything earned will go against the financial obligation of Aer Línte.  Of course the amount to be paid during non-operation will be less than the standard charge because there will be no expenditure on fuel or landing fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If Aer Línte decided to stop the service for a period and were unable to sub-lease the aircraft there would be a payment.  But if circumstances should arise where it was clear that there would be no traffic for services of this kind, the obvious thing would be to terminate the whole agreement on the basis of payment of the penalty which will be covered by a bond arrangement and be charged for as an ordinary working cost of the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that Seaboard and Western are obliged to provide whatever number of aircraft are required for the operation of the service within the minimum and the maximum prescribed.  I was trying to make an estimate of how it was likely to work out.  The agreement is expressed to terminate finally on 31st December, 1956, and if there is delay in the provision of the Constellation type of aircraft the agreement can be terminated by Aer Línte on its own initiative on the 1st March, 1955.  Estimates which have been made of the traffic potentially available suggest that while it is likely that in the first year of the service the traffic offering will be less than sufficient to enable Aer Línte to break level, it is hoped to reach that position in 1954 or at least by 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this whole arrangement which was negotiated by the Aer Línte board offers a fair prospect of getting into transatlantic air operations with benefit to this country with the minimum of financial risk and with the further prospect that it will lead eventually to a situation in which Aer Línte will be able to operate with its own aircraft and crews on a profitable <Col N="1197" /> basis.  It is mainly on that ground that I recommend it to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think we have a great deal to gain by the successful establishment of Irish transatlantic air operations and that this development will lead to that position eventually.  I do not want to appear to be very optimistic.  I think it is reasonably certain that some losses will be made in 1953 and it is possible that some losses may be made in 1954. Against these losses the company will be provided with moneys sufficient to cover them out of the profit made on the sale of the Constellations in 1948 and no further charge on the taxpayers of this country is contemplated.  The direction of the Government to the company and the understanding between the company and Seaboard and Western is that the service under this agreement is to be provided within the limits of that £450,000 and to cease if these limits are likely to be exceeded. Therefore I have every reason to recommend it to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. This £450,000 profit made on the sale of the Constellations has been given back to Aer Línte and that is all they are getting.  They themselves do not anticipate that they will need that amount of money, but the expenditure they may undertake or the loss they may incur is up to that limit and no further.  If they succeed in avoiding loss altogether, then a large part of that sum will not be required by them.  If they do incur a loss within the first or second year of operation exceeding that limit, the service will stop.  That is why it is possible for me <Col N="1198" /> to say that this service will not involve asking the taxpayer to provide any money either to establish or to maintain it.</P>
      <P>I hope that Deputies will approach this proposal objectively.  I know this matter of transatlantic air operations has been the subject of political controversy; at the same time we can forget about what happened in the past and take this as a new proposition that will be independent of anything that went before for the establishment by an Irish transatlantic company of an air service across the Atlantic on the basis proposed here, a basis which we hope will lead not merely to the successful operation of this service on a profitable basis but to a more satisfactory type of development which will involve the operation of Irish-owned aircraft manned completely by Irish crews.</P>

      <P>The Minister's concluding remarks suggested that this matter could be considered <i>de novo</i> and that any reference to it should not take into account some of the controversial matters that were discussed here in the past, concerning a transatlantic air service.  Accepting what he said and discussing this matter on the basis of the proposals which have been made to the House, it is impossible not to <Col N="1199" /> reflect on the circumstances in which this proposal is introduced to the Dáil. First of all, it is unsatisfactory that the terms of the agreement have not been made available.  I appreciate the difficulty of making available the terms of a commercial agreement between two companies and in normal circumstances where two companies are concerned&mdash;even if one of the companies, as is the case here, is a State company&mdash;there would be objection to making the terms of that agreement public, but in this case there is a very big difference, the difference being that whatever losses are incurred or whatever expenditure is incurred, if losses are not the appropriate term, will be borne by the Exchequer.  The number of queries that were put to the Minister indicate the dilemma in which Deputies find themselves and indicate the confusion which exists in the minds of Deputies and the confusion which must exist in the mind of the public concerning the proposed service.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside entirely that aspect of the matter, this is a proposal to establish an air service the initial expenditure for which amounts to a sum of £450,000.  That sum has been made available by the sale of aircraft purchased in 1946 or 1947.  It was available after whatever expenditure amounting to a sum of £1,400,000, had been repaid from the amount derived from the sale of the assets which realised £1,882,000.  This proposal is made at a time when according to the Government's statements&mdash;and in this case we have got to accept them because it is the Government that have made this case&mdash;the situation this year is such that no additional outlay on any project or for any purpose can be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week the Tánaiste, when concluding the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill, asked would it be possible to get agreement from the Dáil, from all Parties, not to ask for and not to promote measures or discussion which would result in increased outlay for any project.  That debate concluded only last week and the Minister who was responsible for that statement or words to that effect <Col N="1200" /> introduces here proposals which mean an expenditure of something over £450,000.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the question of whether this particular agreement or the proposals enshrined in this arrangement are satisfactory or otherwise, the proposal to spend, in present circumstances, money on a transatlantic air service, when other expenditure has either been curtailed or when appeals are made not to initiate proposals which will result in extra expenditure, is, to say the least of it, difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>I know that it is not possible in the Dáil at the moment to have this proposal considered without taking into account the various other factors and, in particular, the approach of the Government to economic and financial policy.  I think I should say that I recognise, and most Deputies recognise, the personal interest which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in aviation, the fact that the Minister is enthusiastic about the development of air services and that he has over a number of years shown his anxiety to see established a transatlantic air service.  It is therefore unreasonable to expect that the wisdom of this proposal will overcome the Minister's enthusiasm to see established a transatlantic air service.  Other Deputies may or may not have the same interest in a proposal of this kind, but the proposal to establish and to expend public money on a transatlantic air service in present circumstances is one which we on this side of the House cannot accept, one which, on the general economic policy as enunciated by the Government, must drive many Deputies to the conclusion that the Government are either insincere in their statements and in the general line of policy they have adopted or, then, the economic situation is entirely different from that which they suggest it is.</P>
    <P>The terms of this particular agreement which have been announced by the Minister may give some indication of the complexity of the arrangements and of the need of a full disclosure of the terms of the agreement.  As far as it was possible to do so I took as extensive <Col N="1201" /> a note as I could of the Minister's statement.  Endeavouring to piece together what he said and to total the proposed expenditure and outlay, one finds it almost impossible to assess the estimated profit and quite impossible to come to any definite conclusion as to the prospects of this service during the next couple of years or even for the full term of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it was estimated that the sum of £200,000 would be required for capital, leaving a balance of £250,000 for working expenses.  He did not specify what proportion of the £200,000 would be expended in dollars and how much of it would be paid in sterling either to staff here or in respect of services paid for directly from the Dublin office from sterling sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>He did.  He said the bulk of it would be in dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially the bulk of it may be in dollars.  He then went on to say that it was proposed to pay a sum of $5,800 dollars in respect of Skymasters and a sum of $10,193 in respect of Constellations for each flight.  On the basis of the traffic available it was estimated, according to the figures given, that next year the total trips between Ireland and the United States of America and vice versa would result in 20,000 to 25,000 passengers or passenger flights.  Of that traffic Aer Línte and Seaboard and Western would have to get half to make a profit of £64,000; if they got 10,000 or less they would make a loss of £48,000. These figures make it more and more difficult to understand the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to the fact that if the agreement was not completed by the introduction of the Constellations before a certain date&mdash; I think it is 1st March, 1955&mdash;there was provision for its termination.  If, for any other reason, Aer Línte decided it was in their interests to terminate the agreement before that date they would be obliged to pay a penalty of $100,000. All these matters might be easier to understand if we had before us the full terms of the agreement and I <Col N="1202" /> think it is quite unreasonable to ask the Dáil to vote this Supplementary Estimate on that basis for this is a Supplementary Estimate presented to the Dáil for the payment of a subsidy to Aer Línte Teoranta in accordance with the Air Navigation and Transport Acts to cover losses in connection with transatlantic air services.  This proposal is presented to the House on the basis that there is available in the United States of America a vast volume of traffic which for some reason or other will be prepared to use an Irish service or a service operated under the Irish flag and with the markings and insignia of Aer Línte.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that traffic from the United States of America to Europe has increased in recent years and that up to the moment the traffic at peak periods certainly exceeds the number of flights available.  It is equally true, however, that competition in recent years has grown more and more intense and that every year more vigorous efforts are being made as between one season and another to attract traffic by means of lower freights and other inducements of that nature and, in the case of some of the better known lines, by the provision of tourist traffic rates over extended periods of the year and tourist traffic rates are now operating over a greater part of the year than was previously the case.</P>
    <P>All these considerations indicate that the guiding principle as far as the public is concerned is to get cheaper fares and to have available, irrespective of the amenities of the service, cheap fares across the Atlantic.  We have had no indication in the Minister's speech or in the references he made to the proposals contained in this agreement that it will be possible for Aer Línte or for Seaboard and Western Airlines to provide cheaper travelling facilities than any of their competitors. It is common knowledge with anyone who has followed the affairs of transatlantic air companies that the American companies have the advantage of a substantial concealed subsidy. That subsidy is provided in a variety of ways but it is generally provided by the payment of what is known as mail <Col N="1203" /> contracts.  It is common knowledge that these companies have in some cases and on particular routes made a profit but that, by and large, substantial losses have also been incurred and these losses have been made good by means of this concealed or disguised subsidy.</P>
    <P>We have been told, and I think it is true as far as general knowledge goes, that Seaboard and Western Airlines has a satisfactory record but its activities have been confined in the main to a particular type of service. Leaving aside entirely the question as to whether it will provide the type of service the public expects on a transatlantic air route, the main consideration from the point of view of the travelling public is whether it will be possible for this company to provide a cheaper service than that provided by its competitors and, if so, will it be possible on the basis of that cheaper service to make a profit?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us different figures and different estimates on the basis of the particulars supplied in the agreement but it was not possible on the information he gave to assess what the prospects of this company or service may be in the future.  The only estimate that was made was that in the first two years it would make a loss. The amount of that loss has not been specified.  The Minister said that it was proposed to limit it to the expenditure of the sum of money that is available after the sale of the Constellations and other equipment and, whatever may be the result, when that money is expended&mdash;if it is expended&mdash;the agreement will terminate. That means that if this agreement has not expired before the expenditure of the sum of money involved, difficulties will arise either for Aer Línte or for Seaboard and Western.  Under the penalty clause which the Minister says will become operative, Aer Línte will be obliged to pay a sum of $100,000 dollars if, for any reason, they cannot fulfil their part of the agreement before the expiration of the three years and nine months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite.  The penalty clause only becomes operative if it is <Col N="1204" /> for any reason within the control of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government refuse to vote more money it means that, at the end of the expenditure of a sum of £450,000, this proposed service will terminate.  I think that the particulars which the Minister has given all indicate that, even after the discussion here or even after this discussion has started, consideration should be given to the terms of the agreement and to making it available to Deputies&mdash;certainly those parts of the agreement which are necessary in order to assess accurately the full significance of this proposed arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister's statement that the office staff, the booking arrangements, and so on, which the proposed service envisages will be provided by Aer Línte.  That will mean the establishment of an office in the United States of America, the staffing of that office and, I assume, the payment in dollars of the staff concerned. On that, it seems to me that very careful consideration will have to be given&mdash;assuming that this proposed agreement is implemented&mdash;to the type of publicity which is indulged in or the type of advertisement that is undertaken by Aer Línte.  I do not know who was responsible the last time for the publicity arrangements but certainly some of the publicity in some of the American journals reflected no credit on this country and no credit on the outlook which whoever was responsible had on the Irish people.  I do not know whether the publicity which was in the <i>New Yorker</i> was widely. disseminated in America.  If it was or if publicity was undertaken in other journals comparable to that which was given in the <i>New Yorker</i>, then I hope that whoever was responsible will have nothing whatever to do with the publicity that may be given in respect of this proposed service.  I do not think that any persons in America&mdash;certainly no volume of travelling passengers&mdash; will travel on an Irish airline merely for sentiment.  If it offers the same or better terms than another line then certainly they will be attracted to it. If the terms are equal to those provided <Col N="1205" /> by other air companies it may attract passengers who have Irish connections. To think, however, that people will travel on an airline merely for sentiment or, for that matter, that people will travel on any other type of passenger service whether it be a shipping service or a railway merely because it has Irish connections or because it is operated under the Irish flag is to refuse to face realities.  With few exceptions, people always travel on the cheapest service which gives the type of convenience and the amenities which they expect.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the reasons why this service is proposed is that it is for prestige purposes.  That was the phrase used in connection with the service that was abandoned in 1948. Again, I think there are limitations to the extent to which a small country should indulge in expenditure for prestige purposes.  There are some services&mdash;some proposals&mdash;which any country must undertake for prestige purposes but there are certain types of expenditure that no small country can justify merely for the sake of prestige.  I do not think there is any merit in the suggestion that a transatlantic air service operated by an Irish air company should be embarked upon merely for the purpose of prestige. One might as well suggest that we should indulge in a vast and expensive rearmament programme.  There might be a far stronger case for such expenditure than there would for a proposal to establish an airline merely for prestige purposes.</P>
    <P>This proposal differs from the establishment of an entirely Irish airline in so far as the aircraft and crews, with the exception of the passenger-handling crews, will be provided by Seaboard and Western Airlines.  It is, I think, a matter of regret that, if a scheme is proposed, the Irish personnel will be confined to the passenger-handling end of it.  It may be argued that if we had our own airline and that if we had our own service fully manned it would be possible to avoid this.  I do not think that the employment content in an airline of this sort is anything that would warrant public expenditure on the scale that is proposed <Col N="1206" /> here.  The employment content in it is comparatively small and the expenditure in relation to the volume of employment provided&mdash;unless the company operate on a very extensive scale&mdash;must be considerable in relation to the number of persons employed. Therefore, the argument that there is available employment prospects for skilled Irish personnel is, I think, merely an exaggeration and does not reflect accurately the position that will arise.  I think, however, it is right to say that, in so far as all services operated by Irish companies are concerned, the standard of efficiency, the skill and the entire service has been up to the highest standard of any airline in any part of the world.  The fact that it has been possible to provide that service reflects credit on all concerned with the development of civil aviation.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anyone would for a moment suggest that the services provided by Aer Lingus &mdash; the crews, the staff of the offices at Dublin, Shannon or elsewhere, and the whole management of that concern &mdash; are anything but such as would deserve the highest testimony from anyone who has had experience of them.  It does not in any way reflect on the efficiency of the service to say that we consider that it is entirely wrong, in present circumstances, to propose a transatlantic air service.  If conditions were different here, if general economic circumstances were better, if we could say that there were conditions of full employment, if it were possible to lighten the burden of taxation on the people, if budgetary considerations did not make it more and more difficult for all sections of the people to meet their commitments, then it might be appropriate and the Dáil might consider a proposal of this kind.  We believe that, in the light of the present economic and financial situation&mdash;in a year in which more and more burdens by way of direct Government action have been placed on the people of the country&mdash; it is quite out of keeping to propose a service of this kind.</P>
    <P>I know that this matter has been the subject of controversy in the past, that it is not possible perhaps to consider <Col N="1207" /> it in an entirely detached way or to approach the proposal on its merits, but there seem to me to be insufficient data provided on which Deputies could take an entirely detached view and consider the proposal merely on the basis of the estimated results, as indicated by the estimates made by those directly concerned.  Even on that view, it is not possible to get a picture which would reflect confidence in the establishment, from an economic point of view, of a transatlantic air service.  The year ahead, as far as one can judge, from Government statements is going to be a year of more and more difficulties, economically and otherwise, for the people of the country.  If that is the economic position as outlined by the Government, and if the conditions or suggestions contained in ministerial statements are justified, then it seems to me this is the wrong time to initiate proposals for a transatlantic air service.</P>
    <P>The proposed agreement has not been made available and, as far as one can gather from the remarks of the Minister, further information cannot be given in view of the fact that the agreement is one between two commercial undertakings and that it might in some way damage the commercial prospects of the proposed airline to make information available to competitors. It is, however, only right that the House should expect full details of this agreement, full details of the material terms so that it can decide on the agreement, on the proposals in it and what the prospects are.  So far as the estimates which have been given to the House are concerned, it is expected that in the first three years the proposed airline will run at a loss.  It is expected that if the full expenditure provided for under this arrangement has not been exhausted it will then be possible to run it at a profit.  If, on the other hand, that money is expended the agreement will terminate.</P>
    <P>I do not think the agreement has anything in it which would commend it to this House or anything in it which would commend itself on a commercial <Col N="1208" /> basis because the terms which were given indicate that there is a minimum limitation of two flights per week which must be paid for by Aer Línte.  On the assumption that traffic will decrease during the off season there is no expectancy that the increase in traffic during the peak season will result in a profit.  It is stated, according to the anticipated figures for next year, that approximately 20,000 to 25,000 persons will travel to this country from America or from this country to the United States of America and that half that traffic will be handled by this company, but unless the air service provided by this agreement can provide transport at lower rates than those provided by their competitors, then it will be unreasonable to expect that half that traffic will be handled by this company.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is reasonable to expect the House to pass this Supplementary Estimate on the basis that the company must get half the estimated traffic of between 20,000 to 25,000 passengers next year.  If it did that, it would make a profit of £64,000 but if it gets less than 10,000 passengers a year it will make a loss, according to the Minister's figures, of £48,000.  It is impossible on the information available to work out how that estimate is made up or to decide on what basis it has been arrived at. Anyone with any experience of a transatlantic service will agree that it would be entirely unreasonable to expect this company to get half, or more, of the total number of passengers travelling, unless the company can provide a cheaper service and give the same amenities as their competitors. I understand that it is proposed to provide what is known as a tourist rate for passengers.  That depends again on the number of passengers anxious to avail of that type of service.  Although the indications are that the numbers availing of tourist rates are increasing, unless passengers can get some additional benefits by reason of the rates charged or by reason of some other amenities or facilities, certainly very few will be prepared to avail of this service in preference to any other service.  I do not think there is anything which this <Col N="1209" /> proposed service can provide which would make it more attractive to tourists than the service provided by their competitors.  If there is, it may succeed in getting the larger share of the traffic.</P>
    <P>I think in present circumstances, on the basis of the proposals outlined in the Minister's introductory speech it is impossible for the House to accept this proposal.  While we have been assured that it is not proposed to commit the country or the Exchequer to further expenditure over and above the sum of £450,000, one result of the termination of the proposed service in 1948 was that the Exchequer benefited to the extent of £450,000.  If that sum were proposed to be expended on a project which would give indications of a better return than this one, then I believe there would be support in this House for the proposal but on the basis of experience of transatlantic air service and on the basis of the indications which were given in the Minister's introductory speech, it is impossible to accept the suggestion that it will be possible to limit the expenditure to the sum of £450,000.  We have got then either to terminate whatever the existing arrangements are at the end of a certain period or we have got to incur further expenditure.  One of the big difficulties with any service of this sort is that, once you go a certain distance, you have got to go further. I think it is better not to go any distance rather than nibble at it and then find yourself in the position that you have got either to curtail further developments or to incur further expenditure by the provision of direct State assistance.</P>
    <P>There are various proposals under consideration for the development of tourist traffic.  These proposals we hope will result in an increase in traffic but from the statement made by the Minister there is no proposal inherent in this agreement which will attract to this country, by means of this airline, increased traffic resulting in any profit to the company concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we are opposed to this proposal in existing circumstances. We do not see anything in it which <Col N="1210" /> would justify the expenditure of money that is already available.  It was provided from the sale of aircraft that we had already acquired and had accrued in the benefit of the Exchequer.  If it is now proposed to expend this money, it will involve the Exchequer in outlay that cannot offer any prospect of an adequate return in exchange for it. The fact that it is proposed to expend this sum of money is merely an indication that further losses will be incurred, that the Exchequer will be obliged to bear further demands and that the public, in turn, will have to bear further burdens in order to maintain the proposals in this agreement which, of course, depend on the sanction of the Government for implementation.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which has been the subject of considerable controversy, and nothing which the Minister has said in his opening speech, or in the concluding parts of it, would justify the expectation that it can be otherwise than controversial or the subject of opposition by those who believe that there is anything in the proposal which would justify the Exchequer of this country being committed to this expenditure. We believe that the proposal is unwise in present circumstances, and that it is likely to be unprofitable.  We believe that there is no justification on economic, or indeed on any grounds, for the proposals outlined in the Minister's speech which would justify the implementation of the agreement proposed between Aer Línte and the American company.</P>

      <P>I welcome the attitude of the Minister in introducing this Supplementary Estimate because it is so seldom that one hears any appeal from the Government Benches for an objective examination of any problem.  It was, therefore, refreshing to hear his appeal.  It is, however, difficult to examine this proposition without having before one the actual terms of the agreement entered into between Aer Línte and the American company.  Therefore, it is very difficult to ask the House for its approval to an agreement which it has not actually seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate, however, the Minister's difficulty in the matter.  I do not make <Col N="1211" /> an issue of that, but I do think it is difficult to ask the House to approve of an agreement which it has not seen. My difficulty is this.  I am all in favour of a transatlantic air service provided we can make it pay.  I see no reason why we should subsidise such a service out of Government funds.  I am quite prepared to admit, immediately, that it may be necessary for the Government to provide the initial capital to ensure the development of such a service, but I think it would be highly undesirable that we should place ourselves in the position of subsidising transatlantic air traffic.  After all, let us be realists about it.  This traffic consists on the one hand of reasonably well-to-do tourists, Americans, or in a few instances, of Irish people who can afford to pay for their transatlantic passage either by airline or by ship.  I see no reason why we should subsidise their holiday period.  They are well able to pay for the service.  Likewise, I see no reason why we should subsidise American traffic, because undoubtedly portion of the west-bound traffic consists of Americans or people leaving the country.  I see no reason why, in present circumstances, we should undertake to subsidise that particular traffic.</P>
    <P>Therefore, my approach to the question of a transatlantic service is based entirely on whether or not we can make it reasonably successful.  It has often been argued that it was a dollar earner and produced dollar revenue for us.  That, of course, is quite fallacious.  The dollar content that may accrue from it is not only nonexistent, but I think would show a dollar deficiency.  From my recollection of the original proposals, 80 per cent. of the total expenditure would have to be paid in dollars.  Under the proposition before us, the dollar expenditure will probably be higher still because I take it that the crews of the planes are to be paid in dollars.  Therefore, I do not think it is unfair to the Minister to say that the dollar expenditure involved will be well over 80 per cent. of the total expenditure. Inversely, the revenue will not necessarily all be in dollars.  A great proportion of the revenue will come <Col N="1212" /> from people who avail of the service from this side of the Atlantic and who will pay in sterling and not in dollars.</P>
    <P>The main expenditure, of course, under the present proposal, as far as Aer Línte is concerned, will be in America &mdash; personal payments to the American Charter Company, 75 per cent. of which will be in dollars.  In the second place, there will be dollar payments in respect of passenger handling, ticket sales organisations in America as well as advertising, which will be a very heavy item of the expenditure, so that the net result will probably show a loss in dollars.</P>
    <P>I can understand many of the arguments put forward by the Minister in support of this proposal which at first sight may seem good.  It is one way of testing whether an Irish transatlantic air line would be a financial success, that it is a cheaper and easier way of initiating a transatlantic air service. I am not, therefore, sure that this is quite a sound proposal.  If this venture fails, and if, when the £450,000 is spent, this venture closes down, I am afraid that the venture will have damaged for good and all the prospect of a proper transatlantic air service.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider that aspect of the proposal very carefully. If the Minister were to come back in two years and say: &ldquo;I did give you an undertaking that there would be a limit of £450,000 to this venture.  The £450,000 is now drawn and I have to ask the Dáil to make more money available,&rdquo; he would be in a very difficult position and I think that any other Government coming forward with a transatlantic air proposal would find itself also in difficulty.</P>
    <P>When this matter was considered in 1948 my difficulty was that I could see little or no prospect of a service paying which was running simply between Shannon and New York via Boston and Gander.  I see little or no prospect of the present service paying for the same reason.  A company which runs two services a week in the off period and six services a week in the peak period has to maintain the same overhead organisation as a company which runs a regular service all the year round. The overhead cost will be the same. <Col N="1213" /> The advertising, the business organisation, the passenger-handling organisation will all have to continue throughout the whole year, irrespective of whether the number of passengers carried is 50 or 500 a week.</P>
    <P>It also occurred to me that the only way we could enter the transatlantic air traffic was to be in a position to run an extended service running through to a portion of Europe, running possibly an alternative service to Rome and Scandinavia, possibly two or three services a week on that basis systematically during the whole year, and that it would not be limited to Boston and New York.  It is a little bit the same problem as we have to face in connection with the cutting off of branch railway lines here.  The branch lines may be uneconomic in themselves but they have to feed the main line.  The big air companies, such as T.W.A. and Pan-American, are able barely to keep afloat on the transatlantic air service by reason of the fact that they have extended services which feed into the transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the position of the average American tourist who comes over to Europe.  He lives, for instance, in Washington, Chicago or San Francisco.  He is hardly likely to make two or three different bookings for his trip to Europe.  He will go to some company which can provide him with a through ticket from Washington, Chicago or San Francisco, giving him a stop in Ireland, then taking him on to London, Paris or somewhere else.  He is hardly likely to want to change planes in New York, then to find himself landed at Shannon and to have to take an Aer Lingus plane to London to carry on his journey.</P>
    <P>After the cancellation of the original transatlantic proposals, I did have a number of discussions with regard to the possibility of a joint service between an Irish company and an American company which had a world service.  I know that there are a great many difficulties in the way, but I think that that would be a more satisfactory proposal because in that way you could secure the traffic which the world company already had&mdash;at least secure <Col N="1214" /> a proportion of it &mdash; and you could avail of their sales organisation to handle the passenger traffic end of it in America, which is one of the costliest ends of the service.  The present arrangement seems to me to fall very far short of a proposal of that kind, because in the first place it leaves Aer Línte with the task of organising the sales and passenger handling service in America, which is one of the costliest ends of the business.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the type of organisation which it is proposed to set up in America, but on the last occasion the organisation which it was proposed to set up and which had been partially set up was on a very vast scale and it was extremely difficult to see how that organisation could ever pay.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider coming to some arrangement with some travel agencies to handle bookings in America.  I think it would be considerably cheaper.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister has considered all these aspects of the problem, but I do think that, from his point of view and from the point of view of any of us who may be anxious to see a transatlantic service developed in the future, these proposals are highly dangerous because, if they fail, and it is not unlikely that they will show a loss, then it will be very difficult ever to come before the House again with proposals for setting up a new transatlantic air service.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has considered all these aspects of the problem.  I am just as anxious as he is to see a transatlantic air service set up, but it must be set up on a financially sound basis.  I do not think this country can afford to subsidise a transatlantic air service.  I see no reason why it should. I do not think, from the point of prestige, it is of very much value to the country.  I think that the employment content is useful, but it is not such as to warrant any large expenditure of money and, therefore, the whole question must be approached from the ordinary financial basis and examined from the point of view of whether we can make it pay or not. If this present arrangement shows a <Col N="1215" /> financial loss at the end of two or three years and the £450,000 is spent, it will be very difficult to come back with any fresh proposals for a transatlantic air service.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat surprised yesterday when this Supplementary Estimate was under discussion by the views expressed by a section of the House, led in the main by Deputy Dillon.  I should perhaps say that it was a pleasant surprise to find Deputy Dillon adopting the rôle of socialist in this debate, because that is exactly what he was doing.  I gathered from the Minister's speech that he intends&mdash;and, in fact, it is the Government's proposal&mdash;to intensify and extend this land rehabilitation scheme, land project or whatever else it is called, and that in actual fact the project is being pushed forward with much more determination by the present Minister than it had been by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expressing the view that more satisfactory work could be done by leaving the machinery to private enterprise, the Minister announced that he proposed to sell or dispose of the machinery that had been accumulated by the Department of Agriculture under this project.  Apparently a sum of approximately £300,000 was paid for this machinery.  Deputy Dillon, in the course of the debate, referred to it as something like £2,500,000.  I think Deputy Dillon was proceeding on the old propaganda scheme that if you have a lie to tell, make it a big one. He was followed by every other Deputy of what I might term the &ldquo;Molly Maguire&rdquo; section of the Fine Gael Party with this £2,500,000. Deputy Dillon, however, for the purposes of this debate and for the purposes of using his exaggerated language in regard to the Minister, adopted the rôle of socialist, a rôle that he is not very well fitted for, and stated that this scheme should be run by the Government as a Government scheme.  I would certainly welcome <Col N="1216" /> Deputy Dillon's conversion to socialism if it were a genuine conversion but it is not; it is a conversion for the purposes of the moment, for the purpose of striking out at his successor and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>I can well imagine how the people right down the country, the solid old conservative element that has always been the backbone of and the mainstay of Fine Gael, must react to this attitude of Deputy Dillon and what I term his &ldquo;Molly Maguire&rdquo; supporters in the Fine Gael Party.  I am sure when they read the papers to-day they must be amazed and astonished at that attitude.  We had a perfect example of it in Deputy Giles's speech.  Deputy Giles started off by saying that he did not give two hoots how it was done so long as it was done.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Giles's speech; he may be contaminated at the moment.  Deputy Giles said he did not give two hoots who did it so long as it was done, and with that everyone would agree; and then he stated how important it was that it should be done by private enterprise for which he had the highest regard.  At that stage Deputy Dillon came into the House and Deputy Giles veered around until he finished up with an appeal to the Minister to maintain the machinery and run it as a Government concern because the project was too big, The Party that acts like that is running around in circles and has no fixed line on anything; and Deputy O'Sullivan is quite right; Deputy O'Sullivan knows that we have what I might call this &ldquo;Molly Maguire&rdquo; line being taken at the moment.</P>

      <P>If the other members of the Fine Gael Party want to adopt the socialist line, certainly that is something to be admired in them.  I wonder what Deputy Donnellan will think of this line; it is completely in conflict with his recent pronouncement in Limerick.</P>
      <P>However, these matters can be straightened out, I am sure, in due course.  I only intervened, as I say, for the purpose of drawing attention to the illogical attitude adopted by Deputy Dillon and his supporters on the Fine Gael benches.  If this land project or land reclamation scheme is the great scheme that it is supposed to be&mdash;and undoubtedly it has magnificient possibilities and potentialities&mdash;I think we should be concerned, as Deputy Giles so well said, about getting the work done.  Where the Minister comes in and says he is prepared to spend more money than Deputy Dillon spent, he ought to be congratulated on doing that.  Instead of the Minister being congratulated, Deputy Dillon has to find some argument with which to disagree with the Minister.  He wanted some peg to hang his particular cap on for the moment and he adopted the one to which I am referring.  Deputy Giles also said something in the course of his speech with which every Deputy will agree: where it is a question of doing good to the farmer, of rendering some constructive service to him, every Deputy interested in the welfare of the farmer should look at the matter not from the point of view of politics but from the point of view of sane, sound common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises here, is the land project to be continued?  Is the land rehabilitation scheme to be pursued? Is the land that is good to be made better and the land that is bad to be <Col N="1218" /> improved and made good land?  That is the vital question and obviously whoever happens to be Minister for Agriculture must be invested with some discretion in relation to the policy of his Department.</P>
    <P>The main question is, is the work being done?  Is it being done better than it was being done before?  I know very little about the machinery involved in this project.  I do not know what the life of that machinery is.  I do not know whether it has a useful life of five, ten or 20 years.  I think there are very few Deputies who have that detailed knowledge of the life of the machinery involved in this project.  If we spent £300,000 on machinery a few years ago that machinery cannot be worth that much to-day.  I think that is an elementary axiom particularly in regard to machinery of this type. Obviously one cannot hope to get £300,000 for that machinery if it is put on the market to-morrow.  I do not think anyone will make the case that we could.</P>
    <P>Several questions have been addressed to the Minister.  How does he propose to deal with this machinery?  Will he auction it?  Will it be sold to one individual?  Will it be sold in lots? Obviously again its disposal is governed by common sense and if an individual is fit to be Minister for Agriculture he ought to be fit to take a decision in relation to such a matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There ought, therefore, to be less of this petty harping and carping about what the Minister will do with the machinery or how he will dispose of it.  I would myself much prefer to see this land project developed as a State scheme under the control of the Minister with all the machinery owned by the State and all the men employed directly under the control of the State.</P>

      <P>That is what I would like to see&mdash;the machinery under the control of the Minister and the people working the machinery under his control also.  At the moment part of the scheme is under the control of the Minister and part is under the control of private contractors.  There is an element here which takes the line that it is better to have freedom under what they term &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; and from that point of view I can see the reasonableness of the Minister's decision that this machinery should now be sold to private contractors. Deputy Dillon took this excursion into socialism yesterday evening like the proverbial bear with the sore head. He took it because he is peeved and annoyed and for no other reason.  I would prefer to support a socialist project when it is put forward by people who believe in the principles of socialism and not when it is put forward because of peevishness, jealousy or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>Just before the adjournment last night Deputy Cowan waxed quite angry because Deputies on the Opposition Benches were speaking at such length on this Supplementary Estimate.  He has now spent, or perhaps wasted, a quarter of an hour contributing something which is of no help to the Minister in the matter under review.  It is simply criticism of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

He has tried every Party, even the socialist Party.  I do not know where the Deputy will finish up but we can have a pretty shrewd idea; on the next occasion he will not be required by any Party.  So far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned we will take no dictation from him or from anybody else.  We hold we have the right to stand up here at any time and present the views of our constituents in the manner in which we feel they would wish us to speak on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> When the land project was first inaugurated it was meant to be more or less complementary, or supplementary, to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If the schemes are to be properly carried out the two should work side by side.  It was the purpose of the Act to drain rivers and streams, to make way for the water that would eventually come from the fields and off the land.  Unfortunately the Government that introduced these two schemes was not sufficiently long in office to ensure their being carried out to such an extent that they would be made safe.  Both schemes passed through this House despite the vehement opposition of the coalition that now occupies the Government Benches.  It is the object of that coalition to spike the work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In the last financial year in which the inter-Party Government was in office there was allocated to my county, Kerry, under that Act a sum of £82,000.  In the first year after Fianna Fáil returned to office, with the aid of their so-called Independent supporters, the amount was reduced to £25,000, a reduction which nullified the whole scheme.  This year for Kerry there is only £24,000 odd and the sanction came too late to do any work at all.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which they are destroying the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  They are destroying it merely because they do not like it. They think it is too good.  Here they come again now to destroy the land project.  We were very glad when this Estimate was introduced that more money was going to be voted so that that project could be carried out with a greater degree of progress.  We were quite happy until the Minister reached the point where he informed the House that he proposed to sell the machinery.  I believe that is the real object of introducing this Supplementary Estimate.  Was it to improve the scheme or was it merely to provide an excuse for the sale of the machinery and render the whole scheme impossible of fruition?</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar that the two exponents of the Minister's new scheme should be two Deputies from <Col N="1221" /> Dublin City.  Of course, I realise that they should take an interest in anything that will improve the condition of the land because otherwise they would not get the food or the production which this country requires. Surely it is the duty of a Government to take every step possible to improve the condition of the land.  That can be done, in the first instance, only by proper drainage.  Full provision was made for the drainage of the land under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and under the land project &mdash; both of which schemes were inaugurated by the inter-Party Government.  So far as South Kerry is concerned I can say that very little progress has been made in the way of drainage under this scheme.  I do not know why Kerry has been neglected so much.  Thousands of applications have been sent to the Department in this connection.  I do not blame the officials: at all times they have been most careful and most helpful in regard to any applications or representations that were made not only in connection with drainage but also in connection with the type of machinery that might be required to carry out the various schemes.</P>
    <P>Judging by the list which was read out, it is rather peculiar that of all the units of machinery in the various counties in connection with this scheme, there is not one unit in Kerry. Why were some of the Kilkenny units not sent down to Kerry?  Why were they all required in Kilkenny?  If anything, this scheme was meant more for the type of land to be found in Kerry and along the western seaboard than for some other types of land.  That is the land we want to bring into production. I fail to see why farmers in the Midlands and the eastern counties should require such help in connection with the drainage of their land or the bringing of their land into production. They are big farmers.  They have good land.  I think they should carry out that work themselves.</P>
    <P>The present Government&mdash;by the attitude which they are now adopting and which, I suppose, they have adopted for some time past&mdash;have made provision only for the big farmers. That is how it will really work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> It is very strange that the 55,000 tons of fertilisers are still lying about here and there.  Why were these fertilisers not given, even for nothing, to farmers who require them?  Why were they not given out in some proportion or at least for a certain reduced price? The Department is holding on to these fertilisers and paying for their storage, re-bagging and so forth.  They are trying to make a profit on them.  Nobody can blame the farmers of this country for not buying them because of the excessive price.  Why does the Government not subsidise the fertilisers?  Any money spent on the improvement of the land by way of drainage and fertilisation to make it fit for production is money well spent.  Such action would receive the wholehearted support not only of the farming community but of the people of the country in general.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in areas where private enterprise has failed to produce ground limestone and where, at the same time, vast quantitiese of limestone exist the Government does not take it upon itself to set up a company and supply the necessary machinery for the production of ground limestone.  It would save money eventually.  Imagine the plight of people in South Kerry who require ground limestone.  They have to get it from Buttevant which is more than 100 miles away while there are vast quantities of the finest limestone available in the Kenmare-Kilgar-van area.  Owing to lack of capital and because private enterprise cannot be induced to produce the ground lime-ston, the limestone in the area is not worked even though the farmers are crying out for lime and fertilisers of all kinds.</P>
    <P>When applications are made for the drainage of land and when the local officer of the Department decides to inspect it and to make a survey of it, I think it would be a good idea if the Department sent a note to the applicant advising him beforehand that his land will be inspected on a certain specified day.  Frequently it happens that when the local officer calls the farmer is absent at a fair, a market or somewhere else.  If the Department issued instructions to their agricultural overseers to send a note to the farmer <Col N="1223" /> advising him of their intention to inspect his land it would ensure his presence and would make it easier for the official and for the farmer.</P>
    <P>I notice that the ground limestone subsidy has been increased by £150,000 because of the increased cost of delivery.  That increased cost will come, eventually, as a result of the increased motor taxation.  Any time taxation is increased, either directly or indirectly, it will work in the same way.  In this case the increase must be borne by the taxpayer.  The Irish taxpayer must also bear any losses incurred on the sale of the Government machinery.  It is very strange that, when making his statement concerning the sale, the Minister did not tell us the method by which the machinery will be sold.  Will it all be collected together at some place and then auctioned?  Is it possible that a number of people could combine and buy the whole lot and form one company and thus create a monopoly?  It is quite possible that all this machinery may be bought by individuals in one part of the country.  In that event, what is the rest of the country to do?  What will happen Kerry?  One can understand that a contractor will not buy the machinery in order to help the Department of Agriculture or for the benefit of the Irish farmer.  He will buy the machinery to make a profit for himself. Can the Minister prevent the purchase of the machinery by a person or persons in one particular area, to the neglect of the rest of the Twenty-Six Counties?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when this machinery is purchased and when the Government will no longer have any control over it, do you think that the Minister will order a contractor that he is to do work in a certain place or that he need obey, if he is so ordered?  He certainly need not or he will not.  Once the Department of Agriculture disposes of this machinery and gives it into the hands of contractors, all its control over the land project is gone. Nobody objected to a local person or to a number of local persons combining to purchase the necessary machinery to carry out this work at a profit to <Col N="1224" /> themselves and for the benefit of farmers but, knowing that the Department had also machinery and had control of the necessary machinery to carry out such work, these people had always to be careful and knew that they could not demand an exorbitant price to carry out any drainage entrusted to them.  Now when such contractors have a free field, they will probably eventually create a ring and the Minister must come along later and try to smash that ring.  There is no way by which he can smash it except to get machinery again under the control of the Department to carry out work in competition with these contractors.</P>
    <P>When the machinery at present in the hands of the Department is sold completely and when the contractors who purchase it require replacements or new parts for the machinery, where will they get them?  Who is to import them?  Is it the Minister or must they do it themselves?  You can imagine all the delays that will be caused when an individual or a company has to approach the Department to obtain a licence to import that machinery.  You can imagine all the red tape that will be involved.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that men who were trained to use this machinery, who had acquired all the necessary technical knowledge and felt that they had had a safe and secure livelihood for years to come, must now leave that work and go back to join the ranks of the unemployed.  Did the Minister think of that when he agreed to sell the machinery because this decision to sell the machinery must have been a Government decision?  I cannot believe that the experts of the Departmnt, good as they are, would recommend the sale of this machinery to the Minister. The farmers of the country were perfectly satisfied with this scheme; the only complaint they had was that the work was too slow.  Owing to the shortage of labour which exists in many areas farmers could not find sufficient labour for the large schemes which they were anxious to undertake. Their only hope was that at some time in the near future the Government would send along their machinery and their men to carry out the work.  You <Col N="1225" /> can imagine what will happen when the contractors will have purchased the machinery, if anybody will purchase it&mdash;and I hope they do not.  You can imagine what will happen if contractors are asked by a small farmer to come along to drain an acre or two of land and somewhere in the neighbourhood, in the same county or in an adjoining county, there is a big farmer who wants to drain 20 acres of land. Where will the contractor go?  For his own benefit he will go to the large farmer.</P>
    <P>What is going to become then of the small mountain farmers down in Kerry and along the western seaboard?  Has the Government any feeling at all for those people?  They passed the Undeveloped Areas Bill to fool the people and they left it there.  It is not working nor can it be worked.  If they want to improve the conditions of the people living in the undeveloped Gaeltacht areas along the western seaboard, the best way to achieve that is to afford them facilities to enable them to bring the type of land they have into full production by drainage and fertilisation. The move of the present Minister is to put all that aside.  So far as I can see, there are now no hopes that anything will be done for the districts to which I refer.  Mind you, it has been said already and it will be said again, that to anybody who knows the past attitude of Fianna Fáil there is something sinister in this whole scheme.  I can imagine certain interests coming together to purchase this machinery.  If you like I shall name them&mdash;Fianna Fáil clubs.  They interfere in everything, be it only the division of land or the appointment of a ganger.  Not only will they get control of this machinery but they will go around and certainly help their own first.  God help anyone in opposition to them.  I want to say that and I do not mind where I say it.  Past experience tells us that.  It is therefore too bad that this scheme for which we had such great hopes should be interfered with in the way it has been by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that the Fianna Fáil Party hated it.  By the way, it is regrettable that Deputy Cowan, who hailed it here with such enthusiasm <Col N="1226" /> when it was first introduced and who shouted across the floor of the House: &ldquo;We shall fight a general election on that scheme&rdquo;, should now support this proposal.  Look where he is to-day. Such is the way of all weathercock politicians, especially when they must watch and mind their own skins. We on this side have perfectly independent minds about all these matters. We want nothing for ourselves.  We do not take up the attitude of speaking in a particular way on any matter in order to gain a few votes here and there because, as I have often said, we believe in honesty in public as well as in private life.  On behalf of my constituents I certainly say that any increased Vote introduced by the Minister to enable further progress to be made under the land project will be welcomed by us.  I hold that the Minister has no right to get rid of this machinery which belongs to the people.  It was bought by the taxpayers' money.  Certainly, a Minister in the Government which is kept in office by the votes of a few irresponsible Deputies who were really elected under false pretences, has no right to do that.</P>

      <P>It is seldom in this House, when a Minister for Agriculture comes forward with a Supplementary Estimate to increase his Vote, passed last April, by an additional sum of £1,500,000 for the purpose of improving agriculture and of making grants to farmers that we have had such an exhibition as we had all day yesterday and from 6 o'clock this evening from the chief Opposition Party. I began to rub my eyes when I heard some of the Deputies opposite oppose the Minister's proposal to provide an extra £1,500,000 for the purpose of providing lime and fertilisers, for paying direct labour, for the purchase of material for drains and fences as well as for the payment of contractors under the land rehabilitation scheme. As I say, I rubbed my eyes and wondered where we were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief complaint seems to be that the Minister proposes not to organise machinery for the carrying out of this work in future.  It is not long since I heard two farmers discuss ways and <Col N="1227" /> means of getting increased tillage, of getting more wheat and beet grown. The suggestion was that the Minister for Agriculture should organise ploughing teams, that he should go in and plough up land and grow more wheat, potatoes and other crops.  I suppose those two men got that idea from this scheme that the Minister and his predecessor had in operation of providing machinery for the draining of land.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is taking a wise step at this early stage in the life of that scheme in not proposing to continue to organise machinery at a cost to the community that, in my opinion, would be at least double what it would be if the machinery were in the hands of private individuals.  I have not the least doubt that, with the machinery in the hands of farmers' sons, the cost of the work done will be at least 50 per cent. less than it would be if done by any organisation which the Minister could provide.  I am surprised that the Deputies opposite did not welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the grants to farmers who carry out their own drainage.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal, as announced yesterday, is to increase the grants to be given to farmers who organise the drainage of their own land themselves and carry it out by their own organised labour, the workers to be paid by the farmers themselves.  Do the Fine Gael Party object to that?  Do they object to the farmers getting grants equal to those given to farmers who get the work done by the Department of Agriculture? We had a Deputy speaking here this evening about the small farmers of Kerry and along the western seaboard. I am quite sure they will be very pleased indeed when they learn that they are going to get substantially increased grants from the Department of Agriculture for the improvement and drainage of their own land.  The Minister, as I have said, has taken a wise step by giving the opportunity to small and medium sized farmers, and indeed to every type of farmer, to organise labour themselves for this work, to employ their own sons on it, or to engage workers to carry out this drainage work on their farms.  Surely, there is nothing wrong about that.  In addition, they are going to get substantially increased grants for doing it. In spite of that, we have had nothing in the nature of intelligent criticism from the Opposition of the Minister's proposal.  Indeed, their opposition is based on deliberate prejudice and hate. There can be no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sum of £1,500,000 extra is for the drainage of land, the provision of ground limestone and for other work connected with the land.  The farmers are going to benefit by that proposal. The Minister has indicated that, in future, he will not organise teams of machinery.  I agree with that, and I think it is about time that farmers' sons and other people were encouraged to do this work themselves.  I should like to emphasise this point, that under this Supplementary Estimate, £500,000 will have been paid out by the Department of Agriculture to contractors before one wheel in the machinery <Col N="1229" /> that there is so much talk about here has been sold.  That sum of money will have been paid to them for using their own machinery on the work.</P>
    <P>Do the Deputies object to contractors buying and owning machinery to do this work?  Do they object to private enterprise?  Do they object to any group or to any individual in this country owning private property, whether it be machinery for this rehabilitation scheme or for anything else?  That is what one would gather from the Opposition &mdash; that they do.  We hear a lot of talk sometimes from the Opposition about the trends of socialism in this country.  Well, if some of them were pink socialists in the past, they have become blood red socialists in the last few days&mdash;that is, judging by the line they have taken on this matter.  It is high time that they fully appreciated the line they are taking. If the Minister for Agriculture goes on organising these plants in all the counties which need them, in time he will find himself with an organisation that would be colossal and the cost of running and maintaining these expensive machines in the hands of State servants would be very great. In my opinion that is most undesirable. We have heard a lot of whining during the last two days about the selling of these few machines.  There are far fewer machines in the hands of the Department of Agriculture than in the hands of private individuals at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of people were prepared to buy this machinery but for the fact that the Department's machines were operating in certain areas and would injure their chance of getting employment if they had these machines.  Many persons were prepared to put their capital into machinery and operate it.  Is that what the Opposition are objecting to?  It would look as if they do not want more private persons to own property in this country and earn their own livelihood <Col N="1230" /> instead of earning it in State employment. In my opinion, what is wrong in this country is that there are too many people in State employment. This will be a breath of fresh air blowing in the right direction.  The Minister has decided to get rid of some of the organisation which his predecessor set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As was pointed out, much more land will be drained owing to the improved grants to be given to the farmers for carrying out their own drainage under this proposal.  The Minister mentioned yesterday that he proposed to equate the grant to the farmers in future with that paid to persons for whom the Department will carry out the work.  I suggest to the Minister that, while there is a limit to what the farmer will pay for an acre of land being drained by the Department, he should take into consideration the additional cost to the Department of the rehabilitation scheme up to now for the drainage of land.  There is no doubt that it would cost the Department 50 to 100 per cent. more than it would cost the farmer to get his own work done.</P>

      <P>In equating these grants for persons who propose to carry out the work themselves the Minister should take into consideration the amount per acre which it has cost the Department up to now to drain land. It was stated that doing away with this machinery will be to the disadvantage of small farmers.  The burden of the complaints which I have heard since the scheme came into operation was that the small farmers were not getting any service from these machines, that it was on the larger farms that the work was being done. Numbers of farmers have come complaining <Col N="1231" /> to me that because they had a small job to be done or had only medium-sized farms they had no hope of getting the Department's plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the tendency of the Department was to do work on the larger farms where the bigger job was to be done; that they probably found it more economic to do a substantial job.  That is the only explanation I can give.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of drain pipes was mentioned.  In reply to a question to-day, the Minister stated that it was necessary to import about 5,000,000 drain pipes a year.  I suggest to the Minister that if he indicated to the present manufacturers of these burnt-clay drain pipes that, in the foreseeable future, there would be a market for all the pipes they could produce, they would increase their output and other plants would come into production.  It is a pity that it is necessary to import 5,000,000 drain pipes a year when we have ideal material for making them in this country.  The only cost would be for digging it out of the ground.  Something should be done in that direction by the Minister.  He should encourage in every way possible new people to set up plants for the production of these pipes and the present plants could double their production.  If some of them had an assurance from the Minister that, for some years to come, say five or ten years, all the <Col N="1233" /> drain pipes they could turn out will be needed in the country, I have reason to know that they would provide the extra capital and produce the necessary pipes.</P>
      <P>I noticed in the Minister's statement yesterday that he was estimating that something like £450,000 would be necessary to pay the carriage on ground limestone next year, that is, on an output of about 550,000 tons, representing almost £1 a ton.  I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to organise further lime-grinding plants in this country so as to obviate wasteful transport charges on ground limestone at the present time.  To my knowledge, ground limestone has been drawn 100 miles at least.</P>

I want to suggest to the Minister that it is time some move was made to encourage people to put up grinding plants in the immediate vicinity of where the lime is required and thereby avoid this wasteful expenditure on drawing limestone where the man who produces and grinds it is paid about 16/- a ton while it costs nearly £1 a ton for its transport. That is very uneconomic considering how badly the land needs the <Col N="1234" /> lime.  I suggest to the Minister that it is uneconomic to pay £4 10s.&mdash;it is the State and ultimately the community who pay for it&mdash;for the transport of a lorry load of lime only costing the same amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping very close to the rails.  There is another matter I mentioned before in this House and it is no harm to mention it now.  Persons who are grinding their own lime, who own lime grinding plants and who have a transport system of their own when these subsidies came into operation, are not allowed under a regulation, I understand, made by Córas Iompair Éireann to replace those lorries.  It is an extraordinary thing in this year 1952, that if a man owns a lorry for the purpose of drawing lime that he has ground himself he is not allowed by Córas Iompair Éireann to replace that lorry.  There are some of those lorries on the roads drawing lime which are almost worn out, and which are not fit to be on the roads and are a danger to the community. The Minister should by now have that matter examined and not have Córas <Col N="1235" /> Iompair Éireann set up a dictatorship to pay the subsidy to whomever they think well of.  I have heard recently of a gentleman&mdash;I have no objection to him personally&mdash;being asked to draw lime in County Dublin who never drew a ton of lime in his life, although the owners of lorries and lime grinding plants will not be allowed to replace their lorries by Córas Iompair Éireann. These men are warned that if they do no subsidy will be paid to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a sound policy because the land of this country is held by private individuals, and we all hope that will always be the case.  The so-called farmers who sit in offices in towns or in the city, and who hire the Department of Agriculture to do their drainage work on the farms, are not farmers to my mind.  They should be made to go out and organise men in the district, and pay them to drain their land.  I believe that all the drainage of land should be done by the farmers themselves.  Of course, it should be supervised and laid out by the Department officers, but the work itself should be carried out by the farmers in every respect.  I have no hesitation in advocating that, and I think it will be found to be the soundest policy in the long run.  It is the policy that suits this country, containing such a large number of small and medium-sized farms.  I believe this work can be carried out better by these people than by any Department. In my opinion, the small drainage works can be organised far better and <Col N="1236" /> on sounder lines and carried out more economically by these people than they can be carried out by any Department of State.</P>

      <P>I propose to be brief in my remarks on this Supplementary Estimate.  I notice in this House that the rôle of the Independent Deputy becomes harder each day when he rises to speak on any particular matter or Estimate that is under discussion.  It seems to me that the general impression amongst the people in the House is that you have to be an Independent tied on to the tail of some political Party or another.  It is not my job to defend the attitude or the outlook of any other Independent in this House, but I do say this, that it is very unfair for members of political Parties to criticise Independent Deputies for taking a line which they believe to be the correct one inside this House or outside it.  It is all very fine for some political Parties to suggest that the line that such and such an Independent takes is all right because the line happens to agree with their own particular views.  We found very recently that an Independent candidate in Dublin became very popular just because he represented the views of certain political Parties in this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to make it relevant in a moment.  The remarks I have to make are not dictated by any political Party.  We had Deputy Allen just now at great pains to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of getting rid of this machinery and allowing private enterprise full rein in carrying out the most desirable, essential and necessary work of land improvement.  In the same speech he criticised quite rightly, in my opinion, the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in suggesting that the Minister should keep this machinery although we all know beyond any shadow of doubt that there is no greater champion of private enterprise than the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen criticised that attitude in relation to the machinery.  Five <Col N="1237" /> minutes later he discussed the question of the production of ground limestone and he bewailed the fact that ground limestone has to be carried from the north of Ireland down to Wexford.  He more or less suggested that help should be given &mdash; I presume financial help&mdash; to interests in Wexford or in the south to enable them to set up their own lime crushing plants.  In my view he was there making a plea for State interference in connection with the production of ground limestone.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we have him asking the House to agree to a proposition that machinery should be put at the disposal of private enterprise and taken completely out of the control of the State and, on the other hand, we have him asking the State to help private enterprise to establish lime crushing plants.  I do not know what he wants or where he stands.  Neither do I know where the people on my left stand when they say that the machinery at present in the hands of the Department of Agriculture should be kept there.</P>
    <P>It is all most disconcerting to a Deputy in my position who, since my election to the House in 1948, has taken what I consider to be an outlook approaching very closely to that of the Labour Party's policy for many years.  Since becoming a member of this Assembly I have not seen eye to eye with either the present Government or the inter-Party Government on the question of agriculture.  I make no apology for saying that I have on repeated occasions criticised the policy outlined and pursued by Deputy Dillon while he was Minister for Agriculture.  That does not mean, however, that I criticise him on every aspect of his policy and there was one aspect with which I was in complete and thorough agreement.  That was the policy of land reclamation. I have the greatest admiration for Deputy Dillon for having introduced the land rehabilitation project.  That was a new departure in the development of Irish agriculture though there were some who maintained that it was merely an enlargement of the farm improvements scheme in operation under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>It was a much bigger scheme than <Col N="1238" /> that.  There was more vision behind it, and it encompassed a much wider area.  Although that scheme has now been welcomed and is now in operation under the present Administration, we had Deputy Dillon coming in here yesterday like some small boy and crying, because the present Government was taking a particular action of which he did not approve.  The Minister has stated clearly that it is the intention of the Government to carry out the land project and to increase work done under that scheme. It was quite evident when the scheme was introduced that changes in administration and improvements of one kind or another would take place as the scheme progressed.  I believe the Minister is sincere in believing that the change he proposes to make is an improvement on the scheme, and we should, if we are serious about the scheme, welcome it as such.</P>
    <P>All through yesterday I listened very attentively to the various speakers.  I was impressed by the manner in which Deputy S. Collins treated this subject. His contribution was non-Party, and it is very rare to get such a contribution here.  He dealt with the land project on its merits.  He was worried about certain aspects of the Minister's plan. He was worried as to whether or not the sale of this machinery might be detrimental to certain interests.  He was worried as to whether there was a likelihood or a danger that the interests of the smaller farmers would not be safeguarded.  He pleaded with the Minister to ensure that, whatever action he took, steps would be taken at the same time to safeguard the interests of the small farmer.  He also stated that there would be no opposition, and I presume he was speaking on behalf of his Party, to this Estimate from Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I was here during the debate and I hope it will not be <Col N="1239" /> suggested that I am misquoting Deputy S. Collins or any other Deputy. Deputy Collins had no sooner concluded than Deputy Sweetman came in and produced a motion somewhat contradictory of the statement made by Deputy Collins.  Listening to Deputy Sweetman it became apparent to me that it was his intention to oppose this Supplementary Estimate.  I listened carefully to the reasons he put forward for the viewpoint being adopted by the Fine Gael Party.  For a while he impressed me as a complete socialist but, knowing Deputy Sweetman, I felt that the cloak of a progressive did not fit comfortably on his shoulders, and I began to ask myself was he really serious about this land project or was he more concerned with scoring a petty political point at the expense of the Minister.  Let me say that I do not agree with the present Minister on many aspects of the policy he pursues. I have said elsewhere, outside this House &mdash; and this debate convinced me, if anything were needed to convince me &mdash; that Dáil Éireann is only a talking shop as far as the Irish farmer is concerned. We heard the present Government say that they would put plenty of machinery into the hands of small contractors in order to carry out land reclamation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Opposition side of the House the Fine Gael Party &mdash; I do not know what Party Deputy Davin belongs to &mdash; suggest that this Government should hold on to all this machinery, that the State should be the responsible body &mdash; in competition, I presume, with private enterprise&mdash; for carrying out the land project.  I do not want to repeat myself but, for the life of me, I cannot understand the mentality of an organisation or a Party which one day advocates private enterprise &mdash; a &ldquo;free for all,&rdquo;&ldquo;let every man take his chance,&rdquo;&ldquo;no State <Col N="1240" /> control&rdquo; attitude &mdash; and the following day bemoans the fact that the Government in office are taking steps to remove State control and to put into the hands of private enterprise the carrying out of the land project.</P>
      <P>In my own way, I have advocated the absolute necessity of State interference in many aspects of our life and with particular reference to the development of the West.  I am very much afraid that, by handing over completely to private enterprise the machinery that is available, the small farmer will not get the attention and the help that he deserves and needs. Deputy Allen stated in this House that it was found that work which was carried out by the Department could have been carried out far cheaper if that work had been left to private enterprise.  His impression of the working of this scheme up to the present was &mdash; and I hope I am not misquoting him &mdash; that the Department favoured doing drainage work on the larger holdings and bigger areas because they found it more economical to do the larger unit.  I think that that argument holds to a greater extent when we come down to the private contractors.  No private contractor to-day is a philanthropist.  No private contractor will do the work for the small farmer if he finds that he will get equal remuneration from the larger farmer and that he will not have the same amount of trouble in the way of removing the machinery from field to field.  That is the difficulty which I fear.  I should be glad to see, all through this, a quantity of machinery being kept in the hands of the Department so that where the private contractor fails to carry out his work the Department can step in and fill in the gap in the particular area concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any farmer down the country who took the trouble to read the report in to-day's paper of the discussion which took place in this House on the Supplementary Estimate will take one side or the other.  The majority of our farmers take a very active interest in politics. If Deputy Dillon says that black is white there are certain farmers down the country who will agree with him, and if the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, says that black <Col N="1241" /> is white there are other farmers down the country who will agree with him.</P>

      <P>To my mind the farmers of this country are equally divided in their political leanings.  If a Fianna Fáil High Priest advocates a certain line of action or policy it will be supported by a certain element in the farming community and if a High Priest of the Fine Gael Party outlines or advocates a certain policy it will be supported by a number of farmers. My point is that over the past 30 years both Parties had an opportunity of putting a sound and progressive agricultural policy into operation but that they have failed to do so.  We have seen agriculture stagnant in the past 30 years irrespective of what Government was in power.  We have seen the youth leave the land during the Fianna Fáil régime, during the period of office of the inter-Party Government and again during the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>

      <P>I hope I can relate all this to the statements made in this House yesterday by members of the various Parties who discussed this particular Supplementary Estimate.  On that, I think one of the reasons the land project was brought into operation was to increase the productivity of the land.  With your permission, I propose to speak of the necessity of increasing the productivity of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the amount of money in this Supplementary Estimate for the land project is for the purpose of increasing the productivity of the land.  I suggest that I am entitled to argue that the production which we should all like to see has not taken place and that I am entitled to put forward alternative ways by which that increased production can be achieved.  I have suggested that the trouble at the moment is that the farmer is bewildered by a variety of statements from different politicians and that he is not in a position to judge for himself whether or not the land project is as good as we believe it to be.  A report was issued in the past few weeks of a survey which was carried out by experts under the E.C.A.  Technical Assistance Programme. The report stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that the tempo of over-all accomplishment towards dynamic improvement will be severely handicapped so long as the agricultural segment remains static in real production terms.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it points out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is clearly important to the over-all economic progress of Ireland that effective steps be taken to lift the physical volume of agricultural output.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the land project <Col N="1243" /> scheme is there for that purpose.  The report further states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon the basis of present world outlook, agriculture should be able to find an export market for an expansion of its production of almost any dimension that was conceivable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, little or no progress is being made in regard to the value of the output.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. Surely as this Supplementry Estimate, in fact, covers artificial manures and ground limestone, the two ingredients essentially bound up with increased productivity, it is relevant to discuss the productivity of land under the Estimate?</P>

This Supplementary Estimate specifically refers to fertilisers and ground limestone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to argue the point with the Chair although I feel inclined to do so, from this point of view.  I cannot for a moment understand why this extra money is being made available or why the land project is in operation, if it is <Col N="1244" /> not to increase the productivity of the land.  If it is to increase the productivity of the land, I am entitled to discuss whether or not the productivity which we all desire to see achieved, is being in fact achieved.  I should like to put it this way, that even on the two or three points to which reference has been made in the debate, it is quite evident that we have not agreement in the House with regard to the lines that should be pursued. We are dealing with what is the most important aspect of our whole economy, agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am trying to show that if we have not got that concrete policy which is most essential to our economy then the productivity which we all desire to see achieved, we can never hope to see achieved.  What I should like to see, although I have no hope of seeing it in the near future, is a nonpartisan examination of our agricultural economy in order to plan a long-term policy on up-to-date lines for agriculture.  I shall not pursue that point any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer, in conclusion, to the question of the production of burned clay pipes for the land rehabilitation scheme.  I understand that, at the present time, we are importing a considerable quantity of these pipes. From information given to me, I am positive that the clay deposits in various parts of the country are ideally suited for the production of these pipes.  Seeing that we have no hope of the State going into the business itself, either under a Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil Government, if we had a guarantee that private enterprise would be helped in order to expand the production of these pipes, I think we would be enriching our economy as a whole.  I have not the exact figures, but I understand that a large amount is spent annually on the purchase of these pipes from abroad.  I wonder would there be a possibility of helping, under the Undeveloped Areas Bill, any group of individuals who might be anxious to embark on the production of these pipes?  That is all I have to say on this Supplementary Estimate. So far as my position is concerned, I have no desire to see myself tied to the tail of Fine Gael or to the tail <Col N="1245" /> of Fianna Fáil on any agricultural Estimate.  I only hope and trust that we shall see the day before long when both of them will forget Party politics and sit down and plan out a sound agricultural policy for the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably finds himself in a dilemma.  I think the situation in which he finds himself regarding the land project is that there is a vast number of applications from small farmers, and that for some reason or other he is not able to meet them.  He finds that the amount of machinery at the disposal of the land project authorities cannot cope with the number of applications received. In these circumstances he makes up his mind to sell the machinery.  I want to tell the Minister that he is making the blunder of his life in disposing of the machinery.  I hope now to make a few useful suggestions to him which have occurred to me over many months past. These suggestions, I trust, will explain where I think the Department and the Minister have failed to cope with the situation that has arisen.  I am not going to tell the Minister that the land project was the finest scheme ever introduced in this country.  That is unnecessary because it is undoubtedly the finest scheme introduced here for many a long day.  I think we are all proud of it, and I think the desire of everybody is to see the scheme going ahead.  The work that has been done, so far as I have seen it, is excellent work, and I am speaking now as a farmer myself.  I hope that every effort will be made to speed it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion I would make to the Minister is, first, that he should hold the machinery he has and continue the work he is doing with it.  I go further and say that he should increase the amount of machinery he has.  The second suggestion I would make to him is that he should make more liberal grants or loans available for farmers' sons to purchase similar machinery, and to set up as private contractors to help out the Department in their work. I think that, perhaps, a lighter type of machinery would meet the situation better in the case of these farmers' sons who set up as contractors.  I <Col N="1246" /> repeat that the Minister should hold the machinery he has, that he should increase it, if possible, and make grants and loans available to farmers' sons or others who are willing to purchase machinery and to engage in this land reclamation work.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a few questions.  The first is what guarantee has he, if he sells this machinery, that those who buy it will use it for land reclamation work?  From his speech yesterday, when he produced this bombshell in the House, one would imagine that the machinery after he sells it is going to be used by the purchasers for land reclamation work.  It may not be used for any such purpose. Some of it might be used for totally different work.  Once it is out of the Minister's control, the Minister will have no power to direct the use to which that machinery will be put, unless he wants to assume extraordinary powers.  The real trouble is that the grant has not, apparently, been sufficient to induce the ordinary farmer to undertake more land reclamation himself.  That is a thing which we should all like to see, so far as drainage is concerned.  Let nobody think for an instant that while many farmers may have drainage problems, their land rehabilitation would consist only of drainage and perhaps a dressing of ground limestone.</P>
    <P>A great many small farmers require land reclamation to be done on their farms which necessitates the employment of heavy machinery.  The low output of work is frequently due to the fact that there is not sufficient machinery to go round.  I am making these suggestions to the Minister, based on my own observation and of a good many intelligent farmers who have spoken to me on the subject.  Some of them are men who want work done on their own farms.  They made application a long time ago but have not succeeded yet in getting the work done. Others of them are interested in the job but had not any reclamation work to be done on their own land.  In my opinion it is a pity that there is not more machinery in the hands of the Department as well as more privately owned machinery which a farmer could employ himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The Minister is taking a step in the right direction when he proposes to give grants to induce farmers to undertake light drainage work themselves, such as the clearing of light scrub, which can be done by hand.  I hope he will not be niggardly about these grants, and will make them sufficiently remunerative to induce many more farmers to undertake this work themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the Minister: Suppose a group of farmers in a particular townland or area have between them a fairly big area to be reclaimed, or to be drained, will the Minister consider some scheme of making portion of the grant payable in advance to them so that they can employ a number of men with a ganger to do the work? I am thinking now of a job where the magnitude of it would be beyond the capacity of ordinary farmers and their families to undertake it themselves.  In Connaught, it is usual to get a valley of 40 or 50 acres, all of which would be in need of reclamation.  It might belong to five or ten farmers.  If the job is to be done properly it must be taken as one piece of work.  There would be no use in one man doing his particular part.  I suggest to the Minister that, if necessary, he should revise his scheme so that, where a job like that is done under a ganger, the grant should be made payable in advance to those farmers.  I think my suggestion is worthy of the Minister's consideration, and that if adopted by him it would go a long way to eliminate many of the complaints we hear.  Deputies from the rural areas are aware that when farmers see a good job of work done a few miles away from where they live, it whets their appetite to get a job done on their own land.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the work done has been excellent.  You will, of course, find a few grumblers here and there, the people who think they know how every Government Department should be run.  The work done, as I say, has been excellent.  Every acre that has been stolen from the growing of rushes, heather, briars, blackthorns and scrub and returned to production is an acre up for the country.  It is a magnificent <Col N="1248" /> help towards that increased agricultural output about which we so often speak here.  The selling of the machinery, however, will not help things.  I can see plainly that some of that machinery will pass into the hands of people who will not use it for the purpose of land reclamation.  Perhaps the Minister has some scheme in mind of lending or leasing this plant to private contractors under a repayable loan system.  If that is so the Minister can direct what type of work these machines will be employed on.  But if the Minister is simply going to put these machines up for public auction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then half the machines will, I believe, be used for a purpose other than land reclamation. I say that because the type of people the Minister would like to see buying the machines will not have the capital to do so.  I imagine that these machines would cost anything from £5,000 to £12,000.  Where is a man down the country going to get the capital or the credit to purchase one of them?  I think that the selling of this machinery is a disastrous step for the Department to take.  I wonder what my successor in the Department of Lands is going to do about similar machinery which I left in the Forestry Department.  Are they going to be sold, and is the forestry programme going to be jeopardised by having to depend on private contractors?</P>

      <P>It is a thought that flashed across my mind and one that disturbs me.  A number of Deputies have complained about the transport cost of ground limestone.  If it is true that lorries are carrying the limestone distances of 120 miles by road, then I suggest there is great wastage, and that the question is a very serious one. There are some counties in which, admittedly, limestone is scarce.  Where there is good limestone it should be developed by the Department.  The Department rightly demands a very high calcium content in the lime sold <Col N="1249" /> to farmers &mdash; I think something like 98 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all to the good.  In some areas it is not easy to get limestone with a high calcium content. I can speak from experience of a limestone quarry near Castlebar.  It supplies a huge area.  I believe that the calcium content of the limestone there is below what the Department would like, but in a case like that, where there is no other limestone available, and where the cost of bringing in limestone with a higher calcium content from another area would be prohibitive, perhaps the Minister would consider the provision of a suitable scale of subsidies, so that people would be able to obtain supplies.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the subsidy is, but let us assume it is 5/-.  If a man has limestone which averages 95 per cent. calcium content, lower the subsidy accordingly, but do not deny the people of a huge area the chance of getting limestone even though it may be a shade lower than the particular calcium content demanded by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be about 4,000,000 acres at present to be reclaimed and put back into production.  That can be done, and it is one of the best jobs that can be done.  One aspect of it strikes me forcibly, and that is, that doing away with the work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is completely hampering land rehabilitation in many ways.  Our object in introducing that Act was that it would facilitate land reclamation.  In many areas farmers were told that until such a river is cleared or such a drain is deepened, there was no use trying to reclaim the land.  The present Government have closed down on the operation of that Act.  It would seem as if they took no interest in drainage. I want to tell the Minister what the officials of the land reclamation project must have told him and what he must know if he is a practical farmer, that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was working hand in hand with the rehabilitation project and the Arterial Drainage Act.  These three schemes <Col N="1250" /> are interlocked and cannot be separated. That is plain common sense to anybody who knows the first thing about the matter.  Land rehabilitation is a big job; arterial drainage is a huge job; so is the work that should be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was introduced to facilitate the land reclamation scheme pending the coming into some areas of the arterial drainage scheme which is of necessity slow.  In view of the fact that we have, I think, 107 major catchment areas, there is a very big job before the board of works when they come to tackle arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the fact that, in spite of the vicious campaign carried out in this House and outside by the Party which is now in power against the land rehabilitation project, he is carrying on the work.  A most insidious campaign was carried on that this was a dodge on the part of the inter-Party Government to increase farmers' valuations and Fianna Fáil supporters were exhorted secretly not to touch it.  I hand Fianna Fáil the biscuit for the facility with which they can change face from one day to another.  It is astonishing to think that one and a half years ago they were going around the West of Ireland telling the people, &ldquo;Do not have anything to do with it; this is a dirty trick of the inter-Party Government to raise your valuations&rdquo;.  With the exception of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there is not a Deputy on the opposite side of the House who does not say that it was Fianna Fáil started the land reclamation scheme.  I give full credit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for admitting that it was Deputy Dillon's project.</P>
    <P>The proposed selling of this machinery is a disastrous step.  What the Department wants to complete the job is more machinery.  I think that grants and loans for the buying of a small type of machinery should be made available to farmers' sons who want to buy such plant.  If the Minister puts the machines up for public auction, once they are purchased by some firm outside, he knows that he cannot direct that these machines should be devoted <Col N="1251" /> to a certain type of work.  Once they are sold they are out of his control and I say that as much as 50 per cent. of them will not be devoted to land reclamation.  No matter how much the grants to farmers are increased for undertaking the work themselves, there is a certain type of reclamation which must be done by small farmers and nothing but heavy machinery can do that work.  If the machinery is not there, that type of work cannot be done.  I ask the Minister to bring the Local Authorities (Works) Act into full operation again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>His colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is responsible, but the Minister for Agriculture, as a member of the Government, has collective responsibility and his work under the land rehabilitation project is being hampered.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was designed for and was working hand in hand with the land reclamation scheme, and one cannot go on very well without the other.  I hope my contribution to the debate will be of some help and assistance to the Minister.  I ask him not to sell this machinery but to hold on to it and increase it.  If grants or loans were given for the purchase of machinery, that would induce young men to buy the machinery and help out the rehabilitation programme.  I am glad that the Minister proposes to give increased grants to farmers to undertake this work themselves.  As the scheme has only been a comparatively short time in operation, it has gone on very well.  I am proud to see it going on, and I hope nothing will be done to check it for many years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could reecho the hope which Deputy Blowick has expressed that nothing will happen to the land project.  It is because we feel that something has happened to it that we have raised in this debate the question of the sale of the land project <Col N="1252" /> machinery.  First of all, I should like to clear up a doubt which appeared to be in Deputy Allen's mind.  He sought to suggest that the Fine Gael Party were in some way doubtful about their attitude to this Estimate.  That, of course, is nonsense.  The Fine Gael Party and the Opposition generally welcome so much of this Supplementary Estimate as will be beneficial to the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>We do enter one caveat in relation to a matter not contained in the Estimate. I refer to the policy announced by the Minister in which he declared that he was going to sell by public auction the machinery which he holds as a trustee for the people of the State and which has up to this operated the land project.  It was because of that statement of policy that we moved the amendment to this Estimate.  It could not have been moved sooner, because the statement of policy is not contained in the Estimate itself and was only announced by the Minister when he spoke.  Naturally, we agree that whatever sum is required for fertilisers, for the limestone scheme, or anything of that kind, must be given.  But we do take issue with the Minister on the statement of policy to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I speak on behalf of my constituents, certainly in relation to the sale of this land project machinery, I should like to make some reference to the portion of the Estimate dealing with fertilisers.  It is true certainly of my constituency, and I am sure of the rest of the country, that tillage farmers find to-day that they are unable profitably to engage in tillage by reason of the high prices of superphosphate and fertiliser.  That has, undoubtedly, over the last 18 months, considerably retarded the tillage drive.  When the Minister for Agriculture comes into this House, as he did when moving this Estimate, and is compelled to admit that in a most unbusinesslike manner he purchased some 38,000 tons of fertilisers in the dearest market that it could be bought in, that his particular transaction has resulted in a loss to this country of £250,000, money that could have been available to subsidise superphosphate for every <Col N="1253" /> single tillage farmer in the country, it certainly is proper for us in the Opposition to express our dismay and surprise that that is the position. £250,000 has been lost by the Minister for Agriculture in the last 12 months.  That money could have paid rich dividends in the production of wheat, barley and oats.  It could have added substantially to the tillage drive of this country, but it has been lost, wasted, thrown away by some serious mismanagement in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Very often in this House, when dealing with millions of pounds, we are inclined to gloss over mismanagement in a Department occasioning loss to the people, and far too often we turn the &ldquo;Nelson eye&rdquo; on losses of this kind.  I do not think we should do it, and I think it is proper that we should expect from the Minister for Agriculture, when he is concluding, a very full explanation of how he came to lose £250,000 in the purchase of fertilisers in the last 12 months when every single farmer in this country is facing the highest possible price for the purchase of artificial manure and fertiliser, and the Minister himself has refused in any way to subsidise the sale to tillage farmers of the fertilisers that they do require.</P>
    <P>Having said that with regard to this serious item of loss which now has to be made good in this particular Estimate, I want to add my voice in protest with regard to this sale of land project machinery.  In doing so I would like to assure Independent Deputies, or any other Deputy in this House, that no one here has the right to lecture our Party or Deputies who support the inter-Party Government with regard to their attitude to the land rehabilitation scheme, which represented the hub of the development policy of the inter-Party Government.  It was carried through despite the doubts, despite the, at times, unfair propaganda of our opponents, and it represented for our people the assurance that an Irish Government was going to undo the neglect of centuries of foreign occupation and enable our people to produce more from the land.  It is a bit invidious to us on this side of the House <Col N="1254" /> that we heard Independent Deputies who, in fact, are passing through this House, trying to lecture us here on this side of the House with regard to the land project.  We do not need their lectures.  The people understand well the land project represents something so big that it cannot be destroyed by Fianna Fáil or anyone else, and that it represents a very important legacy which the inter-Party Government left to the farmers of this country.  But we do, as strongly as we possibly can, object to, and will oppose, any effort, concealed or otherwise, to wind up and liquidate that project.  That is what we believe is happening at the moment in connection with the declaration of policy by the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>We recollect that when the present Government came into office their tied political organ, the <i>Irish Press</i>, sounded the note with regard to the land project, which presumably represented the view of the inner circles of Fianna Fáil, when in an editorial of the 21st October, 1951, the <i>Irish Press</i> condemned the land project as costing too much, and not being the worthwhile capital scheme that we had held it out to be.  We knew the moment that editorial appeared that inside the ranks of Fianna Fáil some effort such as this would be made to whittle down, to strangle and slow down that land project.  Now it has come to this that some auctioneer with his hammer will sell off as scrap the machinery purchased with Marshall Aid held by our people and handed over to the present Minister as a trustee for our people. We are expected to accept that without a murmur, without opposition.  If we did so we would be letting down the majority of the people of this country whom we represent.  I know it has been expressed by other Deputies also that the auctioning of the assets of the Irish people and the Irish farmer by the present Minister for Agriculture is just the beginning of the end.  It is throwing the small farmer of this country out of any opportunity of getting land reclamation work done.  At the moment under the scheme as it now is one defect has been &mdash; and of course with any scheme there are particular defects &mdash; that there are <Col N="1255" /> so many applicants seeking work by the Department itself, there is such a queue calling upon the assistance of the Department that the Department finds it has not sufficient machinery to deal with all claims, and delay occurs in relation to applicants seeking the assistance of the Department.  The applicants in almost every case are the small working farmers who cannot afford to engage contractors to do the work for them.  It is that particular type of applicant who will now be told by the Minister: &ldquo;You need not come here any longer; we will not provide the service, the machinery and the staff given to your luckier neighbour&rdquo;&mdash; most of them apparently in County Kilkenny &mdash;&ldquo;who got this work done by the Department of Agriculture&rdquo;. These applicants will in fact be left out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister really considered this at all in any detail because, had he done so, he would have made a better case and he would have shown a better face.  He says that the sale of this machinery to contractors will result in the work being speeded up.  I do not know what he means by that or how he hopes it will be achieved.  Assuming that he will devise some scheme whereby existing contractors will be enabled to purchase this expensive machinery and assuming that he will prevent another serious loss to the Exchequer, what then will happen?</P>
    <P>We will probably have a number of contractors with a complete monopoly of all the necessary reclamation machinery.  That group of contractors will be charged with the execution of land reclamation.  Their work will be sanctioned by the Department of Finance and grants will become available to them when the work is completed.  They will start out to do the work at a particular figure, probably the figure now obtaining, and no difficulty will arise.  But, in 12 months' time, we will have a land reclamation contractors' association. That association will meet and will, at their meeting, add a little to the existing charge for land reclamation work. That will go from the Minister's Department to the Department of <Col N="1256" /> Finance and the Department of Finance will say: &ldquo;We will not sanction that; the figure we paid last year is good enough; we will not give any more.&rdquo;  The land reclamation contractors' association will say: &ldquo;Right.  You do not pay us and we will not do the work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There will be one of two results; either there will be no reclamation work or there will be reclamation work at a higher cost to the Exchequer. That is exactly the situation it was intended to avoid when Deputy Dillon devised the existing administrative machinery for the land project.  It was intended that private enterprise, on the one hand, and the State, on the other, would together carry out the work of land reclamation, neither having a complete service or a monopoly, and both being in a position to compete against one another so that a first-class service at a low cost would be assured.</P>
    <P>We now have the Minister coming along deliberately creating a monopoly and deliberately depriving his own Department of the power to ensure an efficient service at a low cost.  I think that is inexcusable.  I know that the Minister's announcement has caused a sensation in my constituency.  Time and again during the last six months I have raised by means of parliamentary question the fact that hundreds of applicants, all of them small farmers, seeking to have work done under the land project in Offaly have been unable to get that work done because sufficient machinery, they were told, is not available to the Department of Agriculture.  Those applicants will now have to wait till Tibb's Eve before they can get whatever contractor becomes the owner of the reclamation machinery in Offaly to do the work for them.</P>
    <P>This proposal is designed to benefit the big, substantial farmer.  Deputy Killilea laughs at that.  Deputy Gilbride sniggers.  I wonder would either of them, particularly Deputy Killilea, go back to his constituency in the West and defend there his statement of policy.</P>

We think that this statement of policy heralds the doom of the land project.  It is at least consoling that it is being introduced by a member of a Government that will not be in office for very long.  I think that, on examination, any Deputy in this House, and particularly any Deputy on the Government Benches, will regard this proposal as a mistake.  Looking at the administrative machinery now available to the land project and seeing the fair division between free enterprise in the presence of the existing contractors and the departmental machinery held in reserve to ensure that there would be no cornering of the market or raising of the ante or anything of that kind, Deputies on every side of this House will recognise that that is the only scheme that will ensure fair service at a low cost to the people of this country.  We have moved this amendment to this Estimate because the Minister seeks to change that system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon in one of his maddest moments, formulated a <Col N="1261" /> scheme that was not nearly as useful as the farm improvements scheme.  I have not the figures but I am satisfied that under the farm improvements scheme more land was cleared at a lesser cost, and without involving us in a dollar debt, than under the land reclamation scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change in the land reclamation scheme.  I am not so terribly sure whether or not the Minister has found the best way out.  I am of the opinion that, if we want to get this work done at a much faster rate, an improvement in the grant payable to the farmer &mdash; who would thereby be encouraged to undertake the work himself &mdash; might be a better way.  Instead of giving £12 an acre I think that if we could give £20 an acre, and let the inspectors examine the land, each farmer who has land which requires reclamation would be encouraged to go ahead and do the work himself.</P>
      <P>Much fault has been found with the Minister's proposals in the matter of handing over this machinery to other people who will work it.  He is handing it over because he believes that it will have the effect of giving a much greater return.  Those of us who have experience of local authorities or of any Government organisation can easily understand that the least return in labour is got from State subsidised schemes.  Any contractor who comes along to-morrow morning will do much more work in much less time.</P>

      <P>I certainly have.  I am a genuine worker, and I am not one of those people living on the worker at all.  I belong to the workers.  We want to get this work done at a faster rate than it is being done at the present moment.  We want to find a system whereby it can be done more <Col N="1262" /> cheaply and more quickly.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister's proposals constitute a step in that direction, and I therefore welcome his proposals.  I should not like to see people in this house misled by Deputy Dillon waving his hands and saying: &ldquo;Hit me now and the child in my arms&rdquo;.  I do not intend to detain the House further than is necessary to express these few views.  In the first place I want to kill the idea that this is an encouragement to the big farmer.  The only person who has been catered for up to the present has been the big farmer. I would ask any Deputy to go down to see the thousands of farmers in my constituency who are anxiously waiting to see something done under this scheme.  I meet these men every day in the week, and they want to know what progress can be made or how soon they can get the machinery down.</P>

We must get away from the silly ideas underlying that sort of work, and the Minister's scheme provides us with a way of facing up to the problem which confronts us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Supplementary Estimate, I want to protest against the decision of the Minister to dispose of the machinery now in the possession of the Department, and which was brought into this country by his predecessor, brought in at a time when it was necessary to give an example to the working people of this country of what could be achieved by a land reclamation scheme, properly organised and administered.  I want to say that during my lifetime &mdash; and I have reached a fairly good age &mdash; a better scheme was never introduced into this country.  In fact I think I can say that no scheme to equal the project launched by Deputy Dillon will ever be introduced into this country again no matter what experts are employed in the Department. <Col N="1263" /> It has been stated in the course of the debate that the main political Parties do not seem to be able to agree on a policy for agriculture and that as a result the people are making no progress. May I say in that regard, that the standard which has been reached by our people as compared with that which obtained prior to the winning of our legislative freedom, is a credit to any Irish Government?</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of land reclamation, is it not a fact which nobody can deny that there is not sufficient land in the country to enable us to accommodate people who may have to be transferred from the poorer areas?  When this scheme was initiated, it was specially intended to increase the area of arable land so that people from the poorer areas, people with holdings of valuations of £1, 30/- or £2, might be provided with economic holdings. We have a large number of such people along the seaboard in my constituency, people with rentals of from 15/- to 25/- and with holdings of from ten to 15 acres.  They can till only one or two acres and therefore have not sufficient land to enable them to carry on a rotation of crops.  I was proud, as a member of this House, to see that an opportunity was afforded to these people by this scheme to add to their small holdings by reclamation. Prior to the introduction of this scheme, much of their land was waterlogged, growing only rushes and shrubbery of every description.  To-day as a result of this scheme you can walk into these holdings and put down any crop you wish to grow.  That was not done inside the last six months, the last 12 months or the last 18 months. The work was commenced during the Minister's predecessor's time and it is showing fruit to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that people with big farms in other parts of the country have already got a fair share of money out of national taxation to enable them to get their land reclaimed. I have no objection to big farmers in Meath, Westmeath, Waterford, Kilkenny and Cavan getting the benefit of this scheme but I do say that they should wait their turn and give the <Col N="1264" /> poor small farmers in Connaught the first opportunity of having a few acres of their land improved by this scheme. There are some big farmers also in my county but I know that many of them can afford to reclaim their land themselves. They are getting a decent profit out of it and they can take their time.  I have no objection to any land eligible for the benefits of this scheme according to the regulations laid down, being reclaimed but I definitely say that first preference should be given to the poorer areas.  So far as my area is concerned, any work done under the Government scheme was well done, cheaply done and properly supervised. The people who were in charge of the machinery in that area certainly deserve to be congratulated and I am sorry to see that they are now to be relieved of the responsibility for work of that type in future.</P>
    <P>To come to another point, I understand that there is a scheme in my county whereby young men &mdash; and we have plenty of them &mdash; can combine and engage in this work as contractors.  I was given to understand that if two farmers' sons joined together they can purchase an outfit say at £1,000 and on paying a deposit they can get a loan and a grant.  I have seen such a scheme tried in my own area and it has been a great success.  The work has been done cheaply and well.</P>

The result for a small farmer in my area was that he was able to get his acre or two acres of land done.</P>

I suppose, if things go right, it may be possible to get a full outfit costing anything up to £10,000. There is no danger that it will ever be sent into my area or into the poorer areas of the country.  It will go into the rich Counties of Kildare, Meath, Tipperary or Limerick where the owner of it will be able to get work reclaiming 20 or 30 acres of land.</P>

      <P>I was not here yesterday and was surprised when I read the headings in this morning's newspapers: &ldquo;Alteration in land project: machinery to be sold by contract.&rdquo;  I asked myself &mdash; where is this fine scheme going to end?  A measure that conferred great benefit on areas such as mine was the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was part and parcel of the land project scheme.  Without it, the land project scheme could be made available only to a very small percentage of areas, such as we have along the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>I think that the amount of money spent under that Act by the inter-Party Government in my county was £80,000.  There was a second and a third grant made available.  Small rivers were opened up and cleaned, with the result that adjoining land could be drained.  Land which, for years, had been water-logged, was cleared of water and the land itself was prepared for reclamation.  Suppose I have four or five acres of land beside a river which is choked with green grass, and I ask to have the land reclaimed, I will be told, and rightly so, that it cannot be done because there is no means of taking off the water which is on my land.  It was in such cases that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was of great benefit in the execution of drainage work.  The people in the poorer areas are not prepared to go out and assist in making drains or in reclaiming land unless the Government give them a decent subsidy to encourage them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints have been made about long delays in the delivery of limestone and of superphosphates.  I do <Col N="1266" /> not see why there should be these delays.  I think it is true to say that superphosphates can be obtained at any period of the year.  In the case of lime, it may have to be brought a long distance to an area because limestone is not available in every area. In my part of the country there is the best of limestone which I suggest to the Minister should be developed. It would be better to have the young fellows in that area employed on that work than have them leaving the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there has been so much delay in dealing with applications from farmers in County Mayo for the reclamation of their land.  A huge number of such applications has been lodged.  People are coming to me every other day asking if there is any hope of getting their land reclaimed.  The fact that so much interest is being taken in this land project shows that the scheme has been a great success.  It will take years to finish it.  An Irish Government could spend money on no better work.  This machinery is to be auctioned and sold and given to private individuals to operate.  I am given to understand, and I speak subject to correction, that the smaller type of outfit can be bought for £1,000.  The applicant pays a third of the cost, gets a grant of one-third and a loan of one-third. Such an outfit could be bought by two families.  This machinery will now be distributed in a very big way. Will those people who buy this machinery get a grant similar to that given to those who purchase machinery in a small way?</P>

I have the idea that very few young men can afford to buy such machinery without assistance from the Government. If this machinery is to cost £1,000, it is not the most deserving cases that will get the opportunity of buying it.  If they had £1,000, they might prefer to put it into some other means of existence instead of machinery. Suppose they do buy £1,000 worth and they complete the whole outfit and 90 per cent. of it is second-hand machinery which has been working for the last three or four years, are the Government prepared to give it to them on the same terms as if they bought new machinery?</P>

I never knew that second-hand farming machinery was eligible for a grant.  If a grant is to be allowed in connection with this machinery which is to be sold, if a man has a machine and wants one of a larger type and another man wants to buy the smaller machine, there is no reason why the second man should not be entitled to a grant.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> The people in the poorer areas and the people living in the seaboard areas west of the Shannon played their part in supplying the people of the cities with eggs, butter, potatoes and bacon. They work the land and give the people these things.  A scheme should be put into operation to give these people an additional acre of land to add to the two or three acres they have been working for years.  That would be money well spent and would be doing a great service to these people.  I hope the Minister will not forget these poorer areas.  The people have to try to make a living out of the small amount of land they have.  People in Tipperary, Kilkenny, Monaghan and other counties with 400 or 500 acres of land are getting £50 or £60 for a two-and-a-half-year-old bullock and £4 per barrel for wheat.  In my county they have to sell their cattle before they are a year old.  Money should be spent in these areas and give the people an opportunity to keep their cattle beyond that age and to grow wheat and beet. It is intended to grow beet there and I hope that there will be some beet grown there.  By spending money in these areas you will be doing work which will give a good return.  You will give the people an opportunity of living there without having to go to other parts of the country.  I ask that the poorer areas should get the first chance of any money which is being made available.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the people in my constituency.  I welcome what is proposed in connection with the land project scheme.  As far as the people of Kerry are concerned and the people I represent, I have no hesitation in saying that it is long overdue and that the small farmers will welcome it.  Up to this the scheme was never effective in South Kerry.  Our people looked upon it as a scheme for the larger farmers and the people in other parts of the country who have done well under the scheme.  It was so designed that it was practically impossible to make it applicable to small farmers.  Owing to technical administrative difficulties, the officials in my county made it absolutely impossible of application to the people there.  They made it so difficult that <Col N="1269" /> the small farmers lost all hope in regard to it.</P>
      <P>As can be seen from the returns for South Kerry in particular, the number of people who qualified under the scheme was very small indeed.  I know of one scheme in County Limerick and another in County Meath where the reclamation of the land cost on an average £150 per acre.  Contrast that with the amount allowed to the farmers who cannot get anything in excess of £20 per acre.  The small farmers were left high and dry without any relief.  I can say, so far as the officials in my county are concerned, that the system as it exists should be scrapped immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as here proposed, is not a very elaborate measure. It is simply designed to widen a discretion which is already vested in the Minister for Local Government.  At present where obligation is due by a local authority payable out of the poor rate, the claim becomes unenforceable at the end of six months unless the Minister for Local Government, believing that substantial injustice will be done by that strict limitation, extends the period for any period he thinks fair and reasonable to a maximum of two years as provided by the Local Government Act, 1902.  It is proposed in this Bill to widen that discretion so as to permit the Minister for Local Government, where he believes injustice would be wrought by allowing a claim to become unenforceable at the end of two years, to extend the period to six years, which is the period provided in the statutes of limitation which apply to all ordinary persons as known to the law other than public authorities as defined in the Local Government Act of 1898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> I believe the history of the anachronism which this Bill is designed to correct is as follows, but I am bound to tell the House that in giving them this version I speak subject to correction, which I have no doubt the Minister for Local Government will be able to supply, for I have not got the same historical material in regard to this proposal as I was in a position to put before the House in regard to the Public Authorities (Protection) Bill which I introduced some time ago. The House may remember that I reminded them that in 1891 the Public Authorities (Protection) Act was passed which prescribed a period of limitation of six months instead of six years for public authorities.  When the Local Government Act of 1898 was passed for Ireland I surmise that some of those concerned in its drafting were desirous of bringing the contract obligations of local authorities into line with the obligations accruing against them in tort and inasmuch as the Public Authorities (Protection) Act reduced the period provided by the ordinary statutes of limitation in respect of tort to six months, some prudent and cautious officer of the then local government board introduced the same principle in regard to claims arising out of contract into the 1898 Act.  Within so short a period as four years it became quite clear that intolerable injustice was being done as a result of this uniform unenforceability of claims against public authorities unless the claim was made and enforced within six months of its becoming due.  In 1902 there was an amendment provided in Section 4 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1902, providing that where the Home Secretary, the Chief Secretary or some other officer of the Government acting on behalf of the local government board thought equity demanded it he would have discretion to extend the period in which a claim could be enforced against a local authority which fell to be discharged out of the poor rate to a period of two years.</P>
    <P>I have asked the House to amend the Public Authorities (Protection) Act of 1891 by extending the period under that Act to six years; and the House may remember that that Bill is still at <Col N="1271" /> Second Reading as a result of an agreement between myself and the Minister for Justice that we would postpone the final disposition of the Second Reading until such time as it was convenient for him to produce proposals that he himself had in mind to deal with the same problem as I sought to deal with in the Bill submitted by me.</P>
    <P>This Bill will bring the local government legislation, in so far as it applies to contract debts due by local authorities payable out of the poor rate, into line with the statutes of limitation in respect of contract debt applicable to every other person in the State.  I understand the Government is favourable to the principle of this Bill, and I do not wish unduly to dwell upon the meritorious purpose that can be served if the Minister, who is here present, intends to give us the Government view upon it at an early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill <Col N="1272" /> be now read a second time.  This Bill is described as the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, 1952. The object of the Bill is to provide increases in the weekly compensation payable under the Workmen's Compensation Act and also to provide for an increased payment in respect of the lump sum payable to an adult dependent or to an adult dependent and children.  Before proceeding further, I should perhaps explain that the Labour Party does not regard the present legislation in respect of workmen's compensation as either adequate or satisfactory to the needs of the situation.</P>
      <P>The present workmen's compensation legislation, which was originally enacted in order to enable compensation to be secured with a minimum of complexity has, in our opinion, in fact developed to such an extent that the law governing workmen's compensation has become far too involved and far too complex, not only for those who have counsel on either side, but also exceptionally so in respect of the unfortunate injured party.  Not only is the law far too complex and involved, but it has proved to be extremely costly so far as the injured party is concerned.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that, in a great many cases, the injured party, maimed in the course of his employment, without any income whatever in the form of wages and with a wife and children dependent upon him, is frequently the victim of the grip of hunger and that is often used ruthlessly against him in order to compel a settlement under the Act, a settlement which in no sense bears the hallmark of justice from the standpoint of the injured worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our view the workmen's compensation code ought to form part of our general social welfare code.  It should be a comprehensive piece of legislation built into the existing social welfare code and it should be administered by the State on a non-profit making basis.  There should be simplification of the procedure for recovering compensation. There should be a minimum of hardship and inconvenience imposed on the injured workman in securing his rights under workmen's <Col N="1273" /> compensation legislation.  Much, however, as we desire the complete reform of this legislation, it will be recognised by the House that complete reform would require major legislation of a kind which is beyond the power of any Opposition Party, having regard to the rules of order.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, recognises two things.  First, amendment is urgently necessary and, secondly, pending the introduction of more comprehensive legislation in respect of the payment of compensation to injured workmen and their dependents we should proceed to revise the existing scales of compensation so as to ensure that they will be brought within reasonable compass of present day needs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is limited to an amendment, or amendments of the Acts of 1934 and 1948.  It might be well to explain at this stage that so far as weekly compensation is concerned the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 provided a weekly maximum compensation of 30/-.  That was the maximum rate prevailing from 1934 until 1943 when, under stress of a substantial increase in the cost of living, an Emergency Powers Order was made which had the effect of adding 7/6 to the basic compensation of 30/- per week, making a total maximum compensation payable of 37/6 per week.</P>
    <P>In 1948 the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act was introduced. That provided, amongst other things, for raising the weekly compensation from 37/6 to 50/- per week, at the same time raising the ceiling for workmen's compensation payments to those whose salary did not exceed £500 per annum provided they were in the non-manual classes.  Where the workman is in what is described as a manual class no such ceiling is enforced against him from the standpoint of his right to recover compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>We have the position that under the 1948 Act the maximum compensation payable was 50/- per week.  Since 1948 there have been three rounds of wage increases in industry generally and, in fact, in virtually all classes of employment.  In 1948 we had a general round of wage increases measured by an increase of approximately 11/- per <Col N="1274" /> week.  In 1950-51 there was a second round of wage increases in which the increases granted varied from 10/- to £1 per week.  In 1952, the present year, the pattern of increases is working out in the vicinity of 12/6 per week.  In some cases it is slightly less.  In others it is more.  The position in relation to compensation, however, is that since the House fixed compensation at 50/- per week in 1948 we have clear and unquestionable evidence of three rounds of wage increases in relation to workers generally, but, notwithstanding the fact that workers generally have received these increases that has had no effect whatever in the determination of compensasion to which large numbers of injured workmen are entitled and they are still governed by the ceiling of 50/- per week fixed under the 1948 Act in the circumstances then prevailing.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill to accord recognition to the fact that there has been a substantial increase in wage levels since 1948, that these increases have not been taken into consideration in determining a workman's right to increased benefit over and above the 1948 rate and that, in the circumstances of to-day, it is urgently necessary to raise the level of weekly compensation from a maximum of 50/- to a maximum of 90/- per week.</P>
    <P>The present workmen's compensation code &mdash; that is, the 1934 Act with the 1948 Act impacted on it &mdash; provides that an insured workman, where his remuneration exceeds £1 per week, will receive workmen's compensation at the rate of 75 per cent. of his average earnings subject to a maximum of 50/-per week.  This Bill proposes that he will receive 75 per cent. of his wages subject to a maximum of 90/- per week. It will be clear, therefore, to the House that in order to receive the compensation at the rate of 90/- per week in respect of injuries arising out of his employment or sustained in the course of his employment, the workman would, in fact, have to receive, prior to the accident, an average wage of not less than £6 per week.  If he earned less than £6 per week he would not get a maximum of 90/- per week but a maximum of something else &mdash; the something else being determined by the fact <Col N="1275" /> that 75 per cent. of his earnings would not give him 90/- per week in compensation where his weekly pay was less than £6 per week.  I do not think it is necessary to say to the House that 90/- per week is not excessive compensation in the circumstances of to-day. Indeed, I could make a case &mdash; and so could my colleagues and so, I am sure, could other members of the House&mdash; for the payment of a weekly rate of compensation higher than 90/- per week in the case of persons who, when injured, suffer a substantial diminution of their wages in consequence of their absence from work due to injury.</P>
    <P>I think I need do no better for the purpose of illustrating the efficacy of my argument than remind the House that it now takes 45/- to buy what £1 bought in 1939, and that it now takes 90/- to buy what £2 bought in 1939. Nobody would suggest in 1939 &mdash; particularly in that year, which is the datum year for the purpose of these calculations &mdash; that to pay an injured workman £2 per week when he sustained injury in the course of his employment is to pay an excessive rate of compensation.  The basic rate provided in the 1934 Act was 30/- per week.  There were wage advances between 1934 and 1939 and these would probably have brought a mathematical adjustment of the 30/- payable under the 1934 Workmen's Compensation Act to a basic maximum of approximately £2 in 1939 if wages and prices were adjusted during the intervening years. This Bill asks the House to increase the maximum compensation payable to an insured workman from 50/- per week to 90/- per week.  If this figure of 90/- errs in any direction at all it errs on the side of being excessively reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals also with the payment of lump sum compensation in the case of fatal injuries.  It provides for an increase in the amount of compensation to an adult dependent in the case of fatal injuries and to an adult and other dependents where there are other dependents apart from the single dependent adult.  Under the 1934 Act, the maximum compensation payable to the adult dependent of a workman <Col N="1276" /> who lost his life in the course of his employment was £300 &mdash; one sum of £300.  If the workman had one child or ten children the maximum compensation payable was £600.  That was the position which the Legislature felt was, according to its concepts, reasonable compensation in 1934.  Quite clearly, if the Legislature thought £300 and £600 in these two categories of cases was reasonable compensation in the circumstances of 1934, they cannot be pleaded as constituting reasonable compensation in the circumstances of 1952 &mdash; 18 years later &mdash; when the prices of commodities have soared enormously in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I think it is hardly necessary to emphasise in 1952 that rates of compensation fixed at £300 and £600 in 1934 represent inadequate compensation to-day.  It will at once be apparent to the House that to pay £300 as a single and final payment to the adult dependent of a workman who loses his life is inadequate compensation.  To imagine that £600 is adequate compensation for a widow with any number of children, where the breadwinner loses his life in the course of his employment, is to suggest something outrageously unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I read in the newspapers last week of a case which came before the court in Cork.  The next-of-kin of a workman who lost his life in the course of his employment &mdash; his widow &mdash; brought an action for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The widow went before the courts and told them that the breadwinner had been killed in the course of his employment, that she was left with nine children to rear, and that the children were all young.  The court awarded the maximum compensation that it could award &mdash; £600.  That was the paltry allowance which that unfortunate widow was given to try and fight a battle through life for herself and her nine young children.  It needs little elaboration from me to depict the plight of that widow with nine young children, trying to feed them, to clothe them, to educate them, and to protect them against all the rigours and trials of life until they reach adolescence and manhood.  All that has to be done on a paltry sum of £600 workmen's compensation <Col N="1277" /> originally determined in 1934.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the House will recognise that, in seeking to increase the compensation from £300 to £900 in one instance, and to increase the overall compensation from £600 to £1,800, this Bill is seeking to do only what changes in living costs and wage and salary standards have necessitated. Even the new compensation of a maximum of £1,800 payable to a widow left in the circumstances of the Cork widow with nine children is not to put the compensation at any unreasonable figure.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes two other amendments. It seeks to raise the present income limit for non-manual classes from £500 per annum as the salary or wage ceiling to £800 per annum.  This adjustment is doing nothing more than moving the ceiling upwards in accordance with the wage and salary movements which have taken place since £500 was declared to be the new ceiling under the 1948 Act.</P>
    <P>There is one other amendment and it is a vital amendment from the point of view of the injured workman.  At this stage, perhaps I ought to explain the position under the 1934 Act.  Where workmen's compensation is accepted by a workman from an employer the law, I think, says that a workman is debarred from taking an action at common law where he has accepted compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, but the whole case law which has been build up under the workmen's compensation code has been built on the basis that where the workman could show to the court that he was not aware that the claim by him to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act would debar him from making a claim at common law, the courts have always given the benefit of the doubt to the injured workman and have allowed him to make a claim at common law where it was shown that he had an action against the employer for negligence under the common law code.  Recently, however, the Supreme Court decided that once a workman accepted compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, he could not sue his employer under common law no matter how negligent <Col N="1278" /> the employer might be.  Thus you might well have a situation under which a workman met with an accident to-day and his employer might say: &ldquo;All right, I shall pay you workmen's compensation next week&rdquo;; and once the man received one payment of workmen's compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act, he could take no further action against the employer in common law, no matter how negligent the employer had been.</P>
    <P>That decision by the Supreme Court is one which, if allowed to stand, will impose very great hardship on injured workmen, particularly injured workmen who are not aware of their rights in the matter, and it might well expose them to the danger that those who cover the risk of injury in respect of such workmen may seek to have workmen's compensation almost foisted on the injured workman, as the best means of stopping an action at common law, particularly if the employer is likely to be compelled to pay heavy compensation because of negligence on his part.  Since the Supreme Court decision has been given, cases have come to light where action at common law could not be taken because the workmen concerned had accepted compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I think if the Minister makes inquiries into the matter, he will find that, among the legal profession, there is grave disquiet at this decision which, for the first time for a long period, has put the injured workman at a serious disadvantage before the courts and at a serious disadvantage as far as his rights at common law are concerned. This Bill seeks to remedy that situation by the provisions of Section 8.  I would hope that the section, as now framed, would, in its obvious justice, appeal to the House sufficiently to ensure its enactment in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Summing up on this Bill, recognising that a comprehensive remedy for the defects in the workmen's compensation code requires major legislation, and since it is only possible for an Opposition Party to introduce certain amendments, I think it will be agreed that the proposals in the Bill are reasonable and modest.  I would ask <Col N="1279" /> all sides of the House, concerned as they must be with the well-being of the injured workman, to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I should like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate Deputy Norton and those associated with him on the introduction of the Bill.  I do not think any words of mine can improve on the case that has been made for the Bill by Deputy Norton. It is an unfortunate fact that our method of providing statutory compensation for injured workers must entail a review from time to time.  The first Workmen's Compensation Act was passed as early as 1906.  It received its first review by our parent statute, the statute of 1934, which, as Deputy Norton has told the House, provided for a ceiling compensation of 30/-, based on the wage levels then obtaining in the country.  The further intermediate improvement, provided by the Emergency Powers Order of 1943, led to the 1948 Bill which was introduced by Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare and that Bill provided for a ceiling of 50/-.  I am not quite certain whether the ceiling now proposed of 90/- is an adequate ceiling, so far as industrial workers generally are concerned.  I can see the case being made for a man in receipt of a wage of some £8 or £9, that a weekly compensation less than half his wages is not adequate compensation but, of course, so far as the vast bulk of employed persons are concerned, I am quite satisfied that the present ceiling is adequate to meet their claims and it may be, as Deputy Norton has said, that the ceiling figure suggested in the Bill is more than reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see the introduction in the Bill of the much-needed amendment with regard to fatal accident lump sums.  At the time that the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1948 was passing through the House, other Deputies and I pressed Deputy Norton as Minister, to provide for some increase in the lump sum payable in <Col N="1280" /> the event of a fatal accident.  I do not know why it was not then done.  I was never satisfied with the reasons given for not doing it, and I am glad that in this Bill it is proposed to bring about that much-needed reform. Everyone who has had an experience of workmen's compensation litigation can readily understand the appalling injury that is caused when, through some unfortunate accident, a husband, the head of a family, is killed, and all of us can well sympathise with the inability of the judge, trying the workmen's compensation case, to provide anything more than the maximum at present payable under the Act, of £300 to the adult dependents and, if there are juvenile dependents qualifying. £300 also in their case.  I do not think it is necessary to emphasise to the House that a total sum of £600 in the case of a large family is not adequate in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I feel that I am perhaps largely repeating, but not so well, the speech made by Deputy Norton.  I would, however, like to avail of this Bill to suggest to the Minister if the principle of it is acceptable to the Government &mdash; and for the life of me I cannot see why it should not &mdash; it could well be availed of to provide other necessary amendments and reforms in relation to the workmen's compensation code. One very necessary amendment is provided in Section 8 of this Bill which deals with the position of involuntary election under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  As Deputy Norton has informed the House, the present code has been construed to mean, in application to particular cases, that an injured workman who, in ignorance of his rights, is paid and accepts any sum as compensation, is for all time debarred from taking independent proceedings against his employer.  That has resulted in very serious injury and hardship to injured workmen.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate, I am sure, that in ordinary circumstances no workman has a right of action against his employer, that is, a right of action at common law unless there is some personal negligence on the part of the employer &mdash; some unsafe plant or machinery or some matter of that kind.  That is dealt with in the first of <Col N="1281" /> these Acts, the Employers' Liability Act of 1881.</P>
    <P>Now, when that kind of negligence is established, the workman who is injured can look forward to securing from a judge or a jury at common law far in excess of the statutory compensation provided under the workmen's compensation code.  Naturally, when the Act of 1934, which is our parent statute, was passed, it had to deal with a situation in which a workman had a double remedy: the right to proceed under the Workmen's Compensation Act for a weekly sum as compensation, or the right to undergo the hazards of a common law action and the recovery of a lump sum in compensation.  The Act of 1934 laid down in Section 65, I think, that such a workman, having both rights, was entitled to proceed with both, but was not entitled to accept both weekly compensation and damages.  The idea behind the section was quite clear, that an injured workman could take his proceedings under the Workmen's Compensation Act and his common law action and that, right up to the end, he was entitled to decide which he would go ahead with, but that once he received either damages in his common law action or workmen's compensation, then he was held to have elected, and that was the end of it.  Now, the meaning or the good sense behind the section was quite clear, but the wording, unfortunately, was not clear enough.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a workman who is injured.  In some cases that I know of, without having an opportunity of consulting a solicitor, a workman, injured at his employment, with dependents at home, for whom he has to provide food and having no income because his wages are stopped, is visited by the local insurance agent. In no time he receives what he needs, a sum of money to provide food for his family, and for that sum of money he is asked to sign a receipt.  It is quite understandable that he should sign the receipt.  In a couple of months' time, when he proceeds to bring his common law action, he finds that the receipt he signed was a receipt for workmen's compensation, and he is then informed by the court, as it must inform him, <Col N="1282" /> that he has thereby elected to dispense with his common law action and to accept workmen's compensation only, because the Act says that he cannot accept both &mdash; that if he accepts one he cannot accept the other.</P>
    <P>That is not a recent decision of the Supreme Court, as I think Deputy Norton said.  It has been extended recently by the Supreme Court.  That is the difficulty that has been facing legal practitioners and injured workmen for quite a number of years.  I am not quite sure whether that decision was carried to the extreme of holding this notional election to apply in the case of an infant or a minor workman, but possibly it may go that far.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill proposes to deal with that situation.  I would like to see in addition to the Bill &mdash; this is only my personal view &mdash; in the workmen's compensation code, a provision for the payment of a lump sum of compensation to be assessed by a judge on the consent of both employer and workman.  I know there are many cases where perhaps a young workman for the rest of his life &mdash; where the incapacity in fact is partial and not permanent &mdash; is prevented from ever again engaging in useful, lucrative manual employment.  I suggest that, in those circumstances, the weekly payment, even on the basis of total incapacity, is not as useful a method of compensating him as could be some lump-sum payment that would enable him to start a little business or some other method of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>I know that in fact in most cases of that kind, after it has been determined by the court, a lump-sum settlement is arranged, but the amount of that settlement depends largely on the advice and ability of the legal representatives of the workmen and also on many other circumstances of that kind. It might be far better in these circumstances to give to the Circuit Court judge the power, on consent, to assess what would be a fair lump sum to pay to the injured workman.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I think it is a measure that is very badly needed.  I do not think that any Deputy can really oppose the proposals here made.  We all realise that to-day every employer who is anyway prudent is idemnified <Col N="1283" /> against liability under the workmen's compensation code.  That is a matter which should be considered, because the original provision in regard to workmen's compensation was long kept at a very low figure for fear of imposing too great a burden on employers of labour.  There is now available to them a method of insuring against this risk, and it is, in fact, in general operation. I think that the proposals in this Bill are a very modest contribution towards the alleviation of a very real hardship in the case of injured workmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the compensation code should be amended and the compensation increased. I just rise to speak for one particular type of workers, the workers who have got compensation on the basis that they are considered capable of doing light work.  These are the most tragic cases that I have met with in my experience.  When a man who had been so adjudged goes back to his former employer, whether a big corporation or business or a small employer, looking for light work, he may only have an injured hand or a stiff elbow or an injured foot, but the employer in 99 cases out of 100 does not want to take the risk of giving him light work, fearing he may be injured again, or to give him employment where he need not exert the full powers which he formerly used.  Such workers have their families to support. Their general health is good, and they are hoping to get some small employment as a night-watchman or something of that kind.  Such opportunities are very rare.  In considering this whole matter of compensation, the cases of such people should be taken into consideration, and until such time as they get light work or whatever other work may be available their compensation at the regular rate should continue.  I have no desire to stress any of the other points raised. I just got up to raise that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Labour Party on their initiative in this matter.  This Bill is one which, I am sure, will meet with <Col N="1284" /> the approval of every section of the House.  It is good to see that, in matters of this kind, there can be a non-Party and objective approach for the purpose of dealing with reforms which are urgently needed.  I am in complete agreement with every portion of the Bill.  I need not repeat many of the things so ably said by Deputy Norton and by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>There is a good case for including on the Committee Stage a section which would cover the point raised by Deputy MacCarthy.  The question of light work and of making provision for a workman who has been adjudged to be capable of light work and who has been unable to procure light work should be covered.  I am sure the movers of the Bill will consider the inclusion on the Committee Stage of some section of that nature in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As a lawyer I think I can say, with the approval of every lawyer in the country, that the amendment contained in Section 8 is one which is long overdue. We have all come across cases of grave injustice being done to workmen who have been seriously injured through the negligence of or breach of his statutory duty by their employer and are deprived of their right to full compensation because in the early stages they had accepted payments of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  As Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, these payments are made at a time when the injured worker is in hospital and very often unable even to appreciate the gravity of his injuries or of the situation.  I may have to suggest one or two slight verbal amendments in the section which could be embodied in the Bill on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask the sponsors of the Bill to consider the possibility of altering Section 8 to some extent.  The section still provides for this system of election by the injured workman as to whether he will proceed under the Workmen's Compensation Acts or proceed to his common law remedy.  In practice, I see no reason why an injured workman should be put to any election.  I think the only thing necessary to ensure is that he will not secure compensation twice over.  I see <Col N="1285" /> no reason why an injured workman might not receive compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts with full knowledge of his common law right, provided that if he succeeds in his common law action payments made to him will be deducted from any compensation he may secure.</P>
    <P>I think that that would be a much better position.  It would permit in a number of cases an injured workman receiving payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts until his common law claim was determined by the courts.  In a great many cases it would mean that a workman who had been injured would receive weekly payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts during the early stages of his injury until such time as it had been determined whether or not he had a common law claim.  But there is no reason why he should be put to election at any stage.  The only thing necessary is to see that he will not recover compensation twice for the same injury.  It should be possible by some amendment of Section 8 to ensure that he would be entitled to certain payments under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, but that these payments would be deducted from any compensation arising out of any claim which he might successfully make in the courts.  I again want to congratulate the initiative of the sponsors of this Bill and to say how glad I am to find that it has got a good reception including the reception which it received from the Government Party through its daily newspaper, the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>Deputy Norton knows this has nothing to do with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour and a compliment to be interrupted or objected to by Deputy Cowan.  The lady says that she was awarded £300 compensation although her husband's wages were £7 a week.  That is one of the cases which Deputy Norton has made an appeal for, and I join with him in asking that when the Bill is passed the date might be made retrospective so as to include this woman who was dependent on her husband. She goes on to say: &ldquo;He was a very steady and sober man and gave me all the help I needed.&rdquo;  I want to add my voice to the appeal made by Deputy Norton and the other speakers for decent treatment for these people.</P>
      <P>There is another case, which I think is known also to most members of the House, where a young man, with three or four children, met with an accident about two years ago in Seán MacDermott Street, when some sacks containing meal fell on him and injured his back.  He was paid the sum of £2 10s. a week, I think, for the last two years, and neither the firm concerned nor the insurance company will increase the amount.  He is, therefore, struggling to keep his family and to keep the rent clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> I will go on a little further, because Deputy Norton did so, he said some of these companies and some of the employers, although I must say not all of them, did their best to starve out these men by forcing them to take half pay or the maximum amount for a long period, and then forcing them to make a settlement.  When the notice to quit comes, because of heavy arrears of rent, these people are forced to make a settlement for £100 or so, whereas if they got a chance to go before a judge and jury they might get £1,000.  I make this appeal on behalf of these people who, at a moment of serious want, accept the small sum of money that is offered to them by the representatives of the insurance company paying them the workmen's compensation. I do not think they should be at a disadvantage later; they should be able to go to court and ask a judge and jury to give them what they think they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the type of case that Deputy MacCarthy very properly mentioned.  That is the case where a man gets a doctor's certificate stating that he is fit for light work. This unfortunate man, seeing that his workmen's compensation, small as it is, is about to be stopped on him, takes the certificate for light work and goes along perhaps to the firm that employed him previously or some other firm.</P>
    <P>He has not his full strength and the employer sees, as Deputy MacCarthy says, that he is not in good health. He is afraid to take the risk because he may not be a fully insurable person, and does not want to employ him much longer.  I have known a case which occurred a year or two ago in which a man was certified as fit for light work.  He was only back a month when he was dismissed, but in going back and proving that he was fit for light work he was not entitled to compensation when he was dismissed.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the members of the House to give their support to this Bill, and I hope the Minister will accept the Bill as suggested by Deputy Norton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect it is natural that those of us who are trade union <Col N="1289" /> officials will have much more sympathy for a Bill of this kind than the average Deputy.  I fear very much that the average Deputy here will look upon this measure in the erroneous belief that the majority of people who draw workmen's compensation do so as malingerers.  It would be regrettable if any hasty decision was taken by the Deputies of this House against such a background.  So that I might clear the minds of Deputies of a certain suspicion of that kind, I would draw their attention to this fact, that a workman has not the right to go to court so long as the insurance company elects to pay him his weekly compensation under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy O'Higgins in that, because I have had experience in my capacity as a trade union official and I know many workmen who have been compelled to remain on indefinitely drawing the miserable pittance of 50/- per week despite the fact that they were more than anxious that their cases should be heard and fair compensation fixed so that they might return to even partial employment and help to provide for their families.</P>
      <P>The insurance company has the right either to pay the award according to statute or have its case heard before a Circuit Court judge.  I think it is important that Deputies should bear this fact in mind.  Where it is possible &mdash; and that possibility is only at the will and pleasure of the insurance company &mdash; for these cases to come before the court, the vast majority have been proved to be genuine.  It has been proved that, in the vast majority of cases, there is no malingering where workmen have been injured in the course of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present compensation code, the weapon of hunger is used to force the injured workman to accept compensation even though he knows perfectly well that the compensation is unjust.  He accepts because he realises that the insurance company can, if it so desires, continue to pay him the miserable pittance of 50/- per <Col N="1290" /> week for an indefinite period and he accepts against his better judgment and possibly against the advice of his solicitor compensation that is subsequently proved to be totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I know there are certain safeguards. I know that the national health insurance has the right to intervene and to object to such a settlement.  The district justice has the right to refuse to record such a settlement.  At the same time, I know that the justice places a good deal of reliance on the opinion of the worker himself, and so does the national health, as to whether or not the compensation is adequate for the injuries he received, because there are a number of injuries which will not be visible and the extent of their effect on the earning capacity of the worker will have to be mainly judged by the opinion of the worker himself.</P>
    <P>It is because this Bill seeks to raise the ceiling to a reasonable figure that we are so much in support of it.  We appeal to the Deputies on both sides, irrespective of Party, to support the measure.  Deputy Norton has given figures demonstrating the comparative value of the compensation being received under the statute as against the background in 1939.  It is true that other social welfare benefits, such as old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and national health insurance have been increased in some measure since 1948. It is only fair that workmen's compensation should be stepped up to something more commensurate with the present level of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In relation to death benefit it is not the invariable practice that the dependent of the deceased receives the full benefit.  Sometimes medical proof is necessary in order to secure the full death benefit in respect of a man killed during the course of his work.  It is indeed very rarely that the dependents receive the full amount.  I think Deputy O'Higgins gave an excellent example in support of the workers' choice either in common law or under the Workmen's Compensation Act; that is to say, that the worker having drawn workmen's compensation should have the right to go back and choose <Col N="1291" /> common law.  I know that in the vast majority of cases when a workman is injured during the course of his employment invariably the employer sends him a certain sum of money with a form to sign and unless that worker knows something about the law or has a trade union official or a good solicitor to advise him he may be trapped into signing and subsequently discover that he has thereby abrogated his right to compensation under common law.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be regarded merely as an interim measure since there is need for a comprehensive scheme of workmen's compensation.  Whether that scheme should be tied up with other types of insurance is a matter that can be discussed later.  As an interim measure this Bill merits the approval of all those who are interested in the rights of workmen in securing justice under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kyne has very sincerely expressed his views in relation to this particular code.  I am sure that Deputy Norton, although I did not hear him speak, was actuated entirely by motives of sincerity and by a desire to help unfortunate people injured in the course of their employment, when he was introducing this Bill this evening.  I did interrupt a fellow Deputy from my own constituency, Deputy Alfred Byrne, who in every discussion that takes place here produces a letter he has received from somebody.</P>

Deputy Byrne comes along with this particular <Col N="1292" /> letter to the effect that a person only received £300.  We know what is the law.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has introduced this Bill and it has considerable merits.  It has as many merits now as it might have had last year, the year before or the year before that again.  I agree that this maximum of £600 is entirely inadequate.  I think it is a scandalous amount to be paid to a widow with a family whose breadwinner has been killed in an accident in the course of and during his employment.  I agree that the amount of compensation that is being paid, a sum of £2 10s. a week &mdash; it was originally 30/-; it was increased by Emergency Order to 37s. 6d., and it is now £2 10s. &mdash; is entirely inadequate. I have always stated that where a <Col N="1293" /> person is injured during and in the course of his employment he ought to be entitled to receive a sum equivalent to his earnings at the time of his injury.  Deputy Norton does not even advocate that in this Bill but I will go so far as to advocate it, because I think it is only right that it should be done.</P>
      <P>Let us, however, get down to the history of this matter.  When a person, in the ordinary way, was injured during and in the course of his employment he was entitled to no compensation whatsoever &mdash; and many people lost a foot or a leg or an arm or a finger in the course of his or her employment.  It might have been due to the negligence of a fellow-servant, but, under the law as it stood, the injured person was entitled to nothing.</P>
      <P>The Workmen's Compensation Act was originally brought in for the purpose of establishing that where a person was injured during and in the course of his employment &mdash; whether or not it was due to the negligence of a fellow-servant &mdash; he would not be left high and dry but would be entitled to a certain weekly sum in compensation. If, in similar circumstances, he was killed, his widow would be entitled to a lump sum.  If she had children the maximum amount to be paid would be £600 and that sum would be reduced, depending on whether or not she had children, to £300 &mdash; the sum Deputy Byrne mentioned here to-night.  One must understand the fundamentals of the Workmen's Compensation Act when one comes to consider that matter.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly certain that during the three and a half years that Deputy Norton was Minister for Social Welfare he must, as a trade unionist, have been pressed very strongly by members of the trade unions in regard to the subject of workmen's compensation, and even if he was never pressed, Deputy Norton must have realised himself, as a person actively concerned with trade unions and as the general secretary of one of them that the compensation provided under the law of this country was entirely inadequate.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Norton must have realised that some adjustment in the law was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Under workmen's compensation the employer insures himself against risks because the employer is responsible if an employee is injured during and in the course of his employment.  Under the law as it stands at the moment, an injured employee would be entitled to compensation at the rate of £2 10s. per week.  Originally, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, it was 30/-per week and that was subsequently increased to £1 17s. 6d. a week.  I am perfectly satisfied that Deputy Norton realised that for a person who was earning a reasonably good wage and who was injured without any fault of his own during and in the course of his employment £2 10s. a week was entirely inadequate.  I am perfectly certain that in the circumstances related by Deputy Byrne, where a worker lost his life, Deputy Norton was satisfied that £300 was an entirely inadequate lump sum to pay.  I am also perfectly certain that Deputy Norton must have used all the influence he could and had to try and improve that situation and to try and increase both the weekly payments and the amount that should be paid on death.  I could speak, if I wanted to speak, of many cases which have come to my knowledge, as they have come to the knowledge of Deputies of this House, of very severe hardship imposed on the widow of a breadwinner and on the family of a breadwinner &mdash; on the widow in the case of his death and on the family in the case of his injury&mdash; through these inadequate sums that are paid under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    <P>For the past 20 years &mdash; since 1934&mdash; those of us who deal with these matters have met with many cases.  We could all cite many cases in every year since 1934 of the type of widow who writes a letter to Deputy Byrne in regard to what she is entitled to under the law.  But one must realise, and I think it is an essential realisation, before one proceeds any further with this matter that were it not for workmen's compensation legislation this unfortunate widow to whom Deputy Byrne refers would receive nothing. The workmen's compensation code does provide something, though I agree that the provision is inadequate.  I think that it ought not be a separate code at <Col N="1295" /> all, administered as it is administered, where the liability and responsibility is not on the State, but on the employer who protects himself by means of an insurance policy.  A worker in the course of his employment with Deputy Byrne or somebody else &mdash; a worker employed, say, cleaning <Col N="1296" /> Deputy Byrne's windows &mdash; is killed and Deputy Byrne &mdash; not the State &mdash; is liable to pay compensation to the widow.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11th December, 1952.</P>
