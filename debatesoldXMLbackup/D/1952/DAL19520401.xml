      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his attention has been directed to the leading article in a provincial daily newspaper of 25th March in which it is stated that a Deputy, General Seán MacEoin, asserted in a speech at Tuam that there is one and a half years' supply of wheat in the country; and, if so, if he will state whether this assertion is correct and if it is incorrect if he will have immediate steps taken to contradict such statements which endanger the production of essential food supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the leading article referred to by the Deputy in which a statement is attributed to Deputy MacEoin that the wheat stocks in this country are equivalent to one and a half years' supply.  This statement is not correct.  At the present rate of consumption, stocks of wheat are sufficient to supply the needs of the country for 19½ weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that statements such as this are very serious and may have an ill effect on the growing of wheat and will he not take steps to see that such wild and reckless statements are contradicted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there was a statement made at the Cork County Committee of Agriculture by a member of the Minister's own Party, Deputy Corry, in regard to the wheat midge, which militated much more against the growing of wheat?</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that bread is at present being delivered in Wexford Town and County from bakeries outside the county to persons and shops from whom bread ration coupons are not requested; and if, in view of the harm that is being done to the bakery trade in County Wexford, he will take the necessary steps to stop this practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reported to me some months ago that bread was being <Col N="936" /> delivered to retailers in Wexford in contravention of the rationing regulations. The complaint was investigated and appropriate action has been taken against the offenders.  A similar allegation which has been received recently is being investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be done quickly because on my information, as the Minister is probably aware, there is a new bakery starting outside County Wexford.  It seems very peculiar that these bakeries can send such a lot of bread into County Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of the regulations made by the Labour Court governing the wage rates and conditions of employment for messenger boys in the Dublin area: (a) the date on which such regulations became legally effective; (b) the number of establishments registered by the Labour Court in respect of which such regulations are applicable; (c) the number of inspections carried out by inspectors of his Department for the purpose of ensuring that such regulations were being complied with; (d) the number of breaches of such regulations reported by the inspectors, <Col N="937" /> specifying the number of each type of breach reported, and (e) the action, if any, which has been taken in respect of such reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two Employment Regulation Orders affecting messengers in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  One became effective on the 27th July, 1951, and the other on the 1st January, 1952.  There is no obligation on the Labour Court to maintain a register of employers affected by the regulations.  The records maintained do not readily lend themselves to an extraction of all the details which the Deputy requires but I can inform him that about 240 premises have been visited so far by inspectors in connection with these regulations and appropriate action taken where breaches were detected. In the early days of Orders of this kind the first efforts of the inspectors are directed towards making employers aware of their obligations and 2,500 copies of a notice have been issued to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspectors do not take cases to the court; they report the facts to me.  The decision as to whether prosecution is required or not will be taken by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  The estimates to which he refers were compiled in line with directions laid down by the Food and Agriculture Committee of the C.E.E.C. and outlined in paragraph VI of the questionnaire of the 23rd July, 1947. In accordance with these directions the estimates given for imports and exports were in respect of the 12 months ended 30th June of the second year stated in each case; the figures for crop areas were the acreages estimated to be sown in each of the first years so stated and the estimated figures of crop production furnished represented the expected output of those acreages.  The figures in respect of live-stock population were the estimated numbers of each of the different classes of live stock as at the 1st June in the first year stated in each case.  The estimated output of live-stock products was directly related to those numbers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Taca Siochána were recruited as temporary officers for service during the emergency without pension rights and without an incremental scale of pay. In recognition of this, they were paid at a rate higher than that prescribed at the time for persons recruited in the ordinary way to the Garda, and their pay was not made subject to the Garda pension contribution of 2½ per cent. When members of the Taca were enrolled in the Garda on 1st April, 1942, their service became pensionable as from that date and they were allowed to retain the special rate of pay which they had been receiving as temporary officers.  They will be eligible for full pension before they reach the retiring age.</P>
      <P>It was made quite clear to them when they were recruited to the Taca that their services in the Taca would not be pensionable and when they were enrolled in the Garda it was made clear to them that their services in the Taca would not count for the purposes of increments of pay or pension in the Garda.  There is, therefore, no question of their having been deprived of anything to which they had any right or expectation.</P>

The operation of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, is being kept under review in my Department with a view to the introduction in due course of any necessary proposals for legislation to amend and improve it.

      <P>Am I to take it that no local authorities have made representations as to the difficulties they are experiencing in working the Act in relation to existing established servants and in relation to making long-standing employees of local authorities established servants?  Does the Minister not consider that, in the new circumstances which may arise&mdash;whereby the demand which will be made on these road workers in respect of social insurance and payments under the Superannuation Act will amount to between 5/- and 6/- per week&mdash;serious consideration is necessary and does he not agree that road workers, on their present very low wages, cannot afford such a high contribution?</P>

I am not aware that an addition of 5d. per week imposes an undue hardship, having regard to the improved benefits which these people will enjoy.  It is possible that complaints have been made as to the difficulties of working the Superannuation Act.  I have already indicated that any difficulties which arise are being kept under review by my Department and that, as is the case in all such circumstances, it is not in the course of one month, six months or 12 months that all the difficulties that may be encountered will arise and that if, at any time, it should be necessary to introduce amending legislation it is <Col N="959" /> desirable that all the weaknesses&mdash;if any&mdash;should be discovered before any proposals are submitted to this House.</P>

      <P>While there has been a fall in the freight market it is not of sufficient extent to affect the fertiliser position of the present year.  Most of the fertilisers required have already been imported or manufactured here and variations in costs cannot affect them.</P>
      <P>Reductions in freight charges will unquestionably enter into the calculation of prices, but increases in prices of raw materials will also have to be taken into account.  As from to-day an increase of 20 per cent. in the cost of one important raw material becomes effective, and other increases are on the way.  I am hopeful, however, that it may be possible to finish this season without any further increase in price to the farmer, but I should point out that the position is not being improved by the reluctance of farmers to use fertilisers, particularly on grasslands.  This is having the effect of greatly adding to costs by heavy storage and depreciation charges on fertilisers which should by now be in the ground.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne seemed to be very worried, judging by his parliamentary question to-day, as to the extra contributions that would have to be paid under the social welfare scheme&mdash;the extra 5d. per week that the worker will have to pay&mdash;but we did not hear anything from Deputy Dunne about the extra 1/7 that the worker would have to pay under Deputy Norton's Bill.  Considering the burden that he states those men have to bear between superannuation contributions and the Social Welfare Bill, I think he will agree that a difference of 1/2 is a big help to the worker concerned. I think it will be reassuring to him to know that he is now being asked to pay only 5d. instead of 1/7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a lot of talk last week about the farmers and the farm workers under this Bill, but I did not hear anybody from the opposite side comment on the fact that both the <Col N="963" /> farmer and the farm labourer would have to pay a much smaller contribution now, the total being 2/6&mdash;1/3 each I understand &mdash; while under Deputy Norton's Bill the man had to pay 2/6 and the employer 3/6.  I think Deputies on the other side should have made some little comment on that, and also on the fact that the farm worker, with a wife and two children, when he is either unemployed or sick will be entitled to get £2 10s. per week while under the Bill with the higher contributions he would only get 37/- per week for himself, his wife and two children.  I think in all fairness the people on the opposite side should have drawn attention to these facts.  A difference of 1/2 a week in the contribution is, in my opinion, a very big consideration for the ordinary worker. Deputy Norton stated last year that he was sure the workers would not mind paying the 1/7 per week considering that they had spent £44,000,000 in drink and gambling in 1949.  It is all right for people in big positions to talk that way, but it is a different matter for the man who has to count every shilling.</P>
    <P>We also heard Deputy Larkin say that there was very little propaganda against this Bill throughout the country as compared with Deputy Norton's Bill.  I am sure that Deputy Larkin will remember that there was a lot of propaganda carried out in favour of Deputy Norton's Bill.  A civil servant was sent round different parts of the country explaining all about the Bill or, as they would say in other countries, &ldquo;putting it across.&rdquo;  When one of the trade unions here in Dublin at a meeting rejected it, they were accused of being a Fianna Fáil union. I think when tactics like that were adopted and a civil servant was employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister himself held a meeting in Cork to tell the people all the great things that were in the Bill.  I contend that the present Bill is a much better Bill at a smaller cost to the worker.  It provides for lower contributions and greater benefits.  As I have just mentioned, in the case of the farm worker with a wife and children, he will get, for a much smaller contribution, £2 10s. instead of 37/-.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin said that, if Deputy Norton's Bill was open to criticism, this Bill also was open to criticism, but none of the people on the opposite side were able to find any serious fault in this Bill, or any reduction in benefits by the Minister for the reduction in contributions which he is giving.  Their principal grievance was the cutting out of the man with over £600 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin laid great stress on the case of the man with over £600 a year.  The Deputies opposite know very well that it is only very rarely a man with such an income would ever reap any benefit from a Bill like this.</P>

      <P>It is only for the purpose of getting some little bit of kudos from those people that the Deputies opposite are talking that way.  There was a lot of talk about retirement pensions at the age of 65.  I contend that, in the case of anybody over 65 years, <Col N="965" /> there is as good provision in this Bill as there was in the last Bill.  Some of the Deputies opposite said that, when a man reaches the age of 65, employers are not inclined to keep them on, and they mentioned several trades where such men are compulsorily retired. Well, if they have to retire, and are unable to get work, they are entitled to a retirement pension of 24/- a week, with allowances for their wives and children up to 50/-, provided they can show that they are unable to work. They have not to renew their claims either.  They are not struck off after six months as at present.  They can draw unemployment benefit continuously, provided they can show that they are unable to secure work.  If, on the other hand, they are unable to work, and can prove it, they are entitled to the same benefits under this Bill as under the other Bill.  Therefore, I cannot understand why we should have all this talk about retirement pensions at 65, while at the same time Deputies say that people would be better off if they were allowed to continue on after 65.  Well, here is the opportunity, with the same safeguards for sickness and unemployment after the age of 65.  I think that argument of the Deputies opposite will not cut any ice at all.</P>

      <P>I mentioned last week about treatment in hospitals.  I do not know, in view of all the interruptions there were when I was speaking, whether or not the Minister took any notice of what I said.  I think this is a matter that calls for something to be done about it.  I referred to the case of a contributor who falls sick.  He is attending a doctor, say, who does not visit one of the voluntary hospitals under the scheme or a local authority hospital, and has to go into another hospital.  The result, very often, for him is that he has to pay the full cost of hospital treatment, although he has been paying national health insurance for years.  I think that is wrong.  I think there should be some contribution to enable him to meet his hospital bill, a contribution that, at least, would be equal to whatever the State is paying <Col N="966" /> to a hospital under the scheme.  I think it would only be just to do that.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite should admit that the increase in widows' pensions and the levelling up of same, will remedy a long-standing grievance.  In the case of widows with 14/- or 10/- a week, it will be a big help to them to get £1.  Personally, I do not believe that is enough but at the same time it, represents a big jump on the present figure.</P>
      <P>In regard to the section of the Bill dealing with deciding officers, I think we should endeavour to get rid of the system whereby people looking for unemployment benefit are so often turned down on trivial grounds.  Their cases have to be sent up to Dublin and, of course, have to come back again before a decision is given.  I understand that very often the decisions in their cases are given by people who are really in a minor capacity when compared to the manager of a local employment exchange.  I think that a person holding the position of manager of an employment exchange in any of our big centres should be regarded as competent to give a decision in cases where very often only a few shillings are involved. The delays in the payment of such claims at present means a great hardship for workers.  These delays occur very often at present.  There are plenty of ways of remedying that, and I think something should be done about it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say any more except to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill so quickly, considering the short time the Government has been in office, and following so quickly on the recent increases to old age and blind pensioners.  I think it is a step in the right direction, and even though some of us might desire more yet we feel that this Bill will go a long way to help to relieve the sick, the idle, and the needy people of the country.</P>

      <P>There is the old saying that &ldquo;it is a ill-wind that does not blow somebody good&rdquo;.  It seems that, on last Thursday night when Deputy Sweetman was speaking, whatever way the wind was blowing, our <Col N="967" /> friend, Deputy Burke, conveniently enough was down at the gate. Whether it was on the breeze, or otherwise, he apparently heard Deputy Sweetman speaking, and, with great speed, he came back to tell us something which certainly was of great importance.  Out of the charity of his overflowing heart he told us something which, up to then, had not been divulged by the Minister.  He informed the House that, within a few days, the Minister was going to make provision for an increase in children's allowances.  If it were for nothing else than that, I believe that the recall of Deputy Burke by Deputy Sweetman's speech certainly helped us in this House.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago, when speaking in the House, Deputy Burke took exception to the attitude of some members in the Opposition. He compared them to a certain character in a certain play when he said that they were always inclined to look for their pound of flesh.  It dawned on me last Thursday night after hearing Deputy Burke that in the same play there was a character named Bassanio, who was supposed to have said: &ldquo;Let me play the fool.  With mirth and laughter let our wrinkles come.&rdquo;  Deputy Burke gave us more enjoyment on Thursday night than you would get from any character in the play.</P>

      <P>He was serious, or at least he thought he was.  Other statements made in the debate were interesting when we compare them with the views expressed by Deputies last March when speaking on the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton.  Even the Minister, in introducing the Bill, divided his contribution into two sections. The first part of his contribution differed enormously from the concluding section.  Again, I got the idea that there was something of a parallel to the excitement which prevailed in <Col N="968" /> different parts of the country for some time back.  In various parts of the country certain people were in a state of tension which came to a climax in Dublin last Saturday night.  I am speaking of the Irish Caruso competition. As well as the people involved, they also had their advisers or trainers or maestros, whatever you may call them.</P>
      <P>Certainly in the competition last Thursday there seemed to be a line drawn when depicting the Minister in the role of Plutarch introducing his master in the prologue to Pagliacci. Perhaps the great maestro was so pleased with his people that he introduced his prologue, but in a somewhat different vein, a very bitter vein.  At one stage in the prologue he found it suitable to dwell on what he called the &ldquo;small scrap of paper&rdquo; mentioned by Deputy Norton.  Having stated that Deputy Norton had spoken from platforms all over the country about this &ldquo;small scrap of paper&rdquo;, he then said that in the High Court Deputy Norton was more careful of his words and, instead of using the expression &ldquo;small scrap of paper&rdquo;, the Deputy referred to it as &ldquo;some headings&rdquo;.  If we are to take the comparison between the statements made by Deputy Norton when he mentioned some headings or a scrap of paper and the words of the Minister who insisted on the fact that, not a small scrap of paper or some papers, but a large file was there, it seems that the Minister found it suitable to question the correctness of the words used by Deputy Norton when he was on his oath.  I will only say this much&mdash;the Minister is not here, but it will be on the records for him to see what I said&mdash;let him never forget the fact that he was on oath on one occasion as to whether he knew people or not.</P>

      <P>The second part of his contribution to this debate certainly brought us to a stage where we could see a clear conflict between the views expressed by members of the Government at the present time and the views expressed by some of these <Col N="969" /> members when in opposition.  When in opposition the Minister and many other members made it quite clear that one of the main points of their opposition to Deputy Norton's Bill was that no provision was being made for over 500,000 people, small farmers, shopkeepers and various other self-employed people.  We had Deputy Corry stating that he would never vote for any legislation which would deny farmers, country blacksmiths, tradesmen and handymen the right to the same treatment as other sections. Deputy Cogan, an outsider in the race, made it quite clear that he was as strenuous in his opposition as Deputy Corry was to Deputy Norton's Bill because of the supposed exclusion of these sections.</P>
      <P>Does it mean that the Minister has got Deputy Corry and all these other Deputies to see his side of the story, or that, having caused a small revolution in the Party, these Deputies are now satisfied to answer the whip and say that what they said 12 months ago was only said to suit the occasion, was only said because at that time they did not realise that the time would come when a true sense of responsibility would be placed on them?  The Minister when he was in opposition made it quite clear that he was not satisfied even then with such an exclusion.  Deputy Corry mentioned that the farm workers were &ldquo;gone with the wind&rdquo;, that there was no need for the provision included for their protection in Deputy Norton's scheme.  I wish that some people who profess such an interest in the farm workers would either go with the wind or face up to their responsibilities.  Deputy McGrath followed the line handed out to him by those who were passing on notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned by the Minister in his opening address, by Deputy McGrath and by others that in Deputy Norton's scheme the farm worker was not going to get the same advantage as the other workers over the £3 10s. limit.  I do not blame Deputy McGrath for that.  He and the others are just saying what they are asked to say.  However, I blame the Minister <Col N="970" /> for making statements here which he must know in his heart to be false to the core.  Will the Minister or anyone connected with him point to any part of the Norton Bill wherein it was mentioned that the farm worker should get 37/- instead of 50/-?</P>
    <P>I challenge any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or of the Government to bring forth evidence to justify their false statement.  In the Norton Bill it was clearly set out that anyone earning £3 10s. and over would pay 3/6 by way of contribution and would be in receipt of the highest rate&mdash;50/-, as mentioned by Deputy McGrath a while ago.  It is interesting to see this conflict of opinion expressed by a member of a Party which has the name of being so united.  Last March, when speaking on the Norton Bill, Deputy Allen stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Most agricultural workers at present or in the immediate future will be getting £3 10s. per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last March Deputy Allen realised that even the farm workers would benefit, and yet, 12 months after, we have a so-called responsible Minister of State making statements here for publication in the Press.  It is small wonder that Deputy Little, when speaking on this debate 12 months ago, pointed out the danger of reading one newspaper only.  In his contribution at that time, he concentrated to a high degree on the importance of acting up to the true sense of the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, but Deputy Little did not realise that, within 12 months, people would be asked to read in a national newspaper a statement by a responsible Minister which was completely and utterly false. I believe that that in itself should be an answer to any of those members who said that the farm worker could not benefit under Deputy Norton's scheme in a just proportion owing to his rate of wages.  As we are on the question of the farm worker, there is one matter which should never be lost sight of.  Never in the history of this country, until the introduction of Deputy Norton's Bill, was any provision made so that the farm worker could enjoy the benefit of unemployment insurance as was the case with industrial workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> I am not interested in praising or condemning the action of any Governments. I would prefer to concentrate on present and future problems.  However, when members of the Government come here and try to force the issue to such an extent that they are trying to convince everyone outside this House that they and they alone are the only people interested in social securities for farm workers, I will ask them to tell us now why, during all the years that they governed the country, they never realised the importance, socially or otherwise, of the farm worker?  I ask, them why they never realised that even under the Constitution, about which we hear so much, every individual has a God-given right or, if they realised it, why the farm workers were denied such a right until Deputy Norton introduced his Bill?  No claim was ever heard on behalf of the farm workers by the present Government during their former period of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan took, what appears to some of us, a new line in opposing this Bill last year.  He went so far as to point out the terrible dangers inherent in the Norton Bill.  The greatest of all, in the view of that knowledgeable Deputy from County Wicklow, was that if we were to give this social security scheme to the workers it would improve the case of the vested interests in unemployment.  If we were to try to judge these words as expressed by Deputy Cogan I think we are also entitled to judge the same words expressed by the Minister in his introductory speech and expressed by some members&mdash;Cork members, unfortunately&mdash;of his Party who agreed with him outspokenly and otherwise in this connection.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that, while he is not giving the advantages of pensions at the age of 65, the worker can receive unemployment benefit if he is unemployed or sickness benefit if he is ill.  That will naturally be taken in line with the dangers which Deputy Cogan pointed out with regard to the vested interests in unemployment. Does Deputy Cogan or any other <Col N="972" /> Deputy who stood up here and agreed with these remarks realise what it is for workers to go day after day to employment exchanges and sign on for what is commonly called the dole?  How many members of this House who may agree with high-faultin ideas about employment exchanges or national health offices had ever to go through the mill themselves?  If they had to go through it they would not express any view in favour of such a scheme.  As a member of the Labour Party, I will speak as one who had to go through the mill.  I and many like me found very little pleasure and very little comfort in going to the employment exchanges. Men in Cork City at the present time have to go down to the labour exchange in Union Quay every morning to sign on.  We are expected to agree that the working man, on reaching the age of 65 or 66, can go down to the labour exchange every morning to be greeted with open arms by officials awaiting his arrival and to be considered by them, as one of their favoured clients and ready to give him money because he is unemployed.  We all know the hardships of the unemployed man.  I say here and now that it ill becomes any member of any Party to say there is nothing wrong in expecting a man to continue going to labour exchanges between the years of 65 and 70, if he is not employed, because of his advancing years.</P>
    <P>That is one of the vilest expressions one could use considering that, according to the last returns issued, there are roughly 74,000 people unemployed. Is it a luxury for those people to consider themselves as being idle, to consider themselves as a special class enjoying the special privilege of going to a labour exchange every morning? No matter what Deputy McGrath, or any other Deputy, or even the Minister himself may say, the outstanding feature in Deputy Norton's Bill, from the point of view of the working people, was the fact that they were entitled, if they so wished, to retire at the age of 65.  This was a great advantage to a man after rearing a family, that family having married and left their father and mother to build homes of their own; that man could <Col N="973" /> at least say that, if he found the work a little more strenuous in those later years, under Deputy Norton's Bill, provision was made for him.  The fact was accepted that he had served his country well and because of that he was able to retire on a pension at 65.</P>
    <P>A member of the Government Party made a statement here last year on this particular subject.  I do not wish to single out members and use their names but the fact that they have expressed certain views naturally forces us to draw attention to them. One member, because he probably believed in his heart that what he was saying was true, stated, at column 93, Volume 125, of the Official Debates, 4th April, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The rot and the decay in the rural areas, which has caused so many of our boys and girls to leave the country to search for employment across the seas, will get a decided fillip under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If even Deputy Norton's Bill was not going to be a help to prevent unemployment or to prevent workers from leaving the country, how can we for one moment believe that this present Bill before us will be any better.  When Deputy Ormonde and so many other Deputies believed that, because 500,000 people were not included in this Bill, the dangers were so apparent that emigration would continue at full flood, surely it must be doubly true now that the farmers are excluded because they had the right under the previous Bill to form a co-operative society and to gain all the benefits in that Bill, except in cases of illness and unemployment which we knew could not be effectively operated.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, if they were able under that Bill to gain the other advantages under this important system of social security, why is it that this Bill is denying them any such right?  Why is it that in a democratic Party a Minister, in spite of all the statements made by members of his own Party because they believed that the views they expressed were correct, comes along now offering a Bill which is completely the reverse of the expressed <Col N="974" /> views of those members in the past. All I can say in that respect is that the Minister represents a certain type of Hoffman seeing the evil spirits all around him.  Surely when he stood up to speak on the importance of this Bill, he must have cast his eyes across the House, visualised the situation 12 months ago and seen members of his own Party clamouring for the improvements which they demanded should be included in that Bill; he must either be a wonderful man to say that he could submerge completely all those members of his Party or else it must be that these members were too weak to demand from the Minister provision for the sections of the people that they themselves were so deeply interested in 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the community that is being left out of the present Bill&mdash;domestic servants.  I am sorry to say that the Minister found it suitable to omit this section.  He stated last Thursday that because there was no fear of unemployment in this type of work and because these girls would not perhaps be in need of such benefits, he thought there was no need to include them.  Why should he come to such conclusions so hastily, because I believe he must have come hastily to this conclusion.  How many women, girls at one time, advanced in years now, have worked all their lives as domestic workers in private homes and other places, who have never got any more than a national health stamp in the case of illness?  They would get that meagre protection which is allowed under the National Health Acts.  Why is it that some provision is not going to be made for these people at the latter end of their lives? Some of them may suffer hardship because, having worked for these people for many years these families may move or emigrate.  As in the case of a man at 65, she may find it difficult to get other employment.  She may be in the position that no one belonging to her own family is alive and she may have no alternative but to go to the county home.  We know these things to be true; we know they have happened in the past.  I have known cases where women, having given hard, <Col N="975" /> long years of toil, never had anything to fall back on because, God knows, we realise their wages were not such as would give them a chance of saving for the rainy day.  Therefore, I consider even at this stage that the Minister should consider the right of inclusion for such a section in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another section which has been excluded is the female agricultural worker.  What has been said of domestic workers must even more so apply to female agricultural workers. I have seen old women out thinning turnips in hard weather.  I know the wages they get.  Some of them were supposed to be regularly employed but the wages they got for being so regularly employed was nothing to shout about.  If we are deeply interested, instead of merely giving lip service to true Christian ways of life, we should provide for these female agricultural workers protection in the latter end of their lives.  The Minister may say in the case of domestic workers that they may get married and retire from such work after a period of years, but if that is so, the fact that they have a number of years standing to their credit can be an incentive, or would be an incentive under the original scheme of last year, to continue as voluntary contributors to obtain the benefits which would come to them.  Even if we are to consider the national health schemes of the past, I know a large number of workers who contributed year after year without getting one penny out of it.  We know that it is by the accumulation of such moneys that the fund is built up to a high level.</P>
    <P>Last year the present Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, took part in this debate.  He was most anxious, as he invariably is, to abuse everybody. Very few escaped his tongue on that occasion.  He said that the Bill introduced in 1951 was framed by self-seeking politicians in an effort to gain the urban votes.  He accused the members of the Government and of the various Parties supporting the Government of being false to one section of the community, a section he considered the hardest working section, namely, <Col N="976" /> the farmers and others employed on the land.  He almost shed tears on behalf of these hard-working people because the then Government was not providing them with the benefits he would like them to get.  He was most wrathful in his condemnation of the Bill.  He did not dream then &mdash; this man who was so deeply interested in these hard-working people &mdash; that the day would come when it could be proved that the members of the inter-Party Government and the members of the Parties comprising that Government were more solicitous for the welfare of these people than Deputy MacEntee would ever be.</P>
    <P>If Deputy MacEntee was then as interested as he professed to be, surely now as Minister for Finance he could discuss with the Minister for Social Welfare the necessity for including these people.  He drew attention last year to a particular line taken by Deputy Captain Cowan and myself when the Social Welfare Bill was before the House.  Both of us had drawn attention to statements made by a certain clergyman.  Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, attacked us viciously for the line we took and the views we expressed. He stated that we had used our privileged position to abuse those who endeavoured to recall to our minds the moral issue at stake.</P>
    <P>If there was a moral issue at stake 12 months ago, surely it is still at stake to-day.  If Deputy MacEntee at that time considered the views expressed by such the ologians in their own sphere, as it were, to be correct then, they must be equally correct to-day.  If they found it convenient at that time to condemn the Bill, surely in justice to everyone they must more than condemn the present one unless it was merely a political game.  If there was room to attack us on the moral issue at stake at that time, where do we stand in relation to the present Bill?  Even the concessions we offered to these 500,000 people in our Bill have not been offered to them in this measure.  I would invite those who told us there was as much justification for free love as for free spectacles to tell us now why they found it suitable to attack the Bill 12 months ago and <Col N="977" /> now find it suitable to remain silent on the present Bill which does not give half the advantages we proposed to give?</P>
    <P>I remember reading an editorial in a certain magazine prior to the last election.  That editorial finished with the sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Norton goes, social security will go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The writer of that editorial seemed to take pride in the fact.  The main contributor to that magazine said that we at that time would make drones of the workers if we gave them social security.  To some extent he was right in what he said because time has proved that when Norton went a good part of social security went with him, the most important part of it, namely, the right of a man to receive a few shillings at an age when he could enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that a scheme was ready in 1948 when Deputy Norton took over.  Yet, 12 months ago we had Deputy MacEntee here telling us:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In conclusion, let us come together and try to devise another scheme which will encourage voluntary adherence to a scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there was a scheme almost completed in 1947-48 when Deputy Norton took over the Department of Social Welfare why then should Deputy MacEntee appeal to us 12 months ago to come together and try to devise a scheme which would encourage voluntary adherence.  Possibly the present Minister had some ideas of a scheme but it is obvious, reading the debate 12 months ago, that no other member of his Party knew anything about that scheme.  The Minister made no attempt to give us the details of that scheme, which had almost reached completion in 1947, according to him, when he had an opportunity of doing so on 2nd March last year.</P>
    <P>I think it ill-becomes the Minister that he should treat a colleague in such a disgraceful fashion.  He evidently left Deputy MacEntee up to the 2nd March last year in complete ignorance of his proposed scheme.  I believe <Col N="978" /> that, as Deputy Norton has said, there was nothing in existence except a scrap of paper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little and others spoke on the 1951 Bill.  Deputy Brennan thought the Bill would be of no use to the farm workers.  If that Bill was of no use to the farm workers even though they would get the advantage of the higher benefits because their wage was £3 10s. and over and it was intended to give them the right of retirement with pension at the age of 65, I wonder what will be said now about the present Bill because of the absence of such provisions. It frequently happens that a farm worker, by reason of the heavy type of manual work in which he was to engage, finds it difficult to continue at that type of heavy work after the age of 65 and, in fact, finds it difficult to get permanent employment after that age.  There is nothing for him but to march in gaily to the manager of the local employment exchange, if he is unemployed, or to await the Minister's cheque, if he is ill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, in the course of his speech, mentioned that very few advantages were accruing to the farm worker from the unemployment benefit.  Naturally, we differ with him there.  I have often seen the type of case where a farm worker, having worked for a large number of years with one employer, found that, through no fault of his employer, he was unemployed.  It is only natural, too, that an employer will consider himself when he finds that a man is reaching a stage when he cannot give a fair return for his wages and will get rid of him and, perhaps, take on a younger man.  When the older man finds himself unemployed, he tries to get employment elsewhere but, because he is advanced in years, he finds it impossible to get employment with the local authority or with any body else.  Such a farm worker could get no benefit under all the different Christian Governments we have had in the past&mdash;and even under the 1937 Fianna Fáil Constitution&mdash;except in times of ill-health, when he could draw a few shillings national health insurance. If such a worker found himself unemployed and in good health, there was nothing for him.  Surely, <Col N="979" /> therefore, Deputy Brennan was mistaken when he said the farm worker would get little advantage from the unemployment benefit.  Under the Bill, the farm worker would be entitled to all the benefits which an industrial worker would be entitled to when unemployed.  Surely, that was an incentive to the farm worker to pay his contributions.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the rates of contribution.  In the case of the average worker in industrial employment the contribution amounted, roughly, to 1/7 per week.  I readily agree that in the case of the farm worker it would, at the outset, have cost more because up to the present no provision was made to enable the farm worker to benefit under the different Acts relating to employment. Because of the fact that the farm worker was paying only national health insurance his contributions under the Bill would have seemed to be much higher but the farm workers in South Cork, and in various other areas with which I have been connected, would much prefer to pay their contributions into a scheme under which they could benefit than be the victims of a system of pauperism or free doles, which so often has been their fate under successive governments and not alone under our native governments.  Not far from my own home there is a road known as &ldquo;Charity Road&rdquo;.  That road was built at the time of the Famine in order to give a few of the unfortunate people living in the district some employment for a while and to give them the charity of earning a very small sum of money to help them and their families.  The farm worker does not want charity.  He wants to be treated as the decent, respectable Irishman which, thank God, he is.  In order to be entitled to benefit under the Bill the farm worker would be willing to pay his contribution.  The Minister should be honest and tell the country that this Bill is only part of a truly comprehensive Bill on social security.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Norton's Bill was under discussion the present Minister <Col N="980" /> for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee, said that it could be considered not as social justice but as social injustice. I believe that that remark, which he applied to Deputy Norton's Bill, would be more appropriate to the present Fianna Fáil Bill.  We should admit that this Bill is only a step in the direction of a comprehensive social security Bill.</P>
    <P>A statement which was made by Deputy Allen on Deputy Norton's Bill &mdash;Official Report, column 577, Volume 125, No. 4&mdash;should, I think, be investigated. At that time Deputy Derrig, Deputy Little and Deputy Childers&mdash; no doubt because of their experience and because of their study of financial matters&mdash;were asking where we were going to get the money to finance that Bill.  Let us remember that, during the lifetime of the inter-Party Government, the Fianna Fáil Opposition Party were continually drawing attention to the annual increase in the Estimates.  Last year, on the discussion on Deputy Norton's Bill, these very Deputies pointed out that the scheme would cost so much that they were afraid that the State would not be able to stand up to the responsibilities placed on it.  Let us now examine what Deputy Allen is reported as saying at column 577 of Volume 125, No. 4, of the Official Report.  He said that the Fianna Fáil scheme&mdash;Deputy Dr. Ryan's scheme&mdash; would cost millions a year less than Deputy Norton's scheme.  Time proves everything.  We have had to wait 12 months to realise how true Deputy Allen's words were.  Statements published in the newspapers at that time mentioned that the scheme that Fianna Fáil would put forward would have all the advantages of Deputy Norton's Bill, excepting retiring allowances at 65.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They mentioned further that the scheme would be so reasonable that there would be no increase in the contributions and that the advantages would be enormous to the people.  He did not tell us at that stage that he would find it so convenient to slice out of Deputy Norton's <Col N="981" /> Bill some of the most important advantages which it conferred.  I give full credit to Deputy Allen for realising then that the Bill as mentioned by the present Minister when he was in opposition envisaged reductions in some of the benefits to such an extent that it would, as Deputy Allen stated, cost millions of pounds less every year.</P>
      <P>On the question of old-age pensions, much has been said in this House about the rate of pensions now and in the past.  All I would say in that regard is that the present rate of £1 per week is not adequate.  I am not blaming the present Minister for that. I shall go so far as to say that both the present Minister and his predecessor may have encountered difficulties in trying to finance the various schemes.  I do not know; as back benchers, naturally we cannot be expected to know the various difficulties that arise in providing moneys for the various schemes that we as ordinary Deputies so frequently wish to see put through the House.  Yet we must admit that an old-age pension of 20/- per week is nothing we can really shout about.  It is nothing we can shout about to people across the border, or to people in some continental countries who never boast as we do that they have Catholic and Christian Governments.  Yet the Governments of these countries were able to provide social security and old-age pensions on a scale unknown to us, notwithstanding the fact that many of these countries had to undergo years of warfare and to suffer destruction of all descriptions.  Thanks be to God we escaped all that, and having escaped it, surely we should be prepared to say that we are willing to strain our resources to the last to provide adequate pensions for old persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister stated in 1947 that a pension of 12/6 was good at that time but even if we take into consideration the increase in the cost of living since then, we still say that 12/6 was not a good pension in 1947.  No matter what Government is in power it is essential, if we believe in a true Christian concept of life, to give to old people that to which they are entitled <Col N="982" />&mdash;a decent allowance at the end of their lives.</P>
    <P>What some members of the Government Party forget is that in December, 1947 there were roughly 149,000 old age pensioners in the country, drawing pensions ranging from 1/- a week up to 10/- a week.  Some members conveniently forget to acknowledge the fact that in September, 1950 the number of pensioners was increased from 149,000 to 161,000.  Apart from the increase in the numbers who were entitled to pensions, the most important aspect was that the smallest pension anyone of the 161,000 could get was 5/-.  It was left to the inter-Party Government and to the Minister for Social Welfare in that Government, Deputy Norton, to break away completely from the system whereby an old person at the age of 70 could be offered a pension of 1/- a week.  Their action meant, that starting at 5/- and rising by half-crowns up to 17/6, one move forward was made in the old-age pensions code which in itself was more realistic in facing the difficulties which had to be encountered by these old people than any Act passed in previous years.  I say to those members who wish to forget this fact and to the Minister himself that it would be well to dwell on the significance of offering 1/- a week to an old-age pensioner. The Minister must remember that in the 1948 Election the present Government Party put before the people a leaflet entitled &ldquo;A Plan for Social Security&rdquo;.  In that plan for social security they were prepared not alone to give pensions at 65 but the present Minister stated on the 2nd March, 1951, as reported in Col. 1121 of the Dail Debates of that date, that a person should be entitled to £2 per week as a full pension.  What a strange reaction it was a couple of weeks afterwards to introduce an amendment which cut completely across that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will say that the sooner we face up to the real difficulties which are affecting this State and which are reacting to the detriment of our people, socially and economically, the better it will be for everybody. The sooner the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, <Col N="983" /> and the other members of the Party who devoted so much time 12 months ago to condemnations of the then Minister for not giving enough to these people, realise that it is not right or proper in a Christian country to make pawns or playthings of the old or the poor, the better it will be for all concerned. These old people, living in impoverished conditions owing to circumstances beyond their control, look to the State for that little help to which they should be entitled.  Some may say that our conception means that we are expected to believe that social security means personal security. Let us get away from all that.  I say that we can never get away from it so long as the attitude of the Minister who came into this House last Thursday to attack viciously other Deputies, prevails.  We cannot expect any improvement in debates in this House so long as we have the line of conduct pursued by Deputies such as was adopted by Deputy McGrath last Friday when he used a nick-name in reference to Deputy Norton.  I abhor nick-names.  I have heard the name &ldquo;long Ned&rdquo; used inside and outside this House but I say that kind of conduct will get us nowhere.  We are here at the express wish of the people of Ireland.  If the old bitterness is to continue, it must simply mean that the sole aim of Deputies is to try and score political advantages over one another.</P>
    <P>The members and the Ministers who intentionally, or otherwise, make a false statement and get it published in the Press the following day in connection with agricultural workers, will realise that the day is coming when the Irish people, realising the advantages which should be theirs but which very often are not theirs, will say: &ldquo;Enough, no more, we will decide for ourselves if you fail to decide for us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Watching Deputy Mulcahy here last week hammering his desk so hard and pressing his case in this debate, reminded me of the professor giving a lecture on law.  He said &ldquo;If you have your facts hammer them home,&rdquo; and the student said <Col N="984" />&ldquo;what happens if you have not got the facts?&rdquo; He replied &ldquo;Hammer the desk.&rdquo;  That is what struck me last week when I listened to Deputy Mulcahy say that it was Fianna Fáil policy down through the years to sneer at labour, to sneer at labour organised and unorganised; in other words to sneer at the worker.  Now, that is not a fact, no matter how hard Deputies opposite may thump or hammer their desks.  They know well what the facts are.  I do not want to recite the litany of Fianna Fail's record on the question of social security and social service. The facts were stated by the Minister when he said that the expenditure on social services in 1931-32 totalled £3,250,000 while in 1951-52 it totalled £12,750,000.  These facts alone should bear this out, that we in Fianna Fáil have never sneered at the workers.  I do not want, as Deputy Desmond has said, to bring any bitterness into this debate, but on the other hand can it not be truthfully stated that Deputy Mulcahy's Party, in the person of Deputy McGilligan when one time he was a Minister, not only sneered at the workers but snarled at them.</P>

We heard a great deal from Deputy Norton and Deputy MacBride before they became Ministers.  They were confident that they could produce a first-class, attractive and beautiful scheme which would give Utopian social services.  Despite the great spirit of comradeship which Deputy Mulcahy told us existed between the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party what was forthcoming after close on three and a half years?  Deputy Norton's Bill, but as somebody has stated here it was a Bill which it was never intended was to be an Act Maybe that is nearer the truth.</P>

      <P>Surely, you have as good a knowledge of English as I have. He is open to consider it and, therefore, the matter is not closed.  Is not that a simple way of looking at it? I would say that, from my experience in Dublin City, there is certainly a case for consideration of death benefits. I have lived and worked amongst the very poor and I am not one bit ashamed to admit it.  If you ask social workers or insurance agents, particularly those who work for friendly societies, you will find that time and again people lapse their policies.  In some cases that is due to neglect and in other cases to hard times.  Many agents for friendly societies keep these people in benefit through good will. You will also find Brothers of the St. Vincent de Paul Society paying premiums for these people to keep them in benefit.  That should not happen in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are facts that I know of. I can assure Deputy Davin that I was not put up to say what I am saying. I am speaking from my own experience. No later than last week I was approached in connection with the case of an old lady in my constituency whose insurance policies had lapsed. The agent could do nothing in regard to that case.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware of it or not, but if you miss ten weeks' premiums on an industrial insurance policy you get notice from the society and, after four weeks, unless you reduce the arrears to pay the 18 weeks' premiums, you are out of benefit.  This old lady had paid premiums for years and all <Col N="989" /> that was coming to her was the cash surrender value of her policy.  That was not sufficient to bury her.  I know that the agent in that case had time and again paid the premium for her.  Of course, that is illegal because an agent must not have any insurable interest in a policy, but that agent kept that old lady in benefit time and again.  He has to live and he could not afford to keep doing this all the time.  Anyway he gave up paying the premium.  The old lady died and a collection had to be made in the neighbourhood for her burial.  It may not be so in the country, but in the poorer districts of Dublin they go round collecting with a sugar bag when a person dies who has no insurance policy.  That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to make political capital out of this, but I feel very keenly about it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should at the earliest opportunity look into that matter.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see increased old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  I feel, however, that the people know well that this Government or any other Government could not do much better in the present financial state of the country.  This Bill is a step in the right direction. While it may not meet everybody's requirements, I am sure it is satisfactory up to a point.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies opposite do not think that I tried to bring any heat into this debate.  If they do think it, I am prepared to apologise.  I am a newcomer here, but whether my stay will be long or short, I do not intend to tread on anyone's corns or to be abusive.  If Deputies opposite think so, I have no means of trying to convince them otherwise.  I am doing my best and giving the facts as I know them. Any statements I have made I am prepared to stand over them.  So far as I know, the members of this Party are not put up to say anything.  We do not dash to a Minister's room and ask, &ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo; I am speaking entirely on my own and I want no guidance from Deputy Davin or anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in <Col N="990" /> this debate, for only a very short space of time I hope, merely to express my own declaration of faith on the subject of social security and in order to dissipate the kind of suggestions which have been made in the course of this debate by certain sections of the House, not confined to the Fianna Fáil Party, and which have been hinted at, if not repeated, by the Deputy who has just spoken.  I have no intention of going in detail through the differences which exist between the Bill now before the Dáil and the Bill which passed its Second Reading under the auspices of the inter-Party Government. I want to state emphatically and clearly that the provisions in the Social Security Bill introduced by Deputy Norton when Minister for Social Welfare and to which a Second Reading was given after very considerable opposition by Fianna Fáil and certain farmer Deputies represented our policy and represented the unanimous policy of the then inter-Party Government.  It still represents the Fine Gael policy.</P>
      <P>Any Deputy who alleges that there was some sort of concealed trick on the part of the Fine Gael Party in connection with that social security measure which was given a Second Reading in this House some 12 months ago is saying something which from this time forward he must know to be false because there is no truth in it. That Bill was given the benediction of Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance.  I am entitled to say here and do say that, within the limits of the duty imposed on him by the Constitution and by his trust to the taxpayers, Deputy McGilligan was never in any way opposed to the expenditure of public money on proper social services and the Bill as it emerged and was passed on Second Reading in this House had his entire benediction, as it had mine and that of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party who were then in the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only proper, having regard to certain suggestions made, that I should on the Second Reading of this Bill pay a tribute to the farmer Deputies who supported Deputy Norton's Bill when it was introduced in this House and <Col N="991" /> who, by so doing, jeopardised their own political future.  They walked into the Division Lobby last year in support of that Bill, many of them under threat from their own constituents that if they voted for that Social Security Bill they would lose their seats at any future general election because of the so-called hostility of the farmers to that measure.  That they took the risk at that time is something that the people ought to remember to the farming community and to those Deputies in particular. In fact, many of those Deputies who appeared to be taking their political future into their hands had the satisfaction of topping the poll at the subsequent general election which took place a few weeks afterwards, thereby giving the lie to the suggestion that the decent farmers of this country were not prepared to do their share in so far as they were called upon to do it by the provision of moneys and benefits for people who have to be secured against the accidents of life.</P>
    <P>I regret the present Government omitted from this Bill the provision contained in the Social Security Bill sponsored by Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare enabling farmers to form co-operative societies and voluntarily bring themselves within the scope of that measure.  We realise quite well the difficulty of dealing with the farming community in a matter of this kind, the difficulty of asking them to pay taxes for which they were getting no return in the way of benefits. At least, an effort was made in the particular provision which we had in that Bill to enable small farmers, or farmers under a certain valuation, to bring themselves in some way within the scope of a social security measure. I regret that the present Government has left that out.  I regret that the present Government has left out the deaths benefits.  I regret that the present Government, in this Bill, has made no reference to old age pensions for women at 60 and men at 65.</P>
    <P>I think it can be asserted without any danger of contradiction that all Parties in this House and all sections of the community are agreed on certain <Col N="992" /> fundamental principles in connection with social securities.  We have long since passed the days of <i>laissez faire</i> liberalism when it was left to everyone to provide for himself or to starve.  It is recognised that everyone in the State must help in providing against the accidents of life for at least certain sections of the community.  There will be and there should be controversy as to the extent to which the State should be called upon to contribute and as to whether the welfare State is the proper method of dealing with existing modern conditions or whether the habits of thrift and personal initiative, which are so vital to building up a decent nation and a decent community, should be rather encouraged than that people should be permitted to test all measures of social security that come before any Parliament as simply: &ldquo;What am I going to get out of it for nothing?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We may differ on our approach to schemes of social security and as to the people who ought to be brought within it.  It may be that circumstances and difficulties on financial matters may prevent a particular Government or any Government from going as far as they would wish along the line of providing for the accidents of life for all sections of the community. But one of the really fundamental matters in a measure of this kind is the fact that the people who are brought within the scope of such a measure are those contributing to the benefits which they will subsequently enjoy, and they will enjoy those benefits if and when circumstances are such as to call for the granting of those benefits to them, in the certain knowledge that they are not receiving public charity or putting their hands into the pockets of their neighbours; that they are getting something to which they have contributed, and which adds to their own conceit of themselves and their own pride in their initiative.  They can derive satisfaction from the fact that they themselves have helped to provide for the situation which confronts them when they are called upon to draw those benefits.  That is one of the reasons I regret the absence of the death benefits and the absence <Col N="993" /> of the provision for old age in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the impact of misfortune would fall most on unmarried women when they come to the age of 60 years and they find themselves after a long time of hard work faced with a future which is somewhat bleak, perhaps due to the fact that they have in the course of their hard work sustained, not a very serious illness but an illness which cripples them or incapacitates them in part from carrying on their full duties.  I think it is right that unmarried people of this kind should be entitled to the provision of social security, that they should be entitled themselves, by their own contributions and their own thrift, to look forward to the time when, if circumstances so require, they may be entitled to retire if they so wish at the age of 60, or 65 in the case of a man.</P>
    <P>My understanding of Deputy Norton's proposals was that nobody was bound to retire.  A woman at 60 was not bound to retire when she reached that age or a man when he reached 65.  If she or he felt in a position to continue working and not to draw a pension, they could do so. It is unfortunate that that particular provision is left out of the Bill.  I make my own declaration of faith here to-day publicly that I am in favour of such a provision and always was in favour of it when it was put into Deputy Norton's Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of the provisions in this Bill dealing with a grant on marriage.  I was not in favour of it when it was considered by Deputy Norton.  I am still not in favour of it on ethical and social grounds, but I am very strongly in favour of provision for death benefits.  I happen to know something about the City of Dublin and the poor people of the City of Dublin. I am personally aware of the horror that haunts Dublin people, particularly working people, throughout the whole of their working lives, the fear that they will be buried in a pauper's grave.  That horror and that fear is endemic to many of the working people of the City of Dublin.  It has not been in any way assuaged by the provision <Col N="994" /> which they were enabled to make by means of contributions to insurance collecting societies.  They had the unfortunate experience of paying their weekly sums, week after week, to many of these collecting societies and finding then that it lapsed or that some technical mistake or error was made enabling the particular company to escape liability.  Some effort was made in the Insurance Act of 1936 to deal with many of the injustices that had been in existence for so long in connection with collecting insurances and insurances against death.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that one of the reasons at least why the particular provisions that were in Deputy Norton's Bill dealing with death benefits were omitted from the present Bill had something to do with political considerations. We know that there are large numbers of people here in Ireland earning their living, and earning a decent and honest living, collecting these weekly payments from people who effect small policies of insurance. I know that these people were fearsome of the effects which Deputy Norton's Bill might have on their livelihood. But I took the view at the time, and still take the view, that so far from prejudicing the livelihood of those people making their livelihood in collecting these weekly sums, they would eventually benefit from the provisions of this Bill, because people would know that they were secure under the social security provisions against the horror of not having sufficient money decently to bury them after their death.  They would know that that was secure and the money they were in the habit of putting in that particular form of insurance would almost certainly be put into other forms of endowment which would be a benefit to the people and would fill the gap that might be left by the people giving up the habit that they had of paying into the societies contributions for death benefits.  I do not think they would be in any way prejudiced, but I do feel, whether they are or not, the situation should be faced that our social conditions require that people who insure themselves against the hazards and risks of life, unemployment, <Col N="995" /> illness and death, should be protected and that they should have the peace of mind which comes to them from knowing that when they die they will not be themselves buried in a pauper's grave or a near pauper's grave.  Their relatives will have the wherewithal decently to bury them and respectably give them a funeral which is valued so much certainly by people in the City of Dublin and by all sections of the Irish community.</P>
    <P>While I affirm my declaration of faith in that I want to say, I am not in favour of marriage allowances and never was.  Social insurance, as I have said repeatedly in the course of the few remarks I have just made, is an insurance against the hazards and risks of life.  I do not think we have yet come to the point where marriage is regarded as one of the hazards or risks of life.  I do not think we have yet come to the point where marriage is regarded as one of the hazards or risks of life.  At all events, it is nothing to insure against.  In my view, the persons who enter that state, both men and women, are bound to work for it, to save their money beforehand so as to provide themselves with a home and furniture.  This will ensure a decent pride in their own achievement and will give them the feeling they have earned the right to enter into the married state without having to ask the taxpayer to contribute, even in a small way, so as to encourage them to that end.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the class of people who will be brought within the ambit of this particular measure, at all events, or within the ambit of any other social security measure are the kind of people who require to be encouraged to marry.  Had there been a provision in the Bill to encourage elderly men in the farming community to marry, there might be something to be said for such a provision.  However, a Bill of this kind which deals very largely, if not exclusively, with industrial workers does not need a provision encouraging marriage.  Early marriage is the rule with such people. As I have said already, from ethical and social reasons, it is far better that those people should set about the job of getting married in an earnest way and should regard it as a matter to be <Col N="996" /> achieved through their own efforts by way of thrift and personal initiative. They will find themselves in a far better position as a result of entering the married state through their own achievements rather than making an improvident marriage through relying upon the benefits which they would get, to some extent, from the taxpayers bounty.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect in this Bill to which I do not entirely subscribe; that is the ceiling of £600.  The measure introduced by Deputy Norton, which got its Second Reading in this House, had no ceiling.  I am quite prepared to admit that the question of a ceiling of £600 and no ceiling is one on which there could be and, I feel, there ought to be legitimate differences of opinion.  We provided for that in the Bill sponsored by the inter-Party Government by establishing the principle that all parties who were working under a contract of employment came, <i>prima facie,</i> or originally within, the Bill.  We put in that Bill what I regard as a very vital provision in connection with the scheme of social security, a provision enabling certain classes of the community or certain classes of working people working under a contract of service, to opt out of the Bill provided they made and established a case to the satisfaction of the Government. There are a number of people engaged in good class employment&mdash; first class employment &mdash; whose employers, for a long number of years before there was any scheme of State social security or, indeed, such scheme was ever thought of or put into operation, have provided benefits for them in the way of sick benefits, death benefits and pensions.  Those people were faced with the problem or having to pay their contributions under the Social Security Bill and also, perhaps, under the particular schemes attaching to their own industry.  They did not know whether they were to get one set of benefits or double benefits.  We provided for that by enabling the employees of the Electricity Supply Board &mdash;I do not mean to be regarded as giving those as a specific example&mdash; the employees of Coras Iompair Eireann and the employees of <Col N="997" /> Guinness's which are all still contributing to very good schemes of social security, to opt for exclusion from the Bill and establish their right not to pay double contributions when, perhaps, they would only receive one set of benefits.</P>
    <P>In the amendment moved by Deputy Norton to this Bill, he wishes to remove the ceiling of £600.  Speaking for myself, I would agree very strongly with that proposal provided it is linked up with the provision in the Bill sponsored by the inter-Party Government enabling the classes who say that, through their own thrift and with the co-operation of their employers, they have provided a scheme of benefits for themselves as good as, if not better than, the scheme provided under the present Social Security Bill to opt for exclusion from the Bill.  They should be entitled to make their case to the Government&mdash;I underline the word Government&mdash;and not to the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; who should be prepared to make an Order excluding them from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to wind up my remarks by insisting, on my own personal conviction at all events, that, no matter what scheme of social security is brought in, personal thrift and private initiative should be safeguarded and not menaced, and that every encouragement should be given to private individuals to increase their private savings. In the course of the next few days, and for the next few weeks, we will have to consider the financial situation in this country.  We have been insisting for a long time that one of the methods of salvation from our financial ills is to encourage private savings and the initiative of private enterprise by way of private investment.  I submit to this House that in any scheme of social security, we must safeguard and encourage, and by no means discourage, the right of each individual to save from his or her earnings a certain amount to provide for the accidents of life, such as illness and death, and to provide also for old age.</P>
    <P>A scheme sponsored by the State, even in part financed by the taxpayer, should only supplement and not supplant <Col N="998" /> the initiative and the effort of the private individual to look after himself.  I emphasise strongly the view that that is one of the things that is urgently required in this country.  If it is encouraged and emphasised, and if habits of thrift and personal initiative in matters of thrift are encouraged, not merely will the taxpayer be relieved of a possible burden but there will also be built up in this country a far better outlook on life.  We will have far better citizens and a far better scheme of social security.  I want Deputies, when considering this Bill, to bear in mind what has been said by the speakers on the opposite side of the House and what will be said in the course of the debate as to the principal difference between the Government's present Bill and that which was sponsored by the inter-Party Government and introduced by Deputy Norton when Minister for Social Welfare, remembering the differences there were between the economic situation as it existed at the time when Deputy Norton's Bill was before the House and conditions as they are at the present moment.</P>
    <P>His Bill was framed on the basis of a certain minimum of unemployment. Unemployment has since risen. His Bill was framed in the light of the policy of the then Government which aimed at securing, as far as it was humanly possible to secure it, full employment for our people.  It was in that atmosphere and with that aim and object that we introduced that Bill and the provisions contained therein.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced in a very different atmosphere, an atmosphere of slump, uncertainty and unemployment. The calls that will be made upon the taxpayer in the present set of circumstances are entirely different from the calls that would have been made had conditions remained as they were when Deputy Norton's Bill was given its Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may and despite the arguments that may be based on the effect of present developments, we must insist on personal thrift; we must insist upon the right of the individual to provide for himself; we must insist <Col N="999" /> upon the duty of the individual to look after himself and his family so far as it is possible, for that will be good for himself, good for his family and good for the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the picture presented by the Minister for Social Welfare, many important considerations must spring to the minds of Deputies.  I believe that we are now coming to the end of an era in the social development of our country.  In so far as I represent the young men and women of to-day, and as an Independent Deputy, I feel it would be churlish were I to dismiss as unimportant and inconsiderable the achievements of the generations that have gone before us.  We will merit the right to criticise and possibly to denigrate their achievements, or their lack of achievement, when we ourselves have a little more to show for our own ability, understanding, integrity and honesty of purpose in the years that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>When speaking on this measure, Deputy General Mulcahy quoted at some length from the democratic programme laid before the First Dáil in 1919.  I think the programme has inherent in it an intensity of feeling in relation to the requirements and needs of a truly democratic people.  The sentiments contained in that programme and heir method of expression have never been betterd, in my view, in any similar Assembly in any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare, in the words of the Irish Republican Proclamation, the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be indefeasible, and, in the language of our first President, Pádraig Mac Phiarais, we declare that the nation's sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the nation, but to all its material possession, the nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the nation, and with him we reaffirm that all right to private <Col N="1000" /> property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In return for willing service, we, in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if those who had the privilege of being present when that proclamation was read are completely satisfied that they have discharged, to their own satisfaction, the undertakings and the guarantees given by those young men at that time, among whom they themselves were numbered.</P>
    <P>I share the view with both Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin that this Bill is in principle no different from the Bill introduced by the inter-Party Government with Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy Larkin at column 823 of the Official Report of 27th March said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as the two Bills are concerned it is quite a legitimate criticism to say that the present Bill is substantially the same, almost word for word, but in a truncated form, as the one we discussed in this House 12 months ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has the same advantages and the same objections, together with certain other disadvantages to which Deputy Larkin referred in a very fair-minded, level-headed, objective and extremely competent manner.  It would appear, therefore, that this Bill has additional defects as compared with that introduced by Deputy Norton but, despite that, it does, I think, represent the fruition of the achievements which these men on both sides of the House set before themselves 25 and 30 years ago in order to achieve equality of opportunity for all the children of our nation.  I do not know if they are completely satisfied.  Perhaps they are: perhaps they are not.  As an Independent Deputy I accept that decision of the House but as an individual starting out, as I hope I am, to work towards what I consider to be the fuller achievement of that democratic programme I believe that it fails in many respects to achieve all that is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> The Social Welfare Bill, as introduced by the present Minister, has, for him, a number of untypical disadvantages. I always like to associate the Minister and Fianna Fáil with probably the finest piece of social legislation ever introduced in this House. Incidentally-looking back, as I think most of us look back from time to time &mdash;all social legislation, from what I can gather, started in 1933&mdash;a significant date.  However, I like to associate the Minister with the fundamental principles of the 1947 Health Act&mdash;particularly in respect of a scheme which I attempted to implement in relation to a mother and child health service.  The full credit for the underlying principle there, for which I claim no credit&mdash; although I should very much like to claim full eredit for such an idea&mdash;rests with the Minister and with the Party which supports the Minister.  That principle was that a very necessary health service should be freely, readily, and without a means test, at the disposal of all mothers equally.  No insurance principle was involved at all.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is impossible to improve on that as a basic principle for social welfare schemes generally.  Here in Ireland, in particular, it is a terribly important consideration whether these schemes are made available as a right of citizenship or as a result of insurance contributions. The reason why I rejected insurance&mdash;and I think why the Minister accepts its defects&mdash;is that quite a considerable proportion of our population do not receive a regular weekly wage from their work on the land.  There is also the administrative difficulty of collecting insurance contributions from the small farming community generally.  The fact is that the very people you want to help most are people who are not improvident, as some short-sighted people accuse them, but who are simply so badly paid that they cannot afford to put by the money for insurance schemes and possible and inevitable contingencies.  Academic moralists who criticise schemes such as these in the comfort of their ivory towers condemn these people for not ensuring, in this modern community, that they can provide for these possible <Col N="1002" /> and inevitable contingencies.  These people cannot put by the money for insurance schemes or possible contingencies or even inevitable contingencies such as old age, death, maternity, and so forth.  These are the people whom most of us here, I think, are more anxious to help than any others.</P>
    <P>It is in consequence of that point, among others, that an insurance scheme has many defects in our largely rural community.  On one occasion when I was arguing the case for our special interest as a Christian people in that particular section of the community, the very, very poor, I was asked by a distinguished prelate why I should concern myself or bother the country with the expense of this small percentage who might have been subjected to a means test&mdash;&ldquo;Why not let them have it?&rdquo; and so forth.</P>
    <P>I do not think that as a Christian people&mdash;I am sorry to have to reiterate the word &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;: it has become very common in use and sometimes one wonders what it stands for&mdash;we can afford, as I felt at that time, to leave aside that section of our community, to humiliate them or allow them to be humiliated in any way simply because they do not fit into some nice well tied-up administrative category.  They are our responsibility &mdash;we here in the Oireachtas&mdash;and we cannot, because it is difficult to categorise them, dismiss them as an insuperable difficulty.  This Bill, as Deputy Norton's Bill, has, to a certain extent, neglected to take up the challenge of the problem of the very poor and the underprivileged and of those who, more than anyone else, require our help.</P>
    <P>When examining that Bill and the Health Bill I wondered to what extent, if any, the Minister or the Government felt tied by that&mdash;I must still admit to me&mdash;rather confusing entity known as Catholic social teaching on matters of progressive or social legislation of any kind.  It is confusing and I believe that if we are to make progress with any degree of safety we must have clarification of the extent to which we are bound by the conflicting decisions on the various matters <Col N="1003" /> raised from time to time.  I am a confirmed believer in what has been described as the Welfare State.  I believe in the Welfare State&mdash;and this is important and relevant on this debate&mdash;because, by it, I understand that the State accepts responsibility.  Should I not requote the democratic programme of the First Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare that the nation's sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the nation, but to all its material possessions, the nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing processes within the nation, and we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare... In return for willing service, we, in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Pádraig Mac Phiarais, President of the Republic, Deputy Mulcahy and many other Deputies in this House subscribed to that declaration&mdash;in my view a declaration of my conception of the Welfare State&mdash;that the State will take on responsibility for the protection of the aged, and the effect of accidents inseparable from loss of wages, old age, ill-health, unemployment and sickness and all the other disabilities inseparable from our lives in a modern community, that in giving access to these benefits provided by the community out of the community purse, the dominating motive shall be that the community provide these services in health and social welfare as one section of the community providing them for another section who will require them rather than as one class of the community providing them for another.</P>
    <P>As I have said I believe fervently in the Welfare State.  I intend to pursue ruthlessly and relentlessly, as long as I am in public life to the extent that I can do so, the achievment for our people of that equality in the treatment of these accidents and of the inevitable developments amongst the old <Col N="1004" /> and the weak.  As I say, I wondered when I read the Bill to what extent Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister, felt that he could not pursue, as far as he might have wished, the achievement of a truly equitable and just social security in regard to these matters but his statement to me, as a politician, requiring guidance if you wish, is confusing. We were told recently in a Lenten Pastoral&mdash;I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of February 25th&mdash;that &ldquo;the Welfare State, being in large measure the offspring of Socialism, insists that all should be on the same footing, and receive equal treatment&rdquo;. Then in a report of a lecture in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 31st March we are told that &ldquo;the Welfare State is a concept of Government more correctly termed &lsquo;paternalistic&rsquo;.  It was impossible not to recognise the generous impulses that were often behind it.  In so far as it represented a revulsion of feeling from the horrors of <i>laissezfaire</i>, or in so far as it promoted social justice, the Church would welcome it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I say, in passing, that Monsignor Ryan, who delivered that lecture, congratulated the present Taoiseach on the Constitution under which the perfectly constitutional 1947 Health Act was made law by this Oireachtas?  Nobody questioned the constitutionality of that Health Act&mdash;I do not intend to deal with it <i>in extenso</i> but it is relevant to the question of social teaching&mdash;nobody questioned the Health Act in relation to the fundamental principle of service being made available from the community purse to those who require it under the health provisions of the mother and child scheme.  I am well aware that in discussing these matters at all I am travelling along very thorny paths but I think if we are to achieve as Catholics&mdash;as most of us are&mdash;true equity in a Christian community, we must do it, knowing clearly the path which it is permitted for us to travel. I do not know if the Minister was concerned on that score.  If he was, all I can do is to point to his achievement under the 1947 Health Act, which is still there on the Statute Book.  There is no question as to its constitutionality or of its being repugnant to the Constitution. <Col N="1005" /> In the examination of our way of life and the social conditions under which we live, as far as I can see, our attitude appears to be to penalise the child of the improvident father or of the careless parents.  In looking through the whole gamut of our way of life, surely it is true to say that, of necessity, starting with infanthood, childhood and boyhood and going the whole way, the chances of a poor child losing his life are higher than those of the child of wealthy parents.</P>
    <P>The figures are there for anybody to see.  In our educational services, the dice is loaded against the child with ability but without wealth.  The universities and the professional schools all open to the self-same key-the money you have in your pocket and what you can pay.  It is true that a good education brings a man a good distance along the road towards providing for his family and achieving for himself the social security which you deny to the poor.  In old age&mdash;I referred to this before&mdash;you can buy security from our workhouses.  Some thousands of old people, men and women, in them are scattered throughout every county in Ireland.  I wonder how many Deputies have any intimate knowledge of the conditions under which they are living before passing from this world?  To my knowledge, there is no more materialist people, by clear provable example, than we are demonstrably living at present.  Every single aspect of our life&mdash;access to every way for improving and for achieving comfort and security&mdash;is open to the man who is wealthy.  I think that is a fair incontrovertible statement.</P>
    <P>From time to time, we, politicians, receive strictures for our interference with other aspects of the life of the country.  But, as politicians, we have no alternative but to deal with realities. We must deal with unemployment, emigration, bad health services, old people in county homes, neglect, orphan children, widows and so on, and the way in which we can deal with these problems is not simply by talking about them or by mouthing pleasant, comfortable platitudes.  We must in this House legislate for the deficiencies and the defects of our society.  The <Col N="1006" /> fact that those defects, provable, demonstrable defects, exist, in spite of the fact that these platitudes are being mouthed year after year with little real effect on the way of life of our people, leaves us, as politicians, with no alternative but to provide what admittedly is our make-shift answer to the needs of modern society.  We must step in where there is need.</P>
    <P>We have the example of politicians of other nations who have succeeded in achieving a large measure of social justice by means of legislation.  I mention, particularly, New Zealand and Sweden.  I believe that, short of their defence programme on which they have entered, Great Britain in a short time would also have achieved, under a Labour Government, a real measure of true social justice for all its people. We must, as politicians, bear in mind that, being a newsboy at a street corner in mid-winter or an emigrant hawking your bag up the gangway, or being unemployed with a family&mdash;not starving it is quite true but not having what you would like to give them&mdash;or being a child with ability and denied the right to develop that ability for lack of wealth or money, or being a widow separated from your children by a court of law through no fault of the judge's but just your fault because you have not money, or being an old person incarcerated in these cold and cheerless dungeons which we call our county homes: that all these are hard realities not only for the politicians but for the widows and the orphans. I do not wish to make this into an appeal, but these are painful realities which are there and which must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>A truism, too often repeated, becomes a platitude, and that is one of the reasons why I have always preferred to be more a man of action than one of mere words.  It is imperative that those who continue to impose these strictures, lectures and limitations on us politicians in our attempt to discharge our duties, as we consider best, must understand that it is not sufficient comfort for those people I speak of to know that they are in orphanages, in destitution or in want and need in such circumstances under <Col N="1007" /> the aegis of a truly Christian community.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very difficult for the Minister to bring in a proper and comprehensive Social Welfare Bill with no ceiling, no means test and, preferably, no contributions unless you have full employment in the country.  I believe that this Bill is a true measure of the poverty of the State 30 years after the declaration of the democratic programme. At the same time, it is what probably the country can afford.  It is a shameful thing that it is only what the country can afford.  It does not matter whether the number was 70,000 or 50,000 when we were there&mdash;I am not criticising any Government; one is as bad as the other&mdash;but that there are 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed men, capable of making a productive contribution to the wealth of the nation, walking around the streets, standing at street corners, drawing the dole or unemployment benefit of some kind, is a shameful reflection on the state of the country 30 years after that brave, courageous and magnificent declaration of a democratic programme.</P>
    <P>The continuation of emigration creates the same problem for the Government of the time, the loss of men capable of adding to the wealth of the community, that wealth which would make it easy to give proper social services to the community.  It is just like the private individual in a material society like ours where, if you have money, you can have everything. The Government say: &ldquo;We have not got the money because over the years we have not been efficiently or competently ruled.&rdquo;  However, as I say, I prefer not to criticise the past.  We can do better in the time that lies ahead of us.</P>
    <P>With the emigrants and the unemployed I also class as unemployed, in effect, so far as the productive wealth of the country is concerned, the true wealth of the country, the road workers.  I am well aware that that again is another political subject.  I consider these men, occupied, as they are, digging holes in the ground and <Col N="1008" /> filling them up again as being occupied on little better than relief work and I think that is unworthy of our State. It is more appropriate to the famine days than to modern society.  You can and you should find for these men well-paid productive work, adding again, as I have said, to the collective wealth of the community and the collective prosperity of our people.  These are the major failures of our successive Governments.  That all these men, able-bodied, intelligent, educated men, should be on road work is a serious indictment of our Governments.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Norton's amendments, I completely agree with them and I consider that they would improve the Bill.  I consider the £600 ceiling, the absence of provision for domestic workers and the absence of a death benefit are disadvantages in the Bill. But Deputy Norton cannot bluntly get away with what is a palpable political trick.  He is surely the last Deputy who should have tabled these amendments. He had the power, the authority and the money to do all these things over a period of three and a half years. He may think that he can confuse his constituents occasionally at public meetings, but most of the people are fairly hard-headed.  They are not unduly moved by the political wailings which we hear from Deputies.  His concern for a means test is what you might call his <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;the man who could campaign at the election and develop that delightful Ramsay MacDonaldish explanation of why we should have a means test in the mother and child scheme: why should the fur-coated ladies in Fitzwilliam Square get paid for by somebody in Connemara? Deputy Norton and the majority of the members of the Labour Party, I am afraid, have abdicated any right they may have thought they had to speak on behalf of the working people, the ordinary people of this country.  The Labour party have made declarations of very high-sounding and fine-sounding principles which we now know are nothing more than windy, flatulent platitudes.</P>

Without doubt, Deputy Norton would have the support of all who might be called Labour-minded Deputies in this House if his behaviour in the past had given anybody, or would give anybody, any reason to believe that, were he supported in this amendment, he would stand up for the people&mdash;the underprivileged people&mdash; for whom he can speak so eloquently. However, when the time of testing comes, he can run away very fast so unquestionably in the face of a vested interest from whatever direction it may come.  Here in Ireland, from what I have read and seen, we have only one way of dealing with a man who runs away either physically or morally; we do not trust him the second time.  I <Col N="1010" /> will make certain that I will try very hard indeed before giving Deputy Norton and his associates in the inter-Party Government&mdash;the Fine Gael organisation and the other organisations&mdash;an opportunity of restoring the Medical Association to the Custom House and the other similar powerful vested interests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>After the speech we have listened to from Deputy Dr. Browne, it is pertinent for Deputies in this House to examine their consciences, if they have any.  I do not propose to follow Deputy Dr. Browne in his principles with regard to social philosophy, which all of us hold dear, but which Deputy Dr. Browne attempts to monopolise.  It is very easy for Deputies in this House to talk as the patrons of the poor and the patrons of the oppressed and to more or less suggest they alone are entitled to talk on that matter.  I notice that the Deputy, when he spoke here, made reference to fighting and running away.  I notice that Deputy Dr. Browne, having made his speech, has fled from the House. He need not have feared as I did not intend to deal with him on this measure as, perhaps, it may be possible to deal with him elsewhere.  But I refer to examining one's conscience and I commend that as a maxim to Deputies on all sides of the House.  May I also suggest to Deputies, above all, that they should never endeavour to speak on both sides of a measure being thus discussed here?  That is a very difficult feat.  The Deputy who spoke last has attempted it.  He has told the <Col N="1012" /> House his political determination to see established here in Ireland a &ldquo;welfare State&rdquo;, an imported phrase from Britain.  That is his political belief, a welfare State, the paternal State caring and looking after every soul from the day he is born till he goes into his grave.  That is a political belief about which political wars have been fought in Britain and on the Continent and even in the New World.</P>
      <P>I can see a great deal to be said in favour of those who regard the welfare State as something essential provided their demand for it springs from the feelings of human generosity which are always regarded by us as Christian charity.  But I do not like any attempt to make a demand for a welfare State here as an argument to brand anyone who has doubts as being unchristian and uncharitable.  I think that is what Deputy Dr. Browne has endeavoured to do.  It leaves a bad feeling in most of us to hear speeches of that kind.  It makes one doubt the sincerity behind his remarks because a welfare State, as he has postulated it, is a State in which the idea of a means test is something abhorrent, something that cannot be regarded at all.  The welfare State <i>á la</i> Deputy Dr. Browne is not concerned with the possibility that the subject who has been so paternally cared for happens to be the winner of the Hospitals' Sweeps.  That is not the concern of the State.  Whether that person needs it or not, according to Deputy Dr. Browne, he must get care and attention under a welfare scheme from the State.  That is a point of view and it is not necessary for us here to discuss the arguments for and against it.  It is a point of view that has been argued extensively elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us just take from Deputy Dr. Browne's speech that one phrase &ldquo;means test&rdquo; and let us apply that to an examination of the sincerity of the political conviction which he has expressed in this debate, because we are discussing a proposal for legislation which epitomises the means test. We are discussing a proposal introduced by the present Minister for Social Welfare asking this Parliament of the Irish Republic to provide certain social aids and help for a particular <Col N="1013" /> section of our community, all those who earn less than £600 a year. That is the Bill which is before this House.  That is the Bill that Deputy Dr. Browne has discussed.  That is the Bill that Deputy William Norton asks this House to reject in favour of another.  The issue that confronts Deputy Dr. Browne is a simple one: is he or is he not in favour of a social welfare scheme that contains within it a test as to means?  That is the question which he knew he had to discuss when he rose to speak in this debate, and how very carefully, how very cleverly, how very astutely he discussed everything else but that particular question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to postulate the reasons as to the motives for his speech but I would like, if I can, to bring the debate back to what the real issue is.  When Deputy Norton was Minister for Social Welfare and had as his colleague Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;if there was a visitor in this House from another country he would scarcely believe it&mdash;after much research, after much investigation, he introduced into this House some 18 months ago a proposal for social security.  The details of that proposal are well known to most Deputies, conveniently forgotten by some.  The one outstanding feature of that proposal for social security was this, that there was no ceiling, no means test, no level with regard to employed persons visualised by that Bill; there was no limit of £500 a year, £600 a year, £700 a year or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>The proposal introduced by Deputy Norton provided social security as set out in the Bill for all sections of employed persons without regard to their means, without regard to the property they might have amassed through their thrift and effort over years.  That was the proposal that Deputy Dr. Browne, in his concluding remarks here this evening, said he was against although he voted for it&mdash; against it although it contains no means test, but he voted for it.  Here to-day he has expressed approval for a proposal containing a means test although he has sworn that his political conviction for so long as he is <Col N="1014" /> in public life will be to fight a means test.  I do not understand Deputy Dr. Browne.  I do not understand the purpose behind his speech here to-day and I cannot understand the arguments in which he indulged.  To me the colours are vivid colours; white is white and black is black; and I cannot understand anyone who, for reasons of his own, endeavours to mix colours.  If I were to express the views offered by Deputy Dr. Browne and if I were to express my political conviction that a means test was wrong and undemocratic, I would be against every proposal for social legislation which contained such a means test.  I would be against it whether or not it suited my political convenience. I would be against it whether or not it meant my opposition would entail the dissolution of Parliament and a fresh appeal to the electorate.  Political consistency is a principle very often prated about but very seldom practised.</P>
    <P>We have now had this fresh example of Deputy Dr. Browne fighting for a means test in another branch of social legislation&mdash;fighting for it, as he says, because he believes in it no matter what the cost may be&mdash;and fighting against it in this branch of social legislation because it suits him from the political standpoint to be against anything supported by Deputy Norton and the Labour Party.  That is not consistency.  I do not believe that is political sincerity.  I do not believe that is a type of performance that will commend itself to any fair-minded Deputy.  I think the intervention of Deputy Dr. Browne on this occasion has been disedifying and the sooner we can forget about it the better.</P>
    <P>I want to return now to some of the proposals contained in this Bill.  I do not intend to permit the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary to forget the side of the House on which we are to-day.  I have no intention of discussing this Bill without referring to the political aspects of it.</P>
    <P>This measure of social justice has unfortunately become a political bone of contention in the last four years.  It has been discussed inside this House <Col N="1015" /> and outside it by insincere men from insincere motives.  It is a pity that that should have been so but the fact remains that it is so.  First of all, I must make one comment.  I believe this proposal that we are discussing to-day is primarily a political measure and is being introduced now merely to act as a cushion against the unfortunate economic plight that employed persons will shortly find themselves in here.  It is primarily a political move to prevent the Government in the coming months incurring the discontent which undoubtedly must be the result of their broader policy.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this Bill is prompted by Fianna Fáil's rejection of the Norton proposals 12 months ago and by the effort to produce out of the hat something they had promised when in Opposition and something to which they now found themselves committed. I propose to discuss the Bill from that point of view.  Any Deputy who was here during the lifetime of the last Dáil will recall the Social Welfare Bill of 1951 as one of the measures around which there was an unparalleled amount of lobbying and jockeying for position.  The Bill that had its Second Reading 12 months ago was discussed up and down the country by the then Opposition as something in which they saw the possibility of the ultimate defeat of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>I want now to give them a little bit of credit.  They may not like the way I give it but I extend it anyway: I do not believe they were opposed in principle to the provisions contained in the Norton Social Insurance Bill.  I do not believe they were genuinely against that measure of social justice.  It was a weapon given to them which they thought they could use to defeat the Government and they were sufficiently unscrupulous to use any weapon if it could be used for that purpose.  But it did not defeat the Government and now, looking back on the last 12 months, we are entitled to examine the views they expressed then, even though they may have been insincere, and the promises they made then.  We are entitled to hold them now to account before the bar of public opinion as to <Col N="1016" /> the manner in which they have fulfilled their promises and as to the reasons why they have failed in some respects to do so.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to recall the Friday morning, 2nd March, 1951, when the Social Insurance Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Social Welfare.  It was a broad scheme.  It was a comprehensive scheme.  It applied to all employed persons, even those in domestic employment.  It contained provisions enabling it to apply to farmers throughout the country.  It was the first real attempt at comprehensive social legislation by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>When that Bill was introduced on that Friday morning, it was opposed by the present Minister, then Deputy Dr. Ryan. I hope I shall not be regarded as being offensive to the Minister when I say that his was a poor performance.  He was obviously in the position that he had to speak and speak from a very bad brief.  So bad was his contribution that that night the Fianna Fáil Party met in solemn conclave.  I do not know where they meet when they meet in solemn conclave but I am told it is somewhere in this city.  They sat down round a table that Friday night, 2nd March, and they put their heads together and said: &ldquo;Look here, we will have to do something about this business of social insurance and social welfare.  We will have to compete against the Government. We will have to produce some carrot and dangle it before the noses of the voters.&rdquo;  The Press was called in.  I am sure Deputy Briscoe was there.</P>

      <P>I would not be so quick in speaking if I were the Deputy. I commend a little caution and restraint.  Perhaps the meeting was in the afternoon.  I forgot for a moment that the House met in the morning on that Friday and rose at 2.30.  Perhaps the meeting was in the afternoon.  There they met and after Deputy Briscoe had given his advice as to what might go down in Dublin and Deputy Corry had given his advice as to what might go down in <Col N="1017" /> Cork, they all decided as to what they would do.  They would issue a message to the Press.  I am sure there were six or seven journalists there, headed no doubt by the gentleman from the <i>Irish Press.</i>  They went into a room and there they were met by the then managing director of the <i>Irish Press</i> and on the following morning, Thursday, 3rd March, when the Irish people read and considered the Government's proposals for social insurance and the benefits that might accure to them from it they had before them opposite each measure suggested by the Government another benefit called &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's Counter-Proposal&rdquo;.  That was perfectly fair and I would be the last to suggest that, in issuing their proposals for social insurance on 3rd March, 1951, Fianna Fáil did anything wrong.  They did not do anything wrong.  They were perfectly entitled to do what they did but they did a very foolish thing because they did something which I am sure Deputy Briscoe would have advised against. They put down in black and white what they were promising to do&mdash;and that is something an insincere politician should never do.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, the Fianna Fáil Party issued its counter-proposals. <Col N="1018" /> I want to discuss these proposals and to be as fair as I can. I am sure Deputy Briscoe will say that that would be difficult.  I want also to remove from my remarks the heat which dishonesty always arouses in me.  These proposals issued a little over 12 months ago were a solemn contract entered into by the Fianna Fáil Party with the voting public&mdash;the employed persons, the domestic servants, the poor of this city, the old and the dying for whom Deputy Dr. Browne spoke.  A promise was given to all these people by the Fianna Fáil campaign group in the programme published on the 3rd March, 1951.  The promise was that while all the benefits that the then Government were offering were going to be guaranteed by Fianna Fáil, and even in some cases increased, the contributions&mdash;the tax from the worker&mdash;would not be increased by one penny.  If Deputies on the Government side of the House doubt my words I commend them to read even their own journal, the <i>Irish Press,</i> of the 3rd March, 1951.  They will find underneath the Fianna Fáil Plan this stipulation&mdash;it is in italics in the <i>Independent</i> and I am certain that it is in black print in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a heading &ldquo;Cost of above Proposals&rdquo; and there are two columns, a left-hand column and a right-hand column.  The left-hand column shows the Government's proposals with regard to costs and the right-hand column shows Fianna Fáil's proposals.  We read promise No. 1 from the Fianna Fáil Party: &ldquo;No increase in contributions.  Increase of taxation by £4,500,000.&rdquo; That promise was designed to get for Fianna Fáil the support it had lost amongst the workers, organised and unorganised, in the cities and towns of this country. That came after some six or seven months of active political work by Fianna Fáil Deputies and henchmen <Col N="1019" /> and organisers who went to every worker, every employed person in the country, and endeavoured to influence him by the unfair argument that he should not be asked to pay one penny for any measure of social insurance that the State might introduce.  That went on for six or seven months before the Second Reading of the Bill in this House.  How well we all remember the propaganda that was indulged in prior to the Second Reading of Deputy Norton's Bill.  There was not a workers' group or a trade union section anywhere in the country that had not someone there to try and convince them that Deputy Norton's Bill was bad because Deputy Norton tried to put up the contribution and that that was wrong and unfair.  Accordingly, when Fianna Fáil issued their alternative proposals they knew they were doing something that would have a political effect; it might be a short-term effect but nevertheless it was designed to win from the inter-Party Government the support of employed persons and of those who felt that they liked to get something for nothing.</P>
      <P>Promise No. 1 was that there would be no increase in contributions.  That promise was not&mdash;as it might have been if Deputy Briscoe were the sole drafter of this proposal&mdash;that Fianna Fáil says that the contributions will not be as high as those which the Government propose.  It was a fair and a straight promise that there would not be a penny increase in the price of the stamps that an employed person or an employer would have to buy at the end of the week for social insurance purposes.  I do not think it would be unduly harsh or severe on the flotsam and jetsam that comprise the present Government if, 12 months hence, we nail their ears to the board over that promise.  Undoubtedly, they won considerable support in this city and in other cities throughout the country by the bribe that they were going to give everything that Deputy Norton promised in the Norton Bill but that there would be no increase in cost either to the employer or the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have broken that promise. They have smashed their own words, if they had any words, into smithereens. <Col N="1020" /> They have come into this House now with a Social Welfare Bill increasing the contributions of worker and employer.  They have done that, with sheer disregard of what is down in black and white written by them only 12 months before.  I know that Deputies longer in this House than I am, Deputies such as Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Corry and the Parliamentary Secretary, perhaps do not get unduly hot under the collar at an example such as this is, of political expediency and dishonesty but I think that we should always punish, so far as we can, anyone who deliberately breaks promises made for the purpose of getting political support.  I accuse the Fianna Fáil section of this Government of breaking deliberately their word to the voting public in this instance.  It might be all right if their breach of promise, for which we shall surely get damages, ended at that but unfortunately it does not.  Having promised the Irish people that under their magnificent dispensation all these benefits would come from nowhere without costing the employer or the worker a single penny increase, they go on to stipulate what they were going to give. Their imaginations ran riot.  Their advice was sought from Cork, Donegal, Galway and Kerry, and everywhere their wise men sat down, they said: &ldquo;Anything that Norton does, we shall do better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The widows and orphans! How we were all moved by Deputy Dr. Ryan, speaking in this House as a Deputy 12 months ago.  How we were all moved by the case he made for the widows and orphans, particularly the widow who was not insured.  He would not have the proposal contained in the Norton Bill which said the widow would get 26/- if she lived in a town and something less if she lived in a rural area.  &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Deputy Dr. Ryan said, speaking, as he was careful to say, for Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;the widow and orphans are going to be really well looked after by Fianna Fáil,&rdquo; and on that afternoon they issued their proposals.  They made these promises.  The proposal in the Norton Bill was that the widow and two children of an insured person should get 26/- in an urban area and <Col N="1021" /> 22/- in a rural area.  Fianna Fáil promised such a person 38/- a week&mdash;not one halfpenny less than 38/- a week. That was printed in the morning Press of 3rd March, 1951.  Every single widow in this country who had been struggling, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said, to exist on 26/- a week was promised: &ldquo;If you vote for Fianna Fáil, if you support the Fianna Fáil Party at the next election, whenever it comes, if they are returned to power you are going to get 38/- a week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is on the insured scale.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think that could be applied to all these classes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is referring to both the widow of the insured person and of the uninsured person.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I urge the Minister to apply that to all these classes but to do it out of taxation.  That is the point I am making&mdash;that he should do it out of taxation.  I am arguing now from the point of view of the insured worker.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> He goes on then to develop the argument. However, that is really not the point I am making.  The point I am making is that later on that day Fianna Fáil promised in their alternative programme to that class of widow 38/- a week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference relates to the uninsured widow.  If Deputy Briscoe has the courage to go around the South City he will find many widows, uninsured persons, to whom I have no doubt he&mdash;if he did not, his Party did&mdash;said 12 months ago: &ldquo;Vote for Bob Briscoe, and if you have two children you will get 38/-.&rdquo;  He has now to come back to them and say: &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil currency has been severely devalued in the 12 months that have elapsed, and you are now not going to get the 38/-; we are very sorry.&rdquo;  That perhaps may do Deputy Briscoe.  That is his own problem.  He made it himself and the Fianna Fáil Party made it, but it certainly will not do this House.  That is promise No. 2 which has been broken because, in this Bill, a widow, an insured person with two children, which is the basis for all proposals in this connection, does not get what Fianna Fáil promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indictment does not end there, because Fianna Fáil's foolish document went on to deal with the case of the worker who, after years of toil and labour, felt that he was still young at 65, and should not be retired at 65 as Fianna Fáil said Deputy Norton was trying to do with him, but that he should have the right to work on, and that when he reached the age of 70 then his hour of retirement was reached.  Fianna Fáil promised to that worker a retirement benefit at the age of 70.  They put that promise in the table which they issued in March, 1951: <Col N="1025" />&ldquo;Retirement Allowance at 70.&rdquo; That was the third promise which they made, that every worker at the age of 70, without paying a penny more, was to get a retirement allowance equal to what Deputy Norton had promised him at 65, and for which he was expecting them to pay an increase in their stamps each week.  Fianna Fáil promised that at 70 there would not be one penny increase from anybody.  That was promise No. 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill says nothing about it, and that is my complaint. In this Bill, Fianna Fáil give their third example of base political betrayal, because they have deleted from it with a red pencil any reference to retirement allowances.  Deputy Briscoe smiles.  I wonder do the people who believed in Deputy Briscoe's propaganda, or in his Party's propaganda at the last election and who voted for them, smile now when they find that their trust has been so scandalously disregarded?</P>

Now I come to make reference to one of the clearest pieces of vote-catching that was indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Party: that was their promises in relation to <Col N="1026" /> old age pensions.  Deputies will recollect, when the Norton proposal was before the House, the shock suffered by Fianna Fáil when they found that the old age pension was going up to £1 a week.  It was a sorry day for them and poor Deputy Dr. Ryan, as he then was, had to deal with it somehow on his feet.  He dealt with it in the politican's way and said: &ldquo;Well, of course, you are giving them £1 a week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When I was about to educate Deputy Briscoe some Deputy, whose name I cannot recall at the moment, said something which I could not make out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1951, was introduced for its Second Reading on 2nd March, 1951, the Minister in charge of the measure gave notice of his intention to introduce an amendment on the Committee Stage providing for an increase of old age pensions from 17/6 to £1 a week. Six weeks later, when the Budget was introduced, financial provision was made for an increase in old age pensions to £1 per week.  Unfortunately for the country, there was a change of <Col N="1027" /> Government some two or three weeks later and the present Government, <i>noblesse oblige,</i> introduced proposals for legislation which had been announced some weeks before.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to what I was saying about Fianna Fáil promises in relation to old age pensions.  In opposing the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill last year, Deputy Dr. Ryan had to do some very quick thinking.  The trouble was that he did not think and he was not quick.  He heard that the Minister was increasing old age pensions to £1 a week and he could not outbid that because it might be a bit difficult to do so.  What did he say?  He said: &ldquo;What Fianna Fáil propose is this: that any farmer whose valuation does not exceed £30 a year will not be bothered by any means test.  Every farmer whose valuation does not exceed £30 a year will qualify for the full old age pension, and every person who is not a farmer and who does not earn more than £100 a year will qualify for the full old age pension.&rdquo; He made that firm promise when he spoke on the 2nd March last year.</P>
    <P>If Deputies want the reference, it will be found in Volume 124, column 1112, of the Official Reports.  In order to make the promise quite clear, the proposals issued that afternoon by Fianna Fáil contained this promise in relation to old age pensions: &ldquo;No means test for farmers under £25 P.L.V.&rdquo;&mdash;it went down £5 in two hours &mdash;&ldquo;or £100 cash income.&rdquo;  There is a clear promise in black and white by Fianna Fáil that any farmer whose valuation did not exceed £25 would qualify for the full old age pension and no questions asked and, if his income did not exceed £100, he would qualify for the full old age pension.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the political kudos that could have been made, and I have no doubt was made, out of that proposal. A person who had a pension from Córas Iompair Éireann, or any other large employer, of up to £2 a week would qualify for the old age pension.  A farmer who had 20 or 30 acres of land&mdash;in my constituency certainly his valuation would not exceed £25&mdash;would qualify for the full old age pension.  Down in Laois-Offaly, and I <Col N="1028" /> am sure in Donegal, the boys made full use of that promise.  I am sure that in the City of Dublin the same use was made of Fianna Fáil's proposal. Never again would a means test bother the man of humble means or small property or the man who purchased a pension of less than £2 a week; he would now get the full old age pension and it could never be taken from him.</P>
    <P>I was so interested in this proposal that when, owing to a national tragedy, the Government changed on the 13th June and the present Minister for Social Welfare found himself in the position which he now occupies &mdash;temporarily I hope&mdash;I followed up this promise about old age pensions and the means test.  I should have said that Deputy Dr. Ryan not only made a speech about the means test in relation to old age pensions but, after Fianna Fáil issued this table on the 3rd March, he actually put down an amendment to the Norton Bill.  He knew that the amendment would not be allowed by the Chair, that it would be declared out of order as a charging amendment; but it was good propaganda and he put down an amendment proposing that the limit in regard to the means test for old age pensions should be increased to £100 a year.</P>
    <P>That was the first amendment to the Social Welfare Bill, 1951, tabled by Deputy Dr. Ryan, but he put his name in Irish&mdash;Seamus Ó Riain.  I would recommend Deputies to look at that amendment and examine it.  I said to myself: &ldquo;Deputy Dr. Ryan cannot be such a bad man; he is anxious to see this becoming law,&rdquo; and when he became Minister I put down a question to him which was answered on the 17th July, 1951.  I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...whether he intends to introduce proposals for legislation for the purpose of modifying the means test as applicable to a claimant for an old age pension, to the sum of £100 per annum in accordance with Committee amendment No. 35, tabled by An Teachta Seamus Ó Riain to the Social Welfare (Insurance) (No. 2) Bill, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Social Welfare Bill, <Col N="1029" /> 1951, was being discussed, I informed the Dáil that a comprehensive scheme of social legislation was being prepared. Until the scheme has been formulated and approved by the Government, I am unable to make an announcement regarding any of the proposals that will be included. The Deputy may, however, be assured that any promise made by me will not be overlooked.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should read the Bill.  I can only repeat the Minister's concluding remarks when he said that I could rest assured that any promise made by him would not be overlooked.  It will not be overlooked because it is our job to see that it is not.  There is a promise made by the Minister which is broken in this legislation now before the House.</P>
      <P>The last matter I want to refer to is the concern which we heard expressed with regard to a large section of our people whom we were told were being excluded from the Norton proposals. How many Fianna Fáil Deputies spoke about &ldquo;the poor old farmer&rdquo;?  Deputy Corry spent hours declaiming against the vindictiveness of any proposal for social welfare that did not bring in &ldquo;the poor old farmer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Every Fianna Fáil Deputy, from Cork to Donegal, talked about the farmer, weighed down with years, with holes in both pockets, unable to pay his way, and here he was being taxed to provide luxury and ease for the workers of the cities; and the poor old farmer, we were told, who provided all of us, as he undoubtedly does, with most of the income of the State, had a right to be included in any social welfare legislation&mdash;an expression of opinion with which I completely concur if it can be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was quite useless for the then Minister for Social Welfare to point out the difficulties of working out a contributory insurance scheme in connection with farmers who were not employed, who did not work under a contract of service but worked for themselves. These excuses were not acceptable to <Col N="1030" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Deputy Cogan led the campaign.  When the dust has settled on the battles with regard to the last social welfare scheme, when it has all finished, it is pertinent for us now to inquire: what about the poor old farmer?  He is still walking the same fields and he is weighed down with the same years and he is still nobody's child and he is not included in this Bill.  He is back just where he was. But this time he knows that Deputy Cogan for Wicklow now thinks that he should not be in a Social Welfare Bill. I want to ask where is the sincerity in that?  Why is not Deputy Corry prating about the poor old farmer now? Why are not all the Fianna Fáil Deputies who moved us to tears with their pleas on behalf of the farmer not so eloquent now?</P>
    <P>I know next Sunday when I go down to my constituency, I will remind the farmers who vote for me&mdash;and there are plenty of them&mdash;that in the Bill which Fianna Fáil criticised 12 months ago as being exclusive of the farmer, there was a provision enabling groups of farmers in this country to form themselves into co-operative societies to work out a scheme in accordance with the Bill to get practically all the benefits&mdash;they could not get unemployment benefit, of course&mdash;contained in the Norton social welfare scheme. That was in our Bill 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is it in the Bill we are now discussing?  Again the red pencil has cut it out, and there is no sign of a farmer in this Bill.  There should be some end to political inconsistency and political insincerity. After all the talk we heard in regard to this matter 12 months ago, it is depressing to find Deputies, for political reasons, so conveniently forgetting their own speeches and the sentiments they had expressed not so long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Larkin that on principle there is very little difference between this Bill and our Bill.  The only difference lies in the benefits, which in some cases in the Norton Bill <Col N="1031" /> were greater.  The real difficulty in relation to social insurance is the difficulty of trying to apply to an agricultural country a scheme of social insurance which is easily workable in larger industrial countries.  We have our difficulties here, and we all recognise that, but we do not do what our opponents did 12 months ago, endeavour to make political capital of difficulties which arise from the economy of the country.  We do not do that.  We recognise the difficulties; we recognise that the principle which the Government proposes in this scheme is very much the same principle as we proposed.  But we do point to the fact that the benefits we were able to give&mdash;of course, the worker and the employer were expected to pay for them&mdash;were very much greater.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to join my voice with the request made by the Leader of the Opposition, that at least one benefit contained in the Norton Bill, which has been taken out by the present Minister, the death benefit, should be restored.  I need hardly say that the death benefit was promised in this famous document 12 months ago.  I know that that will not weigh with the Minister in deciding whether it should, in fact, be given, and I would rather urge the case that has been made for the particular benefit by the Leader of the Opposition and, I think, very ably made also by Deputy Colm Gallagher, who spoke from the Government side of the House.  He made a very excellent case for the restoration of that benefit to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that it is a matter that arises more frequently for the attention of city Deputies, and perhaps country Deputies do not have the experience of it that city Deputies have.  But anyone who does any kind of work in the city in particular directions will appreciate very much the importance of a death benefit and what it means to the less well-off sections in the city. It is one of the minimum rights which should be provided in any social welfare scheme.  It is one of the first things that should be put in.  It should be one of the common denominators in all these schemes to ensure to a person <Col N="1032" /> that there will be no anxiety, no fear, as to what will happen their mortal remains when they die.  I do think that the alternative suggested by the Minister, the marriage benefit, is just a bit of, perhaps, excusable political window-dressing.  It may appear more popular, but it is not a good thing, and it certainly does not meet an undoubted social need as would the provision of death benefit.</P>
    <P>I have, perhaps, spoken at undue length.  I have done so because, from time to time, I do think it is necessary that some Deputy in this House should make a protest in favour of political honesty and straight dealing.</P>
    <P>I would have expected that protest to have come, not from the Government side but, perhaps, from a Deputy sitting halfway in between.  I would have expected that protest to come from a Deputy who has made his concern political ethics and social principles.  Unfortunately, it did not come, but something else came from him.  However, the fact does remain that, in relation to this important matter, the politicians on the Fianna Fáil Benches have led the country a merry dance.  They have danced in front of the voting public, holding carrots, but when the people proceeded to get the carrots they saw they were nothing but painted sticks.  I think we should have the right to protest and the right to expect that in the not too distant future an opportunity will be given to us of getting rid of political inconsistency and political dishonesty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the last speaker while he preached to the House about political inconsistency and political dishonesty. I could not believe my ears for a few moments when I listened to statements made by his leader, Deputy Costello, to the effect that he was in favour, generally speaking, of social welfare.  There have been various closely-guarded secrets throughout the history of the world.  We have heard of the secret of the philosopher's stone and we have heard of the great care which has been taken in America so that the secrets of the manufacture of Coco Cola will be protected, but there never was any more closely-guarded <Col N="1033" /> secret than the Fine Gael interest in social security.  Never was this closely-guarded secret made known by Acts in this House or expressions outside this House.  Deputy O'Higgins purports to be concerned with and purports to lecture this House, and particularly this Party, on political dishonesty and on political inconsistency.</P>
      <P>A lecture such as that comes particularly well from a Party who did the greatest political somersault in the history of this or of any other State&mdash; the Party who pledged their supporters and this nation to the British Commonwealth of Nations and the Party who attempted to bludgeon that view on the people by means of a secret political army known as the Blue-shirts. Is it not extraordinary when we bear in mind the history of this Party that it should protest about political dishonesty and political inconsistency in this House?</P>

Surely we are entitled to comment on the political somersault taken by this Party and expressed by the leader of that Party&mdash;not in this House and not here in Ireland, but in Canada?

      <P>If the Deputy will keep <Col N="1034" /> quiet I will discuss quite a number of things he will not like to hear.</P>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I would like to say this: We heard that Fianna Fáil were going to seduce people from their allegiance by holding this measure of social security in front of them or the Fianna Fáil promises about social security.  I do not think these people will swallow what Deputy O'Higgins and other speakers, particularly on the Fine Gael benches, have been preaching to them in connection with this measure.  It came as a complete surprise to me that the Fine Gael Party, now or at any time during its whole history, ever had any interest in social welfare.  I do not think that the criticisms of the efficacy or otherwise of this measure are going to be accepted by the people who were going to benefit under this measure&mdash;I mean the unfortunate section to whom Deputy MacEoin referred in his speech last week&mdash;the old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>These people got a lesson in social welfare from Fine Gael that they will never forget.  The people who criticised the Minister who has introduced this measure on this side of the House in connection with social welfare will ask themselves this question, and I am sure the workers in receipt of the benefits from social welfare will ask themselves the same question: Who was it who introduced the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and the increase in the old age pensions?  They will also ask themselves who provided social legislation for this country and who, in some cases, set a headline for other countries in Europe to follow as regards different advanced provisions in respect of labour?  All these proposals came from this Party and all these proposals were, in the main, carved out by men who now occupy the Front Benches in this House.  As far as social welfare is concerned, Fianna Fáil have a record of which they may well be proud.  As a member of that Party, I want to congratulate the present Minister for this further step as regards social security envisaged in the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering a Bill of this kind what we have got to do is to figure out <Col N="1035" /> what we can afford to spend and how best we can spend it.  I am sure most people in this House, with the exception of the Fine Gael Tory Party, would like to see better benefits if we could afford them.  I feel that most of the people here would like, if it could possibly be done, to give greater benefits to the unfortunate unemployed, to the widows and orphans and to the old age pensioners.  Unfortunately, we are a small State and we have limited resources.  The question for argument here is how much of our national revenue we can devote towards the very praiseworthy benefits enshrined in this Bill.  We must cut our cloth in accordance with our measure.</P>
    <P>In this measure, I feel that the Minister has approached the matter in a practical way.  The main difference between this Bill and the Bill introduced last year is the fact that, under this particular measure, there are smaller contributions.  With regard to last year's Bill, I was told by many workers that they were very worried about the amount of the contributions. Although most workers would like a provision for social security, many workers are not very happy when it comes to the question of contributions. It would be impossible to have schemes of this kind without contributions.  In my view, the principle of the contribution is a good one, because, as has been pointed out by some other Deputy, the very fact of the worker having to contribute puts a different complexion on the scheme.  They would feel entitled to benefit under the social security scheme in the same way as they would be entitled to benefit under an ordinary insurance policy which they would take out privately.  One of the things which makes this Bill more attractive from the workers' point of view is the fact that it is somewhat more realistic in relation to contributions and in relation to the capacity of people to pay.  I was amused at the crocodile tears shed by some members of the Opposition because those over £600 per annum are left out of the scope of this Bill.  I can understand that line of approach by members of the Fine Gael Party.  It comes, appropriately enough, from the <Col N="1036" /> Party who gave their last dying kick under Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, by restoring the supercuts in the Civil Service.  Deputy McGilligan took very good care that those in the higher income group from £1,800 to £2,000 per year had their cuts restored.  I can understand their concern, then, because those over £600 a year are not included in this measure.</P>
    <P>We all know that those with an income of over £600 a year are people who very, very rarely look for social welfare or social insurance, and the intention of this Bill is to benefit the poorer sections of the community. Those of us who support this measure will shed no tears because the people in the higher income group have been left out.  I do not think that domestic servants should be asked to contribute because they are people who will never benefit, and it would be most unfair to ask them to subscribe to the Bill. Indeed, it would be an imposition on them.  It is a bad principle to compel people who can never hope to gain to become contributors to a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>Taken by and large, this Bill represents a practical approach by the Minister to deal with this very complex problem.  There are a few specific points on which I would like some information from the Minister.  In relation to some of them he may consider separate legislation necessary.  There are certain people who are not provided for in this Bill, and who are not as far as I know provided for under any existing code.  There are unfortunate people who are permanently disabled, and who were never insured workers.  Some of them are disabled since birth, and some are disabled because of disease, such as poliomylitis. They would never qualify under this measure.  Possibly the Minister may consider their position when introducing the Health Act.  That might be the best way of dealing with their case.  The only way in which these people can be dealt with at the present time is through the medium of public assistance, and many of them object to drawing that.  These are the most helpless members of our community, and I appeal to the Minister to try and <Col N="1037" /> include them in this measure if possible. I know it is difficult to lay down hard and fast rules, and equally difficult to cover every case when drafting legislation, but I would like to see something done for these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position will be in regard to people who are injured while working and who would normally qualify under the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  I do not know whether those who are permanently or partly incapacitated will come within the scope of this Bill and I would like the Minister to clarify the position.  There is, for instance, the case of the workman who meets with an accident and loses a limb as a result of it.  As a rule, he gets a lump sum by way of compensation.  He is unfit to do manual work of any kind and unless he can qualify for some sedentary occupation he has very poor prospects.  The compensation he gets does not last very long.  Possibly he incurs very heavy medical expenses. He may have family responsibilities, and as a rule he is much worse off at the end despite compensation. I would like to have the position clarified in a case of that kind. What would such a man's prospects be under this Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that in a case of permanent and total incapacity the applicant can be bought off compulsorily by the employer under the Workmen's Compensation Act depending upon his particular age group. The employer can buy him off even though he may subsequently prove a liability to his family for the rest of his life.  I would like to know whether or not, in a case of that kind, a man who qualifies under the Workmen's Compensation Act because of partial or permanent disablement will be debarred from the benefit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another section in which I am interested is the migratory worker.  We have a good deal of difficulty at the moment in connection with these migratory workers in relation to social insurance as between Britain and here. I think the Minister's predecessor signed some convention with his opposite, number in Great Britain in relation <Col N="1038" /> to the benefits to which migratory workers in Scotland and England would be entitled when such workers were injured either in England or Scotland and return here.</P>
    <P>That convention worked out extremely badly and was very harsh as far as the migratory workers were concerned. It provided, in the first instance, evidently by arrangement, that if these men stayed out of Britain longer than six months after being insured they were cut off from the benefits to which they were entitled under their particular form of employment. They were left to re-apply under the national health insurance code here and they could not go back to Britain again as far as benefits were concerned. Quite a lot of these people did not know how they stood.  In many cases I had great difficulty in finding out whether the people on the other side know their exact position.  As always happens, it was the worker who suffered.  I suppose they have rather a peculiar system in operation in Britain.  They abolished workmen's compensation and introduced their social service system.  However, there is a common law liability on employers in respect of negligence and, in addition, the worker has the right to claim under the social service code.  For instance, if a man is insured and, due to the negligence of his employer, becomes incapacitated, he has the common law right of action in respect of his employer's negligence and can recover compensation and he can also claim under the social service code.  In fact, he can convert his payments under that social service code into a pension in respect of his incapacity if he is permanently insured.  Many workers who migrated from my constiuency, and from other parts of my county such as Achill and that district, and who were insured there and ordered on medical grounds to return to their homes, possibly because of the better food here, found themselves, under the convention signed by the predecessor of the Minister for Finance, between two stools in regard to insurance.</P>
    <P>I should like the whole position reviewed as far as this scheme is concerned. Where you have, as we have, a large number of people who traditionally <Col N="1039" /> migrate during a certain part of the year and come back to this country for the remainder of the year, it is essential that their position be clarified.  Whatever they are paying over in Britain is, to a large extent, lost to them eventually.  I do not know anything about what they would be paying here or how they would stand under the provisions of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will consider these matters, as they affect a very large number of the workers in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed to note the opportunities that were taken by some Deputies in this House, particularly on this Bill, to provide cannon fodder in the matter of propaganda for our country's enemies.  I was particularly amazed by the views expressed by some Deputies.  It is not the first time that I have heard these views expressed in this House and outside&mdash; views that are always quoted, and quoted with some effect, by enemies of Irish political unity.  I have gone into this Bill fairly thoroughly, as I am sure most Deputies who are interested in this matter have done.  I think this Bill can well be examined without some of the types of statements uttered by Deputies in this House&mdash;statements that, quite obviously, will be used outside whether or not they are deliberately made for that purpose.  It seems to me rather extraordinary that some of our Deputies should swallow the vomit of the political propaganda of the gentlemen in the North and regurgitate it here.  I have heard a lot of wailing in this House by some Deputies on the difference between the social services in this State and those which are provided in the Six Counties and in Britain.  Some of the Labour Deputies went very far along that line, as did Deputy General MacEoin.  It seems to be a favourite habit of some of the Labour Deputies to quote what Labour leaders and Labour Governments in other parts of the world have done in relation to social insurance. I have not heard any Labour Deputy in this House point out on this measure that the very first people to slash social services was Britain.</P>

      <P>Who introduced the present social welfare cuts in Britain but the Labour Government?  I give the Deputies their choice of the lot of them&mdash;from boisterous Bevan down to chattering Attlee.  It took a Labour Government to cut the health services: to put on 1/- on the doctor's prescription and the half-price on the spectacles.  These are the very people who are quoted to us by the Labour Deputies.  I will say for the good Nye Bevan that when he saw his principles being interfered with and the attempts at cuts in the social services, he resigned.  What did the Labour leader in this country do?  He stuck to his office for three and a half years.  Notwithstanding the fact that his much-publicised Social Welfare Bill was supposed to be on the stocks and that we were told, week in and week out, that it was coming, Deputy Norton took very good care that he stuck with the Coalition Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows the reason for the delay.  We voted against the measure because we pointed out that we would produce a practical measure and because we knew at that time that the introduction of Deputy Norton's Bill was just so much window-dressing for the members of this House.  We knew that the Coalition Government had as much intention of giving effect to a social welfare measure as they had of flying to the moon.  Week after week, for three years, we put down questions in this House in an endeavour to discover when Deputy Norton would produce his famous Social Welfare Bill. Speeches were made at Labour Party meetings and at Labour Party conventions. There was plenty of wind, ballyhoo and advertising, but there was no Social Welfare Bill, notwithstanding the pressure brought to bear by the Fianna Fáil Party to get Deputy Norton to introduce the Bill.  We were aware that the people who always <Col N="1041" /> killed social welfare in this country were killing Deputy Norton's Bill behind the scenes and we know now that what we said then was right, because not one solitary penny was provided by the Coalition Minister for Finance for a social welfare scheme of any kind.  We now know that it was ballyhoo and that that measure was introduced into this House when the Coalition Government knew that the writing was on the wall so far as they were concerned, and that, whether they liked it or not, they would have to face the Irish people in a general election within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>They did not take any effective steps in the last few days or in the last few weeks when they were in power to ensure that social welfare would be brought to the Irish people, as a lasting monument to Deputy Norton and the inter-Party Government.  Mark you, there were a number of people who got the last political bus when they saw that the sands were running out for the inter-Party Government. When the writing was on the wall, there were a number of people provided for.  There were people going on to the judges' bench who bought the last ticket on the last political tram of the inter-Party Government.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Norton was so concerned about social welfare, he should have ensured that money would be provided for a social welfare scheme which would have gone down in history as a monument to Deputy Norton.  Unfortunately, we are inclined to believe, from our knowledge of what happened, that no financial provision was made by these gentlemen for any social welfare scheme; we are inclined to believe, and the country will believe, that the social welfare proposals which were spoken of by the Coalitionists for a period of three years were merely designed to fool the people.  We all know that even if Deputy Norton had a chance of enacting such a Bill, Fine Gael would <Col N="1042" /> not allow him to do it.  At all events, we have now got a Government in power that keeps its promises.  We have got this further Bill which will go on the Statute Book as a tribute to the present Minister's concern for the poorer sections of our community, another measure which will add to the social code which Fianna Fáil has given to the Irish nation, comprised of so many beneficial measures for the people of this country.</P>
      <P>I can commend this measure to the House and to the people who are shedding tears about the old age pensioners. While they were talking about the old age pensioners for over three years the present Minister in a few short months provided additional benefits for them.  In the same way, instead of talking, as the Coalitionists did, about social welfare, Fianna Fáil is doing the job.  This is the job.  I invite Deputies, if they are seriously thinking of challenging this Bill, to consult the people who are going to benefit by it&mdash;in particular the workers &mdash;before they commit political suicide by voting against it.</P>

Despite all these assurances, and despite the many attacks which Fianna Fáil made on the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton, we find that there is nothing comprehensive about this measure and that it falls far short of what we we were led to expect. The last speaker gave us a long lecture about the beneficial social legislation that Fianna Fáil enacted after the Party came into power in 1932.  One of these social experiments was the free beef and the free soup provided for workers, in the same way as the British introduced free soup when they wanted the people of this country to change their religion.  In addition to the free beef and the free soup, which no Irish worker wanted, they gave the workers <Col N="1043" /> a few shillings dole.  That continued, unfortunately, for a few years as the people had no alternative to accepting the dole and the few pounds of free beef weekly.  However, after a few years the people got tired of the Fianna Fáil beef and the Fianna Fáil doles and they turned elsewhere to seek a livelihood.  The last Deputy who spoke also mentioned about cannon fodder for other countries.  It is well to remember in that connection that from 1935 onwards, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy, many young Irishmen had to emigrate and became cannon fodder in foreign countries during the 1939-45 war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is social legislation, and I am commenting on the remarks made by the previous Deputy when he referred to the beneficial social legislation enacted by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Despite what Deputy Moran and other Fianna Fáil Deputies have, mentioned in regard to the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the workers and plain people of this country, I think they will have to admit that not until the inter-Party Government came into power did the claims of these people get serious consideration, and not until Deputy Norton was placed in charge of social welfare in this country, despite what Deputy McGrath or any other Deputy may say, was any real advance made. Deputy Norton and the inter-Party Government were not long in power when they removed one of the most shameful measures ever enacted by any Government.  That was the measure whereby old people had to submit to a means test in order to qualify for the barest allowance for a livelihood. Fianna Fáil, according to their statements, had no money at that time to increase the old age pension; the only effort they made in that direction was to allow these old people to apply for home assistance, as unfortunately the great bulk of them had to do, and make paupers of themselves to eke out an existence.  Deputy Norton was not long in power until he increased the <Col N="1044" /> old age pension by 5/- and modified the regulations in regard to the means test.  He also introduced legislation to increase the old age pensions, and bring them into line with what they should be.</P>
      <P>Why did Fianna Fáil during their 16 years of office not take cognisance of the plight of these people?  Why did they not allocate money to meet their requirements?  They had money to expend in acquiring aircraft and Constellations from this, that and the other nation, but they had no money to help the least fortunate section of our people.  So far as this measure is concerned, its most depressing feature in comparison with Deputy Norton's scheme is that it cuts out entirely the retirement allowance.  I have always believed that that was the major advantage in the scheme introduced by the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in the right of every man and woman to a retirement allowance at the age of 65.  While I believe that the inter-Party scheme did not go far enough, at the same time I was of the opinion that it was a distinct step forward to the time when every person in this country would be entitled to a retirement allowance at 65.  Mention has been made by the Minister himself that there was no need for this retirement allowance for workers, farmers, business people or others, and the point was made that workers in this country are well able to work even after attaining the age of 65.  If that is true so far as the people who are working on the land, on the roads or in the factories are concerned&mdash;the people who are the backbone of the country and who are the greatest asset to the community&mdash; what is to prevent civil servants, school-teachers or civic guards&mdash;not that I wish to cast any aspersion on these classes&mdash;from working until they reach the age of 70?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should there be one law for the privileged classes and another law for the hard-working classes who are the backbone of the county?  That is what I am opposed to.  I want to mention again that. even rate collectors are now included in the privileged classes. It is not long since the Cork County <Col N="1045" /> Council got notice from the present Minister for Local Government to the effect that rate collectors, when they reach the age of 65, should be retired on a substantial pension.  These poor fellows, who have to work about one month in the year, are not supposed to be able to continue working after they reach the age of 65.  It was the Minister's opinion that at that age they had given sufficient service to the country and were entitled to a substantial retiring allowance.  I do not want to cast any aspersions on any section of workers, but if that regulation is to apply in the case of rate collectors why should it not apply also in the case of road workers and farm workers and, indeed, in the case of the farmer himself and of businessmen?  I think that what is the law for one should be the law for all.</P>
    <P>The reason why I find so much fault with the present measure is that it entirely cuts out any substantial benefit for the classes I have just mentioned.  We have many such people in my county and, I am sure, in every constituency.  They comprise the bulk of the workers.  Surely it would give great satisfaction to them to know that, when they had reached the age of 65 years and when, perhaps, their working powers were diminishing, they would be able to retire on a decent allowance of 24/- a week for a single man and 36/- for a married man.  It would give them something to look forward to.  Under the Minister's scheme, they must continue to pay their contributions, and if they are able to continue working until they reach the age of 70 they will have no benefit to look forward to except the old age pension, which they would have got in any case without any contribution.  I hope the day is not far distant when that kind of class legislation will be changed and when the plain people will get what they are justly entitled to, namely, a retiring allowance, the same as that which it is proposed to give to the more privileged classes.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about old age pensions.  I am a firm believer in a modification of the means test, particularly in view of the increase in <Col N="1046" /> the cost of living.  I think that old age pensions should definitely be increased so as to offset that increase.  So far as the present legislation is concerned, I would say that that section of the community which is comprised of small business people has good reason to grumble.  They do not get the same benefit from the means test as, say, the farming community.  If a business man, with a valuation under £30, transfers his holding to a member of his family, he does not get the same benefit from that transfer as a farmer does.  I hope that that discrepancy will be removed in the near future. The small business people in our towns and villages comprise one of the hardest hit sections of the community at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another objection that I have to the Bill is that it does not embrace small farmers.  We have quite a large number of them in my constituency.  This Bill does not offer any advantage to them.  I was not a member of the House at the time that Deputy Norton's Bill was introduced.  One of the objections I had to it was that I thought a better effort should have been made to include this particular section I am referring to.  I read the comments that were made on that Bill at the time by various Fianna Fáil Deputies, such as my Cork friend, Deputy Corry, comments to the effect that any Bill that would exclude those people could not be termed a Social Security Bill and was not worthy to be entitled as such.  I admit that I agreed with the assertions made by Deputy Corry and his colleagues at that time, but as I grew older I learned that there is no sincerity whatever on the Government Benches.  I am not saying that in any biased way but rather as a fair and impartial observer of their actions.</P>
    <P>I think that some provision should have been made for the small farmer. What security has he at present if a member of his family gets ill and has to be removed to hospital for a major operation?  How is he to meet the hospital charges and the cost of the operation? I know several of these people who from time to time have to go to a local medical officer because they have <Col N="1047" /> not the wherewithal to meet the cost of specialist medical attention.  Something should be done for that section of the community.</P>
    <P>What has this Bill to offer to the huge number of unemployed that we have in the country?  To my mind, it has nothing to offer.  I may be wrong. Due, maybe, to Government policy, the number of unemployed is steadily mounting.  I cannot speak from intimate knowledge of the position in different areas in the country, but I am conversant with the position as it exists in West Cork.  At the moment we have some 1,400 people unemployed there.  I can assure the House that 1,350 of these, or 95 per cent., are only too anxious and willing to work if work can be made available for them. But, unfortunately, the work is not there, and their only alternative is to apply for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister for Social Welfare done for these people?  In the first place the Government have held up work on schemes which were providing productive employment, such as Deputy Dillon's Land Rehabilitation Scheme and Deputy Keyes' Local Authorities (Works) Act.  These schemes have been almost completely wiped out by the present Government.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about production but that policy is not going to lead towards production.  These schemes which, more than anything else, would provide employment are being held up by the Government.  If the Government is not in a position to provide these people with work, then I think it should have made provision in the Bill to increase their home assistance allowance.  How can a man in the Beara or Dingle peninsula or in Connemara maintain himself, his wife and child out of 16/6 a week, which is his present rate of unemployment assistance? Surely no Minister in any Government will maintain that he could do that and at the same time provide himself and family with a house, clothing and other essentials of life on 16/6.  The Government's proposal is that that shall be, and will be, the case in the future, and that there will be nothing whatsoever for that <Col N="1048" /> section of the community except to allow them to continue as they have done in the past.  I would make a sincere appeal to the Minister to reconsider their position.  I personally know the plight of a number of those people.  I am sure that Deputies representing other constituencies could say of their constituencies what I have said of mine.  I know that plenty of those people are finding it extremely difficult to live at all.  I know that some of them have been forced to apply to the local authority, particularly for bed-clothing, boots and other things for their children because on their present miserable pittance they would have no chance whatever of providing their children with these essentials.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to a painful reality.  I think there is no more painful reality than the way in which that section of the community is being treated.  Unfortunately, the present policy tends to increase that section from time to time.  I had hoped that something would be done for the self-employed people.  We have a lot of tradesmen such as blacksmiths, boot repairers, people employed in a small way as millers, etc., and I believe that any Social Welfare Bill could not be termed comprehensive when it does not include that section of the community.  I hope that in any future review of this question that section of the community will get consideration, as it is a very essential section.</P>
    <P>I believe that pensions should be made available for every class and section in the community as they are being made available for a substantial number at present.  I do not see why the man who works with a shovel or spade or plough is not entitled to a pension just as well as the man employed in a very comfortable office is entitled, not to £1 a week, but to £9 or £10 a week when he retires.  I welcome whatever useful sections there are in the Bill.  It cannot be denied that everything in the Bill that is of advantage to the people has been copied from Deputy Norton's Bill.  The increase in the national health allowance was embodied in Deputy Norton's Bill.  The increase in the contributory pensions was also embodied in that <Col N="1049" /> Bill, as were the other increases provided for.  However, I welcome their implementation, as they will be a big advantage to the people affected by them.  This question of social security is a very important one, and I hope that it will be reviewed in the not distant future, and that many people who are entitled to benefits, and who are omitted from this Bill, will come under the scheme.  I hope that when it comes under review it will be reviewed in a more favourable light and by a more favourable Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to be consistent in my attitude to this Bill. It is rather amusing to find people on the front benches on both sides of the House accusing each other of being inconsistent.  It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke for a long time on political inconsistency and insincerity and referred to the Norton Social Security Bill, as &ldquo;our Bill&rdquo;.  I should like to quote a statement made by the leader of the Opposition, Deputy J.A. Costello, as reported in column 73 of Volume 106 of the Official Reports of 13th May, 1947.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello's opinion of social security then was: &ldquo;the existence of social services is an indication of ill-health in the body politic.  In any case, as has been stated, it is nothing more than a row of medicine bottles showing disease in the household.  The sounder your economic fabric, the less need there is for social services.&rdquo;  Yet, in 1950 and 1951 when Deputy Costello and the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Norton and the Labour Party were shouting down the country that the farmers were never better off, that there was never less unemployment in the country, and when Deputy Dillon stated that he increased milk production to such an extent that he did not know what to do with the milk or butter, Deputy Costello and the Fine Gael Party felt that it was necessary to bring in a Social Security Bill which showed that there was a disease in the household and that we had to bring in the medicine bottles.  That is an instance of inconsistency and insincerity. It is equally easy to collect instances of inconsistency and insincerity on the other side of the House.  When there is as much blame attached to one side as to the other side, both of them should give up attacking one another on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is, to my mind, a somewhat better Bill than the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton.  But, as Deputy Murphy has just stated, it has the major defect that Deputy Norton's <Col N="1051" /> Bill had, and the major defect is that it does not provide for the self-employed, just as Deputy Norton's Bill did not provide for them, but it requires the self-employed to contribute part of the moneys which will be expended on the sections who benefit from it.  That is a grave defect in this Bill, as it was a grave defect in Deputy Norton's Bill.</P>
    <P>I said I wanted to be consistent, but the position I am faced with now is that I have the option of going into the Lobby and voting for this Bill or going into the Lobby and voting for Deputy Norton's Bill.  It is a case of &ldquo;Out of the frying pan into the fire&rdquo;.  It is like the old question, &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your mother-in-law&mdash; yes or no&rdquo;.  That is the position I am in in regard to this Bill and, as I say, I want to act consistently.  I opposed the Norton Bill on the ground that it was defective, particularly in the way I have mentioned in making no provision for the self-employed.  I want to oppose this Bill on exactly the same ground.  But, if I do that, I feel I am voting for the Norton Bill.  That is my dilemma.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of hypocrisy spoken in connection with social services.  We have no sympathy with the people, as is evident from speeches in the House.  We try to court favour and popularity with the people at their own expense, and we charge them quite extensively for the benefits we are giving by first of all collecting from them.  As I said before, I cannot say what side I will take when the vote is being put to the House.  That is my difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak very long on this measure.  I had intended to preface my remarks on the lines taken by Deputy Lehane.  I think myself it is a great mistake for people to boost up their social welfare scheme or their social security scheme, in the belief that that should be accepted as an argument for good government.  I have said this in other places, and I do not apologise in any way for saying it.  The acid test for good government is the employment which the Government provides, and a <Col N="1052" /> Government that fails to provide employment for the able-bodied citizen is failing in its duty.  There is no substitute, by way of social services, for employment, and it should be the first aim of any Government to provide full employment for its citizens&mdash;those who are able and willing to work.  The necessity for the provision of social welfare schemes for people who are able and willing to work is abundant evidence that a Government is not discharging its duty properly to the citizens.  There cannot be any greater evidence.  In my view, it has become universally accepted that it is the progressive thing to provide more and more social services rather than to provide more and better employment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that throughout the country it is, at any rate.  I am satisfied that political Parties endeavour to secure support on promises of that kind.  I do not think that any Party in the country can claim to be immune to actions of that kind.  I think it is a very bad thing for the country that any man should secure his return to the Oireachtas on the grounds that, if he is elected, he and his Party will provide more and better social services.  If he is fair to the country and its people, he will feel it should be his constant aim to secure, as far as he can do so, that every man and woman in this country who wants to work will get work.  That is the first consideration.</P>
      <P>We all know that there is a big number of people in this country who are not able to work.  There is definitely a moral obligation on whatever Government may be in office to ensure that those people will be provided for.  That has been done by different Governments to a certain limited extent.  I feel that they should be the concern of every Government rather than those who are capable and, in many instances, willing to work.  I feel that those who are unable to work should be far more generously treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many others who have dealt with this Bill, I am not at all satisfied <Col N="1053" /> that the self-employed man should be omitted from our social legislation, because a considerable majority of the people in this country are self-employed, particularly those on the land&mdash;small farmers and their families. As Deputy Lehane has said, they will be expected to make their contributions to whatever social reforms take place, and they derive no benefit themselves.  That is certainly inequitable and unjust.  I do not know whether it may be possible to deal with that.  I am aware that it is a fairly big matter to tackle.  I am sure that both the Minister and his predecessor must have given long and earnest consideration to this very serious and important aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the people about whom I actually rose to speak and who have not been provided for in this country except by way of home assistance.  The number is small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The number is 62,062, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are referring to the same people.  You will find in this country men and women who have sustained an accident in childhood and who are for that reason partially, and in some cases, totally incapacitated and more or less a burden on their people.  In olden days they might have been victims of infantile paralysis.  They do not come in any way at all under the Health Act nor under any of the scheduled diseases.  I, and I am sure every other Deputy and member of a local authority, have had cases of people brought to their notice who are almost completely destitute and dependent on the charity of their friends.  There is no provision for them that I know of except home assistance.  I did hope that they would have been provided for under the Public Health Act, 1947, particularly the victims of infantile paralysis.  I have found that the regulations governing the allowances paid to such people are limited in this way; the county medical officer of health cannot register a patient of that kind unless the doctor gives a certificate that such a person will respond to <Col N="1054" /> medical treatment.  In many cases the doctor cannot, in all conscience, give that certificate because he does not believe that the person concerned will respond to treatment.  The unfortunate person can get no help except by way of home assistance.  Although I know that this Bill does not properly concern itself with people of that type I appeal to the Minister to introduce some form of legislation, or to make provision in some future Bill, for those people who, as I have already said, are limited in number.  Such provision would not impose any serious financial burden on any Department.  He knows that in his own constituency there are very deserving cases.  I do not think that there is anything further I want to say on this matter.  As I said, I am not a believer in the welfare State.</P>

That ought to be the natural place for it to succeed, where you have insurable employment. In an agricultural country I do not think it is feasible at all.  I doubt if it will ever be a success in this country.  My idea of a welfare State would be, as I said at the beginning, that every man and woman who wants employment would get it and, mark you, I want to emphasise, productive employment.  Employment by itself which does not yield any results is not going to gain any benefit for the nation, and is not going to put the nation in a <Col N="1055" /> position to provide for those who really should be provided for.  If there is productive employment for every citizen who wants to have it, the result of their labours will ensure that whatever Government will be in existence will be in a position to provide for those who should be provided for and who in justice and charity should be looked after by the State.</P>

When I heard Deputy Finan a few minutes ago alluding to the endeavours to find employment I felt rather sorry that Deputy Finan was not in the House as a Deputy three years previously, when he would have got a little lesson in regard to the ways and means of preventing employment, which was well known as the abeyance policy of the inter-Party Government.</P>

Deputy Cafferky should learn a pretty good lesson from that.</P>
      <P>I must admit that I feel a certain amount of disappointment with this Bill since it does not provide for the small farmer and the self-employed man.  There may be difficulties in that. I am sorry some of my friends from Cork are gone because I would remind them of the difficulties we found in finding a level in another matter during the past fortnight&mdash;that was in connection with the proposed grant to be given by the local authorities for housing.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the level that we found in Cork and agreed on as the level of the £600 income man which is in this Bill.  We considered that it would be fair for the farmer with £100 valuation to come on a level with that.  We are quite happy about that and we decided that the farmer with £100 valuation and the gentleman with the income or the salary of £600 a year should both be entitled to the housing grant.  However, we found it would cost between 4/- and 6/- in the £ to the ratepayers and then we dropped it in a hurry.</P>

That would be a fair basis.  The change that I see in this Bill is that <Col N="1057" /> we are not going to get the same crucifying that we were going to get under the Norton Bill.  We find that Deputy Norton proposed that the man employing an agricultural labourer would have to pay 3/6 a week and that the labourer himself would have to pay 2/6 a week, and, with the present position of agricultural labourers with over £3 10s. a week, that 2/6 would become 3/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the advantage of having a good Deputy who shows a good example.  Under this Bill, 7/- has been reduced to 2/6.  At least, that much relief is given as against Deputy Norton's Bill.  He and his Party were prepared to allow only 37/- per week to a sick or unemployed agricultural labourer with a wife and two children. Under this Bill that man will get 50/- per week.  Those are two pretty big differences as far as the agricultural community is concerned.  I can understand the annoyance of some people, and I am a firm believer, like Deputy Finan, in providing people with employment rather than giving them assistance of this description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> For a number of years I have been chairman of a board of assistance in Cork.  I appreciate the difficulties of the poor.  I know the problems they have to face through no fault of their own in many cases.  I welcome this Bill, or any Bill, that will give relief to these people.  It is all very fine to talk about social services on the British scale.  It is most unfair and unjust to have comparisons made between our social services and the social service schemes in Northern Ireland.  We are an agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy General MacEoin complaining that this would keep Partition.  I wonder did the Deputy think of that when he was talking in the Lobby here.  Farmers in Northern Ireland have a minimum price of 2/8 per gallon for milk as compared with the 1/- per gallon that Deputy Dillon proposed to give us.  If that is not a greater contribution to continuing Partition than anything contained in this Bill, I do not know what to say. The farmer on both sides of the Border is a tough gentleman.</P>
    <P>I have shown some of the differences that I at least as a representative of the agricultural community can see in this Bill.  I can see the improvement it will make in the towns and villages as well as in the rural areas.  The improvement so far as the agricultural workers are concerned will be pretty big.  That is another reason why I am in favour of this measure.  Away back from 1947 onwards scarcely a fortnight passed in which we had not three or four questions from members of the Labour Party asking when the Social Welfare Bill would be introduced. They were there for three and a half years.</P>

      <P>That sum of £126,000,000 which the Government which Deputy Davin supported, borrowed and squandered during their three and a half years of office, and our present financial position, does not leave us in a fair position to go any further than we go in this Bill.  I think we are carrying out the pledges we gave the people fairly well.  I should prefer to see a Bill introduced into this House which would improve employment.  I should prefer to see a Bill which would give employment to the people instead of any social welfare or any social service that is mentioned in this Bill. I think employment is more essential. However, we have to go back and make up for the policy of abeyance which was operated by the Coalition Government for three and a half years and which has left us with the present unemployment problem.</P>

It has been stated from the Government Benches that the Fine Gael Party are not interested in social security.  I do not think that statement will bear examination.  When the inter-Party Government took office and a Social Security Bill was actually placed on the table of this House and passed its Second Reading, the entire Fine Gael Party, as it was constituted in the last Dáil, voted for the Bill: the entire Fianna Fáil Party voted against it. It ill becomes the Fianna Fáil Party, therefore, to taunt us that we are not interested in social security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken to many people with regard to social security. In my profession as a doctor I have an opportunity of mixing with every type, class and condition of person.  I have made it my business to check the views of all the different types of people whom I meet on social security.  Some of them are in favour of it; a great many are against it.  Practically all the white-collared workers with whom I have spoken do not want this Bill. A lot of the agricultural labourers with whom I have spoken do not want the Bill, and a lot of the industrial workers with whom I have spoken do not want the Bill, because they feel that it will be an imposition on them.  They feel that they have to pay a fairly substantial increased contribution.  A lot of the lesser paid workers feel that it is the duty of the State to pay for this Bill.  I do not say that I am in agreement with that view, and I do not say that I am particularly against this Bill. However, I feel there is a lot in their point of view.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to read part of a letter that was sent to me a few days ago from the Transport and Salaried Staffs' Association:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At a special meeting of the County Wexford branch of this association, held at Wexford on the 26th instant, the following resolution was passed unanimously, and I am instructed to request your assistance in the matter:</P>
      <P>That we, the members of the Wexford branch, Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, emphatically support the demand of the salaried staffs of Córas Iompair Éireann and British Railways for exemption from the provisions of the proposed social welfare scheme on the following grounds...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not weary the House by reading the letter <i>in toto.</i>  They give four different grounds and they mention that they have a welfare scheme of their own which is already in existence.  I have read that letter <Col N="1062" /> to stress the point I have made that there are many people in this country who do not welcome the Bill.  It is quite obvious that a lot of work has been put into this Bill but if the Deputies of this House believe that the people of the country are awaiting with bated breath the passing of this Bill by the Oireachtas and its implementation they have never made a bigger mistake in their lives.</P>
    <P>The taunt was thrown this evening that the inter-Party Government took three years to introduce their Bill.  I do not think that that is a fair charge. One would want to be a lawyer to appreciate the amount of work that was put into this Bill and one would want to be lawyer to understand it. I am not a lawyer but it is obvious that this Bill goes a long way and that it covers practically every point.  I must say that I think that work was done by Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Social Welfare and that it is not unreasonable that he took three years to bring his Bill before the House.  I may not agree personally with everything in the Bill, nor with everything in the present Bill, but I think that the present Minister had a Bill more or less cut and dried for him.  I think he had the nucleus and more than the nucleus of a social security scheme and that he had a far easier job than Deputy Norton, because I think that the present Minister had only to read through Deputy Norton's Bill and to make his own emendations.</P>
    <P>I come now to the provisions of the Bill itself.  First of all I should like to deal with the increased disability benefit under the national health insurance. Let me say better late than never, with a full knowledge of what I am saying. The national health insurance benefits in this country in the years since we got our native Government have been nothing short of a public scandal. Take the case of an honest, hardworking man with five or six children who goes to his business every day and is suddenly knocked out, through no fault of his own, by sickness.</P>
    <P>Suppose such a man is earning £3 or £4 a week.  The sum of 22/6 a week which he is offered is nothing but a pittance.  Furthermore, he gets <Col N="1063" /> nothing for the first three days.  I know how the scheme is worked, and in the majority of cases such a man often waits 14 days before he gets anything.  I have even known such a man to wait three months and then have to get a Deputy to write a letter to the society to get the money for him.  Therefore, I say better late than never.  I am whole-heartedly behind the new benefit of 50/- a week, which is a great improvement on the present situation.  I have been unable to satisfy myself, however, if the rule still continues whereby, if a man is drawing benefit for six months, there is a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that everything decent in this Bill was in Deputy Norton's Bill.  Now I come to deal with the increase in widows' non-contributory pensions.  Anyone who has stood for election to this House and who has done a bit of canvassing in the towns and cities will have had the experience of going into the houses of the people and talking to them.  They will have observed that the majority of the widows, as stated by the Minister, very often live alone and have no family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has had the experience, as you all have had, and as I have had, of going around to decent people's houses, the houses of people struggling to make ends meet, will agree that they have their pride just the same as anyone else, and that it is an outrage to offer them 10/- a week in the rural districts and 14/- in urban districts.  I therefore welcome the proposed increase <Col N="1064" /> of 10/-.  In fact, I do not see that it goes far enough because so many of these people are living alone that 20/- a week will not do very much for them, since it is so much harder for people to live singly than in families. I welcome also the increase in the contributory pensions to 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>I come now to the maternity benefit, of which I also approve.  After all, it is very essential to the unborn generation who will form the Ireland of the future, that their mothers should have an opportunity, when they are going through the very anxious and dangerous period of producing children, of resting before, and resting after confinement. In the past, how many women in the poorer districts, perhaps more so in Dublin, almost as soon as they were able to get out of bed, were compelled, through force of economic circumstances, to go to work.  The present provision is a good feature of the Bill and I welcome it.  With regard to the maternity payment of £2, I think it is a niggardly allowance.  I think £2 would hardly pay for the cotton wool and drugs that would be required. I suggest that that should be raised to £5.  You will not be throwing money away by increasing the allowance, and you will be relieving certain people of anxiety.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marriage benefit, I find myself in agreement with other speakers on this side of the House.  I do not think the marriage benefit is a good thing.  I do not see any sense in a marriage benefit; I certainly do not see any sense in a marriage benefit of £10.  What use is £10 to set up house for anybody?  Youth is always foolish and many young people about to get married, when they hear they are entitled to a grant of £10 according to this measure, will say: &ldquo;Oh, that will start us up in a house.&rdquo;  The only effect that will have will be to stop people saving money, and any enactment that stops people from having a thrifty outlook is harmful.  I agree with Deputy Costello that, on moral and ethical grounds, this provision is unfortunate.  I do not see any sense at all in it, and I think it should be rejected.</P>
    <P>In regard to unemployment benefit, <Col N="1065" /> it is a tragedy that we should have to provide unemployment benefit, but it is a necessary evil in this country.  Is it a good policy or sound policy to pay such benefit?  It has always been done in other countries, and it is our duty to provide for those amongst us who are unemployed, but I feel that we would be doing far better and that this money would be more usefully expended in providing employment for the people who are idle.  In my own town, or the nearest town to which I live, Gorey, one sees people standing at the corner of the street unemployed. Many of them are going to England every day.  Perhaps some of us do not see the inner mind of the unemployed man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The taunt is sometimes thrown at the unemployed man that he does not want to work.  I know these people and I have spoken to many of them; I have mixed amongst poor people as much as anybody in this House.  I know what these people standing at the corner of the street feel, the feeling of anyone who has no work to do.  We may try to salve our consciences in this House by passing a Bill to give the unemployed 50/- a week and think that we are doing our duty by them but what these people want, these decent people&mdash;and that is all we need be concerned with; we need not be concerned with the shirker who does not want work&mdash;is work.  These decent people want work and it is our duty to give them that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I digress for a moment from this Bill to the Estimates to say that cutting down expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the lessening of provision for housing are going to produce more unemployment. Is there any sense in that?  By cutting down the provision made for such works you increase unemployment, and you throw a heavier burden on the State because you must have more taxation to meet it.  What does the decent fellow standing at the corner of the street, as you pass along, think about it?  He has got feelings, just the same <Col N="1066" /> as you and I, and as he sees you pass he says: &ldquo;There goes a man who has got a good job, and a way of life; have I not a right to the same thing?&rdquo; This is a Christian State and no one can deny that he is right.  This is not a State in which we believe in depriving the individual of his private rights.  We believe in giving him the right to have his own home and to rear his own family.  Are we doing that by merely paying him 50/- a week unemployment benefit rather than introducing useful schemes which will absorb the unemployed? Surely we ought to provide some means in my town and in every town in Ireland by which these men when they become unemployed in industrial work or other employment can be diverted to productive schemes? That I suggest would be far better for the welfare of the country than paying them 50/- a week to stand at the corner of the street.</P>
    <P>In giving them 50/- a week, however, we are only giving them plain justice because I do not think any person in Gorey could live on the present allowance, which I think is about 22/6.  He has to pay 13/4 for the rent of his house.  Perhaps in addition he is thrown a miserable pittance of 2/6 for each of his children and a little extra for his wife.  That is totally insufficient.</P>
    <P>We accept the principle of private enterprise in this country; no matter what other countries do, we need not follow them.  Our circumstances in Ireland are different from anywhere else.  Let us then try to work out our own economic problems.  Let us do our job so that the work is decentralised throughout the country.  This Bill proposes to unify in one body the social services of the country.  I welcome that, but I would like to feel that in this scheme there would be decentralisation so that the people from Wexford and other country districts will not find that every claim for disability or maternity benefit will have to come up to Dublin to be buried in a pigeon-hole there.  Let each county have its own administration, and have control over its own funds.  We do not want to have a state of affairs existing where people looking for benefit <Col N="1067" /> will have to wait for days on end before they get it.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say except that, in the main, we welcome this Bill, although I personally do not agree with a lot that is in it.</P>
    <P>I do not particularly agree with a lot that is in the Bill, but I will say that we welcome the increase in the benefits which are to be paid because they will help to relieve much of the distress and suffering caused to the poorer sections of the community in all parts of the country since the inception of this State.</P>

      <P>I think no one will deny that all Parties in the House are agreed that there is a need for social welfare.  It is generally accepted by all Parties, Government and Opposition, that a pool must be established that will give financial help to those who require it when they are struck by some of the economic hazards which come in the course of a worker's life. There are periods in the life of a worker when, despite the provision he endeavours to make, he will find that he needs financial assistance.  It is recognised in practically all Christian countries that the State has the same duty to its citizens as the good parent has to his children.  With the exception of a few Independent Deputies, every Deputy in this House has, at one time or another, expressed these views.  They have indicated by their votes that they are willing to support the establishment of a fund to cover these economic hazards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is from outside sources, usually from people in well-paid and sheltered employment, that we hear a criticism and a condemnation of social welfare. These people, who will never have the need, as far as can be seen, in the course of their lives to have recourse to benefits such as are indicated in this and many other Bills, are loudest in their condemnation and cry out &ldquo;Now we are turning into a Communist or a Socialist State.&rdquo;  Some even go so far as to say that it is against the teaching of the Catholic Church.  They have written and spoken at meetings condemning what they call the welfare <Col N="1068" /> State.  They say that the worker is to be coddled from the cradle to the grave but they have not explained what is to happen to the worker, to his wife and children should he have the misfortune to lose his employment and not be able to get alternative work.  They do not say whether the policy of putting his wife and his children into the gas chamber is preferable to that of letting them starve to death.  They indicate that they will be looked after by charitable institutions, that well-meaning people will go to the door and hand out a few shillings under some guise or another. They want to place the Irish worker in the position of being a beggar who has to confess his misfortunes and accept the bread of charity from any organisation that likes to impose itself by going slumming, or by some people who think that the giving of a few pounds or shillings in charity is going to make up for their ill-spent lives.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party denounce those people.  We claim the right of the worker to protection during his lifetime because he has given service to the State and because, by his productivity and his work, he has enriched the State.  Therefore the State has a duty to him.  I have never yet heard one single person who is likely to have recourse to any of the benefits of social welfare condemn it or criticise it beyond saying that the benefits are not big enough.  While those people from outside were loud in their condemnation of Deputy Norton's Social Welfare Bill, we find that on the introduction of this Bill they are gravely silent.</P>
    <P>Does that not indicate exactly what they were&mdash;political humbugs&mdash;who sought, under the cloak of religion or of some organisation, to blacken the efforts that were being made to improve the lot of the worker.  I am sure the people of this country must realise that their silence to-day on the very same question indicates only that they were playing a political game, and that they would stoop to anything to forward their own political beliefs.</P>
    <P>It is clearly the wish of the people of this country that a social welfare scheme of some sort should be in operation here.  Each and every one of <Col N="1069" /> the political Parties in this House has made it the main plank in their platform because they realise that, should they go to the country stating that if they were returned to power they would do away with all social benefits, they would scarcely return a single Deputy to this House.  Does that not indicate clearly that the vast majority of the voters realise the need for social insurance and intend to see that it will be carried out by whatever Government comes into office.</P>
    <P>While all Parties agree as to the need for social welfare, there are many points of difference as to the best form of scheme.  There is disagreement on how much and how varied the benefits should be.  There is disagreement as to how many people it should embrace. There is disagreement as to the age at which and the conditions under which the benefits should be given and there is disagreement as to how it should be financed.  I suggest that the present Bill must be examined in the light of the promises made by the Government when they were in Opposition before and during the election.  It must be examined against the background of the Social Welfare Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1950, which was criticised and condemned in the speeches of the members of the Government when in opposition.  In April, 1951, Fianna Fáil, when speaking against that Bill, stated that the benefits were not large enough, that the scope was not wide enough, that the increased contributions should not have been asked for, that the money necessary to provide additional benefits should have come from the Exchequer and should be secured by means of new taxation.</P>
    <P>I will quote Deputy Lemass, as he then was, as indicating the general view expressed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  On the 4th April, 1951, in Volume 125, column 64 of the Official Report, Deputy Lemass is recorded as stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us come now to the points on which we disagree.  So far as we can calculate, all these benefits I have enumerated, the higher rate of benefit payable in case of unemployment, the equal rate of benefit payable on sickness, the provision for <Col N="1070" /> maintaining the rate of sickness benefit for the duration of the applicant's illness and so forth, can be financed out of the existing contribution revenue.  There appears to us no justification whatever, in so far as these benefits are required, for increasing the contributions payable by workers and their employers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As reported in column 65, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In so far as I can see, the higher rates of unemployment and sickness benefit, all the proposals in this Bill relating to unemployment and sickness benefit, can be financed from the existing contributions without any increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As reported in column 71, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be clear, therefore, that the differences between the proposals put forward here by Deputy Dr. Ryan and those contained in the Bill are these: That Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposals provide for no increase in the existing contributions; they provide for benefits in the case of unemployment and sickness equivalent to those provided in the Bill; they provide for better help, through an amendment of the children's allowances scheme, for larger families and, so far as I can calculate, when provision is made for the additional cost of the old age pension amendment, no higher charge on State revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that these statements must be taken into account when we examine this Bill and find that it is not to be financed <i>in toto</i> from taxation.</P>
    <P>Another objection to the Social Welfare Bill of 1950 was that fishermen, farmers and other self-employed people were not included.  I do not make the point that it is possible in this Bill or that it was possible in the 1950 Bill to cover such people.  I want, however, to show the political bluff that was worked in April, 1951. Deputy Corry, as reported in Volume 125, of the 5th April, speaking on the Social Welfare Bill, said this to his present colleague, Deputy John Flynn:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have one deep regret in this matter, and it is that Deputy Flynn <Col N="1071" /> has given notice of his intention to withdraw his amendment.  I am sorry to see him leave the House now, because I should like to put a few figures before him.  There are in Deputy Flynn's constituency in Kerry some 21,000 farmers, if we can call them farmers, living on less than 30 acres per family.  The Deputy's amendment says that no provision is made in the Bill for the payment of benefits to small farmers and casual workers who are not included in the Bill as at present constituted.  I wonder whether Deputy Flynn considers that the 2/6 promised to the old age pensioners in Kerry, and which he knows as well as I know can be screwed out of the Minister, whether this Bill passes or not, is a full justification for throwing overboard these 21,000 farmers who live on less than 30 acres per family in County Kerry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Corry will ask the same question of his colleague at present, because this Minister, like the last, has found it impossible to cover people whose means of livelihood cannot be checked as to whether they are actually unemployed or employed at a particular period.  As reported in column 200 of the 5th April, 1951, Deputy Corry said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not prepared at any time, for any Party, to vote for any Bill that will put on one side 500,000 of our people.  The total number occupied in any manner in this country is 1,300,000 and that includes even the three-card-trick man.  Of that number, 503,000 are farmers, their wives, their sons and daughters over 14 years of age, working on the land; 358,000 of that 500,000 are working on holdings under 50 acres and, under this Bill, they are to be cut out completely from any benefits whatever, but they are to have the pleasure of paying so that others may benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Corry realises that the very same thing is happening to-day.</P>
    <P>It is necessary at times to bring to the minds of the people who make wild <Col N="1072" /> statements in this House their inconsistency, so that the public will have an opportunity of judging them on the way they keep their promises whether as Ministers or as members of the Dáil.  I would like to quote from column 90, Volume 125, of the Official Report of 4th April, 1951, when my colleague from Waterford, Deputy Ormonde, was speaking on the Social Welfare Bill of 1950.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of my principal objections to the Bill is that it caters for the urban areas to the detriment of the rural areas.  The agricultural community is almost entirely excluded, with the exception of some 17,000 agricultural labourers.  The agricultural industry is our most important industry.  It produces our greatest wealth.  Yet those who manned this industry do not come within the ambit of this scheme because there is no voluntary provision in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is still no voluntary provision for that type of people, because in the present Bill, before you can exercise the right to become a voluntary contributor, you must have been a contributor previously.  Deputy Ormonde also said, at column 92 of the same debate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The social welfare scheme deals particularly harshly with the people on the southern and western seaboard, from Waterford and Cork right up to Donegal.  The small farmer, the fisherman, the tradesman, the artisan, the country blacksmith, the man with a horse and cart or a donkey and cart, to serve his own or his neighbour's needs, are all excluded although they are compelled to contribute to the cost of the scheme.  Instead of their burden being relieved, it is being made harder for them to bear.  I believe this Bill will have the effect of further depopulating the rural areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest, if that is correct in regard to the 1950 Bill, it seems to be equally correct of the present 1951 Bill.</P>
    <P>At column 94, Deputy Ormonde said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any scheme which excludes tens of thousands of workers, small employers, <Col N="1073" /> small farmers, shopkeepers, independent workers, tradesmen and rural craftsmen, who are as much in need of help and social security as those people who are included in the scheme, is far removed from the comprehensive national scheme we were assured we would get.  To say the least of it, this is a scheme in which it is proposed to give benefits to a privileged class, industrial workers and wage earners.  The cost of it will be paid for by the community at large.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would feel that if that is correct of the 1950 scheme it must be equally correct of the 1951 scheme but, of course, to be perfectly honest, it is nonsense to say it of either scheme. It is not possible to include every type in this social welfare scheme and I do not intend to criticise the Minister for not doing something that it is obviously impossible to expect him to do. I could quote from those debates Deputy Kissane and Deputy Corry on the same points; I could quote Deputy Cogan as claiming that he would agree with the scheme up to a point should the Minister have taken in those injured at their work.  I could quote Deputy Cogan as stating that he felt that no Minister had the right to extend unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance to farm workers because he felt that it was contrary to moral law, and he quoted innumerable so-called theologians in support of his case.</P>
    <P>Each man is entitled to his views.  I see nothing wrong with Deputy Cogan having views of that kind but I would expect any Deputy to be consistent in his views.  He indicated on that day that he would vote against the Social Insurance Bill because he held views contrary to social welfare as indicated in the Bill.  If he had those views&mdash;and it is not so long ago since April, 1951&mdash; what intention has he in connection with the 1951 Bill and what has caused him to change his mind?  In actual fact, contrary to what Fianna Fáil Deputies asked for, this Bill will cover a lesser number than the 1950 Bill.  A large number of manual workers, or if not a large number, a number of manual workers who are at present <Col N="1074" /> earning over £600 a year will automatically be disqualified under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to know that.  It certainly is correct to say that female agricultural workers will not be covered, and that those employed as domestic servants will be cut out from the effects of the Bill. The Bill is a good one so far as it goes, and it can be called a good one so far as it goes because it is a replica of the 1950 Bill, with certain benefits taken out completely and some other benefits substituted.  It is strange, in view of the fact that we were told in 1947 that the then Government had complete and practically on the stocks a comprehensive scheme of social security, that when it comes to making out a Bill in 1951 it is the Norton Bill, with certain omissions and certain slight alterations.  It is quite true that there is provision in the 1951 Bill for increased widows' and orphans' pensions that did not appear in the 1950 Bill.  Just as the 2/6 increase for old age pensioners in the 1950 Bill was called a smokescreen to induce Independent Deputies to support the Government, the improvement in widows' and orphans' pensions in this Bill may be described as an inducement to three certain gentlemen, who are not too happy, to change their minds and be content with what they are getting.  Any honest Deputy in this House will admit that he is very glad to see an improvement for the widows and for the orphans.  In fact, we might go so far as to say this: had this improvement in their position been brought about by means of a special Bill completely divorced from the present one, we would have given it wholehearted and willing support, we would have given it a speedy passage through this House, and we would have been asking that the earliest date possible would be fixed for its coming into force.  However, when we find it enshrined <Col N="1075" /> in a Bill which we were told was in existence in 1947, we are inclined to feel that it's the sugar coating which is covering the pill which certain Deputies would otherwise have found it difficult to swallow.</P>
      <P>The dropping of the retirement pensions which were included in the Norton Bill is, to my mind, the very kernel of the difference between this Bill and the former one.  If we had established even on a contributory scale the principle of retirement pensions at 60 years for women and 65 years for men, without a means test, then, as sure as night follows day, there would be a demand so loud throughout the country that a similar regulation should be made for all old age pensioners that no Government, no matter who they were, would be able to stand against it.  It was because of our belief that the principle of retirement pensions at 65 for men and at 60 for women had been established that the Labour Party was so intent and so determined that the Norton Bill should go through.  It is a well-known fact that people employed in manual work find that, having reached the age of 65 years, they have difficulty in either continuing their work or in finding new employment.  In the course of my work as a trade unionist in the past, I have had occasion to supply certain types of workers to employers and, invariably, particularly as regards dock work, the employer insisted that the man should at least be under 65 years of age.  The fact that a man could retire at 65 and a woman at 60, secure in the knowledge that they had a right to a certain minimum amount of pension from the State which could not be altered because of the money they had contributed to it was, I believe, a concession, the omission of which from this Bill will be deplored by these people.  It is quite true that, if the worker did not show any marked enthusiasm for the 1950 Bill, the same can be equally said of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure, whether we speak of the 1950 Bill or of the 1951 Bill, that had the benefits been once enjoyed by the worker, nobody could take them from him.  He would show in no uncertain fashion how valuable they were <Col N="1076" /> to him and how much they were wanted.  In my view, the removal of the retiring pension on the grounds that a worker at 65 has no need for such pension is deplorable, a fact to be lamented and something which should not have been done by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Surely the principle of retirement at 65 is well-established.  It exists in practically every line of clerical employment. It is the practice in the Civil Service and among local authority employees.  Why, then, should a different line be taken in regard to manual workers?  The only reason is to show that this is a new Bill and that it can be put into operation so much more cheaply.  We were quite well aware that the retirement benefits would have to be paid for, but we were prepared to recommend them to the people in the sincere belief that they would be quite willing to contribute towards them when they would have the satisfaction of knowing that, the struggle to support themselves in manual employment being impossible, they would have the right to retire secure in the knowledge of the receipt of pensions.  It has been suggested that the worker can still do that; that he can go on the dole and sign on at the employment exchange.  Surely, anyone who has had experience of signing at an employment exchange must realise that one must prove to the satisfaction of the officer concerned that one has looked for work and was unable to get it.  One must hold oneself daily available for work.  In order to do that one must sign at the labour exchange between specified hours to show that one is available. Should an employment scheme of any sort commence in the area one may be required to go out and do manual work on that scheme despite the fact that one is not actually physically capable of such work; otherwise one will be suspended from benefit.  Surely that could never substitute for a pension which one should get as a right without any trimmings or conditions and without any investigation as to one's means.</P>
    <P>The most significant change in this Bill is the dropping of the death benefit. <Col N="1077" /> It is well-known that when Deputy Norton was about to introduce the Social Welfare Bill of 1950 the insurance companies set up a howl against the proposed death benefits.  It is well-known that deputations attended on Deputy Norton in an endeavour to get him to remove that particular section. All of us realise the importance of money when a death occurs.  We know that benefits secured from insurance at such a time, industrial insurance or a scheme such as the Social Welfare Scheme of 1950, are used to give to the father, the mother, or some member of the family, something that is ardently desired by every worker, and that is a decent burial.  The omission of such benefit from this Bill is a significant one.  Industrial insurance companies cater for workers who fell they must provide against emergencies and it is a well-known fact that 50, 60 and sometimes up to 80 per cent of the money paid into the insurance companies goes either in administrative expenses or in certain dividends and only a limited amount is returned for the premium paid weekly.</P>
    <P>To secure the benefits offered under the Norton Scheme&mdash;£6 for a child under three years, £10 for a child from 3 to 6 years, £15 for a child from 6 to 18 years and £20 for every member of the family over 18 years&mdash;from an industrial insurance company a worker would have to pay at least 1/- per week. That is the very lowest that would cover himself, his wife and his family. If that 1/- per week is added to the present 2/4 that the worker will now be required to pay it will be found that the figure comes within very close range of the 3/6 that was asked for under the Norton scheme.</P>
    <P>There are additional benefits, but I am speaking solely now of the death benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I suggest that such benefits will not be provided at 1/- per week by the industrial insurance companies and it can therefore only be provided under a social welfare scheme where administrative expenses will be low and there will be no necessity for a profit margin. As I said, the dropping of the death benefit is significant when one remembers that a high industrial insurance official speaking on 4th April, 1951, in connection with the Norton scheme said in relation to that particular benefit: &ldquo;I have no use whatever for the very elaborate social services envisaged in current legislation.&rdquo;  It is interesting to note that these high executives in industrial insurance felt that the scheme was elaborate and gave it as their opinion that they had no use whatsoever for it and we find now that the particular benefit against the granting of which that particular individual was protesting has suddenly been dropped.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton as Minister for Social Welfare, and his colleagues of the Labour Party fully appreciated the importance of the death benefit.  He was pressed to either withdraw or modify the proposed benefits by the vested interests in industrial insurance. His reply was that the scheme was intended as something worthwhile to the working people : it was intended to give them the cheapest social protection possible against the economic hazards of life and he believed that the death benefits were one of the most important points of coverage for the working class people and his scheme came before the Dáil with that particcular section intact.</P>
