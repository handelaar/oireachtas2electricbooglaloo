    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Mianraí, Teoranta are carrying out a scheme of exploration of the minerals at Avoca, County Wicklow. The principal minerals there are sulphide ores containing sulphur, copper, lead and zinc.  Expert advice is that working on a commercial basis would be feasible only if the deposits available amounted to several millions <Col N="270" /> of tons, and the object of the exploration scheme is to determine whether this condition exists.</P>
      <P>The main scheme is at West Avoca and in their latest report Mianraí, Teoranta have stated that they have deepened an existing mine shaft to a point 928 feet below the surface and have started to drive an exploratory tunnel.  The company expect to complete the work at West Avoca within the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>In addition to the main scheme, the company are carrying out a diamond drilling scheme at East Avoca to establish the extent of a body of sulphide ores there.  One drill hole has already been completed and work is proceeding on a second drill hole.  The company expect to complete this drilling scheme in about six months' time.</P>
      <P>Until the whole exploration scheme has been completed and the company have prepared a comprehensive report on its results, it would be premature to discuss the possibility of commercial exploitation of the deposits.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Marketing of Farmers' Butter.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the Government policy of encouraging the production of farmers' butter by the provision of a subsidy, he will now take some steps to ensure that the butter produced can be marketed, and whether he is aware that large quantities of farmers' butter in County Kerry, County Wexford and the Midlands is now unsaleable, and that producers have been caused great loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of subsidy on farmers' butter purchased by factories was introduced in order that producers would not be placed at a disadvantage in marketing such butter by reason of the low subsidised price at which creamery butter was then sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast bulk of farmers' butter produced is either consumed on the farm or sold locally and, following the withdrawal of the subsidy on creamery butter and the consequential increase in the retail price of creamery butter to 3/10 per lb., I believe that first quality farmers' butter, the price of which is not controlled, will find a ready sale at a favourable price.  As regards the relatively small surplus which reaches the butter factories, the Irish Dairy Butter Trade Ltd., Cork, is at present considering an offer from <Col N="282" /> the British Ministry of Food for the purchase of a trial consignment.</P>
    <P>I may say for the information of the Deputy that in one of the largest farm butter areas my Department recently offered to supply a travelling creamery on most favourable terms but the offer was rejected.  A similar offer was made last year and also received no response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the price of farmer's butter has reduced by about 7d. a lb. during the last couple of weeks and has he in mind taking any steps to see that farmers who are mainly confined to isolated areas and who make their own butter will get a reasonable price for their produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that I have made a survey of the country and in almost every case we have made provision for the continuance of milk to creameries.  There is no market, as I pointed out to the Deputy, for farmers' butter at the present time at a price acceptable by farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what gratuity is allowed to farmers who have to sell at a reduced price&mdash;7d. a lb.&mdash;at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said in reply to the question put down by Deputy Dillon, I believe that as a result of the increase in the price of creamery butter, first quality farmers' butter will find a ready sale at as good a price as last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Deputies in this House, in the course of the past 12 months I addressed questions to the Minister in charge of this Department.  The answers to some of the questions were satisfactory and the answers to other questions were not.  I consider it incumbent upon me to say now that, so far as I am concerned, the attitude of the Minister was the attitude of a gentleman.  It is a source of satisfaction to Deputies to be able to address questions to a Minister and to get the information requested in a manner which will not cause arguments and disunity in this House.  I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the officials of the Minister's Department.  I found in the past 12 months, and for three or four years <Col N="285" /> previous to that time, that when these officials were asked for advice or information affecting their Department, they gave it most readily.  It is most gratifying for us in this House to be able to say that the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can at all times be depended on to give the advice and information which is so essential not only to Deputies but to the people down the country who are depending on the Deputies to help them.</P>
      <P>I want to bring the matter of a daily postal delivery service in the rural areas to the attention of the Minister. There is a morning and evening postal delivery, six days in the week, in the cities and large towns, but in parts of the rural areas and in parts of South Cork&mdash;the Bandon postal district, for instance&mdash;the people receive letters only every second day or, roughly, there are three postal deliveries per week.  Within the past two months I received a complaint from a farmer in regard to the postal delivery service in his district.  He had placed an order with a person in Killiney, County Dublin, for some day-old chicks.  He was notified by post that they would arrive at his postal district on a certain date.  The difficulty was that on the date on which they were due to be sent by Córas Iompair Éireann to this particular postal district there was no postal delivery to the farmer's address. It was only by the merest chance that the farmer's young son happened to be some miles from home on that day and was in the vicinity of a district in which letters were being distributed and that he was able to get the letter which was addressed to his father, who was then able to collect the chicks.  If the farmer had had to wait until the delivery of the letter in the normal way, it would probably have meant that the day-old chicks would not have survived until they were collected at the depot and that the money paid by him for the chicks would have been wasted.  That is just one instance of the inconvenience and hardship caused to people in rural areas by the inadequacy of the postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is having this subject reconsidered I hope he will bear in <Col N="286" /> mind the fact that a speedy delivery of letters in rural areas is vitally important to the people who reside there. It is possible that there may not be a large number of letters to be delivered in some of those areas.  We should not forget, however, that young men and women have emigrated from those places and that, now and again, they are in a position to send a few pounds home to the old people. Naturally, they send the money through the post and very frequently the old people are watching and waiting for it to enable them to pay the baker or the grocer or some other bills which they incur.  Sometimes a delay of even one day in the delivery of a letter which contains money can mean great inconvenience to the old people in the matter of getting their provisions and being able to pay for them on the spot, which they are always anxious and willing to do.</P>
    <P>When the daily postal delivery service was instituted in the Cork area where, previously, there had been a postal delivery roughly only three times per week, it proved a godsend to the people there.  One official in the Minister's Department who was responsible to a great degree for working out the machinery for putting that daily postal delivery service into motion came from the West Cork area and was aware of the difficulties which faced the people there.  Unfortunately, in the middle of this very important work, that official, who was well known for the capable manner in which he discharged his work, died.  The postal delivery service in the Bandon and other rural postal districts is a big problem.  When the matter is being considered I hope it will not be considered in the light of the cities and large towns versus the rural areas. That attitude will get us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who has spoken so far in this debate has mentioned the problem of the auxiliary postman.  In the rural areas we frequently come across old men who have given a lifetime of service to the delivery of mails. Some people may say that these men spend only a few hours a day at that particular work and may suggest that they can take up other work also because their Post Office employment is <Col N="287" /> only part-time.  That may be true in so far as a young man holding the position of an auxiliary postman is concerned. As these auxiliary postmen advance in years and as they become old, surely it will not be suggested that other employment will be available for them.  These men have to travel miles around in the rural areas on very bad roads in many districts.  We know that in many instances there is no alternative employment for them.  They depend solely on the income they receive from the Post Office as auxiliary postmen.  This is a long outstanding problem.  It is a problem for which the present Minister is not responsible nor is it one for which his predecessor was responsible.  It is a system that has become rooted in the Post Office and which should have been got rid of years ago.  By doing something to improve the lot of these men, the Minister would be breaking new ground.  This is a problem which vitally affects the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I know that they got an increase in wages within the last few years but that was not sufficient.  If a man has given 25, 30 or 40 years' service he ought to be classified as a permanent official and, on retirement, he should be entitled to some just reward for his years of service in the office of trust which he has held.  In the locality in which I live there were a permanent postman and there auxiliary postmen. The permanent postman retired.  Two of the auxiliary postmen had up to 20 years' service, while the other had a longer period of service.  They could not be offered the route that was being operated by the permanent postman. The Post Office, under their rules and regulations, had to insist upon getting a permanent postman for that district.</P>
    <P>A permanent postman came into the district on several occasions.  Finding that the problem of paying for lodgings was so difficult and having regard to the wages, each person who arrived in that area found it did not pay him to stay in the district.  That position prevailed for a few years.  We had auxiliary men who were born and reared in that parish, men who had given years of highly satisfactory service <Col N="288" /> and yet they could not enjoy the advantage of that particular route, a route in respect of which there was a higher rate of wages than that obtaining in regard to the routes they were servicing.  There should be some system whereby consideration would be given to these men.  They have only a certain time in which to cover the mileage on certain routes in their district.  Inspectors check these routes at various times.  I have nothing in the world against the inspectors.  They are doing their work honestly and conscientiously. Quite often it happens by accident, not by design, that on a particular day, when an auxiliary postman's route is checked, he has no letters for some of the residents who may be living at the furthest point on that particular route.  There can, therefore, be arguments between the postal officials and the auxiliary postmen in regard to a quarter of an hour or half an hour's overtime.  I would suggest to the Minister that something constructive should be done to give the auxiliary postmen their due.  They should be offered some kind of permanence instead of having them depend on a few pounds' gratuity when they retire after 40 or 45 years' service.</P>
    <P>For the last few years the question of public telephones has been to a large extent very well met by the Department.  When the Minister's predecessor explained in the House the details of a scheme for Department officials, I admit that some of us may not have been too pleased.  I, personally, was not too pleased.  All Deputies have their own peculiar problems and I was afraid this scheme might work out in such a way that counties near to Dublin and other counties might get more than their fair slice of the cake.  From what I have seen, I will admit that the distribution of public telephones has certainly been done on a very even basis.  Progress has certainly been very noticeable.</P>
    <P>Now that the problem has been dealt with to such an extent and having regard to the fact that the Minister and his officials have dealt with a heavy share of the demands, I would suggest that the Minister and his Department should concentrate on the problem <Col N="289" /> which faces some of the rural areas owing to the lack of public telephones. Some of the people in these areas are very severely handicapped, particularly in a case of sudden illness, when they may require a doctor or a priest. In sending for either, the messenger may have to go a long distance.  The necessity may arise at a time when the messenger may not be conveniently available.  Facilities should be provided in cases such as these.  They may be small but in themselves such facilities would be of great help to the people in rural areas and would do an immense amount of good for the rural community.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the community, the farming community, for whom a public telephone is of the greatest importance.  Owing to the advances made in the Department of Agriculture, farmers in certain localities may want to get on to places such as artificial insemination centres.  They should have the use of a public telephone when the necessity arises.  In the areas, where those facilities are not available, farmers have every right to complain.  When Department officials are in a position to report an improvement in meeting the demand for public telephones for other purposes, they should then consider the centres which, up to the present, have no hope of getting these telephones.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year on this Estimate another item&mdash;the problem which confronts people in seaside resorts, where there are no public telephone facilities available on Sundays.  On that particular occasion the Minister agreed that he would consider the matter.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is losing sight of it.  It is a matter of which we cannot afford to lose sight.  Unfortunately, we read in the newspapers accounts of a few drownings at our seaside resorts every year.  Perhaps, sometimes, we actually witness such drownings.  As I mentioned last year, there were two very tragic drowning accidents in my own locality on a Sunday, last summer, but if a public telephone service had been available on that day these two lives would have been saved.  In view of the fact that we have a long coastline <Col N="290" /> and a large number of permanent seaside resorts, drowning accidents could become widespread.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to see to it that a public telephone service is available on Sundays.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the question of giving a weekly half-holiday to the staff of sub-post offices.  I am aware that this system operates in some localities, but there are a very large number of places where it does not.  It may be argued that some sub-post offices are glorified little grocers' shops as well as being post offices.  However, I know of a lot of cases where they are sub-post offices and no more.  Of course, there may be a few old cranks who may tell us that it would be impossible for them to carry on if these offices closed for a half-day in the week.  They may argue that it would be very inconvenient for them if they could not go to the post office at their own convenience to buy a halfpenny or a two pence halfpenny stamp.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when it was suggested that postmen should not deliver mails on Christmas Day, one would imagine that the end of the world was at hand.  However, people have now got into the habit of getting the last delivery of Christmas letters on Christmas Eve, and the postmen have earned the right to leisure on Christmas Day.  In the same way, if the postmaster, the post-mistress or their employees were given the advantage of a half-holiday per week, the public would soon adjust themselves to the situation. After all, shops complying with the Shops (Hours of Trading) Act close for a half-holiday per week.  I would like the Minister to give me some information on this question of a half-holiday for sub-post offices.  Are there any discussions in progress at the present time between the Minister's Department and any union?</P>
    <P>The use of delivery vans has been of great help in the speeding up of deliveries in rural areas.  It is very gratifying to see letters being delivered early in the morning and collected in the evening by means of this service. I am sure you all heard the older people speaking of the mail coach.  Long ago there were no conveniences such <Col N="291" /> as buses available to the public and they depended solely on the mail coach as a mode of conveyance for the delivery of mails.  While the mail coach was not a very rapid form of transport, it did its work well.  Complaints have been lodged with me as to the excessive speed of the present Post Office delivery vans, and I have observed their speed myself.  They are a direct contrast to the mail coach; the drivers believe in putting their boot down.  While that may be all right on our main roads, it is a dangerous practice on our by-roads, some of which are badly kept.  This high speed operates in many areas all over the country.  In fairness to the drivers, they say they are forced to drive at this rapid speed because of the limited time available to them to cover their area.  While I do not say that they should model their speed on that of the mail coach, I do not want to see these delivery vans&mdash;these headless coaches, as it were&mdash;travelling around our badly kept by-roads at a very high speed and leaving headless victims behind.  I would like the Minister to have this matter investigated with a view to giving the drivers of these delivery vans sufficient time in which to cover their districts.  It is not fair to be forcing them to cover a large area in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say how grateful I am for the co-operation which I have got from the Minister and his Department during the past 12 months.  If all Departments of State were to give us the same co-operation, I think we would be in a more satisfactory position when we come to examine the yearly Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Esmonde in his plea for better delivery services for rural areas.  We all realise that we are advancing in the use of modern methods, but it is a sad reflection on us that people in rural areas only get letters once or twice a week.  I cannot understand why country people cannot be as well catered for as those living in towns and cities.  If the Minister has to economise, I hope he will not start by <Col N="292" /> cutting down on the services available to rural areas.</P>
      <P>During the British régime a practice was adopted of cutting down postmen's wages by a few shillings per week by means of reducing their employment period.  That practice is being continued. Anyone who understands the life of a rural postman, especially in the western part of the country, knows that he has to travel over mountainy roads in very bad weather.  It seems very mean that a State Department should come along and try and cut down his wages by a few shillings per week and, perhaps, in some cases, deprive him of his way of living altogether by making the route shorter. If it is desired to bring about economy, the Minister should not start with the lower ranks in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Esmonde say that for a number of years postmen have got a gratuity.  I am not aware that they have got any gratuity unless they are established.  I know of the case of a man who has been a postman for about 50 years and he has no prospect of getting any pension when he retires except the old age pension.  If the Government cannot see their way to making these men permanent after a number of years, they should at least give them a gratuity.</P>
      <P>It is very important that telephones should be made available for rural areas.  Some of these areas have a large population, some of whom live probably six or seven miles from the nearest town.  While telephones have been installed in the towns, rural dwellers are as backward as they were 20 or 30 years ago.  The Minister should realise that rural dwellers are labouring under many disadvantages, that they are Irish people and that they should be catered for before any other section.  I want to stress this point and I hope the Minister will see to it during the coming year that priority is given to all claims for telephones in rural districts.</P>

      <P>I wonder is there the same problem in the other provincial towns as there is in Wexford with regard to the General Post <Col N="293" /> Office there.  The Minister has been given many bouquets&mdash;I suppose the majority of them are deserved&mdash;but I would suggest that he turn his attention to this particular problem.  I wonder when will the Social Welfare Department be divorced or at least separated from the Post Office Department. In recent times, I think it is true to say, the officials in the different post offices in the provincial towns throughout the country are at their wits' end to know how to cope with all the different clients who come into the post office.  The greatest example of the chaos that exists sometimes in the post offices was amply displayed the week before last when the unfortunate officials there had to deal with hundreds and, in some instances, thousands of claims and payments-out in respect of children's allowances.  I do not think it is fair to the staff and I do not think it is fair to the customers and the general public who go in.  It has been my experience that I have often been kept waiting for half an hour in the Wexford General Post Office for a couple of 2½d. stamps.  I am not laying any blame on the staff.  As a matter of fact I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the plight in which these assistants find themselves. They just could not hand me out my stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of the Post Office, I believe, is to deal with people who want to buy stamps and send telegrams, to receive parcels, to arrange for telephone calls.  Now we find that in the post offices in this country a big proportion of the work involves issuing old age pensions, issuing children's allowances, making payments to widows and to orphans, receiving fees for wireless licences and dealing with people who want dog licences.  There should be some special office or at least some special counter in the post offices in the big towns, especially in the provincial towns, to deal with all these items I have mentioned, like old age pension payments, widows' and orphans' payments, dog licences, wireless licences, and so one, most of which should be the function of the Department of Social Welfare.  If that cannot <Col N="294" /> be done, if there cannot be a separate compartment, a separate office or separate counter to deal with all this social welfare work, the Minister should arrange to have the staff increased, if it only be a temporary increase for the payment of these items on the particular day or days during the week.  This would facilitate the public and would take a lot of burdensome work from these unfortunates who have to deal with the clamouring public on many busy days during the week.  I appreciate that that would not be feasible in the rural areas; I also appreciate that the rush in the rural post offices would not be as big as it would be, say, in Wexford town, in the City of Kilkenny, in Drogheda, Dundalk, Tralee, Clonmel and towns of such sizes.  But I do seriously suggest that there be some attempt to divorce social welfare from the Post Office Department or at least to arrange some separation within the office.</P>
    <P>There is another complaint I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister, and that is the length of time which a letter posted in Wexford remains in Wexford.  There are two posts out of Wexford; one is at 3.30 p.m. and the other at 8.30 p.m..  That means if I post a letter at 8.30 p.m. in Wexford it is lying in Wexford town for 19 hours before there is any attempt to take it out That is ridiculous. It is very bad service from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the people of Wexford, and I trust the same thing does not happen all over the country, or I trust it at least does not happen in the other provincial towns.  Is it not ludicrous to think that in the year of 1952 if I post a letter at 8.30 at night time, it should stay in Wexford town for 19 hours? That upsets a lot of people.  It upsets in particular&mdash;and I have been asked to draw the Minister's attention to this &mdash;commercial travellers who write the bulk of their letters at night time, and who are not in a position or who are not ready to have them posted until midnight or early the next morning. Most of those letters go to Dublin, and I suggest that if there were a post out of Wexford early in the morning those letters would be delivered on the <Col N="295" /> second or third post in Dublin City. The funny thing about it is that whilst the post is taken out only at 3.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m., we have trains which leave Wexford around 7 a.m. and another at 10.30 a.m.; there is then the one at 3.30 p.m. and a van which leaves at 9 p.m.  There are two trains out of Wexford which do not carry any mail, and I would suggest to the Minister that he would have these trains employed to take mail out of Wexford town and to draw from the areas adjacent to Wexford town as well.</P>
    <P>I would support the plea of other Deputies for the auxiliary postmen. The usual reply that is given when we ask that the salaries or the wages of these auxiliary postmen be increased is that they are only part-time.  The officials of the Department and the Minister go out of their way to tell us that some of those men work only 20, 25 or 30 hours per week and that they are paid at an hourly rate.  In most cases their wages approximate to something like £3 or £3 10s., but certainly they are well below the wages paid to the agricultural labourer or the road worker in the district.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, it is impossible for them to get work after they have completed their 30 hours during the week.  If a man is finished delivering the post at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the afternoon, there is no farmer going to take him on.</P>

      <P>It will be for the Minister to correct me when he stands on his feet.  I have in mind a particular case of an auxiliary postman who receives £2 16s. per week or at least he did a few months ago.  He worked for about 25 hours per week. When I suggested that an increase be applied to him I was told that he was paid that amount of money for 20 hours' work and that he could go and get some other employment when he finished his 20 hours during the week or when his stipulated number of hours per day were completed.  I suggest now that it is absolutely impossible for such <Col N="296" /> people as auxiliary postmen to get work either with a farmer, with the county council or through any of the ordinary sources in the rural areas. The Minister should set his mind towards trying to improve their wages because I believe they should be paid not alone on the basis of the work they do but on the basis of their availability and the service they render.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also take this opportunity in his reply of correcting a wrong impression that may have been gained from people who, for the last number of years, have been clamouring for telephones.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister was reported wrongly or not, but certainly in a speech in recent months he complained&mdash;I will not use his exact words&mdash;that he could not get people in the country to take telephones.  That is the interpretation his words appeared to bear as reported.  Many people came to me and asked me if I did not think that was the best joke of all time.  The people who came to me are quite capable of reading and interpreting speeches for themselves, and that is the interpretation they put on the speech of the Minister as reported in the Press.  They thought it was a huge joke.  These people had been waiting for years for telephones and suddenly they see the Minister reported as complaining that he cannot get people in the country to take telephones.</P>
      <P>As far as my district is concerned, there has been a speed-up in the provision of telephones.  I do not know if that is true of other areas also.  I think the Minister should take an opportunity now of correcting any wrong impression that may have been created as a result of the report of the speech made by him in recent months, and I would appeal to him to provide extra telephone booths in the larger towns. I do not know whether there is any discrimination in regard to that matter.  On what basis are these public telephone kiosks erected?  On what grounds does the Minister and his Department decide where these telephone booths are to be placed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I addressed a parliamentary question within the last 12 months asking how many telephone booths there were <Col N="297" /> in towns similar in size to Wexford. There are two kiosks in Wexford. I understand there are four in some of the other provincial towns with a population similar to that of Wexford. When replying, I would like the Minister to devote some of the time to telling us the basis on which these telephone kiosks are erected in the different provincial towns.  In the built-up areas in Wexford there is urgent need for more public telephones.  People in corporation housing schemes cannot afford to install private telephones. They have no real or genuine necessity for doing so and it would be a boon to these people if public kiosks were provided for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in determining whether or not a kiosk should be erected, try to assess whether or not the erection of such a kiosk would be an economic venture from the point of view of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Irrespective of whether or not the venture is economic, the Minister and his Government have a certain duty to the taxpayers.  The local authority is a fairly competent judge as to the necessity for a telephone kiosk, and when a demand is made by the local authority the Minister should make an all-out effort to facilitate that body.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also devote his attention to the suggestion made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  Some effort should be made to ensure that rural doctors get certain facilities during the night as far as the telephone service is concerned.  Many of these doctors have no method of making contact with their colleagues, with hospitals or with the towns.  Rural doctors ought to have the same telephone facilities as the Gardaí have.  In providing those facilities, the Minister would be doing an excellent service not only to the doctors but to the country as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if the Minister has considered the question of delay in relation to the installation of telephones in Dublin.  I am not satisfied that the present method is working to the advantage of the people generally.  We are told that the Department is making the best possible use of its staff.  There is no shortage of materials now as compared <Col N="298" /> with the shortage that was experienced during the emergency.  Have adequate steps been taken to recruit and train staff to meet the growing demand?  Remember, the demand continues to grow year by year.  I believe that the delay experienced at present is discouraging people from applying for telephones.</P>
      <P>A man in my constituency applied for a telephone last March 12 months. His neighbour applied for a telephone a few months earlier, but in the previous year.  The wires for the purpose of connecting up the first applicant had actually to be brought across the garden of the man who applied last March 12 months.  He asked to be connected at the same time and was told that he could not be connected because his application came in the next year.  I cannot see where economy in the use of staff comes in there.  That man will have to be connected up at some date.  Possibly when he is connected up another man 300 or 400 yards away who applied subsequently will not be connected up.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of discontent and it is hard to make people believe that the Department is making the best possible use of its resources. Serious inconvenience is caused to people who have changed their residences and who need telephones for business purposes I know of cases where people have had to be sent out on bicycles or in taxis in order to keep in touch with their business.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to relieve the present situation.  In particular I would appeal to him to recruit all the staff necessary to implement the policy of the Post Office.</P>
      <P>There is another appeal I must make in connection with kiosks in the surburbs.  There is no kiosk in Kilbarrack.  The people there want a kiosk.  It is essential for them that they should have it.  I have been trying to get a kiosk for that area for the past seven years.  I believe there are other areas where kiosks are required. I suggest to the Minister that the matter is worthy of his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to certain matters <Col N="299" /> that are causing worry in my constituency. There are certain areas, to which I have adverted in parliamentary questions, particularly Rossmore and Leap, where a revision of the postal delivery is acutely necessary.  I know that the Minister has general reorganisation problems to face but in these particular cases it is only adjustment and reallocation of the time schedule that is necessary to meet the particular demand.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal of agitation in my area with regard to the phones in post offices.  I have already seen the Minister about the matter but I would direct his attention to it again.  In some cases there is no cubicle or guard around the phone and there is not the privacy that might be required in certain instances.  The Minister is aware of the instinctive inquisitiveness of people in rural areas.  It would be well if that matter were attended to quickly as some people do not use the phone in the local post office for that reason.</P>
      <P>In general, I would ask the Minister, as did my colleague, Deputy Dockrell, to be very slow to burden the best-paying department, the telephone department, with increased costs.  If increased costs have to come in any serious way, I suggest to the Minister that other charges should be stepped up first rather than give another crack to the telephone subscribers to whom a very considerable impost has been meted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House in general must feel satisfied in the main with the effort made by the Department in the last number of years to improve the situation.  I cannot understand the difficulty that exists in getting personnel for telephone work.  At some stage, installation of telephones may call for highly skilled technicians, but it should be possible to obtain personnel for the normal line-laying and connecting, which would give a considerable impetus to the effort.  The Minister may tell me that, particularly in Dublin, the hold-up was caused by complications arising out of the building of the automatic exchange at Ballsbridge, but I would urge the Minister, <Col N="300" /> as that situation rights itself, to make use of ex-servicemen of the Signal Corps where they are available, to implement his staff with men trained in line communications and telecommunication. In that way he would be serving the public well, and at the same time would be placing confidence in personnel retired from the Army, which would be gratifying to any of us interested in the replacement and resettlement of Army personnel.</P>
    <P>The Department can no longer adduce scarcity of supply as an argument in their defence.  I am interested in one particular feature of the Department as a result of my membership of the Public Accounts Committee.  I would direct the Minister's attention to what I consider an unreasonable difficulty that is arising in his Department in connection with supplies. There seems to be inordinate delay in the fulfilment of contracts, particularly in relation to engineering stores.  Would the Minister review that particular type of buying by his Department, and include penalty clauses in the contract or ensure that, in the event of a contract being placed firmly, the public would not be mulcted for interim increases in the cost of the articles? My mind is agitated by the fact that in the period between placing of contracts and delivery there has often been a considerable increase in the cost of material.  One wonders if the public and the Department can be held to ransom in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate. I just wish to make the points, particularly apropos of the delivery problem in my constituency.  It is a rugged district and some places are isolated. I would like the Minister to do what he can to speed up delivery there.  The Minister will appreciate that if we are to succeed in making rural Ireland more attractive and in consolidating the population in rural Ireland, we must provide first-class amenities no matter what the ultimate Exchequer cost will be.</P>
    <P>In a system as large as the Post Office is, the strong area should be able to carry the weak.  I would urge that point of view.  The Minister did tell me that they were experimenting with some kind of cowled kiosk or a <Col N="301" /> cowl cover on the counter for telephones. I would like to know from him when he is replying if that experiment has been successful.  I would ask him to enhance the value of the phone in local post offices in rural districts by giving them that added touch of privacy which will enable people to use them more frequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. The more brief we are on this Estimate the more success we will have in getting our points of view seriously considered.</P>
      <P>First of all, I think the Post Office will have to recognise that, particularly with reference to the telephone section, they are, in fact, in relation to the public almost entirely a commercial undertaking, that the public who become subscribers regard the Post Office as they would regard a service for which they pay to any commercial undertaking.  It is in that sense that the Post Office should recognise the public and react to their request for service and to the possibilities of additional business.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the discussion has centred around the installation of telephones, the lag in meeting the demand in certain areas and the suggestion that saturation point has been reached in other areas.  I can only speak with experience of Dublin. I find, like my colleague, Deputy Colley, that a great number of people in my area complain seriously that they have been trying for considerable periods to have a telephone installed, without success.  We are told, when the Minister replies to questions, that this matter is being dealt with on the basis of priority of claim, in other words, the earlier the application the sooner the service, and that later applications must go on a waiting list. I believe that that is not the full picture.  I believe that there are certain areas, particularly in Dublin, where the lines are overloaded and that the delay in getting connections is due to the fact that the wires serving a particular district will not carry any more subscribers.  I wonder whether the engineering section of the Post Office will seriously consider that and deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> Then, time and again, we have interference with our telephone service by weather conditions and breakdowns. There are, of course, ordinary breakdowns as well.  But the manner in which telephones which are out of order are dealt with leaves much to be desired. I wonder whether more prompt attention could not be paid to attending to telephones which are out of order.  I do not think it needs any words of mine to convince the Minister or the Post Office staff that when one has a telephone, particularly if one belongs to a profession or is carrying on a business, it is of vital importance that the telephone should be available at all times.  If a telephone is left out of order for 24 or 48 hours it causes the greatest inconvenience and, in many cases, a very serious loss to the subscriber.  The Post Office will have to remember that in relation to most of its services, particularly the telephone service, it is a firm dealing with customers.  Every subscriber is a client and is entitled to the greatest courtesy and speedy attention to any complaints made.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister again to investigate the areas that are overloaded to the extent that new subscribers cannot be connected and see if something cannot be done to improve the situation.  I should also like to ask him, if there is any reason to believe that some of the cables laid, particularly in recent years, have been found to be faulty, if it would not be better to take up the faulty cables and put down new ones which will give satisfactory service for a long period of years rather than carry out temporary repairs to them.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of trunk calls.  Those of us who have to make trunk calls sometimes find ourselves subject to very long delays.  I know that there is a great improvement in this respect between Dublin and Cork because a new cable has been laid and the delays on that service are not very serious.  But, on the cross-Channel trunk service, there appears to be unreasonable delay.  I do not know whether anybody has had the experience of trying to get a cross-Channel trunk call between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. In many cases there is a delay of two <Col N="303" /> or three hours and in other cases there is such delay that it is too late for the parties concerned to communicate with each other.  Something will have to be done to make the trunk call connections much more speedy than they are.  Even in some parts of this country where there has been industrial development and where the telephone is of such commercial importance, there are delays of half an hour and even one hour during the ordinary working hours.  This is a commercial undertaking of the State, particularly the telephone service, and the Post Office will have to recognise that if it wants to make it pay and be satisfactory to the taxpayers it will have to be as progressive as any private undertaking.  I therefore hope that some notice will be taken of the matters which have been raised in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot view this Vote as brightly as it has been viewed by some previous speakers.  First of all, I believe that it is impossible to over-emphasise the importance of a daily delivery service for every part of the country.  I represent a constituency which suffers probably more than any other from restricted postal deliveries.  During the period of office of the Minister's predecessor he laid down a system which, if it had been continued.  I believe would have solved this problem within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only read one thing into the statement made by the Minister in introducing this Vote with regard to the daily delivery service&mdash;that he has sounded the death knell of the system introduced by Deputy Everett when he was Minister. Here is what the Minister said, as reported in column 179 of Volume 133 of the Official Report of 3rd July:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of what I have already said about the worsening of the Department's financial position, I feel compelled to sound a warning note regarding the implementation <Col N="304" /> of the scheme for the extension of daily deliveries to all rural areas. The scheme was originally undertaken on the understanding that, taking the rough with the smooth. the Exchequer would not be required to bear any additional expenditure. The stage has now been reached when, having regard to increased staff wages and increased charges generally for mechanical transport, petrol, etc., I am not fully satisfied that the implementation of the scheme in its entirety will not impose a burden on the Exchequer.  I am, therefore, having the whole position reviewed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I infer from that statement that, so far as extending the daily delivery service is concerned, the Minister is reviewing the position and that the only result of that review will be that he will put a complete stop to the scheme initiated by Deputy Everett. That is the only inference anyone can draw from such a statement.  I should like to know from the Minister his reasons for such an attitude</P>
    <P>Many city Deputies have complained about the telephone facilities provided in Dublin and stated that they are not sufficiently up-to-date.  In many parts of my constituency there are a number of people who do not know what a telephone is; they probably never saw one.  When Dublin Deputies are clamouring for extended telephone facilities for this city and the areas contiguous to it, surely it is in order for a rural Deputy to make a case for the people down the country getting at least a daily delivery of letters to their houses.  You have a twice daily delivery of letters in Dublin and in many parts of the country and in other parts of the country a delivery only every other day.  That is most unfair and unjust. There is no justifiable reason for such discrimination.  If people in some parts of the country are entitled to a twice daily delivery of letters and to extended telephone facilities, surely the people in other parts of the country are at least entitled to a daily delivery of letters.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realises the importance of people getting their <Col N="305" /> letters daily.  These letters may contain news of urgent importance.  The Minister, therefore, should review his policy.  According to his opening statement, he is afraid that the extension of the daily delivery may place a burden on the Exchequer.  Even if the Minister's contention is correct, surely those people living in isolated parts of the country are entitled to this facility even though it places a burden on the Exchequer.  The saving of expense is a very lame excuse for not going ahead with this policy of daily deliveries initiated by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>If that policy were put into operation it would dispose of many of the arguments put forward on behalf of the short-time postmen, because, if there were six day deliveries in all these areas, it would mean that the service would have to be reorganised and that would result in a number of part-time postmen being made whole-time officers.  It is very desirable that that reorganisation of services should be carried out as soon as possible, as undoubtedly the wages of rural postmen and of these part-time postmen at present, as various Deputies have pointed out, are entirely inadequate. A wage ranging from something over £2 to £3 15s. per week is no wage at present and it is about time that the claims of these rural postmen, and of the town postmen as well, were examined and something done to give them justice.  They are at least entitled to that.  It may be said, as Deputy Mac Fheórais mentioned, that they are only part-time employees, but in view of the fact that they work for five or six hours in the middle of the day&mdash; from 11 o'clock until 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock and, in some country districts, 5 o'clock&mdash;it is impossible for them to find other gainful employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of cost and of the burden which an extension of these facilities would impose on the Exchequer. Taking my own postal area in West Cork, Bandon is the head office for most of that area and it is from Bandon that all the letters to the western portion of the county are delivered. The Minister told me, in reply to a parliamentary question seven or eight months ago, that the <Col N="306" /> present method of delivering letters in West Cork cost from £3,000 to £4,000 more than it would cost if the Post Office organisation carried out the work.  The work is being carried out by Córas Iompair Éireann road services at present and I cannot see any reason why the postal services should subsidise Córas Iompair Éireann to the extent of £3,000 or £4,000, so far as West Cork is concerned.  That is a definite statement of fact which I make on the Minister's own figures.  If the Minister saves this sum of £3,000 odd which is at present being wantonly expended, so far as his Department is concerned, it would solve many of the difficulties we are faced with in West Cork and would enable the rural areas where there are restricted postal services at present to have a daily delivery without costing the Exchequer one halfpenny.</P>
    <P>There is another section of postal workers who are deserving of more consideration than they are getting.  I know that all these cases involve money, but, at the same time, it is only right that the grievances of any section of the postal service should be brought forward during this debate. I refer to rural sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  Even though the work in some of the isolated offices may not be very heavy or the volume of business transacted very great, it is more or less a whole-time job.  Some of these sub-postmistresses are paid a wage as low as £1 per week in some cases, and there is no one can contend that even if it were only a matter of keeping the door open that is adequate compensation for their work. These sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are entitled to more consideration than they are getting, particularly in view of the fact that whatever business they are doing has increased greatly all over the country of late.  Children's allowances and other benefits are paid through the Post Office, and more work is transacted in these places now than was the case in past years.</P>
    <P>Another category of Post Office employees whom I would place in the same position are the clerical assistants in the various post offices throughout the country.  Usually a clerical <Col N="307" /> assistant is appointed to an area away from his home, and his first expense is, on the average, 50/- a week for board and lodging.  If we take 50/-weekly, which I believe to be a fair sum for board and lodging, from his weekly wage, we find that he has very little left, and, in view of the rapid increase in the cost of living recently, it is only right that their pay should be reviewed and stepped up, to bring it into line with the pay and conditions obtaining in somewhat similar services, services which do not carry the responsibility with which the Post Office clerk has to contend.  He is faced with the responsibility of handling probably hundreds of pounds in the week, in the shape of deposits, payments for stamps, and so on, and his is therefore a responsible position, much more responsible than that of a clerk in a local authority office or a private business office.  Their pay is not commensurate with their work, and they are definitely entitled to have their position reviewed as early as can be.</P>
    <P>Another item which I was asked by a few people to mention here is connected with the Post Office Savings Bank.  In the majority of provincial towns and in many of the rural post offices facilities are available to people for lodging any spare money they have to their accounts in the savings bank, but these facilities are, in my opinion, very inadequate.  The Irish people traditionally like to transact their business privately and that condition cannot obtain so far as making deposits in many of our provincial town post offices and all village post offices is concerned, because when a depositor goes into the post office to lodge £1 or £10, his book is put on the counter. The clerk may have to attend to some other customer, or even if he remains there, the man's neighbour may come in and be curious to ascertain the wealth of the man making the deposit. That may seem funny, but I know that people take exception to it.  They want to keep whatever amount of money they have in the Post Office private and they do not want to let their neighbours know that they have £10, £20 or £1,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> That state of affairs does not exist so far as the banks are concerned.  If you are lodging money in a bank there are facilities, if you wish to request them, for going into a private room to transact your business, away from the gaze of the public, with some official of the bank, and I contend that the depositor going into the post office is entitled to equal facilities.  If, for some reason of his own which he is perfectly entitled to hold, he requires his business to be transacted privately, there should be some room or some place cut off from the general office where he will be enabled to transact his business without other people who may come into the post office knowing all about it.  I think that is a very fair contention, and in rural towns it would be very easy to put this idea into effect. People are entitled to have their business dealt with privately.</P>
    <P>Almost all Deputies have mentioned the need for telephone facilities.  I believe that the need is even greater in country districts than in the cities and towns because I feel sure, irrespective of the complaints of city and large town Deputies, that they are fairly well provided for at present and have no real grievance.  That is not the position in country areas and it has worsened a good deal of late since the measure was introduced whereby Gárda stations close at nine o'clock. No matter how urgent a phone message to a country district may be, at the present moment it is impossible to put it through because the Gárda stations were the only places which were open to receive a call and they are now closed.  Some measure should be adopted to counteract that.  I cannot see for the life of me why in fair sized villages a public kiosk could not be erected and connected with a call office with an all night service.  Then if a man or woman in a village required to send an urgent message or required the services of a priest, a doctor, a minister or other professional person a call could be put through such a kiosk and that would rectify the whole position.  People living in villages and small towns are entitled to that service, particularly as the Gárda stations are not open after nine o'clock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I would like again to impress on the Minister the importance of daily deliveries to rural districts.  I would ask him to continue the policy so capably pursued&mdash;and there is no question of doubt about that&mdash;by his predecessor in office, Deputy Everett, for three and a quarter years, a policy which was very welcome to many people in isolated rural areas.  Through it they found means of getting their letters daily and of enjoying facilities which have been enjoyed for years back by other sections of the community.  I would ask the Minister to change his view on this system, even though it may cost the Exchequer a little more, and give the people of rural Ireland and the rural postmen now under his charge the justice and fair play which, I believe not altogether through his fault, some are not getting at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to carry on where the previous speaker stopped and ask the Minister to carry out the work of his Department as vigorously as his predecessor, Deputy Everett. During the three years he held office we saw remarkable progress not alone on the technical but on the administrative side of the Post Office.  Apart from the statement he made in this House, the Minister has so rarely referred to the work of his Department in his public pronouncements that it is hard to know what his policy is.  I was glad to note from his statement that stockpiling of essential materials for the Post Office took place during his predecessor's time.  It was denied a good many times that there was any stockpiling while at other times it was alleged that stockpiling did take place. However, in this case we are glad to hear that there was stockpiling and that we have a quantity of useful materials in the Post Office which will enable normal expansion and technical development to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to provide more telephone kiosks.  He might do so even on O'Connell Bridge where there is a number already, because even there we see people waiting their turn.  It has been shown in this Estimate, and the Minister has himself stated, that there has been good revenue from telephones.  Considering <Col N="310" /> that there are 5,500 people still on the list waiting anxiously for a telephone to be fitted we can appreciate that there is an opportunity there to increase revenue.  The more rapidly these people are provided with telephones the surer we can be that revenue will increase.  It may be argued that the cost of installing a kiosk is rather high; somebody mentioned £150.  Even with that expense we can rest assured that in time the capital expenditure will be refunded and in the meantime the people will have the benefit of that service.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention, for instance, the town of Swords, where there is no telephone kiosk.  People who want to call a doctor or to put through an urgent call have no public telephone kiosk.  There is a post office there, of course, but it is closed at certain times, closed for longer periods than it is open.  It is not open at all on Sunday, it is closed for a half-day and it is closed after a certain time in the evening, and during these times no telephone service is available to the people of Swords.  They must seek a telephone either in a private house or in a public house, but they cannot go independently to a public telephone kiosk.  That is only one example.  Palmerstown, a rapidly developing area, has also been left without a telephone kiosk.  West Cappagh, Finglas, the Navan Road and Wadelai at Ballymun are places where there is rapid building development and where the population is quickly increasing.  A telephone service is only one of the many amenities which they lack and some effort should be made to ensure that it will be available to them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to provide, if it is at all possible, as many kiosks as he can.  I do not care how cheaply they may be erected.  We need not erect kiosks which will last for 1,000 years because it is probable that a different type of service will be available by that time.  If we put up any durable type of box I believe that it will be quite sufficient in view of the changing times and the altering techniques in telephonic engineering.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider providing auto-cycles for postmen in certain rural areas.  It would not be necessary <Col N="311" /> in all areas, but in certain rural districts it would be to the advantage of everybody concerned.  In populous districts, of course, bicycles are more suitable, and in built-up areas it is a more practicable proposition for postmen to travel on foot, but there are rural areas where there is a big, scattered population and the postman must cover a large mileage.</P>
    <P>In these districts I feel that postmen should be provided with auto-cycles in order to provide the public with an efficient service.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there are districts, even in County Dublin, where postmen are obliged to travel on foot still.  They have to walk up to ten miles every morning to carry out their deliveries. I feel that an effort should be made to provide these postmen at least with bicycles.  I do not suggest that auto-cycles should be provided where they have to walk, say, only ten miles, because I am sure city postmen have to walk similar distances, but the fact that in rural areas, even in County Dublin, a postman has to cover ten miles on foot seems to suggest that our postmen are not provided with up-to-date equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned that there was need for efficiency in the Post Office, that it should be considered as a commercial undertaking at the service of the public and in a position to give the public an efficient and prompt service.  I should like to say that in a general way the post service is efficient.  Exceptional cases, of course, arise now and again and it is unfortunate that these exceptional cases tend to detract from the reputation for very good service that is available from the Post Office generally.  You have, for instance, very efficient telephone operators and some inefficient ones, too.  The subscriber has to put up with what he gets, when he is operating through exchanges, and it is unfortunate that the same high level of efficiency is not always displayed. I was wondering whether any method of identification could be used to ensure that the inefficient operators could be made known.  In a general <Col N="312" /> way, the public have no redress.  Occasionally the public are harshly treated by operators but they have no redress. If there was some system which would ensure that inefficiency of that character could be eliminated, I do not think we would have any reason to complain of inefficiency in the working of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I should like to say finally that I hope that the threat to which the Minister gave expression the other day in regard to the increased cost of postage will not materialise and that he will find some other way of meeting the deficit.  If postal charges are increased many people will be obliged to economise in their expenditure on correspondence.  Instead of sending out three letters at the time, they may send out only two.  The result will be that a smaller revenue will be obtained than if the postal charges were not increased. I should rather see instead some measure of encouragement which would have the effect of bringing our people to realise the value of the postal services and would induce them to make wider use of them.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will try during the present year to provide telephone connections for the 5,500 people who are on the waiting list. They have been on the waiting list I think for a considerable time in some cases.  I know that some people who could not get telephone connections when they originally applied for them have abandoned the idea altogether. Some of these people have renewed their applications and they are again being asked to take their place on the long waiting list.  I hope that in the coming year the Minister will be able to provide these people with services.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the position regarding the telephone link between Dublin and Belfast, via Drogheda and Dundalk.  I remember that a couple of years ago it was proposed to provide a trunk line such as that from Dublin to Cork.  I do not know what has happened in the meantime but I should like to know from the Minister just what are the plans concerning the provision of that link between Dublin and Belfast via Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to thank Deputies who paid tribute to the work of the Department and to the improvements that have taken place in the course of the past year.  I am grateful for the appreciation which they have expressed of the efforts by the officers and so many workers, numbering 15,000 persons in all, to provide better facilities for the public.  Having started in that way, I feel, as a person who has not had very much experience of Estimate work, that I may perhaps have been too optimistic in supposing that if I delivered a very long speech in introducing the Estimate, Deputies would do me the favour of listening to it because very many of the questions to which answers have been asked by Deputies have already been answered in that speech, including all sorts of questions relating to matters such as silence cabinets.  It makes one feel inclined to take less trouble in preparing one's introductory speech if one knows that questions are going to be asked, whether one gives the information sought in advance or not.  However, the Estimate has been received very courteously by Deputies and I must assume that the fact that they did not refrain from asking questions which had in fact already been answered is not to be attributed to any feeling of dissatisfaction with the service as a whole.</P>
      <P>I may add that I see absolutely no justification in any of the speeches for the motion to refer back the Estimate. There are I know certain Estimates which are of a particularly contentious character and in which contentious questions of policy may be involved, where it is usual to have such motions, but we have heard nothing of that kind during the course of the discussions on the Estimate.  Having listened carefully to Deputy Everett I was satisfied that he could not find any precedent in the last 20 years on which to base his motion to refer back this Estimate.  That is all I have to say on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputies who referred to the general question of the deficit in the accounts, I should like first of all to say that I am well aware of the <Col N="314" /> commercial character of the telephone services and that to increase charges is a most dangerous thing to do because it discourages the telephone habit.  I can assure Deputies that whatever may happen in connection with this deficit, it is not proposed to take any immediate action and that in whatever action is ultimately taken due regard will be had to the state of the telephone finances, bearing in mind the fact that the more reasonable the charges the higher the profits will be eventually.  Deputies can be assured, I think I can say without any exaggeration, that the telephone charges will be the last to be increased of all the charges, which are capable of being increased, in an effort to reduce the deficit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett, like a number of Deputies on the Opposition, talked lightly about the deficit as though a sum of £1,000,000 was something which could be easily forgotten.  It is a very considerable sum, and even if the cost of stockpiling is eliminated, and the estimated loss is given as £860,000, it means in popular terms, I think I am right in saying, a penny on the pint of stout.  That is a serious matter and no Deputy has contradicted my statement that the richer users of the service should pay for the social element of losses involved in the three services. No Deputy in fact can prove that the richer users should not pay for the social element of loss rather than that it should be paid for by any other kind of taxation.  The usership of the three services is, roughly speaking, with obvious exceptions, in proportion to the wealth of the persons concerned, just, as in the case of the ordinary State accounts, there are people who indulge in certain taxable amusements in proportions which in a few cases may not relate to their income, in general the wealthier pay higher taxes.</P>
    <P>The very obvious deduction is that, just as people pay income-tax in order to defray the cost of the social services, a transfer, in part, from the richer section of the community to the poorer section, so the richer users of the departmental services should be asked to pay something towards the loss on remote telephone call offices, on small post offices and on the long distance <Col N="315" /> delivery of telegrams.  I think they should be asked to pay some of the loss.  I am quite aware that taxation, or, at any rate, the greater part of it, has its psychological effects and that people can always find exceptions to every statement.  Nevertheless, I am very glad to notice that no Deputy has contradicted what I have said in general.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make it quite clear that the loss has arisen, almost entirely, between the period 1952-53 and the period 1950-51.  I have not indulged in any extravagant experiments. I have not arbitrarily increased costs in any direction.  I have insisted on an economy campaign and a campaign of increased efficiency.  The officers of my Department, extremely able men, do all they can to avoid unnecessary forms and unnecessary red tape of every description.  I know that economies in working have actually been effected to the value of £10,000 a year since the Estimate was framed. That shows what can be done by improved methods of organisation and of working.  The increase in staff pay, which was very merited, related to other increases which took place as a result of the Civil Service award, amounted to £592,000, and the pension liability to £51,000, making a total of £643,000.  That was, roughly, equal to the difference in the deficit between the two periods I have mentioned&mdash; 1950-51 and 1952-53.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, up against, as I have said, a rather typical case of inflation. It is a case of inflation about which there need be no political dispute or disagreement.  Neither in 1950-51 nor in 1952-53 did the revenue of these services increase by anything like a sufficient rate to cover these increased salary awards which were considered essential because of the increase in the cost of living which has been taking place since 1948.  Everyone knows the international reasons for the increase in cost of living.  Every country has had to face this difficulty.  It is a matter about which there need be no argument.  I mention it just as an example of inflation, for which the present Government cannot be held <Col N="316" /> responsible since the traffic did not increase either in the year before the present Government took office or in this year in a manner to cover the cost.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the background of the Estimate so far as finance is concerned. I do want to stress, once again, that we are doing everything we can to improve efficiency, and not only to reduce costs but to reduce the mental strain on the officials.  If the volume of traffic has increased by anything from 70 to 100 per cent. since 1939, and if the staff only goes up by 27 per cent., we want by improved methods not only to ensure the happiness of the staff but to reduce costs as well.  I should say, without exaggeration, that the hundreds of changes that have been made in the direction of abolishing forms and of simplifying forms and financial checks, of abolishing red tape that is no longer necessary, have all contributed to that end. I should like to emphasise that again because the Civil Service is supposed, by the public, to be universally inefficient. I guarantee that if any group of finance experts or industrial experts were to come into the service of the Post Office&mdash;although I believe they would probably suggest improvements since nothing can be perfect&mdash;they would find that a very great deal had been done to improve efficiency, just as though the Post Office were a wholly commercial organisation without having the social obligations which we accept and carry out for the sake of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal with some of the many inquiries which were made to me.  I do not think I can promise to deal with every point that was raised.  I shall try, however, to deal with the more important ones.  If Deputies feel disappointed, they can always address a question to me personally or ask a parliamentary question at a later date if I do not give an answer to all their questions now Deputy Colley referred to delays in the provision of telephones in the Dublin area.  Well, we have not been doing too badly in the first six months of this year.  I think we installed nearly 300 more telephones than in the first six months of last year.  In the year 1951 we installed more telephones in Dublin <Col N="317" /> than in the year 1950.  We are going ahead with that work as fast as we can.  I should like to refer to some of the difficulties which were raised by Deputy Colley about a person being refused a telephone while his neighbour was able to get one, although there was an area clearance being effected.  There must always, obviously, with the limited staff available, be some deadline that will apply to telephones in respect of any particular area clearance.  For example, we may decide to do the Rathmines area, taking a given date, say, the 1st January, as the deadline for applications. If, on reaching the area, we decide to take the applications coming in in the February following, inevitably we delay our machinery and workers going, say, to the Harold's Cross area.  That is one of the unfortunate things we have to face.  There must be a ruthless attitude with regard to the deadline applying to any clearance area.  There must be a deadline, and so late applications must await the next turn.  That is very sad but it is true.  All the tyranny of mathematics in relation to time affects voting and divisions in the Dáil in the same manner as it effects the telephone service.</P>
    <P>In regard to kiosks, we installed 23 in 1951, and seven of these were in Dublin.  We have already established 20 this year, a proportionate number of them being in Dublin.  We are always increasing the number as the city swells and grows.  I think there are altogether 141 kiosks in Dublin City alone.  I promise to take due account of Deputy Colley's and of other people's representations in regard to the point of establishing more kiosks.  We believe that a kiosk should pay for itself.  We have call offices for social purposes, many of which do not pay.  A kiosk has an annual charge attached to it of £35 per annum.  We are establishing them mostly in towns of over 1,500 people. In towns of larger population we have one or more kiosks in addition to the public telephone in the post office.  We believe that, on the whole, it is best for kiosk service to pay for itself.  We offer local authorities the chance, if they so desire, of guaranteeing the <Col N="318" /> minimum annual charge on a kiosk, so that, in a new housing scheme designed or constructed by a local authority, if there is tremendous clamour for a telephone kiosk&mdash;particularly in an area where there is already a call office and possibly a kiosk in another area of the town&mdash;we may decide it is up to the local authority, if they so desire, to guarantee the annual charge, to pay any sum due.  If people who clamour for the telephone are right in thinking that the kiosk will be freely used then the local authority will not have to pay on any guarantee.  This seems, on the whole, to be a pretty fair offer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney made the suggestion that there was some need for improvement in the manners of operators.  I listened to him with patience, but I have been so delighted with the improvement in the whole atmosphere of the telephone exchange and with the tremendous improvement in the telephone operators that I feel I can ignore Deputy Rooney's observations.  All I can say is that the manager of the trunk exchange has recorded a most delightful increase in the number of commendations of the staff and a decrease in the number of complaints, in the course of the last 12 months.  The good work of improving the position there is still going on.  The staff themselves fully understand that they are in many ways the show piece of Government activity in this country. They have work involving very great tension to perform and they are in contact with the people more than any other section of the service, from the standpoint of having to exercise efficiency at all times.  There has been a fine spirit of co-operation shown in regard to this whole matter.  We, on the other hand, are improving their amenities very considerably and also the amenities of the night telephone operators.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to delays in repairs to the telephone system where breakdowns occurred.  Deputy Briscoe cannot have read the Estimate.  If he had he would find that we are now dealing with long-term cable repair and reconstruction in Dublin City.  It has been deferred for far too long a period and we have to divert staff temporarily <Col N="319" /> so that that work may be done.  The result of repairing and reconstructing the underground cable system will make it easier later on to join applicants for service, reduce the time taken to effect repairs and should result in an all round improvement in the efficiency of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also referred to the delays in cross-Channel calls and there again I mentioned in introducing the Estimate that next year there will be another 60 circuits available for cross-Channel calls and there should be a great improvement.  Indeed, at most times a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service to Britain, other things being equal, will be provided.  I cannot give an absolute guarantee about this, but there should be a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service established gradually from the time these circuits come into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the overcrowding of the post office at Wexford. I feel that that must be somewhat exceptional. We find that we have people who take records of the length of time that queues wait.  As Deputies know, there is frequently a fairly quickly moving queue at the General Post Office.  We get complaints suggesting that people have waited for a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, when in reality it must have been something like one-twentieth of that time.  The circumstances must have been very exceptional on the day on which Deputy Corish visited Wexford Post Office.  I should be glad to have particulars from him.  Although we know there are certain times when there are bound to be queues, we like the queues to move rapidly.  I hope that Deputy Corish's references were slightly exaggerated, as I believe they were.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the speed of mail vans.  The schedules do not provide for an exceptional speed. If the Deputy was nearly beheaded, or if any of his relatives were, by a mail van, he should give particulars.</P>
    <P>In regard to half-day closing, the post office closes for half a day where that is the practice of the shops in the district.  If a sub-postmaster wishes to be in a position to follow the practice in his district, he should ask permission <Col N="320" /> from the head postmaster of the area and his representations will receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the sorting office.  I quite agree with him that there have been very great delays in providing up-to-date buildings in the centre of Dublin, particularly those concerned with the sorting and main distribution of the parcel post and the post.  I think that the sorting office question has been under consideration for nearly 20 years.  All I can do is assure the Deputy that the legal formalities in regard to the site for a new sorting office are nearing their end and we are actually making a preliminary investigation in regard to the character of the building so that when the site is assured steps can be taken to provide working drawings for the new office.  I am aware that a number of these buildings are out of date.  We are making every effort to meet the situation.  I think that we will find by the end of this year that the Board of Works have acceded to the pressure we have brought to bear on them for the redecoration of district post offices and improved staff facilities and for speeding up this work.  As Deputy Norton knows, the Post Office, unfortunately, tends to come at the end of the queue because of matters such as schools and other buildings that are considered to have greater importance from the social point of view.  I can assure the Deputy that I am trying to get an improvement in the decoration of Post Office buildings because, as I have already indicated, I regard them as show pieces of Government activity. Although not as important as the question of slum houses and schools, they play a very great part in the life of the community and I am doing all I can in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred to the position of the night telephonists in Exchequer Street Exchange and other areas.  The question of their conditions is being very actively considered.  It is not being put on the long finger.  I visited the Exchequer Street Exchange informally last night, to discover to my delight that the men's retiring room is being constructed and their amenities in that building, not originally designed as a telephone building, <Col N="321" /> are being improved.  The conditions in the new St. Andrew Street Exchange will be better, as we have experience of what we need.  I hope to be able to make a decision about the position of the night telephonists.  I am aware that the fact that there is a continual wastage of the staff is a bad sign.  As the Deputy is aware, night telephone work suits certain types of people, who take it on as a short-term job.  They do not always leave because they find the conditions unsuitable.  Sometimes they leave because it forms part of their career arrangements.  Some of them, however, do leave because continuous night work of this type is not frequently found in other industries or trades.</P>
    <P>In regard to postmen's uniforms, I can assure Deputy Norton that the staff associations will be consulted when any proposals are made and that their advice will be welcomed by the committee.  I am not satisfied with the postmen's uniform.  I am not satisfied that it is as pleasant looking, as comfortable or as convenient as it could be and that is why I asked that the matter be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred to the bag-cleaning facilities.  I will have the Sovex bag-cleaning machine examined from the standpoint of its suitability for our service.  We had an estimate of the cost as compared with the present contract system.  The Department of Justice generally secures that contract for bag cleaning as indicated by the Deputy, and we find that in relation to present costs we would not be justified in purchasing the machine. The vast bulk of the bags are undoubtedly cleaned in Mountjoy, although sub-contracts are given out. The bags are thoroughly disinfected and, as far as I can gather, it is generally understood that the dust is fairly well removed from the bags.  Under the present system, where there is a float of 500 bags being cleaned every week, we have not had many complaints, but I will go into the question again of mechanising the cleaning of the bags.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred in his speech to the capital raised for telephone development work.  I want to <Col N="322" /> make it quite clear that capital was raised for telephone development long before the Coalition Government took office.  The capital repays itself.  For many years before 1948 telephone capital expenditure has been regarded as the orthodox type of investment, because the capital is repaid in an assured manner according to the best economic standards.  The principle of capital development has always been maintained in connection with telephone development, and was so maintained by the Government between the years 1932 and 1948.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies including Deputy Dr. Maguire, Deputy Dr. Esmonde and Deputy Corish referred to the tests applied to postmen to see whether they are working efficiently.  They are given every chance to appeal against an unfair decision and we have not had many complaints in that regard. The office do their best to test the time these men take.  I do not think Deputies need feel that the staff are in any way driven too fast by the supervisors who accompany them on their rounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey made some reference to the factor of interest on capital in connection with the rental demanded of telephone subscribers.  No excessive amount is demanded.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that the average amount required for interest and depreciation on a particular telephone line is about £10 per annum and that the average rental charge is less than that amount.  Poles, wires and instruments have constantly to be renewed. The rental is supposed to cover the charge in respect of interest, depreciation, renewal and so forth.  The call charges are supposed to cover the actual cost of operating the telephone service itself as distinct from maintenance. I do not think there is any unusual feature in regard to the interest rate.  Whatever special views which I know the Deputy has on the question of interest and the questions of capital and finance, I do not think he has any reason to complain of the conduct of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the manner in which the rental is calculated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to an increase <Col N="323" /> of 25 per cent. in respect of telephones this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise from my introductory speech on this Estimate that we might lose anything up to £250,000 in the coming financial year if we had not increased the charges.  We hope the telephone habit will grow as time goes on.  In relation to other services, the telephone service has remained inexpensive. It is the least expensive of all services compared with charges levied 20 years ago.  The rates have gone up only 25 per cent. compared with what they were many years ago.  In that connection it is well to bear in mind the increases which have taken place, not only in relation to other Government services but in the cost of almost everything in which the consumer is concerned.  I think the Deputy will realise that the rates, on the whole, are very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the rental, in fact, not a maintenance and service charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a complicated matter to explain.  For the purpose of computation we can only say that the rental covers depreciation, renewal and so forth, and that the call charge relates only to the cost of putting through calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And the telephone itself is serviced by the Department free of charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Cogan referred to remuneration in regard to the night telephone service.  It would be very costly for us to pay the rate that has been suggested in some quarters for night telephone services where a sub-postmaster rarely has to get up in the middle of the night&mdash;particularly in places where, perhaps, there is only one call per week.  Representations can be made in the usual way by the association concerned and those representations will have a sympathetic hearing.  We have what is known as &ldquo;sleep full service&rdquo; in relation to telephones where there is an all-night service with only a few calls coming in and where arrangements are made <Col N="324" /> so that the person in charge of the telephones can sleep for the greater part of the night.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan wants a competition for bright post offices.  Obviously this proposal offers great difficulties but certainly I shall consider the suggestion. It would be rather difficult to provide the award and to decide on the type of post office which would be most suitable but I shall have the suggestion considered as I shall have all the suggestions which are made in this debate considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan asked for information about contracts awarded by the Post Office Stores Branch.  Invitations to tender are sent to all firms known to be in a particular line of business. Those tenders are sealed and generally speaking the lowest tender is accepted, there being stated regulations in regard to exceptions.  The contracts committee, under the administration of the Minister for Finance, supervises the whole administration of Government contracts and in the case of contracts over a certain amount the committee take particular care to examine the tenders before the final award is made.  We have few complaints in regard to the allocation of contracts and that is something of which we can all be proud.  There has been no kind of scandal or allegation of pressure of any kind in that regard for years and years and years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite evidently, Deputy Desmond has not read or heard my introductory speech on this Estimate.  He talked as though no steps were being taken to expedite the provision of rural call offices, whereas, in fact, I have arranged that all post offices will have call offices within a period of about two years.  I am doing my best to double the rate of installation in order to encourage the telephone habit in the remotest districts in the country.  I have arranged, further, to deal with 1951 rural applications wherever possible in connection with the call office programme.  I am insisting that the engineers will be allowed to do the work in the way in which they want to do it.  They are going around the country and taking area by area.  Some places will have to wait two years to get a call office, but under the previous <Col N="325" /> arrangement they would, in many cases, have had to wait three or four years.  A record number of call offices were installed in 1951&mdash;even before the change in the system took place.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of a Sunday telephone service in areas where a Sunday telephone is particularly desirable. In a seaside resort it is possible for a hotel, by paying an extra charge, to have a service over and beyond the usual hours.  In no less than 63 seaside resorts there is a continuous service. Practically every seaside resort of any size, even quite small ones, has a continuous service at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett, and other Deputies, seem to refer to the question of stockpiling as though, again, that was a triumph for the Coalition Government. When we were dealing with the question of stockpiling in general we were hoping that there would be emergency stockpiling of an essential character in view of a possible war. Some of the Deputies tried to draw into the argument the whole question of the criticism in regard to the stockpiling which took place during the end of the year 1950 and the year 1951, and which has nothing to do with this Estimate.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs thought fit to acquire necessary stores against the possibility of a war or an emergency of one kind or another.  I should say in that connection that the ceasing of stockpiling will not mean unemployment. Normal orders will be given for stores and so forth.  We have not stopped ordering supplies because of having accumulated stocks.  We will maintain a certain amount of stockpiling of every commodity used by the Department.  Employment will be given in the ordinary way and, although the Post Office is not responsible for providing employment, we do our best to make sure that our orders are routed in the usual way so that the manufacturers who provide these goods will receive orders in a routine manner and will be able to continue employing persons who were ordinarily employed in their production.</P>
    <P>References were made by Deputies from the West to island radio sets.  We <Col N="326" /> are doing our best to have these delivered. The new type of set will be delivered in December of this year.  We are far from being in a sellers' market so far as equipment of all kinds is concerned. We can get all the equipment we need but on account of the Korean war&mdash;although deliveries are better&mdash; we have to wait a considerable time for certain types of stores, wire, machinery and apparatus used by the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the question of guest house priority telephone services.  Unless we insisted on guest houses registering with the Irish Tourist Board we might get demands from every kind of applicant.  We might get demands from a guest house where there would be only one or two lodgers for a very short time.  Such owners might make an excuse to get a telephone.  The simplest thing to do in the interests of the nation is to encourage all people whose occupation or way of life is providing people with holiday facilities to register with the Irish Tourist Board.  If they do we will try to provide them with a telephone in reasonable priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also referred to the fact that part-time postmen's wages were reduced as a result of postal revision in rural areas.  These revisions of services were introduced to improve the efficiency of Post Office workers. The position of postmen has not been disimproved by this revision.  In a very large number of places hours of attendance have been made more suitable for them and wages have been increased. It is inevitable that in a few cases&mdash;I must stress only in a few cases &mdash;some revision necessitated a reduction of wages but these revisions are carried out with as much regard as possible for the interests of the staff. I have made efforts to avoid any hardship and to reduce it to a minimum. It would be impracticable to avoid hardship altogether.  In such cases the men concerned are well aware that their service is temporary.  In every case of rural revision I go through with the officers of the Department the position of all men involved and we try to reduce hardship to the absolute minimum.  We have had very few complaints in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> While I am dealing with the question of rural revision, I should refer to the observations made by a number of Deputies to what was, in fact, the principal criticism in connection with this Estimate, the attention given to a certain warning which I delivered in regard to how far we could go on with revision.  I simply said that we would have to take account of increased costs and that we were examining the position. I did not commit myself either way.  In actual fact, there are 4,200 rural posts; 11 have less than a three-day delivery, 110 have a three-day delivery and 415 have a four-day delivery. To put it another way, 87½ per cent. of all rural deliveries are daily.  We are at the moment undertaking the examination of certain districts with a view to carrying out revision so that there may be a daily service.  In a number of districts this can be effected without any loss to the service.  We intend to complete revision in such areas and then study the position further in the other areas.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that an 87 per cent. daily delivery service for this country as a whole is very satisfactory having regard to the fact that the Post Office will lose over £400,000.  I sympathise with the Deputies who live in areas where there is a fairly high proportion of those restricted deliveries, but I should once again say that I am not despondent.  I must have some regard to the finances of the Post Office before I can go on to complete the entire process of revision. We are now dealing with areas where, we think, the work can be done without having any great increase in cost or where we can balance a savings against increased cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to some part-time postmen who are required to give two attendances, and are, therefore, unable to get any alternative work during the day.  These cases are not very common.  They arise mostly in connection with times of attendance to meet trains.  If a part-time postman finds a second attendance prevents him from getting other more remunerative employment we could make it easy for him to be relieved.  I myself should <Col N="328" /> like to see the number of the posts, where there are broken periods of employment, as few as possible.</P>
    <P>It is our objective, through rural revision and in every other way, to increase the number of full-time posts and the number of fully established postmen.  This is slow and difficult work, as Deputy Norton, who had to deal with this matter for so long, is so well aware.  Nevertheless, there is progress in that regard.  Every time a rural revision takes place, we do our best to increase the number of full-time postmen on the road.  Owing to geographical limitations, it is by no means possible to have all postmen full-time.  If a post is to be delivered early and collected reasonably early some part-time postmen are unavoidable. We are doing our best in regard to the whole matter.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Our aim will be to continue the trend.  Deputy Davin spoke about horse transport, and I have a certain amount of sympathy with what he said.  All I can say is that every consideration will be given to the desirability, perhaps, of maintaining some horse transport.  If it should be abolished it will only be for some adequate reason.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell spoke of inviting operators in commercial offices to training classes.  We give training and assistance to private branch exchange operators.  We will consider the Deputy's suggestion and discuss with him what he has in mind.  Deputy Dockrell also wanted to know the reason for delays in cross-Channel calls. He said the delays were longer when putting a call through from here to Great Britain than vice versa.  The delay is due to a number of technical reasons, and among these to the fact that the traffic is very often heavier on this side of the Channel.  The number of circuits and cables are divided evenly amongst ourselves and the people on the other side of the Channel, but the demand for calls eastwards exceeds the demand for calls westwards.  For that reason there is greater delay in obtaining a connection.</P>

      <Col N="329" /> Deputy Corish stated that some observations I made in regard to applications by farmers for a telephone service must have been badly reported, because the report conveyed that I thought people in rural areas were having telephones installed on demand.  It is true that newspaper reports of that particular speech were most inadequate.  What I really said was that long before the last war there should have been some system whereby people in rural districts would be encouraged to have telephones installed. I have in mind something along the lines of the canvass and publicity programme adopted by the Electricity Supply Board.  Irish farmers have fewer telephones than farmers in other countries carrying on an agricultural export industry.  There is a lag in joining up subscribers, but we are gradually catching up on outstanding applications. We are now examining ways and means of affording, some time from now, a rural telephone service on more advantageous terms.  However, everything we do in that regard must receive the consent of the Minister for Finance and will have to be specifically related to the Government's programme of developments in rural districts. As I said already, if a telephone service had been encouraged in rural areas, there would have been a general rural development of this service.  It would have been of advantage, because it would have expanded as time went on.  Out of 80,000 telephone subscribers, only about 5,000 are wholly resident in rural areas.  This is a very small number, indeed.  I am well aware of the fact that we have never caught up with all the applications for a telephone service for rural areas.  I am referring to a long-term policy, when I refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to telephone services being available at night for emergency purposes.  In cases where the Garda stations close down at 9 p.m., we try to make alternative arrangements for emergency calls in the sub-post offices.  If the sub-postmaster or the sub-postmistress is not in a position to deal with such calls, we try to make other facilities available.  In every possible case, a <Col N="330" /> doctor's house or a nursing home will be joined at night to an exchange away from the exchange that has been closed.  Wherever we have to refuse such facilities, it is simply due to technical circumstances over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that I managed to put right every single complaint that was put before me last year in regard to emergency night calls due to Garda stations closing at 9 p.m.  In view of the fact that a greater number of trunk circuits are being constructed this year in various areas, the position will right itself gradually.  I can assure Deputies that any complaints I receive as to the lack of any kind of emergency service in a particular area will be carefully investigated.</P>
    <P>There are a number of outlying districts which have no post offices, for instance, peninsulas.  I think the local authority in such areas should help by erecting at least a coin-box.  We have to stick to the principle that we cannot erect a private call-office in a place where there is is no post office.  If we did, we would never complete the programme we have undertaken, and we would be asking a limited staff to work far beyond their capacity.  We provide kiosks in an area with a population of over 500, and a number of citizens instal coin-boxes in various areas. We do our utmost to provide emergency night facilities wherever we possibly can.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of seaside resorts.  We have a continuous telephone service in 60 such places. When an exchange has over 10 subscribers, a service is provided up till 10 o'clock, and when an exchange has over 20 subscribers, the telephone service is continuous.  I think this is a fairly satisfactory standard to adopt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to the insufficiency of staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We do our best to recruit staff, and the number is continuously increasing.  However, if the volume of traffic did not increase more rapidly than staff, we would be losing a great deal of money.  There is still difficulty in obtaining a sufficiency of electrical engineers, and the bottle neck in regard to high skill staff has <Col N="331" /> not yet been resolved.  We are doing all we can in the matter.  I am glad to say that there will be more facilities available for the training of electrical engineers in University College, Dublin from now on and also in one of the other universities.  Everything is being done to stimulate interest in the Electrical Engineering Degree and in the Associate Degree, but there are still difficulties which, I hope, will be overcome in time.  The electrical engineering course takes a year longer than the civil engineering course, and this fact has constrained some people from taking the degree.  We have tried to make arrangements similar to those adopted by technical colleges in other countries whereby the fourth year could be done in two years by well recommended students for whom we would provide one half year's work per year in the Department.  However, no unanimity could be obtained among students or others.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of what occurs when we make available to a postman a full-time established post in certain districts and, as a result, the downgrading of a number of other unestablished postmen occurs.  We do all we can in regard to this matter.  The question of the establishment of postmen is one which is under constant examination between ourselves and the Post Office Workers' Union.  As far as I know, the system in operation has been accepted by successive Governments.  We do all in our power to avoid creating hardships, but, as the establishment of postmen has to be in accordance with Civil Service regulations, it must relate to the Civil Service as a whole.  It is necessary to have some form of establishment examination.  It is unfortunate that temporary postmen with long service do not either enter the examination for establishment or else do not succeed at the examination.  As the officials of the Post Office Workers' Union are aware, every effort is made to avoid hardship in these cases and to avoid unnecessary downgrading of those persons whose position must be altered by the coming into a district of established postmen.  We do all we <Col N="332" /> can in the matter, and I do not think anybody can deny that we are sympathetic as far as possible.  As I said already, it is up to the Department to increase the number of established postmen and to increase the number of part-time postmen.  The process is taking a long time, but it is proceeding gradually.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy seemed to think that postmasters are not paid in accordance with the volume of work they do.  Their payment is based on a unitary system.  Their remuneration is calculated on the basis of the amount of work they perform.  The more work they do the more pay they receive.  If the number of children's allowances are increased, a sub-postmaster will receive more pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They have their own association and they can make representations to us.  Judging by the number of applications we receive for the position of sub-postmaster and sub-postmistress, it must be considered a remunerative post.  Some sub-postmasters have shops and make a good supplementary income.  If they have not alternative income, the amount of income they receive from the post of sub-postmaster will depend on their own initiative.  The more work a sub-postmaster does, the more income he will receive. There is no question that from the number of applicants for sub-postmasterships, the extra shop business done as a result of post offices must be fairly substantial.  As I have said, we are always willing to hear representations in regard to that matter.</P>

      <P>I am well aware there will always be complaints and the complaints will be examined sympathetically in the same way as in the case of all other branches of the Post Office. <Col N="333" /> Deputy Collins referred to silence cabinets.  If he read the statement in connection with my Estimate he would have seen that we are actively investigating how to produce the type of silence cabinet which will overcome the difficulties mentioned.  Deputy Hickey referred to directories.  The whole question of the layout and printing of the directory is under examination at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Everett, in the course of his speech, made an extraordinary statement in regard to the allocation of a telephone to a particular applicant. At column 204, Volume 133, No. 2, of the Official Debates of 3rd July, 1952, he says: &ldquo;...the Minister told me it was a private matter.  I thought at the time there were some special arrangements concerned.&rdquo;  Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister states that some official sent out a letter to the effect that the application in question was to be given priority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he goes on to state that he is not satisfied with the position.  I find it very hard to understand Deputy Everett.  He has asked two questions and he has received two specific replies, namely, that the telephone was promised in December, 1950, in his time of office.  He implied by what he said that when it was promised as a priority he wanted to know what kind of priority it was.  He said that if it was promised, the officers concerned were acting against his instructions. Deputy Everett had given no particular instructions in regard to such an application.  He had maintained the general regulations in applying priorities and maintained the tradition in regard to carrying out telephone installations according to some rule and in some stated order. He had given no special instruction when the applicant was provided service on December 12th, 1950, and was promised that the telephone would be installed within six months.  By the time the telephone was installed over three years had elapsed and the telephone applicant was offered service because there had been a very great delay.  Deputy Everett never changed the regulation or the tradition in the <Col N="334" /> Post Office that everyone gets a telephone sooner or later.  No matter how many miles of wire or how many poles are required, everybody gets a telephone sooner or later and the people whose installations would be most costly wait a very long time.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether it is very much worth while to delay such applications. If they are going to be done in the long run, is it not better to do it in conjunction with the ordinary clearance area and not oblige people to wait for three years?  How it works out, as a whole, I am not aware.  I can say that one reason for the delay lay in the fact that there was a scarcity of poles at one time which made it essential to delay unduly all applications. In January, 1951, there were about 100 pre-1939 applications in the whole country and the one in question was the oldest in County Wicklow. Therefore, no regulation was broken, and the applicant was provided with service, in fact, at a very late date. As I have indicated, no special instruction was given to the contrary at any time.  It did not interfere with the provision of a telephone to any doctor in the county.  The only doctor who applied round about that time applied for a transfer of his telephone about one month after this other applicant's telephone was provided.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position a little bit later, at June 30th, 1951, there were 2,910 pre-1951 applications, of which 51 were pre-1949 and of which 417 were pre-1950.  If I had been asked specifically by this particular applicant to instal a telephone and service had not already been granted by a letter dated December 12th, 1950, my natural instinct would be to inquire how many other people there were in this extraordinary position that had waited two years for a telephone?  I would have found out there were quite a number and would have immediately ordered service.  I have insisted since then that all these old applications be cleared off as quickly as possible.  It is not a good thing to delay provision of a telephone in that way.  Having cleared off all but 118 of the pre-1951 applications&mdash; and these are going forward too&mdash;I have established a new rule that, instead <Col N="335" /> of telling people that they may or may not get a telephone, we will do all the rural call offices in two years and the 1951 applications in most areas.  Everybody whose installation involves over two miles of wire who has applied since 1950 is being told he will have to wait until these call offices are completed, until every outstanding 1951 application of less mileage of wire is completed.  But at least everybody knows that now the position is quite definite and when we have cleared off these arrears, we will go back to those people again who have very long mileages of wire or whose installation involves difficulties of an engineering character.  I think that is the best manner of dealing with the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett spoke in the most extraordinary way as though my word was not to be regarded, as though a departmental letter had not existed, as though there was some funny business in connection with it.  I suppose it will be sufficient if I tell the House that here is a letter in the file addressed to the applicant, that its number is 5939-50, that it is countersigned by two officials and was issued on the 12th December, 1950.  In the course of the letter to the applicant in question it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to inform you that it is hoped that the Department will be in a position to provide service within the next six months.  Terms and conditions will be quoted.</P>
    <P>The delay in replying to your correspondence is regretted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that I am, I think, treating Deputy Everett very leniently in this matter and showing very great restraint&mdash;particularly when it is borne in mind that from reading his speech one would get the impression that my word could not be believed and that the officers of the Department, whose impartiality and probity in regard to the awarding of telephones in response to applications is known, were conspiring with me in some way to deceive the public&mdash;I trust that now that I have given particulars <Col N="336" /> of the letter, that the reputation of the officers of the Department, of the Government as a whole and myself in particular will no longer be aspersed by Deputy Everett.  Surely he has full satisfaction in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear again that no instructions were disregarded. There was no instruction not to instal a telephone three years and two months after any person applied, and that is regarded as the extreme limit in connection with telephone applications. I hope, even though I have given an order now that people applying after a certain date whose telephone requires over two miles of wire will have to wait this year, that as long as I have the honour to be Minister, the position will never arise that an applicant will have to wait three years for a telephone, because it seems to me to be extreme and contrary to all reason.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered nearly all the questions raised on this Estimate. Deputy McGrath asked me about the work of the special committee for dealing with the appointment of sub-postmasters set up by Deputy Everett when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs subsequent to the Baltinglass incident.  I should make it clear at the outset that this committee is not a statutory body.  Neither is it a commission.  Because of that, I still take full responsibility for the appointment of all sub-postmasters.  It is quite impossible for me to adopt the same attitude towards this committee that I might adopt, for example, towards the Civil Service Commission in connection with the appointments for which there is a long-established principle and in connection with which there are competitive examinations, and suchlike formalities, the effect of which is almost to remove the Minister from anything more than a general, but nevertheless definite, supervision over the appointments of civil servants to his Department.</P>
    <P>This committee has no statutory function of any kind.  I have to take full responsibility for its decisions. During the past year I have found that the selections made by that commiteee were excellent.  The committee has done excellent work.  All the personnel <Col N="337" /> of the committee have had experience in different branches of Post Office activities.  Their selections are admirably impartial.  From the point of view of political discrimination, there is no foundation for any such suggestion to the contrary.  The committee has helped me to raise the standards required of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  There has been an all-round improvement in standards for other amenities and services throughout the whole country. The committee has assisted me on the important question of what should constitute an efficient sub-post office. It is only to be expected that there should be an improvement in Post Office standards just as there has been an improvement everywhere else, and the existence of the committee assists me in this matter.</P>
    <P>However, since I must take responsibility for the work of the committee, I make my own individual decisions in regard to appointments.  I do not think Deputies have any reason to complain of anything that has happened since I took office in relation to these appointments.  I generally accept the advice of the committee.  Sometimes I receive information of a human character in regard to certain applicants, information which is very useful to me and which, I think, would be accepted by the committee in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath mentioned, for example, the existence in a particular district of a family who had given outstanding national service during the war of independence.  On occasions when the committee put the names of applications for a sub-postmastership in order, there may be, perhaps, two or three applicants of equal merit. Where one applicant is known to be a person who occupied a key position in the national movement I do not see any harm in deciding to give that particular person the position.  I do not expect to have to do that very often.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the fact that extreme patronage existed in the old days and was carried on into our time I am equally well aware that that patronage is no longer desirable in present circumstances. As I have said, however, <Col N="338" /> it may be necessary occasionally to alter the decision of the committee.  I have already altered it on one occasion. In that case I believed there was a potential mistake made, and when that was pointed out to me by the Deputies, representative of all Parties, in the particular district I decreed that another person should be appointed.  I think I was quite right in doing so.</P>
    <P>There is a certain human element which must be borne in mind in connection with the appointment of sub-postmasters. Deputies can help me a good deal in that matter.  Deputy Norton, for example, talked about the frequent patronage in the old days in connection with the appointment of sub-postmasters, and adverted to the fact that that patronage continued to a certain degree right through.  It is, of course, almost impossible to abolish patronage overnight.  Deputy Norton knows that very well.  Opposition Deputies have done very little to acquaint the people in their constituencies of the fact that this committee exists because suggestions have been made to me, when sub-postmasters have been appointed, that an Opposition Deputy had been told by the postmaster that such and such a person would be appointed.  The Opposition is carrying on as if the committee set up by my predecessor did not exist at all.  I have already indicated that I have found the advice of the committee excellent and not to be lightly disregarded.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, representations are constantly received, although such representations are supposed to disqualify candidates in all matters appertaining to the Post Office, because of a long standing tradition as a result of the way in which it was run in the old British days.  It has never really stopped since.  For years and years the Government having administration from 1932 to 1938 was doing its utmost to provide employment for a very large number of people who had previously been victimised for one reason or another.  We need not go into that now.  The Deputy can accept that that was the case.  The first Administration undoubtedly exercised patronage.  Again, patronage had to be exercised between 1932 and 1948 in order to balance the position.  There were a great many people who had given good service in the I.R.A. for whom something had to be done, and so the patronage continued.  Representations were always made.</P>

The comparable figures in this year's Estimate and last year's (if this special provision in both Estimates is omitted) would be £3,525,020 for 1952-53 and £4,103,460 for 1951-52.  This represents a decrease of £598,440, which is mainly accounted for by the reduction of £570,000 in the grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, as against an increase of £700,000 in the grants from the Road Fund notified to local authorities.  This latter increase does not appear in the Estimates, as the Road Fund is accounted for separately.</P>
      <P>The chief items in which increased provision is made are in contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities (£26,570); in salaries, wages and allowances (£23,590), and in contributions towards loan charges of local authorities in respect of sanitary service works (£4,000).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average annual housing output since the initiation of the post-war housing programme in 1947 has been 4,576, and the average pre-war output <Col N="342" /> between 1932 and 1940 was 5,073.  The target of annual production for a ten-year programme of local authority housing is 7,000 dwellings.  In the last financial year, 7,195 houses were completed by local authorities, as compared with 7,787 in the preceding year. While, therefore, the output in 1951-52 was somewhat less than in the previous financial year it is satisfactory to see that for the second year in succession the target has been surpassed.  A further satisfactory aspect is that the housing needs, as estimated in 1947, had been satisfied by the end of last February in eight urban districts, two towns under town commissioners and two county health districts.</P>
    <P>At the end of May this year, 9,323 local authority dwellings were in course of construction, 3,145 were in preliminary contract stages and sites were available for a further 10,129 dwellings.  This latter figure represents the equivalent of a housing programme of over 17 months at the current rate of building.  Development of 435 of these sites in hand had been completed and work was in progress on the development of a further 2,607 sites. There are good grounds, therefore, for anticipating that the volume of housing work being carried out by local authorities will be maintained during the current financial year at as high a level as in any previous year.</P>
    <P>In reply to various parliamentary questions I have already stated the overall position as regards progress in the post-emergency housing programme, but I think it desirable to put the present position in round figures on record now.  Since the 1st April, 1947, nearly 24,000 dwellings have been completed, 9,300 are now being built, and positive steps have been taken towards building a further 13,200.  Thus the total number of houses built, being built or proposed to be built in the near future comes to 46,500, as against the target of 70,000 houses visualised for local authorities in 1947.  This is a record which is highly creditable to the local authorities, their officers and workmen, and to the various other parties who have contributed towards the progress being made.  The rural programme has made the most speedy <Col N="343" /> progress.  About 48 per cent. of the total estimated post-war needs have been met, and current and proposed building operations will bring this percentage up to 89 per cent.  In the urban areas, apart from Dublin County Borough, about 69 per cent. of the estimated needs have been met or are in course of being met.</P>
    <P>The number of dwellings completed by Dublin Corporation between April, 1947, and May, 1952, has exceeded the total completions by all other urban housing authorities, including the other three county boroughs.  Nearly 11,000 houses and flat dwellings have been completed or are being built or included in the current tenders.  Nevertheless, such is the extent of the city's housing problem that this great achievement represents in all only 36 per cent. of the total estimated needs.  Sites in the possession of the corporation will accommodate dwellings to meet a further 15 per cent. of these needs.</P>
    <P>A debate on housing, whether it arises in connection with these Estimates or otherwise, usually involves some degree of concentration on the problems of Dublin and Cork.  These problems have received my closest attention during the past year.  The difficulties arising have been discussed on successive occasions with the local representatives and the local officials.</P>
    <P>Close examination of the prospects in Dublin convinces me that the housing output in each of the next two or three years can be maintained at not less than the high average obtained over the past few years.</P>
    <P>As regards Cork, I am glad to be in a position to report a considerable improvement in the corporation's housing progress.  As Deputies are aware, less than ten per cent. of the estimated needs of that city had been met up to the 31st March, 1951, the number of completions being 332 houses.  By the 31st May, 1952, however, the total had risen to 644 and work was then in progress on 495 further houses.  The corporation have been advised on a series of matters which it is hoped should bring about a further increase in output in the present and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> A greater degree of competition amongst building firms for local authority housing work has been evident of late.  Nevertheless there is little tendency towards a reduction in over-all costs of local authority building generally.  Where definite evidence is available to show that houses can be constructed by the direct labour system at a cost which will compare favourably with tender prices, approval to the carrying out of schemes by this method is being given.</P>
    <P>Every other possible effort is being made to keep costs down without impairing the standards of design and construction.  In several instances before sanction was accorded to expenditure at an apparently excessive rate the local authorities in question were required to institute further critical examination of the factors giving rise to high costs, for example, sizes of rooms, number of rooms in various batches of houses with reference to the size of families requiring to be housed, excessive cost of development, fencing and so on.</P>
    <P>The past year has been satisfactory as regard progress in private enterprise housing.  6,087 new house grants were allocated during the financial year compared with 5,671 in the previous year.  This was the highest number of new house grants allocated in any one year since the introduction of this system of assisting private enterprise.  3,303 reconstruction grant allocations were made in the same period as compared with 2,788 in the preceding period.</P>
    <P>Various other housing matters have come up for special consideration in connection with the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1952.  The debates on that Bill included discussions on the amount of the State aid towards private house building and reconstruction, the level of rural reconstruction grants, the differentiation between the grants for serviced and non-serviced houses, the making of supplementary housing grants by local authorities under Section 7 of the Act of 1950, and the question of the maximum advance which may be made in respect of loans for the acquisition of small dwellings. The Bill has also clarified public policy <Col N="345" /> on certain problems of overcrowding, slum clearance and the repair of small dwellings.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head I (1), a sum of £925,000 is being provided in respect of contributions towards housing loan charges of local authorities, an increase of £26,000 on the 1951-52 provision. This is the amount required to meet the statutory contributions towards loan charges in respect of housing, together with a non-statutory contribution towards charges on certain loans from the Local Loans Fund. During the year 1951-52, housing authorities were notified of a change in the financial arrangements to replace the capital grants formerly made available from the Transition Development Fund.  Regulations were made on the 26th October, 1951, increasing the capital cost limits applicable for recoupment in respect of annual loan charges.  The effect of the regulations will become more evident in subsequent Estimates, according as the schemes to which the new regulations will apply are completed.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I (6) in respect of the special contribution towards the cost of houses reserved for newly-weds has been reduced from £60,000 to £30,000.  This represents payments to be made on account within the year and is not related strictly to the number of houses which may be provided within a year.  Nearly 500 houses have been or are being provided to date, the majority of them in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Since approval in March, 1951, to the fixing of a terminable annuity of 50 per cent. of the rent as a basis for purchase schemes for labourers' cottages, schemes on the new terms have been received in respect of 2,200 cottages. These are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible in the Department and, subject to any questions arising on routine examination of the details, the proposals will be approved.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act of 1950 empowered housing authorities to acquire lands and provide houses for sale or letting to persons irrespective of whether they are or are not members of the classes statutorily described as working <Col N="346" /> classes and agricultural labourers.  The grants payable by the State are based on the new house grants payable to private persons and the provision for them in the Estimates is included in sub-head I (3).  A number of houses have been provided under these powers, principally in Dublin County Borough where over 200 houses have been built for sale on a tenant purchase basis.</P>
    <P>Road Fund income in 1951-52 amounted to £3,261,000 as compared with £2,814,000 in the previous year. Outstanding liabilities at the 31st March amounted to £1,830,000.  Road Fund income for 1952-53 is estimated at £3,500,000.  The Minister for Finance agreed that the Exchequer contribution of £300,000 which had been taken from the Road Fund annually since 1947 would not be sought in respect of the year 1952-53.  As a result it has been possible to increase the Road Fund grants for the year by £700,000. I allocated this additional amount so as to bring the main road improvement grant up to a total of £1,100,000 and the county road improvement grant up to £1,400,000.  The main road upkeep grant remains at 40 per cent. of each council's expenditure on main road upkeep and will probably amount in the year to about £700,000.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increase in the allocations is substantially to restore expenditure on main road improvement to the figure obtaining prior to the adjustment of Road Fund grants in 1949-50 and at the same time not only to maintain the county road improvement grant then introduced but to increase it up to a sum of £1,400,000.</P>
    <P>The main roads of the country represent an important national asset but they can easily become a wasting asset unless they are properly maintained. County roads were not built to take motor vehicles but they are now being used by these vehicles to an ever-increasing degree both for through traffic between towns and also by the rural population both for travelling and for haulage and agricultural work. In these circumstances, without committing myself definitely in advance, I should like to say that, if the Road Fund income continues to increase the <Col N="347" /> county road improvement grant would appear entitled to rank for a further increase in future years.  Meanwhile, some county councils have displayed a commendable initiative in drawing up programmes to supplement by way of loan the works which can be carried out with the aid of the Road Fund allocations and local expenditure from rates.  Any such proposals that are submitted to me will be favourably considered.  In the absence of a special effort of this nature it will be evident that, no matter how favourable the grant position may become, it would take a very long period to bring up to the requisite conditions of sound foundations and dust-free surfaces the total mileage of roads in need of such reconstruction while at the same time maintaining in a proper condition the roads that have already been thus treated.</P>
    <P>The road programme, therefore, represents a very big problem and the funds available, although increased to the extent I have indicated, are still limited in relation to the magnitude of that problem.  Furthermore, the increased cost of labour and material involves much less return than was obtained for the same amount of money in the past.  I have, therefore, advised county councils that it is essential to get the maximum results from the money being spent and that county road improvement works should be carefully planned in order of priority for execution over a five-years' period with the aid of the grants and loans to be made available.</P>
    <P>Particular attention was drawn to the need for providing in the plans for programmes in an ordered sequence which would link up towns and villages with each other and with the main road system, thus leading to a system of spinal roads; also the linking up of important centres of food and fuel production with the towns and the main roads; and finally the carrying out of works calculated to encourage tourism.  Planned five-year programmes are in course of preparation by the county engineers, and in some cases have already been submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>The ever-growing volume of metropolitan <Col N="348" /> traffic is emphasising the limitations of the Dublin road and bridge systems.  Within those limitations the Garda Síochána institute such controls of traffic and parking as are best calculated to secure ordered conditions.  Some of their more recent experiments have proved very successful. A complete solution of the problem is not, however, possible save by the carrying out of major engineering works, and any project of this character presents enormous technical and financial difficulties.  The engineering works under active consideration in recent times include the proposed construction of a new bridge or bridges across the Liffey, and the provision of new roads in the vicinity of the Custom House and Butt Bridge.  The question of new bridges is to be considered by a special committee of the corporation prior to its further consideration by a joint committee of the corporation and the Port and Docks Board.  With regard to roads, agreement was reached last November between the corporation and the Port and Docks Board for making available by the board of the land necessary to provide a roadway east of the Custom House to link Amiens Street with Custom House Quay and a short spur linking Amiens Street with Beresford Place around the new building in Store Street.  Work on these roads is likely to be completed in the near future.  Other works in course of completion in Dublin include the removal of the bridge at Broadstone and the widening of the bridge over the Dodder on the road between Terenure and Rathfarnham.</P>
    <P>One of the major bridge works at present in progress is that being carried out at Gweebarra, County Donegal.  Progress on this work up to last autumn was very slow.  I called a conference of representatives of the contractor and the county council, together with the local Deputies, to see what steps could be taken to secure better progress with a view to early completion of the work.  A progress schedule was drawn up and provided for the completion of the bridge by next September.  The work has since proceeded more satisfactorily but I am not yet in a position to give a definite date for completion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The Beleek Bridge is being reconstructed by the Six County authorities by agreement with the Electricity Supply Board.  The share of the Donegal County Council in the cost is being met to a substantial extent by way of a grant from the Road Fund. A grant has also been allocated to Kildare County Council in connection with the reconstruction of the railway bridge at Naas.</P>
    <P>Two hundred and fourteen thousand tons of turf were produced and 46,000 tons were purchased by local authorities in the 1951 season.  These quantities represented about one and a half year's supply of requirements for institutions, offices and machinery.  Attention was officially invited to the desirability of proceeding with a turf production programme in the present season, but owing to an improvement in the coal and general fuel position, the county councils have not felt disposed to engage in the direct production of turf this year to the same extent as in 1951.</P>
    <P>Grants are available for necessary bog development works on a 100 per cent. basis.  A sum of £40,000 is provided in the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes for this purpose. I have also recommended local authorities when considering their programmes of works for the present year under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to give priority to bog development works which may be found permissible under the Act to assist their turf production or in appropriate cases to assist the private production of turf.</P>
    <P>The provision made for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for 1952-53 is £650,000 and local authorities have been informed that the grants likely to be available will be approximately half of their allocation for 1951-52. In the actual allocation for each county regard will be had to the increase in the Road Fund grants for that particular county, the extent of turf production proposed, and the demand for labour occasioned by the general level of other public works activity in the county as well as the extent to which agricultural production is being intensified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> There was a general increase in the total employment afforded on road schemes, on works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and on turf production during the first portion of the last financial year, but in some areas considerable decreases in employment occurred later in the year. It is, of course, understandable that in the case of turf production schemes, the employment should fall off from about the end of Autumn, but it has been frequently emphasised to county councils that those portions of their public works programmes which can be arranged so as not to clash with peak periods of agricultural and other seasonal employment should be timed accordingly.</P>
    <P>It does appear as if this advice is not followed by some local authorities, with a consequential abrupt decline in employment in their areas at particular periods, generally towards the close of the financial year, when, owing to the intensive work previously undertaken, all the available funds have been spent. The rectification of this alternation of peak periods and seasonal depressions rests with the county councils and their officers.  It should be an easy matter to adjust, and advice to this effect has been given to county councils in this, as in previous years.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L of the Estimates provides a sum of £70,000, being portion of the balance of capital grants towards provision of sanitary services works unexpended on the winding up of the Transition Development Fund at 1st April, 1951.  A sum of £110,000, provided for this purpose in 1951-52, was expended in full and a sum of £52,000 will remain to be disbursed after 31st March next.  In replacement of the capital grant system, the loan charges of local authorities in respect of sanitary services works will be proportionately recouped and provision is made in sub-head M for the liability under this head for the current year.</P>
    <P>The volume of activity in the provision and improvement of water and sewerage services continues to expand. At the beginning of the present financial year, schemes were in progress at an estimated cost of £1,800,000 as compared with an estimated expenditure of £1,556,000 current at the <Col N="351" /> corresponding date in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Last February, approval issued to the carrying out by Dublin Corporation by way of direct labour of the section of the Howth outfall sewerage scheme which involves the laying of the sewer pipes from Finglas to Raheny.  The technical aspects of the remainder of the scheme which is based on an outfall to the east of Howth Head are still under consideration by the Dublin Corporation technical staff in consultation with my engineering advisers, but it is the technical opinion that when the pipe laying work is completed as far as Raheny, some of the areas to be served by it, which are scheduled for early housing development, can be drained by temporary methods pending the completion of the remaining section of the outfall scheme.</P>
    <P>The usual adjudication on town planning appeals pursuant to the operation of interim control presented no unusual feature during the year.  Proposals to extend the borough boundaries of the Cities of Dublin and Cork are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>The average county rates for this year are 27/11 in the £.  Last year, the figure was 25/1.  The increases are ascribable to a number of factors, principally the increased cost of labour, materials and commodities.  The main increases have occurred in the roads, public assistance and health services. There have also been increases in the provision for mental hospitals, housing and sanitary services.  The rate collection for 1951-52 has been satisfactory. 97.4 per cent. of the total county council warrants was collected at 31st March, 1952.</P>
    <P>The level of State grants, without which the rates would be much higher, continues to rise.  For a number of years past, the total of these grants has exceeded the amount of the rate collected.  Last year local authorities received approximately £16,500,000 from State sources, while their rates revenue was approximately £13,000,000. The agricultural grant increases automatically with increases in the rates and reached a total of £4,226,851 for the year 1951-52.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Some observations were made following the general election last year on the compilation of the register of electors.  In the instructions issued to registration officers last August special emphasis was laid on the necessity for distributing forms to every householder in connection with the preparation of the register which is now in force. Special publicity was given to the matter through the medium of the Press and radio, and when the electors' lists were published in November further special statements were issued to make the people fully aware of the manner in which and the time within which the claims to rectify any errors or omissions could be made.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants seeking appointments as official contractors under the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, for the year 1952-53 has shown no marked reduction as compared with the previous year. There has, however, been some evidence of uncertainty felt by traders as regards the availibility of supplies.</P>
    <P>Home manufacturers generally have given satisfactory service and the competition for contracts is now very keen. In particular, tenders submitted by provincial manufacturers and traders indicated a growing tendency to participated in the combined purchasing system.  Increased prices were specially noticeable in the quotations for commodities, such as those manufactured from steel, zinc, copper and similar materials, while there was a substantial reduction in the prices of cloth required for various purposes.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report substantial progress in the difficult work of preparing for the consolidation of local government law.  The manuscript of the textbook on the law is with the printers.  In view of the difficulties attending all kinds of printing work, the most optimistic estimate of the date of its publication would be early in 1953.  Detailed proposals for the revision and codification of the law relating to sanitary services have been completed and are being considered by a departmental committee, while the corresponding work relating to the general local government law is in process of completion.  The next stage <Col N="353" /> will be to refer these preliminary surveys and proposals to the draftsman. Meanwhile, it will be possible to commence similar preliminary research work for the revision and consolidation of the law relating to housing and steps to this end have been taken.  The codification of the electoral law may present greater difficulty and necessitate the introduction, in the first instance, of legislation involving policy.  This is largely due to the antiquated nature of some of the statute law on the subject of franchise. Nevertheless, here, too, I can report a substantial degree of progress which has already been achieved in the formulation of proposals leading towards the amendment of the statute law and the codification of the Acts. All I have to say now is that I hope you will not keep me too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The time we will keep the Minister might perhaps be in inverse ratio to the speed at which he read his speech.  It was extremely difficult at times to follow the figures.  I am moving the reference back of this Estimate on a variety of grounds, but, before discussing any of the matters which may be taken to be contentious from the strictly political point of view, I want to discuss the housing position. Though, obviously, we will have different views on housing on different sides of this House, we nevertheless always try to ensure that whatever discussions we have on housing are carried on on a co-operative basis and on a basis of trying to make sure that the best this House can produce will be available for whatever Government is in power and whatever local authorities are in existence in regard to a solution of the housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I could understand the Minister's approach to housing, his line was that everything is perfectly all right in the matter of housing programmes and their fulfilment.  I am afraid I find myself somewhat unable to understand that view of the Minister's. If one compares the position in the first six months of this year with the position in the first six months of <Col N="354" /> last year that comparison will undoubtedly give us considerable cause for uneasiness.  I admit at once that a comparison of only six months, 12 months or even longer may not be exact and true.  The number of houses completed by local authorities in 1950-51 was, as the Minister said, 7,887, while this year there were 7,100 odd, a reduction of some 700 houses.</P>
    <P>What causes far more concern, however, is a comparison involving the actual progress of the housing drive as distinct from the number of completed houses.  Taking the figures given in response to questions in this House for all local authorities for January, February and March this year and in 1951, we find that in 1951 the number of houses in progress was about 10,000 and in this year in January about 800 houses less, in February about 600 houses less and in March about 700 houses less.  Taking the number of houses for which tenders have been invited or accepted we find the same diminution.  In January the figure was down by 800 houses, in February by 1,000 houses and in March by 300 houses.  Taking the number of houses for which site development work was in progress&mdash;and the results of the work in progress in the first quarter of this year will be seen in 1952-53&mdash; we find that in January the number was down by 800 houses, in February by 750 houses and in March by 470 houses.</P>
    <P>The drop both in the number of houses for which tenders had been accepted and in the number for which site development work was in progress in comparison with a similar time in 1951 was less in March.  I have no way of telling what the April figures were.  Perhaps the peak of the adverse balance with regard to local authority housing may have been reached in February and perhaps we improved that balance from March onwards.  It may be that February was the bottom of a curve which was starting to rise again.  I hope that is so but it is a fact that the number of houses in progress at the beginning of the calendar year 1950 and in the first half of 1951 was over the five figure mark and since then under it.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the target <Col N="355" /> at which local authorities were setting their cap was about 7,000 houses. That of course will be more or less the same as the past year but it is a substantial drop on the 1950-51 figure.  I failed to gather, however, from the Minister why he thought that that target was now satisfactory.  Is it because he believes that the needs of persons throughout the country for whom local authorities build houses have been satisfied?  Is it because he believes that local authorities have in general built sufficient houses to catch up on the emergency period when supplies were not available and that all they need now consider is keeping up with annual wastage?  If that is his view I do not think that most Deputies would agree with him.  I think that they would feel that there is a very substantial leeway and that the target of 7,800 houses reached by Deputy Keyes in his year of office is one which we should try to reach in the future as well.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, as the Minister indicated, a special problem in Dublin. He also indicated that there is a special problem in Cork, but I have no doubt that some Cork Deputy will deal with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to touch on the Dublin position in a general way because Deputy Belton will from our Party deal with it in a much more specific way at a later stage of the debate.  If, however, we consider houses in progress in the City of Dublin again we find that in the first quarter of this year the position was very much worse than in the first quarter of last year.  As I understood the Minister's outlook as expressed in the speech he has just made, he thinks that the position in Dublin Corporation is quite satisfactory; I have heard other Deputies&mdash;and not <Col N="356" /> from this side of the House&mdash;express the view that it is not.  As far as one could gather, however, the Minister is quite happy.</P>
      <P>In January, 1952, there were 600 fewer houses in progress under the auspices of Dublin Corporation than in January, 1951; 500 fewer in February; 350 fewer in March and 300 fewer in April.  Again it may be that the bottom of the curve was reached in the same month in Dublin as among local authorities in general.  It may equally be that the local authorities in general are so much influenced by Dublin Corporation that the tendency which the Dublin Corporation figures have shown in the first three months of this year is such as to throw the others out of perspective.  It is a fact, for example, that in January this year the decrease in the number of houses for which site development work is in progress in comparison with last year is exactly equivalent to the decrease in the Dublin Corporation figures.</P>
      <P>In other months the decrease is larger and it is, therefore, possible to arrive at the conclusion that the country, excluding Dublin, is building through its local authorities at the same rate and that it is only in Dublin the figures are down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against that I put the fact that the Minister has said that he is entirely satisfied with an over-all target which is some 800 houses fewer than the target reached in 1950-51 and a target slightly lower than that reached last year.  I take it from the fact that the Minister has made no reference to the matter that, so far as local authorities, other than the corporations which have no access to the Local Loans Fund, are concerned, these other housing authorities will be able to get their advances from the Local Loans Fund as always.  Everybody however must be somewhat perturbed by the reference which appeared in the papers the other day to the fact that the Dublin Corporation will not be able to get the finances they require to complete their housing programme for the immediate future as a result of their negotiations with the Standing Committee of the Banks.  This matter was, of course, raised in passing by Deputy <Col N="357" /> Norton on the Fifth Stage of the Housing Bill.  The point I want to make is that I was somewhat disturbed, as were others, by the attitude of mind adopted by the Minister on that occasion.  The Minister seemed to take the view, when he was speaking in this House on 3rd of this month as reported at cols. 171-2, that it was none of his responsibility at all to deal with this difficulty in which the Dublin Corporation found itself.  I do not think that that is anything like a correct attitude for the Minister to take up.</P>

      <P>If the Minister did not intend to imply that by what he said, I am quite prepared to accept that such was not his intention, but when he was speaking here on that occasion he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the business of the corporation when looking to the future to discover the places from which and the conditions under which money may be provided for the future.  It is the business of those&mdash;it is certainly not my business&mdash;responsible for the running of the banks to look at things from their point of view, having regard, of course, at the same time, to other interests.  All this is quite understandable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to talk about not bidding the devil good morrow until you meet him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to go on too.  That was the Minister's view-point&mdash;that the Government had not in the past failed to do its part, that there was no need to be alarmed, that, as the old saying has it, there was no need to shake hands with the devil until we meet him, and that the Dublin Corporation was in a position to carry on for some months.  The point I want to put to the Minister specifically is that it is not the Minister's business to let things slide until the position has become so critical that there are bound to be grave difficulties. The only way of dealing with <Col N="358" /> a transaction of that sort and to ensure that the appropriate funds are there in the beginning, is to tackle the job in the beginning and not leave it until there is a crisis on top of the corporation. The Minister's almost <i>laissez faire</i> outlook is that there is no need to look at it now, and that it will sort itself out.</P>
      <P>When I read the statement made by the Banks Standing Committee, I thought how very like it was to another statement referred to in the Dublin Housing Inquiry Report of 1939-43.  At page 168 there is a reference to the negotiations which had taken place between the banks and the Dublin Corporation in previous years and in paragraph 494 it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Negotiations took place with the Banks Standing Committee on the matter of raising £2,000,000 by issue of stock, but in January, 1939, it was intimated to the corporation that the banks could not underwrite a public issue.  The reasons given were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The uneconomic character of the housing programme, aggravated by the high level of building costs. and</P>
      <P>(2)  The magnitude of the sums required for the corporation's five-year programme of public works.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At a later stage there was an issue, but it did seem to me that the outlook, as presented in the statement we read the other day, was very similar to the outlook that was apparently operative in 1939 and which is referred to in the Report of that Dublin Housing Board of which, I think, Mr. Colivet, was the chairman.</P>
      <P>Those of us who look back, not merely on that year but on earlier years and see references to high housing costs, when we compare the housing costs of these years with housing costs to-day, must be permitted a smile.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>1939, pre-war.  The fact is that, not merely as regards housing but as regards everything else, costs are bound to tend to rise because the value of money is decreasing <Col N="359" /> year by year all over the world. The more the value of money decreases, the less we shall be able to get for it and the more it is going to cost to build houses.  It is perfectly obvious, therefore, that the more houses that are built at any one time, the greater saving there will be for those who have to go into these houses and pay rents for them.  I think if for nothing else, other than the psychological effect, it would have been desirable on the Fifth Stage of the Housing Bill when the matter was raised if the Minister had made it clear that, so far as the Government is concerned, the provision of finance for housing in Dublin and elsewhere will be forthcoming, and that, so far as the provision of houses is concerned, anything that can be done will be done to get over those difficulties.  It is, undoubtedly, a fact that a substantial amount of uneasiness has been created as a result of the statement that was made, and of the fact that those who were listening to the Minister the other day did not get the impression that he was going to move at the speed which they considered he should move in dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>So far as I could understand the Minister's statement, when dealing with the provision of houses by private people&mdash;apart from local authority housing&mdash;whether by speculative builders or people building for themselves, it was that last year more grants were allocated than before, and that, therefore, he anticipated there would be a continuance of private building this year on the same lines as previously.  The provision made in the Estimate is, I think, identically the same as that made last year.  If that is so, then I do not understand how the situation arises whereby there are now many more skilled operatives in the building trade in search of employment than was the case 12 months ago. If there is the same volume of private building, I do not understand how it is that there is far more competition now when a local authority puts up a house or a batch of houses for tender than there was some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> The position is, I think, undoubtedly that local authorities, now advertising for tenders, are getting nearly twice as many replies and estimates put in as they were receiving previously.  That would seem to indicate that building contractors are now finding it more difficult to sell houses.  If, as the Minister says, the position in regard to local authority housing and to private housing is entirely satisfactory, that there is no falling off and that the output is going to remain the same, I cannot understand how it is that those skilled operatives who, quite a short time ago, were so hard to get for any housing scheme, are at present finding a difficulty in obtaining employment. The position in and around Dublin, as far as I can understand it, is that speculative building, as such, has almost come to a close&mdash;that it is folding up.  I understand that speculative builders in and around Dublin are merely developing out existing schemes and are not going ahead with new schemes.  As far as I can analyse the matter, it is that operatives who were previously employed by speculative builders are not now in the position of being able to get new jobs from them and are looking for jobs elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Equally, I can only assume that it is due to the lack of speculative building that there are more contractors now tendering for local authority houses in or near the city.  The Minister has available to him the means of ascertaining the cause of the complaints that are being made&mdash;that there are more building operatives idle now than previously.  The House would, I am sure&mdash;I certainly would&mdash;be grateful if we could have from him some indication as to the comparative numbers now employed in building and previously.</P>
    <P>As I have referred to the question of building by private persons, I should like to take this opportunity of again mentioning a very old chestnut in this House, that is the delay there is in the payment of housing and reconstruction grants.  I came across a case the other day where one of the reconstruction grant officers in the Minister's Department got a file from a county council to inspect a certain house.  He goes out and finds there is nobody in the <Col N="361" /> house.  The man is probably working in the fields and the woman may be away shopping.  He then sends the file back to the local authority saying: &ldquo;No one there when I called.&rdquo;  That has happened not once but on innumerable occasions during the last couple of months.  Instead of taking a course so obvious as even not to require mention, when he missed the applicant on the first occasion, that is, of writing to the applicant and saying: &ldquo;I have been around to see you on such and such a date and will call again on such a date,&rdquo; he sends the file back to the local authority saying that there was nobody at home when he called.  If that practice is in existence, as I know it is&mdash;the Minister can verify the fact that it is in existence&mdash;in the case of one particular appointed officer dealing with houses in Leinster, and, further, if it is in existence generally throughout the country, then it is no wonder that we hear so frequently of the delays there are in regard to the payment of grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister when dealing with the question of housing schemes referred, incidentally, I think, to the question of cost.  That, of course, is always a matter of great anxiety to local authorities.  I have tried, as far as I could, to unravel the various funds that are set forth at different places in the Estimate in respect to these grants.  I appreciate, of course, that the reduction from £2,500,000 to £800,000 under sub-head I (7) is, of course, only an apparent reduction, and arises out of a change in system by virtue of which part of the grant is now made up by way of a subsidy on the loan charge rather than by way of subsidy on the capital cost.  I should like the Minister, when concluding, to answer this question categorically.  Is the provision that is being made in these 1952-53 houses for subsidy to local authorities exactly the same as the provision that was made last year in regard to the number of houses, cost, etc.?  Is the apparent difference purely one that has arisen by reason of the change in system, and is there no difference whatever in the real subsidy that is being made available? I refer to sub-head I (7).  I do not know whether the married couples <Col N="362" /> subsidy under I (6) is now being dealt with on the same basis.  If not, it is unfortunate that the Minister is hitting Cupid such a heavy blow in cutting down by 50 per cent. the provision for married couples.  I want to be quite fair to the Minister.  It may be that it is not his hard heart that has caused it, but that this is merely a change also in the system and that the Minister is in fact under sub-head I (6) giving the same assistance to local authorities who are forwarding the case of Love's Young Dream, as was done in the comparative Estimate printed side by side with the current one.</P>
    <P>One of the reductions which will be considered by many Deputies on this side as being a very unfortunate reduction and an unfair reduction is that being made in the Local Authorities (Works) Act allocation.  The reduction, as the Minister indicated, is £570,000. Since that Act was introduced many schemes in many parts of the country have been dealt with under it and the value of the Act is apparent to anyone. Those grants had enabled local authorities, urban councils and county councils, but more especially county councils, to remove many long standing disabilities and to protect and safeguard public property, to act as the outfall for land drainage under the land rehabilitation project and so on.</P>
    <P>The effect of private employment of that kind was not merely to benefit those immediately assisted but the community as a whole in the district. This time last year the Minister told us, when he was discussing the Estimate, that there were schemes to the value of £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 submitted to his Department.  Therefore, the reduction this year cannot be due to any dearth of schemes.  I am sure that during the course of the year even more schemes were added to that last by the various local authorities.  It is a matter of great regret that in the Estimate which the Minister has introduced the provision being made this year is approximately only half that made last year.  It would not be unfair to say that much of the work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was work that will materially add <Col N="363" /> to the national wealth and was a good substitute for the well intentioned but old-fashioned and aimless employment schemes, which were bound because of that very aimlessness to fail to utilise national resources of labour and land in a manner which would be of a long-term value to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the actual work that was done under these Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes, the employment that was given by them in rural areas was very valuable. Though I am not urging it from the employment point of view alone, in the first three months of 1951 I found that the average number employed on Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes was about 9,000.  The numbers that will be employed this year can be gauged from the fact that the amount that was spent in the four months December to March of that year exceeds the provision that is to be made in the whole 12 months of this year.  That reduction will inevitably mean an increase in unemployment in rural areas, particularly during the winter months.  The increase in the road grants, to which I will refer in a moment, cannot possibly compensate for the decrease in employment on this type of drainage work.  The Minister said 12 months ago that the schemes were there in his Department.  Certainly I know that in Kildare the schemes were not merely there, but had been sanctioned by the Department's inspectors.  However, the appropriate funds are not being made available to have those schemes carried out during the current year.  In the winter, there will be considerably more unemployment in the rural areas.  In respect of such funds as are made available, may I make it clear that the viewpoint outlined by the Minister &mdash;that so far as possible drainage work of that sort should not be undertaken when it would clash with other agricultural work or farmwork&mdash;is a wise precept.  There is, however, the national difficulty, due to our climatic conditions, that a lot of that type of drainage work can be done only when the rivers are very low, and that you cannot do it at certain times in the <Col N="364" /> winter when the volume of water is too high.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the increase in the grant being made available from the Road Fund this year.  As I understood the figures he gave us, they were that there was an increase of £600,000 last year in the Road Fund income, and it was estimated it would be up by another £300,000 this year, thereby providing that £700,000 was going to be paid out of a total increase of £900,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in allocating the grant from the Road Fund, has allocated the increase entirely to the main roads. Under the previous position, the main roads and county roads drew about one half each of the amount available from the Road Fund, but that balance is now being disturbed altogether.  As far as I can make out the figure, the grant this year is going to be £1,900,000 for main roads improvement and maintenance and £1,400,000 for county roads, thereby increasing the balance very much in favour of main roads, compared to the approximate parity in the grant for 1951-52.  A very large number of miles of county roads are entirely unsuitable for the motor traffic that has to travel over them.  An estimate has been made that to bring the county roads up to the standards now necessary for motor traffic with the soft pneumatic tyre and the drag that pneumatic tyre gives on a road surface, costs approximately £2,000 a mile.  With 40,000 miles of county roads, the magnitude of the task and of the problem is easy for anyone to appreciate.  No matter how he may see the difficulties that arise in respect of trunk or main roads, I suggest to the Minister that there is another difficulty in regard to county roads and that it would be fairer for him to keep the balance more evenly divided between the two.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the changing of the rating of roads.  There are at present only the main road and the county road.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered dividing into two separate categories main roads and trunk roads which serve the country as a whole.  It has long been a complaint <Col N="365" /> by certain county councils&mdash;and, perhaps, by ours in Kildare in particular&mdash; that the rating by which all main roads are classified together imposes undue hardship on those councils which have to bear a larger proportion of trunk traffic.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty that people who are travelling through the country find a very different standard of trunk road in the different counties. Some of the councils seem to be averse from improvements in their methods.  I know one local authority which deals with one of its trunk roads in a way that one would imagine, these days, one would read of only in something like a Heath Robinson journal. There is no possibility of coping with our road problem unless we avail of the most up-to-date machinery for that purpose.  We cannot possibly expect to deal with 1952 traffic by means of 1900 methods of road-making. There is no possibility of ensuring that those employed on the roads throughout the country achieve a decent standard unless they are able to achieve that standard by making all the use that is possible of the advances of science.  To see, these days, people on a main trunk road sweeping hedge cuttings with a bit of an ash plant that they pulled out of the hedge seems to me an anachronism and is not likely to indicate any efficiency anywhere.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the traffic problem in Dublin City.  Without in any way commenting, much less commenting adversely, on the job done by the Gardaí on point duty&mdash;which, in any event, would not be proper on this Estimate&mdash;I think it would not be unfair to describe the traffic in Dublin as chaotic at times.  The difficulty is that you have either to provide new traffic ways or to deflect traffic from the city.  As the traffic in Dublin is growing, and as all the figures show that it will continue to grow, it will be much more chaotic within quite a measurable number of years.  The job of providing new traffic arteries&mdash; whether it means new bridges across the river or new traffic arteries in the centre of the city&mdash;is inevitably very slow and needs a great deal of consideration <Col N="366" /> before any type of a solution can be found.  Obviously, when a solution is found it will be an extraordinarily expensive process.  So far as possible, it would be better to deflect traffic from the city to roads running around the perimeter of the city.</P>
    <P>The roads near Dublin are overcrowded to some extent.  Some time ago there was an outcry in respect to the Bray road and it was a wise outcry. I think, however, that there is no doubt that of all the roads leading out from Dublin the worst road is not the Bray road but the road to the South.  It carries very much more permanent heavy traffic and very much more freight than the Bray road.  It has not as high a peak load as the Bray-Stillorgan road has in the morning between 9 and 10 and in the afternoon between 5 and 6, but there is entirely a very much higher and heavier daily load on the road to the South than on a road that is purely a peak road. I am quite sure that the Minister must have at his disposal some figures which will enable him to judge the overall loading on those roads.  I suppose I am somewhat prejudiced in thinking that the road to the South is the heaviest. I presume that Deputy Dunne will take the view that the Drogheda road is even more congested.  An instrument has been installed just inside the Kildare boundary to gauge the number of cars and the weight of those cars that travel across it hour by hour.  I am sure other such machines are available to the Minister for other similar roads.  If he would make available to the House a census, so to speak, of the traffic using those roads then we should be in a better position to assess the individual merits of any one road as against another.  Bear in mind the fact that, to a large extent, the road to the South brings in the gravel and the sand for the building of Dublin.</P>

      <P>That road seems to me to merit first consideration, if any consideration is to be given to problems of that sort.  I was always sufficiently innocent to believe that the traffic light was an invention of comparatively modern times.  It just <Col N="367" /> so happened that, the other day, I came across something that showed that we are not necessarily progressing as much as we think we are.</P>
      <P>I came across a cutting from a newspaper published on the 8th December, 1868.  This cutting contains a description of what was, in fact, a traffic light:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the middle of the road, between Bridge Street and Great George Street, Westminster, Messrs. Saxby and Farmer, the well-known railway signalling engineers, have erected a column 20 feet high; with a spacious gas-lamp near the top, the design of which is the application of the semaphore principle to the public streets at points where foot passengers have hitherto depended for their protection on the arm and gesticulations of a policeman&mdash;often a very inadequate defence against accident.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A lot of water has gone under the sea since then but I wonder whether we have made the progress in regard to the direction of traffic that we would like.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, a speed limit was put into operation in Bray.  It was understood at the time by other local authorities that the Department would prefer to await the results of the working of that speed limit before they considered whether the speed limits were desirable for their areas.  Would the Minister tell us whether he has any information as to the success or failure in Bray of the safety device of a speed limit?  There has been a very different experience, I understand, in other countries.  In some countries it has proved a success and in others it has tended to mean that people drive at whatever the speed limit is regardless of the type of dangerous situation that may confront them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not permissible to discuss, on an Estimate, matters that require amending legislation, I think it is sometimes usual for a Minister, when he is introducing legislation, to indicate, in a very general way, whether he has legislation in mind or not.  I would like to know whether the Minister is <Col N="368" /> contemplating any amending legislation for the coming year in respect of the County Management Acts or proposes to take no steps, but leave them exactly as they are?</P>
    <P>The administration of these Acts varies from county to county.  It is, to some extent, a matter for the individual county whether there is the same degree of dissatisfaction in one county as there is in another.  In those counties in which there is not violent dissatisfaction at the moment I think it is true to say that the reason there is no dissatisfaction is that the manager steps completely outside the requirements of the Acts and brings to the elected members of the council infinitely more information and infinitely more responsibility for decision and asks the elected members to give their opinion on matters upon which he would be entitled, under the strict title of the law, to decide on his own. It is a very good thing that is done in some counties, and if the Minister could ensure that it would be done in them all there would not be anything like the same amount of difficulty and criticism as there is at the present. The Act was framed in a far too rigid manner.  In those cases where the scope of the Act has been gone quite outside of there has not been the same amount of criticism.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I put down a question in the House about the ripping up of a road in Dublin alongside the canal.  I was told I would get a letter from the Minister in due course as to the reasons for the apparent grave waste of public money in breaking up a job that had only quite recently been completed.  I got the letter and I got information as to why it was deemed to be necessary.  Apparently, part of the road in question was laid in concrete in December, 1950, a concrete road to be serviceable for very many years to come.  It was only on the 1950 stretch there was not as much damage done as on the others.  But even a road that is laid in concrete in 1946 should be serviceable for very, very many years.</P>
    <P>In the letter, a copy of which was forwarded to me by the Minister's Department to whom it was sent by <Col N="369" /> the corporation, the suggestion appears to be implicit that because the damage in question to the roadway was being paid for by the Electricity Supply Board it was all right.  There must be, and the Minister should make certain that there is, full and adequate co-operation between the various public utility services and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is an utter waste of money to see &mdash;as all of us see regularly&mdash;a new road or street being put down and within a very short time being ripped up again either for a water main, a new sewerage scheme, electricity cables or for gas pipes.  That type of waste of public money shows a lack of co-ordination and a lack of planning in the authority concerned.  It is a lack of planning that the Minister as the overriding supervisor should ensure does not occur.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to make certain&mdash;notwithstanding what was said in this particular instance, that the reason for it was the laying of a higher load tension than had been laid previously&mdash;that before a road or street is permanently laid in concrete every utility service that will be required to go under that road or street will be laid in a proper way.  Where that is not done it shows clearly that somebody is at fault.  I would suggest that it is the Minister's duty, as the supervisor of the local authorities, to ensure that such faults do not occur.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of road works, I would like to read to the Minister correspondence that was apparently sent out in a constituency where a vote was recorded recently:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Comhairle Conndae Mhuigheo. Notice to gangers&mdash;North Mayo Constituency: All gangers in the North Mayo constituency are hereby notified that all work will be suspended on Thursday, 26th June, to enable gangers and workmen to record their votes.  This is on the distinct understanding that men who are not working on that day will not be paid.</P>
    <P>Engine drivers, helpers and gangers who are in the constituency but who have no vote in the constituency will be paid provided they work on <Col N="370" /> that day in the repair and adjustment of machinery and in any other urgent and useful work on which they can find employment for the day.</P>
    <P>Signed Thos. P. Flanagan, County Engineer, 23rd June, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it is desirable that work should not be carried out on any day on which there is an election, then it is the duty of the Government, which feels that, to declare that that day should be a public holiday.  It is not desirable that one local authority should take the view that apparently was taken in Mayo of telling their men that they were not to work, and that institutions such as Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board should tell their employees that they were to work. There should be a proper policy adopted in regard to these matters.  If there is to be a cessation of work, it should be done in a proper open way by having a national holiday.  It should not be done in a manner which would lead one to the interpretation that the local authority is being utilised for a purpose other than that for which it is intended.</P>
    <P>The sanitary service Estimate in this general Estimate put before us by the Minister has again been amended.  I was not able to catch the figures read by the Minister, so I will have to wait until the report is published.  However, I take it that sub-head M is the new method of providing that water and sewerage works will be paid for by means of an addition to the loan interest charges and that sub-head L, which shows a decrease of £40,000, is merely the winding-up of the old system by virtue of which this was done on the capital cost alone.</P>
    <P>With regard to water and sewerage services, I would like the Minister to tell us whether he sees any prospect of being able to make a grant available towards the provision of these amenities for local authority houses which were built before such services were in operation.  Houses were built in many areas without water or sewerage amenities which it would now be possible to provide.  However, the local authorities are afraid that the cost of these amenities would fall on them unaided <Col N="371" /> and would be beyond their capacity.  Grants are available for the provision of water and sewerage in new houses and, if such grants were given to local authorities to provide these facilities for existing houses it would meet an urgent need in many areas.</P>
    <P>Acute concern is being felt by many local authorities on the question of the repair of houses belonging to them.  In so far as I could hear, the Minister did not touch on this question in his statement. The rents that local authorities receive for these houses very often do not come within a mile of the cost of repairs.  The amount that has to be spent by every local authority on the repair of old houses is a problem that must be tackled at the root.  So far as can be seen, the only solution that offers itself is to ensure that there will be a much speedier vesting of cottages in the occupier.</P>
    <P>If an occupier owned a cottage, he would certainly do a small repair after his day's work.  However, when he is not the owner, he leaves such small repair undone, and gradually it becomes aggravated until, eventually, a repair squad from the local authority concerned has to come out and do the work.  The cost is then infinitely more than would be the case if the occupier tackled the job in its initial stages.  I hope the Minister will try to ensure that the benefits resulting from persons owning their own cottages under the cottage vesting system are brought home to the local authority.  Ownership would give the occupier an interest in his dwelling-house and an inherent right which would make him a far better tenant and, indeed, a far better citizen.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister indicated, I think, in answer to a question that there was a very large time-lag as regards the auditing of local authority accounts.  It seems ridiculous that in March, 1951&mdash;I have not got any later figures&mdash;there should be three cases in which accounts for the year 1947-48 had not been audited, that there should be 28 cases in which the accounts for the year 1948-49 had not been audited, and there should be 192 cases in which accounts for the year <Col N="372" /> 1949-50 had not been audited.  In all these cases the accounts had not been audited for a year after the close of the final accounting year.  That type of delay is unsatisfactory and would not take place, I suggest, if the auditors did not, in certain cases, concern themselves with matters that were entirely of a pettifogging character, and of no practical use to the Department, to the Minister, or to the local authority concerned.  I know of one particular case where six dozen bottles of stout were purchased by an institution during Christmas time.  The auditor raised a question and said he knew of an establishment where this stout could have been bought for a halfpenny cheaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there was a protracted minute written on that subject.  If that type of pettifogging takes up the time of auditors, no wonder local authority accounts are in arrears.  As Deputy Davern reminded me, much more than a halfpenny would be involved now.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I was not able to discover that, or I would have been able to take advantage of it.  What I did discover, however, was that the institution concerned is situated approximately 24 miles from Dublin and that the public-house where the stout was sold at a halfpenny per bottle cheaper than where it was bought was in the City of Dublin. Therefore, the cost of transport would make it dearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During recent months the Minister has issued directives dealing with fire brigades.  I wonder if he has yet made up his mind as to whether or not the Fire Brigades Act which was introduced <Col N="373" /> some years ago has been a success. It is very easy to say, I know, that the cost is not warranted, and to take the line that it is unnecessary. When there has been some holocaust, everybody will say: &ldquo;Why were not proper steps taken before?&rdquo; I am of the opinion that a voluntary fire brigade on a part-time basis, no matter how energetic the people concerned may be, is always bound to be a matter of grave difficulty when speedy attention to a fire is half the battle, and I am not at all certain that a better method would not be to deal with it by means of a whole-time regional brigade that would be able to cope with the situation by being on duty all the time.</P>
    <P>The Estimate the Minister has brought in for the coming year shows, as he says himself, an apparent decrease.  With the exception of the Local Authorities (Works) Act decrease, I am prepared to accept that the decreases are only apparent and that they merely indicate a change in the method of housing finance.  So far as the Local Authorities (Works) Act is concerned, however, I want to say I think the decrease of £570,000 is a tragedy which will mean that much useful and productive work that could be done this year will not be done, that much useful and productive work that has been planned and the details of which have already been furnished to the Minister's Department, as he admitted, 12 months ago, must now wait.  It is a decrease that is going to mean, notwithstanding the increase in the road grants, very substantial loss in the rural areas during the coming year.  For that reason I move that the Estimate be referred back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister reading his statement, I have not found it easy to get a picture of the exact position in regard to housing. Like Deputy Sweetman, I got the impression that the Minister indicated a certain amount of complacency and satisfaction with the figures and percentages for the various types of houses and categories with which he was dealing.  An examination of the position would hardly lead one to believe that that complacency was <Col N="374" /> justified if one is interested in seeing that the housing drive should continue at the momentum at which it was proceeding up to the time the Minister took over.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has quoted figures indicating a drop in the number of houses built in the early months of this year as compared with last year.  That would be a reliable picture of the earlier months of this year as compared with the same period last year, but, apart from the figures shown for housing from one month to another, I am concerned with the undoubted evidence of unemployment among building operatives.  One would wonder how you would maintain a satisfactory rate of house building if there is such evidence of unemployment among the building operatives themselves.  In Dublin City, in Limerick City and in other cities throughout the country there has unquestionably been a big drop in the employment of building operatives particularly since last January.  I have not the exact figures, but I quoted them in the House previously.  There were 150 carpenters idle in the City of Limerick, and that figure has not altered appreciably one way or the other since.  At that time there were 500 of 600 carpenters idle in Dublin, and such evidence of unemployment among timber workers must mean a corresponding number of unemployed among plasterers, or mortar men, as we call them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you contrast that with the picture in 1950, a vast difference can be seen. It was then utterly impossible to get unemployed building operatives in any part of the country.  In 1950 in the City of Dublin or in the remote rural areas there was work for all types of workmen&mdash;carpenters, masons, plasterers and slaters.  I had very serious difficulties in trying to secure men to work in various parts of the country. There is no such difficulty now.  I have been quite recently down in the province of Munster, and there are men all over the counties looking for work and who cannot get it.  The various county councils have been trying to get these workmen on to the job of repairing cottages, but they cannot absorb the men going around in teams <Col N="375" /> of unemployed&mdash;carpenters, plasterers and masons.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult in view of that serious situation to reconcile the complacency of the Minister or the Department when they say they are maintaining the tempo that was reached in 1950.  When speaking on the Minister's Estimate this time last year I welcomed it and wished the Minister God speed.  When speaking on that occasion, I hoped that he would in 1951 surpass all that had been done in 1950.  That has not been realised.  Up to the time I left office the building machine was geared up to a high pitch. After a couple of years we had reached the stage of building 1,000 houses per month, and I do not understand what has intervened since that to prevent the continuance of the progress that had been made.  The men were on the job, materials were still available, and I do not believe that an increase in the cost of materials, if there was an increase, could have prevented the drive continuing at the same speed at which it was progressing before the present Minister took office.  Nothing, in my opinion, would justify a slackening or an easing off except that we had reached a stage when we decided we could afford to slacken off.  I do not think we have reached that stage.  The target we set was 110,000 houses, and from the figures which the Minister gave this evening I am not satisfied that we have reached the stage at which we can afford to ease off, and we will not have reached that stage for some years to come.  Every effort should be made to obtain for this housing drive all the available operatives, not to allow them to get scattered, to have a break in the continuity of their work, and thus, perhaps, force them to leave the country.  We should try to keep the machine in gear.  Once it gets out of action, it will be very hard to get back to the peak of efficiency which it had reached, and which we must reach again if this essential national service of housing is to be provided on an adequate scale.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of general agreement that there is a need for workmen. Everybody in the House will agree that <Col N="376" /> housing is the most essential thing for our people at the present time, morally, physically and economically. The money put into the housing drive, even though it may be a strain upon the resources of the country as a whole, is the best investment anybody could make.  The investment of money in bricks and mortar, in Irish housing, is an excellent investment.  It is an investment in the building up of healthful homes, thus making our people a first-class, healthy race.  The question is has the Government got to the stage that it can afford to reduce its efforts in the matter of housing? It cannot be denied that there has been a slackening off in the drive. Instead of having an increased tempo it has been seriously reduced.  We were told months ago to be prepared for a further drop, a decline in building activities in the City of Dublin, not alone in 1952 but for a sharp and steep decline that will take place in 1953.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to say if that evil prophecy is still going to be carried out.  I am not satisfied, from the knowledge I have of housing, that there is any justification for the steep and sharp decline in the building of houses in Dublin in the year 1953.  We will be told about the lack of suitable sites, but in 1950 there were sufficient sites suitable for acquisition to keep the whole programme in operation for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>I want again to repudiate the statement made by Deputy Briscoe in this House speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, that the decline in house building which would take place in 1953 would be attributable to an Order made by me when I was Minister for Local Government, cutting across the activities of the corporation. The statement was published in the <i>Sunday Press</i> on 16th March last in the report of an interview given by Deputy Briscoe.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The expected decline in the city in 1953 is due to unwarranted interference with the corporation's housing plans by the Coalition Government, of which Mr. MacBride was a member.  About two years ago Mr. <Col N="377" /> Keyes, Minister for Local Government in the Coalition, ordered the corporation to depart from the normal line of planning which was aimed at building 2,500 municipal houses and flats and approximately 500 houses by the granting of loans to people who would build or buy their own houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to people buying their own houses.  People had no chance of buying their own houses prior to the passage of the 1950 Act. That is the first inaccuracy.  I repudiate again the allegation that I, as Minister for Local Government, did anything to prevent the development of the Dublin Corporation housing plan. I assert that, while I was in control of the Department, every facility that could possibly be given, not alone to the Dublin Corporation but to every housing authority throughout the country, was given and every effort that could be made to help in the house building programme was made.</P>
    <P>If house building slackens off in 1953 in the City of Dublin I repudiate responsibility for that.  I believe there will be no justification for it and I hope it will not take place.  I hope the Dublin Corporation will get on with the job and continue its magnificent work towards solving the slum problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the question of the housing loan.  It is regrettable that we should have such early publicity, perhaps unwarranted and unjustifiable, during the progress of delicate negotiations between the corporation and the banks.  Such publicity serves no useful purpose.  It is not good for the local authority endeavouring to raise the money.  It is certainly not good in connection with the objective aimed at.  I believe the money will be provided.  I cannot credit that at this stage the Dublin Corporation will be left without the necessary money to continue its housing programme.  Notwithstanding any statement the Minister may make, I am satisfied that the Government will ensure that the corporation will get the money necessary to build all the houses that are required.  This unwarranted intervention <Col N="378" /> is deplorable.  I, myself, had some difficulty in that respect and I know that it certainly did not improve the position.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is not feeling complacent.  I hope he does not think that all is well.  I urge him to galvanise local authorities into greater activity.  There seems to be a slump not alone in Dublin but throughout the country.  There may be some local authorities, though I cannot speak authoritatively on this, who are coming near the end of the road, but I think they must be very few in number.  In the vast majority there is still need for the continuance of the momentum reached in the past two years.  If they are allowed to slacken off now the housing drive will die of apathy. That would be disastrous.  The figures the Minister quoted are healthy but I would urge on him that a further effort should be made to get back to the target aimed at in 1950 and to do that before the men are dispersed because, once they go, it will be the devil of a job to get them back again.</P>
    <P>I deplore the slashing of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The out of £570,000 is a very drastic one.  It almost looks as if the Government is anxious to put the Act out of operation altogether.  I think that would be regrettable.  This Act, irrespective of who was responsible for its introduction, is one that should be operated on its merits.  It has proved both useful and beneficial.  I trust that the drastic reduction is not due to petulance. Irrespective of any increases that may be given under the Road Fund Grant for the maintenance of roads, a number of schemes have been submitted under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was only possible to do a certain percentage of the schemes submitted each year and the Act was not taken up too enthusiastically in the first year.  In the second year a great number of schemes were submitted for examination by the engineers and by the Department of Local Government and any money spent under the Act has been spent wisely and well.  The schemes that have been carried out have proved very beneficial because prior to the passage of that Act drainage <Col N="379" /> had lacked attention for generations and county councils had no authority to go in over the ditch and clean up drains running alongside the public roads.  They got that very necessary authority under the Act and useful road-side drainage has been done in conjunction and in co-operation with land reclamation.</P>
    <P>It will be regrettable if this Act does not continue in operation, but when one sees the money provided cut in two that does not seem to be a very good omen, and it looks as if the Act is not meeting with favour.  If the Government in its wisdom decided to give the Act a miss in baulk it will be regrettable from the point of view of the country as a whole, because magnificent work has been done under that Act.  Arterial drainage schemes cannot be carried out all over the country simultaneously, and this Act had provided an opportunity for relieving thousands of acres of land from flooding, innumerable homesteads, and even bogs.  I can speak intimately of areas where the people were resigned to living in a kind of second Holland, and where they are no longer subjected to flooding simply because of the operation of that Act, and at no cost to the ratepayer.  I regret the drastic cutting, and I hope it is not an indication of a still further drastic cut next year to the total exclusion of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman referred to the repair of houses in the country.  I urge the Minister to prevail on local authorities to speed up the preparation of schemes for the purchase of cottages under the 50 per cent. Order.  That Order has been in operation for a considerable time, but the progress under it has not been satisfactory.  Possibly there may have been some difficulty in drawing up schemes between the local authorities and the Department.  If there is any barrier I would ask the Minister to remove it as soon as possible, because a certain disquietude has been created in the minds of the people in relation to the question as to whether or not they can purchase their cottages.  They resisted purchase on the basis of the 25 per cent. remission. <Col N="380" /> They have now got a 50 per cent. remission, but they are still held up because of the non-preparation of schemes by the county councils.  I am not in a position to state as to whether or not that delay is due to the county councils themselves or whether there is some difficulty in negotiating the terms between the Departments and the county councils.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter with the local authorities concerned in an effort to speed up the preparation of schemes to implement the purchase of cottages by tenants under the 50 per cent. remission Order for which they waited for so many years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give all the attention he can to the question of the completion of the purchase of Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust house.  Following the enactment of the Bill in the British House of Commons, I do not know whether it will be necessary for the Minister to introduce legislation of a similar kind here or whether he can do it by Order, but, whatever the method that is adopted, I would ask the Minister to use all possible speed in giving effect to a purchase scheme that would put an end to a very undesirable state of things, evictions, and so on.  I am perfectly sure that there will be no delay on the Minister's part as soon as the legislation has been enacted in the British House of Commons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Keyes has said in regard to early transfer of ownership of their homes to the occupants of houses built by the Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust.  At the moment I am not aware of what the procedure will be, but I do know that there has been a demand for a purchase scheme for a long period and that delay may mean that certain families would lose the right to purchase their homes.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister, when the British Act becomes law&mdash;I think it is law now&mdash;to take whatever steps are necessary here as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing has been referred to by the Minister and by the Deputies who have spoken on the Estimate.  It is obvious that housing will be the main <Col N="381" /> subject of discussion on the Estimate. That is as it should be because, although there has been tremendous progress made in 20 years in the building of houses in Dublin and throughout the country, there is still a considerable amount of leeway to be made up.  I can visualise the Dublin Corporation being actively engaged in the building of houses for at least another ten years and perhaps more.  An idea has been developing in the minds of a number of people that the growth of Dublin is undesirable, that it would be much better if that growth could be checked.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that there is no possibility of stopping the growth of Dublin and that within our time Dublin will become a city of almost 1,000,000 inhabitants and that the Dublin Corporation will be faced with the problem of building, not only to deal with the slum problem, but to deal with the increasing growth of the city.</P>
    <P>A study of a number of countries, particularly of countries like Ireland, will reveal that the general tendency at present is to have a few very large cities with a decreasing population in the rural and agricultural areas.  We must face that problem.  Suggestions have been made to take Departments out of Dublin and send them to Mullingar, Athlone, Galway, Limerick and other places, to take the Army out of Dublin and the Garda Headquarters. Those suggestions do not take account of the desire of people to live in communities in cities.  That type of development is taking place not only in Ireland but in many countries and we have to face up to it.</P>
    <P>We in Dublin Corporation had an objective to build 3,000 houses a year.  We have been able over a few years to reach a target of approximately 2,500 houses a year. Deputy Keyes has referred to the fact that recently we were informed that there would be a drastic reduction in the number of houses that could be built in 1953.  In the Dublin Corporation we took this matter very seriously. Members of the council took it very seriously.  They held an investigation and discovered that the cause of the trouble was the fact that the corporation <Col N="382" /> had not provided sufficiently in advance for the number of sites that would enable it to maintain a programme of 2,500 houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryPDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.P. Dockrell Mr. H.P. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to do that you wanted to take the best parts of County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  Our corporation did not make adequate provision for sites in advance and we ran up against the problem in the beginning of this year that we had no sites or, at least, we were told that we would not have sufficient sites to enable us to build more than half the number of houses we required in 1953. We took very serious notice of that in the corporation and, as a result of the efforts of members of the corporation, the housing director was able to inform us a couple of weeks ago that 1,000 additional houses could be built and that the contracts for them would start to go out this month, next month, September and October.  All members of the housing committee, which means all members of the Dublin Corporation, were very pleased that their efforts had resulted in the housing director making available those 1,000 additional sites.</P>
      <P>It was very important that they should have been made available because it means continuation of employment.  We were informed last night in the Dublin Corporation that we have 500 men more employed in house building this year than we had last year.  We want to maintain that employment.  That figure was a surprise to me.  I did not think we had that number employed but we were assured last night by the City Manager that in Dublin we have 500 more people employed in house building and in the preparation of sites for housing than we had last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that if there had been a diminution in our building output the responsibility would have rested on us in the Dublin Corporation because we had not taken the steps to utilise all the sites that were available. But we can be up against a problem in the near future for which the Dublin Corporation will not be responsible but for which the Department will be responsible and I avail of <Col N="383" /> the opportunity this evening to refer to it.</P>
    <P>The drainage of Dublin is overloaded. Perhaps 12 or 13 years ago the city engineers, looking to the future, visualised the difficulty that would arise in regard to sewerage in about ten years from that time and they set out to consider the problem in great detail.  They decided on the necessity for a new main sewer from Finglas right out to Howth.  The preliminary work, the surveying and preparation of a scheme engaged the corporation engineers for a long period. Finally, the scheme was submitted to the Department of Local Government in April, 1949, and in February, 1950, a public inquiry was held by the Department in regard to the scheme. In June, 1950, the Department wrote to the corporation criticising the scheme on several grounds and in July, the following month, the city engineer then stated that the city's drainage difficulties would become more aggravated owing to the delay and that some months would be required to examine the alternative scheme suggested by the Department.</P>
    <P>Preliminary plans and estimates of the Department's alternative scheme were prepared and these were the subject of discussions in London between the corporation's sewers engineers, Mr. Nicholls, Mr. Coyle and Mr. Reynolds, who was the consultant employed by the Dublin Corporation. Mr. Reynold's firm had designed the original main drainage of Dublin in 1906 and had been consultants to the corporation since then.  In September, 1950, the city engineer reported on the alternative scheme and submitted reports from the main drainage engineer and Mr. Reynolds.  Here is what Mr. Reynolds, an acknowledged authority, said about it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am of opinion that with certain minor adjustments to meet the views put forward and to give additional safeguards in some matters on which doubt is expressed, the scheme submitted by the corporation is a sound, practical one and is the most suitable and economical method of draining the area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> These reports were sent to the Department of Local Government on the 9th October, 1950, including the opinion of the consultant.  In December, 1950, the Department of Local Government sent to the corporation the report of their chief engineering adviser and, as far as I can gather, the Department simply reiterated their original criticism of the scheme.</P>
    <P>We then had a deadlock, in which the Department's engineering adviser threw cold water on the scheme prepared by the competent officials and engineers of the corporation and supported by a consultant of world-wide authority.  That was the position at the end of 1950.</P>
    <P>The corporation, knowing that the scheme was of such vital importance, decided to employ a second consultant, and Mr. Godfrey Taylor, the principal of Messrs. John Taylor and Sons, consulting engineers, was appointed.  This gentleman is also an acknowledged authority on this class of work.  The matter was submitted to this consultant, together with the opinion of Mr. Reynolds, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The scheme as put forward is the correct engineering solution to the problem set by the topography of the area.  It is free from the disadvantages of the alternative scheme suggested by the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Taylor visited Dublin in June and submitted his report in September. His report was on the best method of conveying the sewage and storm-water from the upper part of the northern area to the point suggested for its discharge into the sea at the nose of Howth.  Mr. Taylor dealt with the departmental objections and stated that he saw no third alternative, and concluded his report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having given the whole matter my most careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the various points raised by the Department consist of difficulties which can be overcome and are not fundamental objections which will prevent the scheme operating in a satisfactory manner.  I am of opinion that many of the disadvantages set out by the Department are common to many sea outfall schemes and that <Col N="385" /> other difficulties mentioned will not cause continual trouble or nuisance and in any case do not justify the radical amendment of the introduction of a pumping station with its high operating cost when the power already exists in the considerable head always available at Raheny.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The city manager sent this report to the Department on the 15th September last and in response he received a request for reconsideration of the points made in the Department's letters of the 30th June, 1950, 6th December, 1950 and 15th January, 1952.</P>
    <P>The city manager and corporation were anxious to see where they could meet these departmental objections, because they realised how necessary it was to have this scheme in operation. Unless it was put into operation, a big area of building land would be closed to the corporation and the development of the city in that direction&mdash;the only direction open&mdash;would be retarded. The city engineer had discussions with the Government engineers in March of this year and, on 11th March, the city engineer sent drawings and an analysis of the backwatering system to the Department.  On 16th April, he sent a long memorandum to the chief engineering adviser dealing with the population of the drainage area, velocities of flow, ventilation of sewers, etc., and in order to meet the Department, he said he was prepared to instal pumps to deal with the dry water flow and skimmings, although Mr. Nicholls, our main drainage engineer, objected to giving this undertaking as he considered these works quite unnecessary and he would not go further than to say that provision would be made for them, if it would meet the Department's wishes.</P>
    <P>All these matters were again referred to the consultants and were also referred unofficially to the chief engineering adviser of the Department on the 23rd April, 1952.  The city engineer was requested by the chief engineering adviser to indicate the capital and running costs of the modifications suggested.</P>
    <P>These have since been supplied.  The corporation engineers were prepared to incur what they considered unnecessary <Col N="386" /> expense to meet the views of the chief engineering adviser of the Department, and to get the scheme approved.  Recently, the city engineer and chief engineering adviser discussed the matter&mdash;on June 5th&mdash;and our engineer on that occasion considered that it would be some considerable time before the matter would be dealt with, and sanction given by the Department.  The Minister dealt with it this evening, but I did not hear him clearly.  I am now given to understand that sanction has now been given for the completion of the scheme.  Perhaps I am misinformed when told that this morning a letter had come from the Department to-day approving of the scheme.  If it has not come, we are still in the position we were in at the corporation meeting last night.  The city engineer visited London on 12th June, accompanied by Mr. Nicholls and Mr. Coyle, and, having first conferred with Mr. Reynolds, they discussed the various aspects of the matter with both Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Taylor.  We now await a joint report on the whole position from these consultants of repute.</P>
    <P>I wanted to place this correspondence and these facts on record here, so that the House will realise that this scheme was submitted in April, 1949, by the city engineer and the Dublin Corporation to the Department. Apparently, it did not matter what the city engineer or the consultants advised&mdash;all the Department asked on each occasion was: &ldquo;Please reconsider your scheme.&rdquo;  Most of us in the House have experience of this type of mentality.  It is known as red tape mentality, which operates in Government Departments.  No matter what you submit, you are asked please to reconsider it, and submit something else.  This is too important a matter to have been held up from 1949 until to-day.  I am sorry that Deputy Keyes has left the Chamber, because in 1949, 1950 and during part of 1951, this matter must have been before him as Minister for Local Government, and it must have been before the present Minister since he took office a year ago.</P>
    <P>The building of the houses we require <Col N="387" /> in Dublin demands the completion of the Howth outfall, as it is called.  The scheme at the moment is being developed as far as Raheny but it cannot be completed until the final portion of it, the portion which runs from Raheny to the nose of Howth is completed.  I do not understand the engineering differences between the city engineer, backed by all these consultants of repute and the departmental chief engineering adviser.  I understand that it is a very simple matter.  The city engineer and the consultants want to run the pipe so that the sewerage is discharged under the sea at Howth.  Their idea is to run the sewerage pipe down so that its contents get a fall and, by its own force, will go out under the sea at Howth.  The departmental engineer wants pumps to be erected to run it up over Howth Hill and give it a fall into the sea.  That is probably an oversimplification of the matter, but that is what we understand in Dublin Corporation. That is the explantion given to us by our deputy city engineer.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Department must understand and appreciate the importance of this, that our whole housing programme in Dublin for the next ten years depends on the completion of this sewer, that the erection of this sewer will open all the valuable building ground we have around Coolock and out from Finglas to Howth, and that it will enable a whole new area of corporation houses to be erected in the vicinity of Coolock.  Our building plans will be held up, and are being held up, through the non-completion of this sewer.  We discussed this matter last night in Dublin Corporation and members of the corporation who are members of the Dáil were requested to avail of the earliest opportunity, which happens to be to-day, to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and to impress upon him how necessary it is that this work should be sanctioned immediately.  The work will give valuable employment, apart entirely from the very valuable services it will open up.</P>
    <P>I look on the Department of Local Government as a Department that <Col N="388" /> should be available to assist local authorities and not to handicap them or prevent them doing work which is vital and necessary.  I can appreciate that a scheme of the magnitude of this could be held up for some time, but I cannot understand how it could possibly be held up from 1949 to 1952. The opinions of experts, the opinions of consultants who are world famous, were submitted to the Department, but all the corporation gets back is the red tape reply: &ldquo;Please reconsider the matter in the light of my letter of January, 1949, or of January, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House realises&mdash;and certainly I realise it as far as Dublin Corporation is concerned&mdash;that, in recent months, the Department has met the corporation, has facilitated us and has cooperated with us in many matters connected with the building of houses, and we feel that, in a general way, obstacles and difficulties which were in our way had been removed by the present Minister.  We in Dublin Corporation are satisfied that when the Minister examines this big problem, when he looks at the correspondence, when he sees the authority, the knowledge and the experience of the engineers submitting this scheme, he will give it his sanction as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>No matter what the plan is, particularly a major plan, there will always be objections to it.  No two engineers agree on anything.  The ideas of the chief adviser of the Department of Local Government may be perfect, but the city engineer, in whom we have the utmost confidence because of his great experience, knowledge and competence, has put forward his own scheme.  If those two engineers do not agree on the scheme there is no reason why the City of Dublin should be deprived of a scheme which is so necessary to its development and to its citizens.</P>
    <P>When you have a city engineer who is competent, when you have men like our sewerage engineer, whose whole lifetime has been devoted to the science of sewerage engineering and when their views are supported by consultants like the men I have mentioned, then I think the chief engineering <Col N="389" /> adviser of the Department of Local Government must step out and say: &ldquo;I have my own view.  I do not agree with what you are doing but you are the responsible authority,&rdquo; and advise the Minister to give sanction so that the work could go ahead.  No great scheme could ever have been started if two engineering authorities were permitted to conflict about it and I would say to the Minister that, by and large, the big responsibility is the responsibility of the local authority, Dublin Corporation.  When they are properly advised by competent people and when the Department knows, as they do know, how necessary the scheme is they should sanction it and the scheme should not be delayed any length of time.</P>
    <P>Other members of Dublin Corporation who are Deputies will support the case I am making to the Minister to give that sanction at once so that we may complete that job, open up these areas in which we can build houses and give much needed employment in Dublin City.  I am quite sure that when the Minister has considered this he will give us the sanction, the green light, so that Dublin Corporation may go ahead with this very necessary work.  Our present housing difficulty is the responsibility of the corporation alone but if we run into difficulties a couple of years hence through lack of sewerage the responsibility will be that of the Department of Local Government and I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be no need to blame the Department with regard to Dublin sewerages when his Estimate comes to be discussed next year or the year after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I expected, this debate has centred around housing because housing has received priority in local government activities during the last four or five years.  I represent a Dublin constituency and therefore I will deal solely with the Dublin area. Dublin Corporation was charged after the emergency with the greatest housing responsibility that any local authority in this country ever had.  As a result of a survey made in 1948 Dublin Corporation found that 30,000 <Col N="390" /> dwellings were required to house the needy people of the city and, I am glad to say, the corporation started on a new project in the Philipsburgh Avenue area which helped to ease this position.  The corporation over a great number of years developed housing for slum clearance and poor people in the city were catered for to the best of the corporation's ability.  Luxury dwellings were built to suit the requirements of people who could afford to purchase their own home.  Small dwellings loans were provided by local authorities to help people in urban and rural areas to purchase their own dwellings also.  There was a certain class of people in the City of Dublin, however, who were never catered for. The corporation built in the Philipsburgh Avenue area 204 houses to be let at an economic rent.  We had 1,500 applicants and the fortunate applicants will be no charge upon the ratepayers. Last Friday we had a meeting of Dublin Corporation and the housing committee's decision will, I hope, find favour with the Minister.  They decided to recommend to him that 700 odd houses should be built on the St. Anne's development area; that they should be of the Philipsburgh Avenue type and let at an economic rent; that the bulk of the tenants of these houses should be taken from existing corporation schemes thus providing houses, built pre-war at a small cost, for the Dublin Corporation.  I am glad to say that in the corporation we have the support of Deputy Cowan on this matter.  I missed the beginning of his speech, but I think I am right in saying that he did not refer to this matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a statement made here in the Dáil by Deputy Cowan which is reported in the Dáil Debates, Volume 116, column 517.  Deputy Cowan, referring to the development of St. Anne's Estate, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have facilities at St. Anne's for approximately 5,000 houses but those 5,000 houses cannot be built because there is no sewerage.  A considerable portion of the work on sewerage should have been done during <Col N="391" /> the emergency.  We have been told that it will take five years to instal the sewerage that will serve the estate at St. Anne's.  In other words, that beautiful site cannot be developed for five years.  I made the suggestion to the Minister's predecessor and I make it to the Minister again that this sewerage work is important and that there are sufficient workers in the City of Dublin to build that sewerage within a period of a little over a year.  That can be done by employing the available workers for three shifts of eight hours in every day using artificial light and tackling it as any emergency problem would and should be. That estate is in my own constituency. If it is developed, the housing problem in North-East Dublin would be solved.  None of us can wait, and none of us will wait, for a period of five years for the installation of the sewage scheme that can be installed in a little over a year.  If it is tackled in the way it should be tackled, St. Anne's will provide approximately 5,000 houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is contrary to the present beliefs and opinions of Deputy Cowan. Deputy Cowan is in full agreement now with the scheme that was submitted by the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation but unfortunately is trying to make political capital out of it.</P>
    <P>A matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister is the urgent necessity for advising local authorities to introduce as soon as possible a tenant-purchase scheme for their houses.  At first glance this may appear to be something about which representatives of local authorities will not bother very much, but I should like to point out that in the Dublin County Council area the cost of repairing cottages for the last 12 months came to over £70,000 and the Dublin Corporation are charged with the repair of 32,000 houses at a cost of £448,000 per annum.  These are problems that I think should get very careful consideration.  Every Deputy realises that a tenant of a house will do nothing to repair his own dwelling when he can get the local authority to do it.  I know <Col N="392" /> a certain tradesman who will wait a year for the corporation workmen to come along to do some minor repairs to his house.  He would not raise a screwdriver to carry out any repairs himself because he is not the tenant of a house which could be purchased under a tenant-purchase scheme.  I urge on the Minister to do what he can to promote tenant-purchase schemes throughout the country and to advise local authorities of the necessity for bringing in some schemes for tenant-purchase.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I would like the Minister to interest himself is to encourage local authorities, by relief works or some other means, to develop some of the natural bathing facilities to be found around our coasts.  We have heard a lot about tourism and about inviting visitors from America and from across the Irish Sea to our shores but I must say much still remains to be done all over the country to attract visitors.  In the Dublin area, the poor people usually use Merrion Strand, Dollymount Strand and Portmarnock Strand because they are readily accessible and are served by good transport systems.  I think the area around the Head of Howth towards Redrock could also be developed at, I would say, comparatively small cost.  The City of Dublin has a population of over 500,000 but there are practically no bathing facilities for the residents of the city at the adjacent seaside resorts.  It is disgraceful to think that in Portmarnock one car can hardly pass through the village at a week-end.  It is not possible to get to Portmarnock Strand except at one small spot near the tower.  Yet it is the seaside resort which is most favoured by the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say that there is still a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the building trade in the City of Dublin in relation to the slow payment of building grants.  I should like also to impress upon the Minister that it would be desirable to have more exciting designs in local authority housing schemes.  The majority of housing schemes throughout the country, and indeed in the city too, <Col N="393" /> would give anybody the impression that the houses were mass-produced. I suggest to the Minister that he might take note of the very excellent building scheme at Clarecastle in County Clare, of the new housing scheme at Portmarnock and the housing scheme for which the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation are responsible at Sallynoggin.  I do not think these schemes cost per house any more than any other housing schemes but a change in the colour scheme is introduced.  There is a change in the colour of the roof, a change in the colour of the dashing of the house and some slight architectural changes in the schemes which make them more attractive and unlike some of the artisan schemes that are being thrown up all over the country.  It is desirable that tenants should take a pride in their own homes and it is very difficult, for these people to take a pride in their homes unless the general scheme appearance is removed as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that, in the course of my journeys through the country, I have been struck by the number of fallen down buildings, out-offices and old cottages which one sees along the main roads leading to many towns and, in many cases, to some very attractive sea-side resorts.  When local authorities are carrying out housing schemes they should cause these old buildings to be demolished and make use in their schemes of this dry filling and old rubble.  These old tumble down buildings are a scar on the face of the country-side.</P>
    <P>I think that special road grants should be made to counties which are, one may say, predominantly tourist counties.  There should be special road grants for Connemara and Donegal so as to enable them to put their coast roads in proper order.  We have some beautiful scenery in this country, but for miles and miles it is not accessible to visitors and tourists.  If they want to see it they have to travel on foot, and in this machine age it is very difficult to get tourists, particularly, to travel on foot.  They generally want to travel by bus, coach or motor car.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the point that <Col N="394" /> was mentioned by Deputy Sweetman. It is this, that the financial position of the Dublin Corporation is all right until the end of this year.  I should like the Minister to assure the corporation, and everybody concerned, that they will be in a position to carry on from the 1st of January next.  It would be idle for members of the corporation to be sitting at housing meetings, or for Deputies in Leinster House to be discussing the housing problems of the city, if money were not made readily available to the corporation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, contrary to what Deputy Cowan has stated when he said that 500 more men are employed by the Dublin Corporation this year in the building trade, will not be able to deny that there is serious unemployment and grave uneasiness in the building trade in general at present.  Deputy Keyes said that there were 165 carpenters idle in Limerick at the moment. There are far more idle in the City of Dublin.  I suggest to Deputy Cowan that if he were to refer to the unions which cater for the building industry in this city he would be told a different story from the one which he mentioned in the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to the Howth main drainage scheme which, I understand, was estimated at one time to cost about £1,500,000.  God knows what it will cost by the time it is finished. Can the Minister give any approximate idea of how many new houses this scheme will serve?  I think it will be surprising to learn how few houses it will serve.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister about the report that was requested in 1938.  I might say that some of the most serious difficulties concerning development in the Dublin area arise from sewerage and water works problems, town planning problems and road construction.  The only way of obviating these difficulties, in my opinion, would be by implementing the report requested by the present Government and submitted in 1938.  It is called the Gavan-Duffy Report.  It suggested, as a solution for local administration in the Dublin area, the formation of a metropolitan council which <Col N="395" /> would control all the local authority activities of the present Dublin City, of all developed areas and all the areas expected to be developed around the City of Dublin.  People may make arguments against that and suggest that it would be unfair to ask the people in Balrothery, Rush and Lusk to pay the same rates as people living in Rathmines, Sandymount and Clontarf areas.  But the rates are apportioned in all other counties in the country, and it would be a very simple matter to apportion the rates in the proposed metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>We, in the City of Dublin, are in the peculiar position of not having much ground to build houses on.  I suppose I could safely say that, apart from the St. Ann's estate at Clontarf, the Dublin Corporation would not have sites for more than 700 or 800 houses. They have to go outside their own borough area to build.  Any future development by the Dublin Corporation will be in the Dublin County Council area.  The tenants will be paying rents to the corporation but will have no representation on the Dublin Corporation.  In the case of many of our housing schemes, the tenants will not have a representative on the Dublin Corporation.  We have a new housing scheme at Finglas.  The people there will be represented on the Dublin County Council and the same will apply in connection with our new housing scheme at Ballyfermot.  We can couple these problems on the fringe of the area north of Dublin City.  We have the Howth main drainage scheme and we have the city council building houses in the county area.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should examine these problems.  I suggest that he should also examine the merits of the Gavan-Duffy Report because I honestly believe it provides the only proper solution for the Dublin area.  If adopted, it would reduce administrative costs as well as the costs of development in general on the fringe area of Dublin.  The position at the moment is that the Dublin Corporation require to build a scheme, as Deputy Cowan has said, at Coolock.  That is in the <Col N="396" /> county area.  You have county town planning and you have town planning officers communicating with each other. Anybody who realises how long it takes for plans to be approved and accepted can understand the unnecessary delay that occurs in this way.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister, when replying to the debate, to answer this question.  Can the Minister say how many new houses the new Howth main drainage scheme will accommodate?  I really think that his reply to that should be very enlightening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in Deputy Keyes' speech he once again referred to the statement made by Deputy Briscoe.  I am sorry that Deputy Briscoe is not here, as the same thing happened before when Deputy Keyes referred to this matter&mdash;I had to give him the exact facts of the case.  He complained that Deputy Briscoe accused him of holding up plans, or at least asking Dublin Corporation to alter their plans, which held up the building of houses.  He claimed that there was no such thing and I would refer him again to the circular issued in January 1951 from the Department of Local Government, when Deputy Keyes was Minister.  That circular asked the corporation to depart from their usual procedure in presenting plans.  The ideas of the Department may have been correct.  What they had in mind was that we should submit completed house plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this the Dublin Corporation would simply acquire a site and go ahead and develop it, pending the approval of the plans by the Department. This circular came out in January 1951 and it certainly held us up for many months and will react on our plans for 1953.  As a result of that, we went to see the present Minister for Local Government.  We came from Dublin Corporation and included members of Deputy Keyes' Party, the Labour Party.  That deputation to the Minister was to try and help us in this matter, arising out of the circular of January 1951.  I must admit that the Minister and his officials were very helpful, they met us in every way and we certainly went ahead.  I do not <Col N="397" /> attach a great deal of blame to Deputy Keyes, but I simply emphasise that Deputy Briscoe was perfectly right when he was referring to the circular of January 1951.  It is there in black and white in the Corporation and in the Department.  That was Deputy Briscoe's case and I am simply defending a colleague by stating the correct position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan certainly made the case for the Dublin Corporation in a splendid manner as regards the Howth drainage scheme.  He was certainly well briefed by the corporation engineer and I would like the Minister to take note of what he said.  We in the corporation claim that we have spent a considerable amount of money in getting experts&mdash;expert consultants&mdash;to deal with this matter.  We started in 1944 and altogether we have got men of renowned reputation in Mr. Alfred, Mr. Reynolds, Professor Conway and Mr. Taylor.  They bear a great reputation in the question of drainage work.  What their fees will be I do not know but I have been assured by the City Engineer that they will be considerable.  I am making that point to show that the Dublin Corporation is more than anxious to see that everything is done in a proper manner.  All we got from the Department was, as Deputy Cowan said, to refer our plans back for reconsideration.  If that is going to continue, it will be very serious.  One of these experts, Mr. Alfred, has died and I hope sincerely the Department will pass those plans before the rest of the experts die and we will have no one to refer them back to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will deal with the matter expeditiously. The Department may feel they are doing the right thing but on the other hand they will agree that we in the corporation took every possible step to do things in the right manner.  We got the best opinions possible and went to endless trouble.  We submitted our plans, I understand, in April, 1949.  I hope that by now they have reached the stage where there is no question of referring them back for reconsideration. It has been pointed out that if <Col N="398" /> these plans are held up any longer there will be a great deal of unemployment in the next few years.  With that scheme we hoped to continue our programme for the next ten years in a much larger manner than we are doing at the moment, and if it is not approved I can tell the Minister it will have serious effects on the City of Dublin.  I would like again to support Deputy Cowan and the other members of the Dublin Corporation who are members of this House in pressing the Minister to give it his most urgent attention, to let the matter go away at once and let us get moving on building our houses again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Belton and others were bemoaning the fact that there is a great deal of unemployment in Dublin in the building line; but it is true to say that in the Dublin Corporation building programme we have 500 men more now in employment than this time last year.  That is a statement of our own housing director. I do not think things are as bad as Deputy Belton would have us believe in private building.  I know from my personal knowledge that in his own constituency, in his own district alone, there are builders there ready to build from 300 to 400 houses.  They have their plans passed by the Department, the foundations are in and they are going ahead in style.  Deputies should refer to these things when they are dealing with housing.  That is actually in Deputy Belton's own district, where building is going ahead for at least 300 or 400 houses.  We in the Dublin Corporation are certainly doing our part.  We do not like to see men walking idle on the streets any more than anyone else and we are doing everything possible to get the housing programme going and to employ as many more men as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the refusal of the Banks Standing Committee to meet the demand of the Dublin Corporation. I heard the Minister, when he was dealing with the Housing Bill, say that he would certainly deal with that matter when it would come up.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Belton, we in the Dublin Corporation are all right for finance up to the end <Col N="399" /> of this year.  I would say to the Minister that now is the time to go ahead and make sure that the money we want in Dublin will be forthcoming.  It is a matter that the Government should treat as urgent.  They should not wait until next Christmas, as it is no good to us then.  We want no hold up.  We have our plans and if this Howth drainage scheme is passed and we have the money by January 1953, we certainly will go to town in great style. I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that this matter of the loan for Dublin Corporation gets urgent consideration.  In fact, it should get priority in the Government agenda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton made a case for tenant purchase.  I would also support him on that, as I think that tenant purchase is a very good idea.  It gives people a sense of home ownership that they appreciate a good deal.  He made the case that it would certainly do away with a lot of expense of the corporation and other local authorities in maintenance.  Any suggestions coming from the corporation or any other local authority regarding tenant purchase should certainly receive the Minister's approval, particularly in the case of the St. Ann's estate, where the Dublin Corporation has agreed to provide over 700 houses by tenant purchase. The Minister should not throw a damper on that but should let it go ahead.  It is an ideal scheme and will save the ratepayers of Dublin a good deal of money in maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>Last night in the Dublin Corporation we had a motion down regarding swimming baths and of course it was pointed out to us that the corporation could not afford to spend any money on the provision of swimming baths. I think that is a shame.  There is no doubt of the value of swimming as an exercise and it should be helped and developed.  It is up to the Department of Local Government in the near future to make some sort of grant to local authorities for the provision of swimming facilities.</P>
    <P>I hope to leave next Tuesday for Helsinki for the Olympic Games.  I regret very much that we have not one swimmer on our team.  Despite the <Col N="400" /> fact that we have such fine facilities all along our coast for sea bathing, we have no facilities for winter swimming, which is great pity.  I do not want to stress swimming from the sporting point of view.  I should prefer to press it more or less from the point of view of the healthy development of our young people.  From my own experience, regular practice at swimming helps to maintain good health.  If the value of the lives lost through drowning could be capitalised on, I should say that nationally the result would well repay any expenditure involved in the provision of swimming baths and swimming facilities.  I appeal in particular for winter swimming facilities for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would advise some of the Minister's officials to pay a visit to Tara Street baths.  Certainly they would get an eyeful there.  The Tara Street baths are the most dilapidated baths I have seen.  I have been on many sporting trips throughout the world and I would be ashamed to bring a person from a foreign country into the Tara Street baths.  The pipes are leaking there and the water is dropping down in the cubicles on the clothes of the children.  I was present at the Tara Street baths for the primary school events.  I saw the water leaking from the pipes in the cubicles and dropping down on the clothes of the children. In addition, it was not possible to open or close the windows.  If you were lucky enough to open the windows you could not close them again.  That is a very serious matter for Dublin City and the Department of Local Government should look into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I pressed the case strongly there.  The view of the corporation was that if they carry out the improvements the people will complain that it will mean an addition to the rates.  I think that a grant should be given by the Department of Local Government for this purpose.  I look upon the matter from the children's point of view.  Every effort should be made to provide them with <Col N="401" /> swimming facilities and teaching facilities.  I should like the Department of Local Government to make a grant to the local authorities in that connection. As I have said, I am not pressing this matter from a sporting point of view but from the point of view that swimming is an exercise which is beneficial to the health and development of the body.  In a case of emergency, a person who can swim can save himself and maybe others as well. I believe that the result nationally would well repay any expenditure involved in that connection.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look into the matter of the Dublin Corporation Finglas to Howth main drainage scheme and to enable us to get on with the work.  Any help which he can give us will be appreciated.  I know that he will do all he can in the matter.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will listen to everything the Dublin Corporation have to say and especially our officials in whom we have the greatest possible faith.  Our housing record in Dublin is second to none.  Tributes have been paid to us from all parts of the world in respect of our housing schemes.  In view of our past record, I cannot understand why there should be any hold-up in the sanctioning of submissions which we make in that respect.  We have a record to be proud of and the standard of our officials is very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a specific matter which is, I think, common only to housing schemes on the fringe of the city area and which causes peculiar problems for the residents of these schemes.  When the housing drive restarted after the end of the last war a number of schemes on the fringe of the city, or in the area of County Dublin which I have the privilege to represent&mdash;it probably occurs also in the constituency of County Dublin proper&mdash;were developed to a considerable extent by private builders.  I think the problem is confined in the main to schemes built by private builders and that it does not apply so much to local authority schemes.  A number of these were developed and roads were provided. Due to delay in finishing the work on <Col N="402" /> the roads and due to the speed with which the builders are anxious to complete the houses, there has been a great delay in leaving the roads in a condition fit to be taken over by the local authority.  That causes a number of problems.  The Department of Local Government will not sanction for public transport any road not under the control of the local authority.  The result is that while a number of roads through different schemes are nearly or partially finished the residents are denied public transport because the roads are not completed and acquired by the local authority.  This matter has arisen in one or two cases and it is causing very serious problems and considerable inconvenience to the residents.  I refer in particular to the development of Mount Merrion and Kilmacud.  Mount Merrion is an area which has grown extensively and, because the developer of the major housing scheme on the estate has not handed over the road, the residents of that area have for a number of years past been denied adequate transport.  When an estate is developed, it is only reasonable that some time should elapse before the necessary work is completed and no new resident objects to the accepted delay which will occur after a scheme is completed.  The residents of Mount Merrion have been denied adequate public transport because the developer has delayed handling over the road.  In raising this particular matter I need hardly say that I am not ascribing any responsibility to the Minister or in fact to the previous Minister for Local Government.  However, it raises an issue which I think should be considered by the Minister and by the Department in consultation with the local authorities concerned.  I say that this is peculiar to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and possibly to County Dublin because in the main the roads on which schemes are built in the city are roads provided by the corporation and the county council schemes provided by the local authorities are in fact provided with roads prior to the development of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has arisen in the case of privately developed schemes. Serious consideration will have to be <Col N="403" /> given to the withholding of sanction for plans until the essential preliminaries are first provided.  I want to suggest to the Minister that some discussions should take place between his Department and the Dublin County Council and, if necessary, the developer of the big scheme on the Mount Merrion estate.</P>
    <P>Similar problems of a smaller nature have occurred on other estates adjoining the Mount Merrion estate and in smaller schemes of a private nature in Clonskeagh and also in Newtown Park, near Blackrock.  In these areas there were a number of minor roads which probably had, at the maximum, anything up to a dozen houses.  In a number of cases the roads were left in the existing condition and large new schemes completed.  These schemes have been finished but because of the lack of co-ordination between the private developer and the local authority and possibly the Department, public transport is denied the residents of these schemes because the roads are not approved for public or for any heavy transport of that nature.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to suggest to the Minister that this matter should receive the attention of the Department in consultation with the local authority.  The residents of these houses are all paying rates and have been ratepayers since they went into occupation but because of this peculiar difficulty which is, I think, not common to other local authorities and which is common only to certain schemes, in the main private schemes, the people concerned are denied the services to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>In discussing this Estimate I believe we are discussing one which, in its own way, is of more importance to the people as a whole than any other departmental Estimate. If we approached this Estimate not from the point of view of its affecting our own little areas or the problems that face the people in the constituencies we may happen to represent it might be better.  We should realise that no other Department of State has <Col N="404" /> a more direct bearing in its everyday activities on the people of this country whether they happen to be residents of Dublin, Cork or the rural areas. The work done in this Department has such an important bearing on the people of the Twenty Six Counties that we should be prepared to try, in our own limited way, to view its activities as they affect the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>We ought to examine the Department's approach towards local authorities. Local authorities are of such importance that requests made by them should be considered closely and carefully having regard to the fact that the requests go through the county manager or the city manager.  Public men have often to complain about the delays that are daily experienced in regard to final decisions from the central authority on requests made by local authorities.  The central authority may through its Minister decide on policy.  It is on the advice tendered by the public representatives, advice which has been accepted by the county manager for these local authorities, that these requests are made.  Surely, these requests are entitled to some consideration. There should not be this undue delay in giving final sanction or in turning down requests made by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any balls to fire in my local council.  The attitude I adopt is that of simply endeavouring, to the best of my ability, to express the views of the people who have sent me here. I do not now, no more than I did for three and a half years, take any advantage of any matter I may raise in this House and use it as a ball to fire in my local council.  So long as we are satisfied that the views we express here are our own honest opinions and are not expressed for any ulterior motive, I believe those views must be given. If other people are not willing to accept these views in the honest-to-God manner in which they are expressed I for one will express them whether they are liked or not.  Many small points, which may seem big to the Department, are raised in connection with plans or requests submitted to it.  I <Col N="405" /> do not object to that, but I fail to understand why plans or requests sent up from a local authority to the Department in connection with housing are returned.  When the local authority officials have done their utmost to rectify the difficulties in these plans, they send them to the Department of Local Government a second time.  Why is it that it only then occurs to the Minister and to the officials of that Department that there are other difficulties which were not noticeable in the first scheme?  I know, and every member of this House knows, that this Department has a number of officials who are experts in their own particular line, but why is it that these experts cannot decide on all the faults when the first scheme is submitted?  Why are the various corrections submitted in a piecemeal manner?  The Department of Local Government is particularly noted for this practice.  Like every member of this Assembly, I could mention various schemes that have been held up.  However, it is not proper to do so now because we are considering an Estimate rather than particular cases. However, if the Minister so desires, he can check up and he will see that housing schemes in South Cork have been held up for long periods because of some small defects which were not discovered on first examination.</P>
    <P>The Department found one or two defects at a time, and it took numerous examinations to find all the defects.  When an official inspected a certain site which was suitable, he returned to Dublin and submitted a report, which was sent back to the county council concerned, in which he said that there was not sufficient land on the site.  Why was this done?  When the site was inspected, it could have been discovered that some of the land was the property of the local authority. For the Minister's information, I am referring to a site in Rochestown, County Cork, where some of the land is the property of the local authority. It originally belonged to the railway company and the local authority purchased it.  An inspection of the site was carried out, and it was obvious from the report of such inspection that it was thought that the railway company <Col N="406" /> property did not belong to the local authority.  Such things should never happen, and there is only one way of preventing them.  It is an easy way&mdash;by realising that a local authority should be a local authority.</P>
    <P>There is too much centralisation in this country, and this is more noticeable in the Department of Local Government than in any other Department of State.  There are county managers, county surveyors, other local authority officials and members of county councils&mdash;all men who, for years, have proved themselves capable of carrying out their duties.  What is the point in having them if due regard is not given to any suggestions made by them?  I can appreciate that a Minister would be faced with a problem if, on a particular matter, local authority officials, headed by the county manager, and members of a local authority were at variance.  However, in most cases that would not arise, because there is usually unanimous agreement in a local authority between the officials and the members.</P>
    <P>If local government is to function properly in this country, if it is to improve, if rural areas are to advance as the county councils desire, and if the people are to get a just reward for the money they pay in rates and otherwise, it must be realised that local government can never be ruled from the Custom House.  The Minister may say that present-day local authorities have a more advanced outlook in comparison with the local authorities that existed in years gone by, or he may express the view, given voice to so often by certain members of local authorities, that we must discard the conservative outlook in local authority matters and move with the times whether or not we wish to do so. Perhaps the Minister may adopt the attitude that, although local authorities have a more advanced outlook than local authorities of bygone years, they should not advance too rapidly at the present time.  However, if we put a brake on the activities of local authorities, we will be removing a brake from the young people in rural Ireland who will then turn their eyes <Col N="407" /> towards the emigrant ship.  I am not trying to paint a picture in this House to suit either a particular Party or a particular individual.  I am not expressing my own personal views but the views of the people in rural Ireland who know the advantages that will be theirs if they get adequate employment. At the moment they are being subjected to difficulties which could easily be removed.</P>
    <P>I am not expressing the views of city dwellers but the views of the rural dwellers.  I would like to pay a tribute to all members of the Cork County Council irrespective of the Party to which they belong or irrespective of the fact that they may be Independents.  All Parties work well together and I am happy to say that, within the last few years, we have made satisfactory strides in our housing programme.  We can do much better and the fact that we have not done much better in the past is not entirely our fault.  A certain amount of the blame must be laid at the door of the Department of Local Government. If the Minister or his officials look up certain data, even at this late stage, they will realise that housing schemes in South Cork have been held up for long periods.  Even though some of those schemes were ultimately sanctioned, in many instances people were denied the comfort of a decent home for a protracted period.  This should never have been the case.</P>
    <P>Coupled with housing is the problem of water and sewerage schemes.  Here again we have a fairly tidy sum in postage through the correspondence sent by the local authority and the Department dealing with some of these very important schemes.  I could name towns&mdash;what is the use now; these records are in the Department&mdash;where the sewerage system at the present time is a disgrace, where recommendations and plans have been sent up to the Department and where objections have been found.  I agree that if advice is essential it is right it should be sent down but why should it take so long to solve these little problems?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Considering that in this Department, there are about 12 different sections, as far as I know, surely these sections should be and must be so compact that there should not be any undue delay in dealing with such an important problem as the improvement of these sewerage schemes in areas where the health of the people depends so much on proper sewerage facilities in their localities.  I can understand that the demands on the Minister and on his Department are such that the heavier demands may come and the greatest consensus of public opinion may come from the cities or large built up areas.  But that in itself is not sufficient to outnumber or outweigh the requests that may come from small towns, old towns, the towns whose names have been embedded in the history of this country when some of these built-up areas were never heard of.  I want to see facilities provided for people in these built-up areas.  They are entitled to them but not at the expense of the people in the towns of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have undoubtedly been many delays in dealing with requests from the local authorities in connection with such urgent matters as sewerage schemes and water schemes.  People in cities will never know what it means to the people in the rural areas to have to go a few miles so often for a few buckets of water, living in villages where they are so often depending on an old well or an old pump that may be there for years.  The Minister may say that it is a matter for the local authority to see that the pump is not an old one or to see that a new one is sunk, but considering that the boring and sinking of a pump costs an average of £225, we believe that when proposals are sent to the Department from the local authorities requesting sanction for a water scheme for these small villages these requests should receive not a long delay but the consideration that is due to them.  If we are slipping into a period where a Department may be inclined to become top-heavy, where the requests from rural areas, from villages or towns are going to be placed in a category far removed down the scale from the <Col N="409" /> demands from cities, then I say the sooner we realise that we are heading for a system of complete chaos and bankruptcy in local government, the more honest we will be with ourselves and the people.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention to the Minister.  There was one member of this House one time who, if I remember, took particular interest in this matter to which I am about to refer.  He was always anxious, and expressed the desire so often, both in public and in private, that there should be no undue delay in this particular connection.  The man who had this problem so much at heart was none other than the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, when a Minister in this House.  The problem with which he was so much concerned, after housing for our people, was one which, as far as I know, has been finally dealt with in Great Britain recently and is now coming before us, the question of the right of tenancy in ex-servicemen's houses.</P>
    <P>That in itself is of vital importance to some people.  The number may be small but are we to judge that even a small minority must be put at the end of the scale simply because there are other matters to be dealt with?  I am not at this stage accusing the Minister of putting them at the end of the scale but I believe now is the time we can put it in its proper position as regards our programme.  I have heard quite recently of cases where young men whose fathers gave a life-time of service to a certain Power, a Power in which I am not interested, nor is anyone belonging to me, have had to leave these houses.  At any rate, just because their fathers, who had been tenants of these houses, died, or because their mothers died these men have now been told to get out of their houses.  There will be other cases happening such as these.  Cannot we stop them at this stage?  Is it not right&mdash;and I believe every Minister of State under local government should be and would be interested in this&mdash;that every member of the House would be interested in this problem and that it will be dealt with as soon as possible?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> There is another problem with which I have more direct contact.  It was mentioned as far as I am aware, by my colleague, Deputy Michael Keyes, this evening, that is the question of the cottage purchase scheme.  This is not the time to discuss the merits or the demerits of the 1936 Act but considering that an Order was made by Deputy Keyes when Minister for Local Government informing local authorities of their right to offer a better scheme to the tenants of these cottages, I would like to know from the Minister, if the Minister so wishes to inform the House, what the position is as regards the schemes that may have been made by local authorities since last March 12 months when that Order was made.  How many county councils have prepared a new scheme embodying a 50 per cent. reduction and a shorter number of years for purchase?  How many councils have ignored this circular completely?  I do not know.  I should like to know and if they have ignored it I should very much like to be informed why they have ignored it.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned in this House and has been mentioned on many occasions at local authority meetings that the cost of the repair of cottages is so heavy that it would be much more advantageous for the local authorities and for ratepayers as a whole if the tenants of these cottages purchased.  If the local authorities, be they officials or members, or if a Minister for Local Government is interested in having these tenants purchase their cottages, they must ask the question: why is it that these tenants have not availed of the old scheme?  If we get the answer to that, then surely we are entitled to ask why it is, since the local authorities are so anxious to have these cottages purchased, the Minister has not by way of circular reminded these local authorities of their responsibility in offering this advantageous new scheme to the tenants?  The Minister may ask what has happened in my own council in relation to that.  It is not for me to answer that question. I have my own view and I have expressed that view in the council.  It is not incumbent upon me to express that view here.  My activities on local <Col N="411" /> councils are confined to the local councils. My activities in this House are confined to this House.  Believing always in majority rule, I accept the decision of the majority at all times.</P>
    <P>If we have failed to offer the advantages of these cottage-purchase schemes to the prospective tenants of them during the last 12 months, there will be no use in the Minister now telling us that the responsibility in the matter rests solely on the members of local authorities.  During the past four years, to say nothing of the past 12 months, more circulars have issued from the Department of Local Government to local authorities than from any two or three other State Departments together.  We have got circulars on pretty nearly everything.  It might be amusing to quote some of them, but I do not want to waste time now. It would have been more beneficial to the prospective tenants of cottages if one or two circulars had been sent out reminding the local authorities that no schemes had been submitted.</P>
    <P>The present scheme is an improvement on the former one but nevertheless it is not all that we desire.  In asking the tenants to purchase their cottages under the scheme we are not offering them anything very wonderful. We are placing a big responsibility on the tenants of the older cottages. To-day these are ramshackle dwellings. That is neither the fault of the tenants nor of the local authorities.  These cottages were built 60 and 70 years ago. Very often they were built with neither an engineer nor an architect in control of them.  We may be offering some of those dwellings to the tenants of them. Local authorities should be asked now why no schemes have been prepared.</P>
    <P>To some extent I can exonerate the present Minister in connection with the reduction in the moneys provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Why would I not exonerate him? I do not wish to be either personal or vindictive but one must recall the speech made by one member of the then Opposition when this Act was going through.  That member found it convenient to attack individually and collectively everybody who had anything <Col N="412" /> to do with this measure.  The member to whom I am referring is the Deputy who now occupies the position of Minister for Finance.  Considering the attitude adopted by him towards this measure when he was in opposition, it is only natural that that attitude would also be adopted by him when he became a member of the Government and, irrespective of who is Minister for Local Government, that attitude of the present Minister for Finance was bound to influence requests for moneys for the operation of this important measure.</P>
    <P>Many counties have reaped very definite advantages under the operation of the Act.  Even the limited amount that is being provided this year will give certain advantages&mdash;advantages that were never appreciated by the Minister and his colleagues when they were in opposition.  Now that they are in Government again surely they must admit that the results achieved have been justified.  If they are prepared to make that admission, then they are not justified in reducing the amount of money provided this year.  I appeal to the Minister to realise that this reduction is a retrograde step and one which will affect not alone the central Administration but the outlook of managers, officials and members of local authorities since they must realise that the Minister is now nullifying the schemes they put into operation for the benefit of the people in the different areas.</P>
    <P>If we want satisfactory local government we can only have that government by admitting that local authorities and those who administer local government are the proper people to implement a policy.  The sooner we abolish the necessity for seeking sanction for trivial matters that arise in day to day administration the better it will be for ourselves and the better it will be for the people we represent.  When we reach that stage we may find ourselves in the position of not having to try to justify any longer the large sums of money expended annually in wages, salaries and allowances in the central office here in Dublin.  Not for one moment do I say that any official in the Department of Local Government <Col N="413" /> is overpaid, be it the secretary of the Department or the cleaner who is employed there.  I think it is important that these people should enjoy a decent salary or wage, as the case may be.  Local government is of primary importance.  Year by year we see the staffs being increased there.  Members of local authorities, members of this House, have to try to justify to the people in our areas the large amount of expenditure in this Department of State.  That does not apply only to members of one particular Party but to all of us.  We try to explain that all these staffs are essential and to gloss over some of the delays that occur in the Department but we know in our hearts that the top heavy machine will not give the results that are expected.</P>
    <P>While local government has improved to a certain degree since it was instituted, it seems to me that progress is slowing up.  Are we going back to the system of local government that was regarded so favourably by the Minister's colleagues and, as far as I am aware, by his Party, of reducing membership in the councils in various areas to one single unit instead of the system that operates in the area that I represent, of splitting it up and having one member representing a certain area? If such an idea exists in the minds of any members of the Government Party, they must be prepared to admit that local government will be slowed up by central administration.</P>
    <P>Within the last 12 months, Deputy Larkin drew the Minister's attention to a statement made by him in connection with direct labour.  Direct labour certainly justified itself because of the competition it created, effecting reduction in prices, and because of the fact that the work done was of the best and the materials used were of the highest quality.  Members of local authorities who have some little knowledge of the building trade, were able to say in public that not only were the houses that were built by direct labour cheaper but were far better in every way.  Is there a danger that the policy of wiping out direct labour will continue? Are we prepared to revert to the old system of giving all to the few?</P>
    <P>We know what happened to many <Col N="414" /> cases during the emergency.  We know cases where one tender only was submitted. The man or firm that was successful in getting the first scheme, could not tender for the next; it had to be left to one of his colleagues.  A ring was formed.  Members of local authorities were able to compare tenders submitted by contractors for the building of cottages with the cost where direct labour was used.  Competition became keener.  Contractors were able in many cases to reduce their original tenders by a nice tidy sum when the schemes were readvertised. We should be honest enough to admit openly that it was the competition created by direct labour that effected these reductions in prices.</P>
    <P>Who would gain by such reductions? The local authorities, the ratepayers and the incoming tenants would gain. Are they to be denied that advantage by the elimination of competition?  We must insist on competition in our building schemes.  I do not say that one policy should be adopted to the exclusion of the other but that they should both operate in competition with each other.  I would not favour a cartel system that would cut out people outside the cartel but there should be a spirit of friendly rivalry and a system of honest competition.  That system was adopted by the late Deputy Murphy and should be continued.  I fail to understand why competition should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is one important factor governing all these things and that is finance. It is a lamentable fact that as a result of the increase in the bank rate local authorities have greater difficulty in providing sufficient money at a rate which will favour incoming tenants. The Minister may say that this is not the first time the banks increased their rates or were given power.  It is a matter of indifference to me whether or not that has happened in the past. I am interested in trying to devise a system whereby progress can be achieved for the future.  If local authorities have to raise certain loans for houses, sewerage, water and other schemes and at times are unable to avail of State loans and must depend on overdrafts in private banks, it is <Col N="415" /> deplorable that, through a combination of the governors of five or six banks, the local authorities must admit defeat at the hands of these individuals and groups.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th July, 1952.</P>
