      <P>Perhaps, I should on the Money Resolution take the opportunity of explaining what this Bill will cost.  The purpose of the resolution is, of course, to authorise the payment out of the Central Fund of the pensions provided for under the Bill to certain persons who held ministerial office under the First Dáil Éireann or the widows of such persons and the widows of other persons who have subsequently held ministerial office.  The actual cost of these pensions will depend on the number of persons who apply but we estimate that it will not exceed £2,800.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1952&mdash;Committee and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Sections 1, 2 and 3 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the widow of a person who held a qualifying office does not qualify for a pension under the Acts, owing to the insufficiency of that person's pensionable service, she shall be entitled to receive a widow's pension of the same amount as if that person's pensionable service had been three years.</P>
      <P>I think I should say at the beginning that I have considered the cases which were mentioned by Deputy Costello and Deputy Seán Collins on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Bill.  I think I have found it possible to provide for one of the cases mentioned by Deputy Costello and I am introducing an amendment to insert a new section in the Bill in lieu of Section 4.  This new section will provide a pension for the widow &mdash; I want to emphasise it is for the widow &mdash; of an ex-Minister or an ex-Parliamentary Secretary whose pensionable service may have been insufficient to qualify his widow for a pension. That will cover not only the specific case mentioned by Deputy Costello but a number of other cases of the widows of persons who held office, perhaps, in the early days of this State whom I overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not see how I could bring it into the Bill until Deputy Costello set my mind working again.  We, and all Deputies have reason to be grateful to Deputy Costello for drawing this particular matter to my attention.  The section, of course, applies not merely to those who held office in the earlier days but to those who held office subsequently. I think the House as a whole will agree that it is not right that, if a person has held ministerial office or the office of Parliamentary Secretary, his widow should be reduced to complete penury if he should die leaving her unprovided for.  The State owes <Col N="409" /> that obligation to the widow of a person who has undertaken the responsibilities of ministerial office or the office of Parliamentary Secretary, and the new section which I am introducing and which will involve the deletion of Section 4, will make that provision.</P>
    <P>I have also considered with the utmost sympathy the case raised by Deputy Seán Collins, but I find it would not be possible to provide any <i>ex gratia</i> payment in the one case which could be covered, without doing grave violation to one of the fundamental principles of the Bill, which is that, if a person has secured alternative employment or receives remuneration from State funds by reason of such employment, the pension would be, proportionately abated.  The lady concerned in this case has been so employed, largely because we all of us, on both sides, recognised that there was a responsibility, that there had been an oversight and even if the difficulty had not arisen about granting her a formal pension, the pension would not have been payable so long as she held that employment, so that I think the case has been fully covered by the action the Government have already taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was awaiting the amendment to express appreciation on behalf of Deputy Costello of the Minister's action in introducing it.  We assume that the Minister has been advised by his legal advisers that the words &ldquo;owing to the insufficiency of that person's pensionable service&rdquo; cover the fact that it is not so much the insufficiency of the pensionable service as the fact that disqualification arose in another respect.  The Acts, as the Minister is aware, provide for an abatement of ministerial pensions in the event of another pension being payable and I take it the Minister is quite satisfied that the wording covers what we have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the point made by Deputy Sweetman, this does not in any way affect the principle that pensionable service can only be counted once.  I want to make that clear.  To that extent, the widow of the particular ex-Minister involved will <Col N="410" /> suffer a very slight and perhaps rather insignificant loss, but we felt it better to do that in order to make the wider provision.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister approached the subject matter of this Bill.  I made my appeal on the basis that, if it were possible to do it in one specific case, without any breach of principle or the creation of any precedent, I should have liked it to be done.  I accept the Minister's assurance that these difficulties have arisen and that it is now impossible to do it in the way I suggested, but I should like to say, in passing, that should the problem become more acute, it might be possible at a later stage by a specific Supplementary Estimate of some description to cover the position.  I should like the Minister to realise that, if the necessity arises, he will have the complete co-operation of this side in doing anything the Government may think fit.</P>

      <P>We have all dealt with this Bill as the fulfilment of an obligation which I have always felt rested on the State to provide for those who served during that very difficult period from 1919 to 1924.  I cannot undertake to make any <i>ex gratia</i> grant outside the scope of the statute.  If I or any other Minister for Finance did so, life would become just impossible. In the disbursement of public moneys, we have to find ourselves authorised by law to do it and to accept the limitations the law imposes upon us.  I do not think the question would arise &mdash; of course, we would consider cases on their merits &mdash; but I do not want to go further than to say that I or any other Minister would have to take a very strong line against making <i>ex gratia</i> grants.</P>

      <P>On the last day we were discussing amendments Nos. 2 and 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy discussing amendment No. 2 now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was agreed the last day, I think, that the two amendments might be discussed together.  The Minister's amendment arose out of the original amendment that we tabled to <Col N="412" /> the effect that in certain circumstances Saturday should be designated as the half-holiday for agricultural workers. On the Committee Stage the Minister promised to consider the matter and on the Report Stage he introduced an amendment to the effect that Wednesday would be the half-day for these workers in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is as well to get clear on this because the Minister was not apparently too clear the last day as to what we were talking about.  Firstly, the Act lays down that the half-holiday shall be ascertained; that is, the particular day in the week shall be ascertained by agreement between the employer and the worker.  Where that agreement is impossible of achievement the employer shall have the right to determine on what day in the week the worker will take this half-day.</P>
      <P>We submit in our amendment that when agreement is impossible, or is found to be impossible, and when the employer neglects to specify the day, then Saturday shall be designated the half-day.  We regard that as eminently reasonable.  The employers' rights are protected almost to a fault.  In that particular section, at any rate, the employer is guarded in the last particular. If agreement is not found possible the employer has the absolute right to appoint the day upon which the half-day will fall and he can name any day from Monday to Saturday, inclusive.</P>
      <P>What more can we do for the employer?  In all fairness to the agricultural worker we say that there should be a proviso guaranteeing to the worker a specific day and that that day shall be Saturday.  The Minister's amendment is to the effect that Wednesday is a more suitable day.  Arguments have already been adduced here to show that Saturday is a more suitable day.  Common sense indicates that it is the most suitable day for almost any type of worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of a half-day? The reason why agitation developed in the last few years for a half-day for agricultural workers is two-fold.  Its purpose is, first of all, to reduce the working week and give these workers more leisure.  Secondly, its purpose is to enable the agricultural worker to do <Col N="413" /> the same as every other worker in the country does, namely, to go about his own domestic business on Saturday afternoon, to purchase what he requires for the following week, to visit the shops and do anything he wants to do for himself.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers are, like other workers, paid on Friday or Saturday. In most parts they are paid on Saturday morning.  Some of them are paid on Saturday evening where the half-day does not at present operate.  A half-day on Wednesday would, in my opinion, be of no benefit to a man who wanted to avail of his leisure for the normal domestic purposes I have described.  Yet, the Minister sees fit to bring in this amendment.  I am completely at a loss to appreciate his reason for it unless it is that he does not want to accept a very constructive suggestion.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the eventuality in which difficulty might arise is remote unless farmers as a class generally intend to neglect their duties and legal obligations imposed on them.  It is more than likely that it will never be necessary to specify a day in order to implement this section of the Act.  I do not believe there is strong opposition among the farmers to giving a half-day on Saturday but there is a pretence here that there is such opposition.  Even if that is so, the cases in which the section would have to be applied would be relatively few and would not result in any grave hardship to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>One opposition Deputy raised a point which merits consideration by the Minister.  The qualifying period is laid down and the worker must work 45 hours before he is entitled to a half-day.  If Wednesday is designated is it not obvious that the calculation of the qualifying period will be rendered difficult because Sunday will intervene and break up the 45-hour period?</P>
    <P>Does not common sense suggest that Saturday is the most suitable day for a half-day?  If an employer does not want Saturday all he need do is say so and the Act enables him to give a <Col N="414" /> half-day on any day he likes if he cannot get agreement with his worker. What more can the employer want? What more protection can any Government give him?</P>
    <P>Surely some consideration must be given to the agricultural worker and his family in this matter.  In certain parts of the country Wednesday would be of no earthly use because the shops would be shut.  In most small towns, villages and cities custom and tradition have established that the shops remain open on Saturday afternoon and sometimes up to a late hour on Saturday night largely for the convenience of people living in the country.</P>
    <P>No matter what arguments may be advanced in opposition to our amendment, it is based upon common sense. I do not think the Minister can make any case for resisting it.  It is in that light that I put it to the House.  I think that to bring in an amendment for a Wednesday half-day is a puerile effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see why Deputy Dunne and the Labour Party generally are inclined to make such a fuss about this particular amendment.  It is quite clear that if the farmer and the worker agree they can fix any day of the week they like.  If they fail to agree, the farmer can decide on any day of the week that he likes.  It is only when neither of these two things would happen that this amendment would take effect.  I think that the number of cases in which neither the farm worker nor the farmer would agree to fix the day would be very few. That being so, why should the Labour Party seek to make a strong objection to the fixing of the day as Wednesday? I think the Minister has made a concession to Deputy Dunne and to the Labour Party in this amendment.  The original intention of the Bill was that no day at all would be fixed in the event of no agreement or in the event of the employer not fixing the day. Those of us who are engaged in agriculture know that there are very strong reasons why Saturday should be avoided.  Saturday is the eve of Sunday.  If the half-day is given on Saturday it means that the worker is <Col N="415" /> free for a consecutive day and a half and that the farmer is deprived of his assistance during all that time.  No cows have yet been bred which need to be milked only five and a half days per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that the farmer and his wife and family should have no assistance for one and a half consecutive days.  I think it would be dangerous to write Saturday into the Act.  In matters of this kind, there is a tendency to be guided by what is in an Act.  I think that that is really Deputy Dunne's intention in this respect.  He wants, gradually&mdash; slowly but surely &mdash; to force the Saturday half-holiday upon the entire country.  He wants to extend to rural Ireland the same working hours as apply in industrial and commercial life.  He may consider that a desirable ideal to strive for.  He is working towards it in defiance of nature.  He is working towards it in defiance of the well-established fact that the work on a farm must be done day in and day out for seven days of the week no matter what laws we may pass in this House.  If we are to have a break in agricultural employment, I think it should not be a break of one and a half consecutive days but, instead, a day each week &mdash; Sunday &mdash; and a half-day, perhaps somewhere in the middle of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of flexibility in this Bill and that is one of its best features.  There is provision for agreement between the farmer and the <Col N="416" /> worker and that is most desirable. They can agree to have the half-holiday on any day they decide upon, or they can agree not to have it at all and instead to compensate the worker for it.  Further, the employer can fix on the day which he thinks fit. As a last resort, it is provided in the Bill that Wednesday can be fixed as the day.  Deputy Dunne and the Labour Party generally are making a great deal of fuss about nothing.  I think this amendment is a generous concession to the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Labour Party may be inclined to look upon the matter from a different angle from Deputy Cogan.  He thinks that we should be very good boys because a concession is offered to us.  In our opinion, Deputy Cogan has completely evaded the issue.  He mentioned that the Bill is flexible.  It is.  We are not asking that any action be taken against the farmer who, even if he does not reach agreement with his employee, fixes the half-day himself. We have in mind the section &mdash; it may be small but it is there and it would surprise me to hear Deputy Cogan deny that it is there &mdash; who are anxious to take advantage of the provisions of any Act.  In this case, this small percentage of employers might take advantage under the Act not to state what day would be the half-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has not denied that, undoubtedly, Saturday is the best day as a half-day for the employee.  In the event of a refusal by the employer to say that he is willing to give the worker a half-day on any of the five days of the week preceding Saturday, this amendment fixes Wednesday as the half-day.  It should be possible to inform such an employer that Dáil Éireann has passed an Act giving him the right as an employer to fix a certain day of the week as the half-day and that if he is not willing to accept the provisions of the Act then Saturday shall be deemed to be the day on which the half-holiday will operate as, possibly, it is the most suitable day for the employee.  If the employer is not prepared to co-operate with us, why should he ask us to co-operate with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> Deputy Dunne made it clear that this matter will affect only a small percentage of employers.  In my opinion those whom it will affect are in some instances to be found in the South of Ireland &mdash; the largest type of farmer, the rancher type, people who have no sympathy with the ideals or with the people of this country be they the middling-sized farmers or farm workers.  Because those people are of foreign origin, they have no sympathy with the ideals of the people of this country.  I do not see why, like Deputy Cogan, we should bow to them and say: &ldquo;If you are not prepared to give a half-day we ask for Wednesday, the middle day of the week.&rdquo;  In all probability the worker will not have money on Wednesday to go shopping or to do business for his family whereas he would have it on Saturday.</P>
    <P>That is one important fact, because employees in most spheres of life are generally paid at the end of the week and they have to rely on the few pounds which they get to carry them over the week-end.  When the week-end is over, they are again waiting for pay-day at the following week-end and they have practically no money meanwhile. Therefore if the farm worker who happens to be in the employment of the type of individual whom I have described, is to get his half-holiday on the Wednesday it would be of little value to him, relatively speaking, whereas if the employer is willing to fix a day in co-operation with his employee, or even fix a definite day on his own, we believe that there can be, and will be, understanding of that arrangement on the part of the employee and a true sense of co-operation will exist between him and his employer.  Our sole idea in supporting amendment No. 3 is to make sure that in regard to the objectionable types of employer who are scattered here and there throughout the country and who want to take advantage of the law to make things awkward for their employees, we shall have the last say by ensuring that this Bill will be administered from a truly democratic point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to members of the Labour Party, I have been <Col N="418" /> wondering why in the original Bill which they brought in they did not fix Saturday as the half-day for all employees if they are so concerned about the 1 per cent. who, they say, will be affected by this section.  They did not make any effort in that Bill to have Saturday established as the general half-holiday.  They now make the case that it is the ideal day for a half-holiday and they are trying to get it established in respect of this 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, there would be no necessity for this amendment except in cases where the farmer and the worker failed to agree on a day and where the farmer did not himself select a day.  In any event, the law would then be operated against him.  Deputy Dunne will admit that.  There is absolutely no necessity for this amendment or even for the Minister's amendment as the worker is entitled to his legal rights outside these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>You say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You say so, too, and the Bill says it.  If these amendments were not there at all, the law comes into operation in favour of the worker.  I cannot see what the hubbub is about at all.  The question of what is the most suitable day for the half-holiday depends on the type of farm.  Saturday may or may not be suitable for many farmers.  If there is only one man working on the farm Saturday might be a most unsuitable day.  I hope that no organised group will set out to establish one particular day, and that alone, as the day on which the half-holiday is to be taken because the whole machinery of the Bill might then break down and it would not be possible to operate it.  It would be much better to allow the thing to work out itself and no doubt the most suitable day will be agreed upon as between the farmers and the workers themselves. I could put up strong arguments from the point of view of many agricultural workers as to why the last day of the week should not be selected as their half-holiday but I do not propose <Col N="419" /> to do so.  The only reason given by Deputy Dunne for selecting Saturday was that the agricultural worker wanted Saturday as the day on which to spend his money.  That could be argued the other way too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have strong arguments to put up against that.  The Minister has given way to the Labour Party in fixing a particular day of the week for those undesirable types of employer who will not either lead or drive but there is no reason why we should put shackles on farmers generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <P>Deputy Allen has put a reasonable question to the House.  He asks why, if the Labour Party were so keen on having Saturday as the half-day, we did not look for it but he himself supplied the answer to that question.  He pointed out that it would be impossible for every type of farmer to have Saturday as the half-holiday. We, in the Labour Party, realise that.  We know that there are circumstances in which it might be impossible to give the half-holiday on Saturday and we have approached this matter with a view to trying to meet the farming community, in particular dairy farmers, and to give them an opportunity of picking a day that is most suitable in the majority of cases. We have even gone further.  We have agreed that the farmer should have the sole right to pick whatever day is most suitable but in the event of his doing neither one thing nor the other &mdash; fixing a day by agreement with his workers or fixing it by himself&mdash; we suggest that Saturday is the natural half-day.  Deputy Desmond and Deputy Dunne have given their reasons why they believe that it is the natural half-day.  I do not intend to repeat these reasons but I would say that, in computing the number of hours worked, it would be more convenient for the farmer that a clear week should have passed from Monday to Friday so that he would clearly know in his own mind how many hours had been worked and that Saturday would be <Col N="420" /> available for the worker who had worked continuously through that week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the debate but, with all due respect to both sides, this seems to be an argument with very little net issue.  I do not believe that the employers of the type envisaged by Deputy Desmond exist in any great numbers or in any great frequency and I am inclined to ask the Labour Party to give this Bill an opportunity of working and if they find that there is any necessity for such a specific provision as this, then they can look for it later.  I am thinking principally in terms of my own constituency and I could not for once agree that Saturday would be a suitable day for the half-holiday in many cases.  Perhaps Deputy Dunne has experience of a different type of farm but I do feel, looking around my own constituency at the type of small farmer there and the type of small employer that the small farmer is, that the dangers envisaged by Deputy Desmond have not any reality.</P>
      <P>The net issue comes down to this, that a man will get what I concede he is justly and properly entitled to, namely a half-day every week.  If the mechanics of this Bill prove inoperative, then I think it will be infinitely more practicable for Deputy Dunne with his experience of these particular workers, to produce an amendment to the Schedule under which, in conformity with the desire of localities, he will be able to lay down specified half-days in cases where farmers are not operating the Bill.  Even if we accept it that Deputy Cogan represents a certain type of farmer in this House. I think it is fundamentally wrong even to concede that there are men of the eccentricity of mind conceived by him.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if we were to conceive that, I do not believe any man will have a difficulty in solving this half-day problem.  I do not think that our farmers are going to be troublesome about the half-day.  It is true that, once there was a change, their <Col N="421" /> innate conservatism would have objected to it, but once the half-day becomes a reality, I do not think there will be any trouble.  The reasonable relationship that has existed between the farm worker and the farmer, particularly so far as the small farming community are concerned, will, I believe, continue.  The difficulty will not be as real as some Deputies seem to imagine.  I feel that Labour are pressing a point that is of considerable consequence to their supporters.  Let us, however, accept the principle that every man must get the half-day that is in the Bill.  Let us, first of all, see how the mechanics of this Bill will work.</P>
      <P>If, when it is in operation, the fears which have been envisaged by Deputy Dunne and Deputy Desmond are found to exist, then I can tell them that, without fear or favour, they will have my absolute support if they come in with a type of amendment to the Schedule setting out what the half-day should be in particular areas governed by the circumstances in those areas. In the meantime, I suggest that it would be of more service to the people whom the Labour Party represent and to the farming community if we did not engage in any further argument about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the Bill I made no provision for a specified day for the half-day.  I still hold the opinion that there is no necessity for it because there is ample provision in the Bill to ensure that the agricultural worker will get the half-day.  If the farmer refuses to give it, there is a penal clause in the Bill dealing with that.  It has been suggested by the Labour Party that Saturday is the most convenient day for the half-day.  I dispute that, because it is not, even from the point of view of the agricultural workers in many cases.  I do not want to delay the Bill, because I hope it will be passed to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into any argument about this, but let me give an example.  Take the case of a farmer who has two men working for him.  One is a married man and the other a single man.  He makes an arrangement with <Col N="422" /> the married man to give him the half-day on Saturday so that he may be able to go to the local town or village to do his business.  The unmarried, when he discovers that the married man has the half-day on Saturday, looks for it on that day also.  The farmer refuses.  The single man does not agree that he should not get it.  It is for the farmer to select the day.  He selects a day, let it be Wednesday or Tuesday.  The worker does not agree, and the two are left undecided.  The farmer does not want to have a row with his man by saying that he cannot take it.  He does not want to compel him.  It is at that point that the designated day comes in.  Since there is a designated day, there will not be any dispute between the worker and his employer.  We have fixed Wednesday as the designated day.</P>
    <P>Now, if these two workers were to take the half-day on Saturday it would mean a complete disruption of work on that farm.  No work could be carried out because the two men were away.  It is for that reason that I have agreed to name a day, and I think myself that Wednesday is the most suitable day in the country.  There are agricultural workers, particularly unmarried men, who may wish to get away for a day now and again.  They may want to attend a coursing meeting. These meetings are usually held in the middle of the week.  The acceptance of my amendment will give them the opportunity of being able to have a day off in the middle of the week. Deputy Davin mentioned something about men wanting to get to a sports meeting on Saturdays.  I do not know what type of sports meeting he was thinking of, but the kind of games I am interested in are those promoted by the G.A.A., and they are not held on a Saturday.  Maybe Deputy Davin wants agricultural workers to patronise other games.</P>

      <P>When an amendment of this nature was under discussion last week a number of Deputies did not see eye to eye on it, and as a result a certain amount of heat was introduced into the debate.  We came to the point where one side refused to see the point of view expressed by the other. The result was that we actually got nowhere in trying to give effect to our intention of making an improvement in the Bill and in affording protection to those for whom we speak.  Everyone should realise, including the Minister, that it is not for sport that we are moving these amendments, or, as Deputy Cogan might try to show as he does at all times, that we are doing so in any spirit of vindictiveness. We are doing so because of the danger we see of abuses arising and so are facing up to our responsibilities.</P>
      <P>We are determined to see that the Bill is made as watertight as possible against those who, through their legal advisers, may wish to try and find holes in the Bill and, as it were, drive a coach-and-four through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said last week that a 45-hour week before the half-day was all that he would consider.  He was fully entitled to express his opinion and to say that no one would be anxious to evade his responsibility by trying to get out of giving the half-day. According to the Minister's view a man would have to work nine hours a day on five days before he would be entitled to the half-day.  That would open the door, in our opinion, to employers of the type &mdash; and let Deputy Cogan know the type I am speaking of &mdash; who would be quite ready to evade their responsibility of giving the half-day under the section as it stands. <Col N="424" /> If these people pretend that they are giving the half-day on any particular day, they can say to the worker that he is not to work a nine-hour day but an eight-hour day.  That man, therefore, cannot work more than the eight hours fixed by his employer which will mean for the five days a 40-hour week.  These people can avail of such circumstances to avoid giving the half-day to the employee. I know, of course, that many Deputies will be amazed to hear that that could be done.  I know of neighbours of mine who would not do it, but I also know of neighbours who will be very quickly off their mark to do it.  These men who have 600 or 700 acres of land will certainly take the opportunity of getting the opinion of their law adviser and take the advantage of having the worker work, say, an eight-and-a-half-hour day and if the 45-hour week of five days is to remain in the Bill that worker will only be working for eight-and-a-half hours a day making a total of 42½ hours and, therefore, will be denied the advantage of the half-day.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to admit that a large percentage of the employers will not take advantage of this, but are we to have such sympathy for them that, with our eyes wide open, we will allow a Bill to pass which is making it quite clear that those who are in better circumstances than the smallholders and can afford to give the half-day are to be let off scot free?  That is the main issue in this amendment.  In case the Minister or Deputy Cogan may have any doubt about the matter and think that we are narrow-minded and looking for trouble beforehand, they should read the speech of the present Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) when introducing the Second Stage of the Agricultural Wages Bill in 1936. The Minister should not judge this issue on our word alone.  He should peruse the statement made by that Minister at that time.  There is no greater proof of the correctness of the line we are taking in this matter as regards certain people than the statement made by that Minister when he pointed out certain circumstances that prevailed in certain places.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to realise, as <Col N="425" /> we realise, that by making it 42 hours he will not place any undue burden on the majority of the farmers who are prepared to co-operate and with whom we are anxious to co-operate.  This will only protect the right of the worker against the mentality and the superiority complex of some employers in this country.  People of that type are still coming into this country.  We can see from pictures in the papers that they are coming here by air from England with their furniture and their dogs and their horses all brought over in the one day.  Are we to give these people the right to take advantage of a loophole in this Bill?  I ask the Minister to consider the importance of placing the obligation fairly on all such employers in this State, those who are honest and who are willing to co-operate, and those who will not be willing to co-operate if they can avoid giving this half-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage during his speech did Deputy Desmond touch on the real meaning of this amendment. I am surprised that Deputy Desmond would make such statements as he made, statements which are without foundation.  He has condemned the farmers of the country on the ground that they are not giving fair play to their workers.  He mentioned the Agricultural Wages Act of 1936.  Can he tell us how many prosecutions were brought by agricultural labourers under that Act or in how many cases farmers have refused to carry out that Act? He has not cited one case in which a farmer has not honoured his obligations to the agricultural worker.  In effect, what this amendment means is that it will still further reduce the working week.  I have already reduced it from 54 to 50 hours.  The Deputy wants to reduce it further to 47 hours. That is in effect what the amendment means and nothing else.  If he were honest, he would tell the House what was really at the back of his mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned 42 hours as the qualifying period.  I am asking that 45 hours should be the <Col N="426" /> qualifying period and there is nothing unreasonable in that.  In the Deputy's own Bill of 1951 it was 54 hours, but in this Bill it is 50 hours, and this amendment means nothing more or less than to reduce the working week from 50 to 47 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the attitude which the Minister has taken. Either he misunderstands what we are putting forward in this amendment or else I misunderstand him completely. There is no intention of reducing the working week from 54 to 47.  It has been reduced to 50 by the Minister and we are satisfied with that.  The intention of the amendment is to prevent people finding a loophole in the Act and by manipulating the hours on the days preceding the half-day which they have fixed themselves avoiding the giving of any half-day.  I do not think the Minister wishes that the Act should allow people with impunity to defeat what is intended, namely, giving the half-day.  This Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, as respects any particular week, an agricultural worker does not complete 45 hours of work during the five week-days preceding the day on which the half-holiday is to be allowed under this Act, he shall not be entitled to a half-holiday in that week...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All a farmer has to do is to make sure that he will not permit a worker to work the qualifying 45 hours prior to the day he has already selected himself as the half-day and continue to do that so that his employee can never get a half-day.  That is actually why we have put in this amendment.  No Act is placed on the Statute Book to compel the decent law-abiding employer to carry out the wishes of the Government; Acts are put there with the deliberate intention of making it impossible for the man who does not wish to obey the law to avoid being punished and paying the penalty for not carrying out the wishes of the lawful Government of the country.  The Minister seems to have misunderstood our intention or else he is deliberately trying to impute to this Party something <Col N="427" /> which we did not intend.  The Minister, I feel, will learn that if he resists this amendment and insists on the Bill going through as it is, time will show that this legislation will be of no use to the people he intends to help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the merits of the points of view of both sides, the issue between the Minister and the Labour Party seems to be that he purports to say that the Labour Party are endeavouring to reduce the working week to 47 hours while he wants to keep to 50 hours.  It seems to me to be a matter of very ready solution without any further acrimonious speeches.  Could the draft not be very simply amended to continue the operation of the 50-hour week but with a clause providing that any employee who has worked for 42 hours per week qualifies for a half-holiday?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That meets the wishes of both sides without any difficulty. I am not intervening as a kind of mediator between both sides.  What is wrong is that while the views may be fundamentally the same, both sides have gone off on a tangent.  I was not in the House for the Committee Stage when this matter was argued.  I am with the Minister, however, when he wants to ensure a 50-hour week and I am also with the Labour Party when they want to ensure that there will be no juggling with hours even though the amendment might affect only one or two individuals in the whole country who might wish to do so so as to be able on a legal technicality to refuse a half-holiday. I would suggest a simple legal compromise embodying the Minister's belief in the 50-hour week and at the same time laying down a minimum of 42 hours which will entitle the man to claim his half-day.  If that is done I think that the Bill will be improved.  It will do away for ever with what may be regarded as the justifiable fear of the Labour Party who are, I would say, making a plea in all sincerity on behalf of the agricultural workers and it will keep the Minister who is the protector of all <Col N="428" /> sections in agriculture right too.  I would press the Minister in this way: If, where legislation like this is concerned, the House can get into the mood of hearing the concerted opinions of all sides and choosing the best one, we will do something of benefit to the agricultural community and avoid the things that occur in debate which should not occur.  They may occur unconsciously when an argument becomes acrimonious and the representatives of the farm labourers may be put in the position of being seemingly in opposition to the farmers.  I do not think that it is fair to the workers represented by the Labour Party or to the farmers for whom the Minister is advocating to put them in that position, when both sides are in fact actuated by the genuine motive of trying to do their best in the situation. I put it to the Minister that he should accept in the spirit which existed earlier in the morning a fair compromise which will provide that if the worker works a minimum of 42 hours he will get his half-day and will ensure also that he cannot by working 42 hours avoid his responsibility to give a 50-hour week in return for the wages laid down.</P>
      <P>It is a simple matter of technique. The Minister has in many ways been eminently reasonable particularly in the view he took when he had difficulties with the Costings Commission and in the way in which he tried to get that body back to its task.  I do not think that it would serve any useful purpose for either the Labour Party or the Minister to have acrimonious disputes when it is a question merely of framing a technique whereby the Minister can have the assurance of the 50-hour week and whereby at the same time the fear can be erased from the minds of the Labour Party that any juggling with hours or making one day an eight-and-a-half-hour day could defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the effort which Deputy Collins has made to adjust this matter but I think, if I am not mistaken, that the proviso already exists in the Agricultural Wages Bill. The main fear of the Labour Party, so far as I could ascertain, was that <Col N="429" /> some utterly malicious employer would seek to evade his obligations under the Bill by cutting down deliberately on the working hours of the worker five days prior to the half-holiday.  If any employer wants to do that I think that you cannot prevent him.  The employer can always send the man home for one day of the week or if it happens to be raining dispense with his services.  In that way the period of 45 hours is broken and the man is deprived of his half-day.  I do not think however that that is a condition which is likely to arise except on very rare occasions and for a very short period.  If you had a relationship like that between the employer and the worker they would very soon part altogether.  It would be better to leave the Bill as it is and see how it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept Deputy Collins's suggestion. Already the Agricultural Wages Board have authority to fix wages per week and per hour.  If any farmer intends juggling with hours there is a fixed hourly wage for the worker and it is at a higher rate, I understand, than the weekly wage.  Therefore, instead of working weekly, the worker starts in on an hourly basis.  I agree with Deputy Cogan, because it has never appeared to me, anyway, that there should be any necessity for an amendment such as this because a question like that never arises in the case of any farmer I know in my county or in the adjoining counties. There are times of the year, for instance, when the agricultural worker will not qualify but that will not defeat the ends of the Bill.  It has been happening for years.  You have the Wages Bill.  The worker might not work in December for a 54-hour week, and yet get his wage.  It is nonsense for people to say that the majority of farmers are determined to rob the worker of his rights.</P>

That position has been clearly explained to him by Deputy Kyne and notwithstanding what Deputy Kyne has said he still refuses to accept the explanation.

      <P>It was explained by Deputy Dunne and by other speakers in this group during previous discussions that the sole aim of putting forward these amendments was to make <Col N="431" /> the Bill watertight.  We were anxious to get agreement with the Minister on that so as to save the Minister and the officials of his Department, in the administration of this measure, from having to come up against innumerable complaints, and so as to save agricultural labourers from dismissal.  I would ask the Minister to realise that when Deputy Dunne, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Desmond, in particular, speak in the House on matters of this kind, they are speaking from painful experience of what has happened in their own areas in the past.  These experiences are not unknown to the Minister.  We are anxious to secure unity and harmony in the House in the passage through its final stages of this agreed measure, if that is possible, so that the cranky and the very bad type of farmers &mdash; and they are in the minority; they do not exceed 5 per cent. &mdash; will not be able to evade their responsibility; and so that every farmer will understand his obligations and every agricultural labourer will understand his rights.</P>
      <P>Does not the Minister know perfectly well &mdash; if he does not know, he is not in touch with the officers and officials of the Agricultural Wages Board &mdash; that many agricultural labourers have been dismissed by the big type of employers in this country for claiming their rights?  Have not such complaints been made to the officials of his own Department?  In most cases the officials in his Department have no power to deal with the people who inflict such punishment on the citizens of this State who look for their constitutional and legal rights.  The Minister has taken, to my surprise, a provocative line on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Minister has not lost his memory and knows perfectly well that he did not vote for the principle of the half-holiday on the Second Reading of the Bill introduced by the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>It seems absolutely useless to go on with this because members are coming into this House who were not here when the matter was discussed.  Whether they are for or against the amendment is immaterial to me.  They are entitled to their views whether they are individual or Party views.  It is not very helpful to have members who have no knowledge of what has been said coming into the House at the end of the discussion.  I am not speaking of one particular person; I am speaking of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this amendment the Minister said that the words used by us were not <Col N="438" /> honest.  I do not mind what he says. He used other lines of argument.  He challenged the mover of this amendment, that is myself, to produce cases where farmers had not carried out another Act.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House on this amendment discussing another Act, but if the records are compared as to the number of complaints made by him and the number made by me under the Act of 1936, the Minister will find that the number of my reports exceeded his.</P>
    <P>I treat with the contempt it deserves what the Minister said in his first speech on this amendment.  He made it quite clear again that he is not anxious for and that he is not willing to give co-operation on this amendment. Co-operation is undoubtedly refused in spite of the suggestion of Deputy Seán Collins, which would have met our point and, I believe, would also have met the Minister's point.  It was a suggestion by a neutral for the purpose of an agreement between two warring parties.  If that suggestion has not been accepted by the Minister, let me say for the record, that the members of the Labour Party were quite willing to accept that suggestion, as it would have gone a certain way to meet the problems that we are faced with, problems that the Minister evaded in his attack on this amendment.  We wish completely to ignore his personal attack.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion that we are not anxious to get this Bill through, the Deputies who made that suggestion should understand that we had no say in ordering business yesterday evening. We did not question the order.  We left it to the various Ministers concerned to fit in the business at this stage.  If this business was not ordered yesterday, the Minister or any member of the Government will not blame us for that.  We do not deserve to be attacked for that.  Deputies know quite well that we are not holding this matter up.  As Deputy Collins's suggestion is not being carried out, we will not force the amendment to a vote against a machine, but we ask that the names of those of us here be recorded as dissenting against the Minister's line in this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 7, to add at the end of line 21 the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;if, but only if the worker has been paid in respect of such Church holiday or public holiday or day's absence from work during that week.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is another matter on which we had a long discussion on the Committee Stage.  In moving this amendment we are trying to make it clear to the Minister that the views expressed by us and by members of his own Party a week ago would be met by the acceptance of this amendment and that is why we ask that it be passed.  The Minister made it clear that in his view, if a Church holiday came in a week preceding the giving of a half-day, the farm worker had a full day off at no loss to himself and therefore should not have a half-day.  It is well for the Minister to know we did not ask otherwise. We still agree that in a week where a Church holiday happens to come, if the worker is away from work on that day and is paid for that day, he should not be entitled to a half-day as well.  But in our opinion and in the opinion of members of the Minister's Party, where the worker is entitled to a half-day, but on one of the five days preceding that day the Church holiday comes and where the worker is not paid for that Church holiday and, because of the custom in many parts of rural Ireland where workers realise that it is not right or proper to work on a Church holiday, the worker, who has been at the disadvantage of being out of work and not being paid for the day, should get his usual half-day with pay.  I do not see anything wrong with that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Furthermore, under Section 7, as well as it being mentioned about the case of the Church holiday or public holiday, it is well for the Minister to read the last two lines of that section where it is mentioned that if the worker is away or is otherwise absent from work he shall not be entitled to a half-day in that week. Has the Minister now any suggestions to make to try and justify the claim that he made on the Committee Stage, as against members of his own Party &mdash; to whom he openly gave credit for the views we expressed on this particular issue?  Is the Minister still going to say that where the Church holiday comes in and where the worker is off through the system operating in the locality and where the worker is denied any remuneration for that day, he is also to be denied the right of a half-day in that week?</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into this in much more detail.  It has been thrashed out already.  In view of the fact that we had pleading by members opposite, including Deputy Corry, to whom we openly gave credit in this House last week, in view of the statements made by him and in view of the common-sense approach by Deputies who could see certain disadvantages under Section 7, I would ask the Minister again to accept the amendment here.  It clearly states that if the worker has been paid in respect of such Church holiday or public day or day of absence, he is not to be entitled to the half-day, but in the event of his being away from work on such a day at his own financial loss he should not be deprived of the right to his normal half-day in such a week.</P>

Deputy Desmond did not give me credit for taking the workers' viewpoint on this particular issue.  I agree with the general principle that where a worker is not paid for a day off he is entitled to his half-holiday.  I do not know whether this amendment covers the point fully or not, or whether or not it may create other difficulties, but I would like to say that I am in favour of the general principle of it.</P>

      <P>The net issue here covers only one point, where for reasons of conscience or local circumstances, a man does not work during the Church holiday.  As the Bill stands at present, he could be deprived of a normal half-day.  I was not in for the discussion during the Committee Stage, but I understand it was fairly acrimonious and that, despite the acceptance by certain Deputies on the other side of the House of the principle, when the bell rang for the division they trooped in the usual direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy did it I will express my appreciation of his being able for once to make up his mind correctly about something.  This is not a question for acrimony.  It is a question of a net issue.  I will put this point of view to the Minister.  Where, in circumstances over which he has no control, a labourer may be in the situation that he cannot work on a Church holiday &mdash; his employer may be of such a type or persuasion that he does not accept the position that is generally accepted in rural Ireland with regard to a Church holiday &mdash; I do not think that the fact that he has not <Col N="442" /> worked a day without pay should militate against him getting the normal half-day with pay.  This is only a small point and operates in respect of a very limited number of cases.</P>
      <P>If the Minister analyses the matter fairly he will see that there is a point in this amendment whether or not the actual drafting of the amendment covers it specifically.  I would suggest, whether he accepts this amendment or does something about it on his own initiative, that the Minister should amend the Bill to ensure that, where through no conscious fault of the workers themselves this difficulty arises, they would not be victimised by virtue of being laid off for a day and not get paid for it and that they could get their half-day with pay.  I do not think there is any need for heat or anything else.  It is purely a net issue and if the Minister considered it in that spirit there would not be any difficulty about his finding some way of sealing the Bill against what might be an injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this section on the Committee Stage last day, I thought we had finished with it but the matter has been raised again. We have exactly the same argument put forward to-day as the last day.  As I pointed out, this Bill has nothing to do with wages.  This is a Bill dealing with a half-holiday for agricultural workers.  If a question of wages is raised it is for the Agricultural Wages Board to deal with it.  Under this Bill, it will be necessary for the Agricultural Wages Board to go into the question of wages.</P>
      <P>The agricultural workers' wages are based on a 54-hour week.  In future, I presume, they will be based on a 50-hour week.  This question of Church holidays or public holidays must be taken into consideration if work is done on those days in assessing the wage for the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on the last day, there are parts of the country where you have certain systems in operation. For instance, in some areas men work on public holidays and bank holidays and are paid for it.  In other areas work is carried on on Church holidays and payment is made.  In other areas <Col N="443" /> no work is carried on on Church holidays. What is proposed in the Bill is that in a week where a half-holiday falls on a Church holiday, a public holiday or on a holiday which would be regarded as one of the annual holidays of the worker, no half-holiday be granted.  That is all that is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no reference whatsoever to the payment of wages for any day in that particular week or for the half-day. That is beside the question altogether and has nothing to do with it.  It has been introduced here by Deputies and I think there has been great confusion in the minds of many Deputies regarding this matter.  This has nothing whatsoever to do with wages.  It is no concern of the Bill whether there is payment for a day or not.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the granting of the half-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>Suppose there is an agreement between a farmer and his man for a half-holiday on a Wednesday or a Thursday and that on the morning of that day the man, because of illness or through some other reason, is unable to go to work, does the Minister suggest that the Bill has no bearing on the fact that a man is entitled to a half-day's wages for that day because it is his recognised half-day?  The Minister must admit that if there is not payment for a holiday or a half-day the whole thing is meaningless.</P>

Where a holiday is not a holiday from the labourer's point of view &mdash; the Minister knows what I mean &mdash; and where it is enforced on him by circumstances of conscience and where, in fact, there is no question of payment is it the position under this Bill that he could, by virtue of having to take a day off without pay, be legitimately entitled to a half-day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not be legitimately entitled to the half-day.  He does not qualify according to the number of hours worked.  This matter can also be looked at from the opposite side.  I can also visualise an employee staying at home on a day he is badly needed on the farm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In regard to Deputy Collins's point, if the man does not work on a particular day during the week he does not qualify for a half-day because he has not worked the 45 hours to qualify him. Deputy Hickey stated that the man might have to stay home for some reason but that case is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought not to accuse me of saying that.  I am putting the matter plainly.  If there is an agreement for the man to work on a Wednesday and if on that particular day he is not able to come to work, having worked the rest of the week, he is not entitled to be paid for that half-day?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He is already qualified in that case.  There is no provision in the Bill and that is a matter that must be determined by the Agricultural Wages Board because the new wages are based on a 50 hour week and not a 54 hour week, as in the past.  Provisions will be made for the half-day.  They will be made where there is mutual agreement between the employer and the employee. Deputy Hickey has raised the question whether the worker will be paid for the first part of the day on which he is entitled to a half-day.  I take it that the Agricultural Wages Board will still operate the two systems in existence at present.  One is a weekly wage in future based on a 50 hour week and the other, an hourly wage, <Col N="446" /> so that provision is made for the payment for the number of hours an employee works in that week and he is losing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If, through no fault of his own, a man is denied the right to work a certain number of hours, is that to militate against the total number of hours that would normally entitle him to qualify for his half-day? The net point is whether the Minister will make provision, in cases in which that limited circumstance arises, that if a man is not paid for a Church holiday and does not work for reasons of conscience or any other reason, that will not militate against his qualification for a half-holiday.  That is the point that interests me and it is the point on which I am completely <i>ad idem</i> with the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot cover that in the Bill because that is a matter for the Agricultural Wages Board.  It is a matter of the fixing of a wage and this has nothing to do with it.  I can deal only with holidays and not with wages.  What the Deputy is asking is that I should determine payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister has not followed me.  There is one specific case where a Church holiday arises and where the number of hours, through no fault of the labourer himself, cannot be credited to him for that week.  It is a specific exclusion and I suggest that the Minister can put in a simple provision to cover the position where this arises, so that that day will be counted for the purpose of qualification as if it had been worked.</P>

I am giving him credit for it in this instance, as I would be prepared to give it to any Deputy, irrespective of what side of the House he sits on.

      <P>I claim your protection against this ministerial type of interruption, friendly or otherwise.  On the Second Reading of this measure we indicated quite clearly, which is not perhaps the usual procedure, the type of amendments we thought desirable in order to make the Bill introduced by the Minister a better Bill than it appeared to be.  Apparently, I am a very innocent type of Deputy and I misunderstood the Minister, though I thought I knew him fairly well.  The Minister, when concluding the debate on the Second Reading, brushed all amendments aside.  He had not read them.  He obviously did not understand what they were about.  He said they were a waste of time.  He claimed we should agree to pass the Bill in all its stages on that day.</P>
      <P>I did not think, when the Minister came to deal with the amendments on the Committee Stage &mdash; and I presume that he had the advice of his departmental officials &mdash; that he would take the very provocative line he adopted on that stage.  If he had adopted a reasonable attitude and met our wish that this should be an agreed measure and if he had related his attitude to that appeal this Bill would have passed through its final stages long before now.  On the first day the Minister brushed all the amendments aside and said the Bill was a perfect one. Has it not been improved now after lengthy consideration?</P>

An agreed measure is much easier to administer.</P>

    <P>The agricultural workers are being asked to believe that Fianna Fáil is giving them these legal rights.  The agricultural labourers are not by any <Col N="450" /> means stupid.

      <P>Deputy Cogan can have all the credit he wants but the Minister must admit on this Final Stage that after an unnecessarily lengthy period in Committee we have hammered a bit of sense and reasonableness into his hard head.  The Minister has a good heart and I believe he faced up to this Bill in a good-hearted way.  Unfortunately, he was not able to work what he intended from his heart into his head and we had to spend about six hours on the Committee Stage, with the goodwill, co-operation and assistance of Deputy Cogan, Deputy S. Collins, Deputy Corry and Deputy McGrath&mdash; by means of his laughter &mdash; getting the Minister to improve the Bill.  The Minister has promised that he will improve another section of the Bill, and we are letting him have the Bill in its Final Stage on the understanding that he will make that improvement when the Bill comes before the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Recently I was reading through some Dáil debates dealing with an effort made here some years ago to introduce a Bill to give farm labourers a weekly half-holiday during the period when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office.  The Bill was introduced by the Labour Party.  It was defeated by an overwhelming vote of the House.  During the lifetime of the inter-Party Government I recall having had discussions with the then Minister for Agriculture, who did not believe, and expressed to me his disbelief, that one could get through this House a Bill which would give to agricultural <Col N="451" /> workers a weekly half-holiday. I recall, too, the fact that when our Party introduced the Bill in 1950, the Bill passed through the House by accident because of a tactical error on the part of the then Fianna Fáil Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite correct.  Of course, that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As it happened, we secured for the first time recognition of the principle that farm labourers are human beings and are just as much entitled to a half-holiday per week as is any other worker.  During the 18 months or two years which have passed since the passing of that Act certain difficulties have appeared, manufactured difficulties, largely because of propaganda and sabotage by people who never wanted to see agricultural workers get a half-holiday.  These difficulties were capitalised and we now have the present Minister putting this measure through.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the maximum protection for agricultural employers and the minimum guarantee of a half-holiday for agricultural labourers.  That is the sum total of it.  It is, however, a step in the right direction and our attitude to it is not an unwelcoming one.  We believe we are moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Anyone who faces the issue clearly must admit that this Bill would never have seen the light of day and farm workers would never have got a half-holiday were it not for the fact that the Labour Party has been pushing this principle, not merely during the last two or three years but during the whole of its existence, in order to secure this very simple amenity for farm labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expressions of opinion to which we have listened here on the Committee <Col N="452" /> and Report Stages are ample evidence that if the issue were left to the tender mercies of some Deputies &mdash; I instance in this respect Deputy Cogan and bracket with him the present Minister &mdash; the farm workers would never, in their lifetime, have got a half-holiday. These Deputies have been forced and jockeyed into the position, however, that they must now accept this principle. This Bill represents the culmination of a struggle, not on my part alone, but on the part of those who have gone before me.  In that connection I mention in particular the name of James Larkin, a name well known to agricultural workers, not only in County Dublin, but throughout the country. It was James Larkin who struggled and fought to establish for farm labourers, who were at the lowest level of the social scale, certain minimum standards of existence, and it is in acknowledgment of the work he did that we welcome this small step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I would not intervene in this debate were it not for the remarks of the last speaker.  It is well known that the inter-Party Government, during its period in office, introduced a Private Members' Bill for the purpose of giving a half-holiday to agricultural workers.  When the then Minister for Agriculture refused to accept responsibility for that Bill, the Fianna Fáil Party refrained from voting on the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>A Committee of the House was set up.  Seven members of the Fianna Fáil Party acted on that committee.  The committee approved of the Bill.  They improved it considerably. One of the representatives of Fine Gael on the committee &mdash; Deputy Sweetman &mdash; tabled amendments on the Report Stage of that Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture of that Government and the Minister for Education of that Government went into the Lobby and voted against the agricultural workers' weekly half-holiday.  That can be verified by Deputy Dunne, Deputy Davin or any other Deputy who wishes to look up the records.  They are the people <Col N="453" /> they were supporting at that particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Bill is about to pass in this kind of atmosphere.  I think it redounds to the credit of anybody in this House who has taken the view that they would like to put a minimum floor under the standard of the agricultural worker.  At all times, and irrespective of what Party I belonged to, I have felt that kinship with the agricultural worker that is inevitable in the son of a small farmer.  I do not think we are doing justice to ourselves or, indeed, justice to the farmers or to the agricultural workers by making this Bill in its Final Stage the subject of a good deal of bickering.  Nobody <Col N="454" /> will be able to assess the merits of effort made on behalf of a section of the community as quickly as the people who are affected.  I am not for a momnet going to enter into the niceties of what people did or why they did it.  I have at all times been an avowed supporter of the principle of establishing a half-holiday for the farm labourer since the stage when Deputy Dunne first introduced it.  I did that in an inter-Party day when we were allowed to exercise our own judgment and our own conscience in the matter.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I would say without hesitation that I accepted that principle as a guiding principle and as a basis on which we should work.  But let me say this.  At all times I was anxious to preserve &mdash; and I am making my speech at this stage in a sincere effort to continue to preserve it &mdash; the relationship that, in the main, has always existed between the farmer and his man.  That relationship may have its exceptions and it may well be that there were cases of acute victimisation and extreme difficulty &mdash; cases to the knowledge of people sitting in this House &mdash; but the general situation, and particularly in relation to the stock from which I have sprung myself, the small farming community in this country, is that there has always existed a tremendous camaraderie between the farmer and his men.  It was there before half-holidays were envisaged. I have seen it and I am sure the Minister has seen it.  We all know that the farmers have been very reasonable with their men in the matter of giving them time off.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes it a legal certainty that the agricultural labourer is entitled to his half-holiday.  As a keystone in statute law, it is a very valuable contribution.  It would be unfair of me not to say that where the farmers of the constituency of West Cork, which I have the honour to represent, are concerned, and I am sure it applies generally, I think there was always a spirit there and an arrangement between the farmer and his men which this Bill will do nothing to improve. Certainly it will do nothing to hinder it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> I think we should let this Bill go through in the spirit that we are trying to make an irreducible minimum for people worthy of the best consideration of this House.  If we are going to view in a realistic way the basic economy of this country it ultimately redounds to the farmer and his labourer if the economy is sound.  Taking it in that spirit, it ill behoves us to make extravagant claims or to make artificial differences between these two sections.  I have a feeling that, while legislation is necessary for protection, in the main this legislation is for the purpose of getting after people who have abused privileges or people who have not exercised what was normal human charity and decency in relation to their employees.  I assert fearlessly that that was the exception rather than the rule in the agricultural community of this country.  As such, I welcome this Bill and its passage to ensure that the wrong type of employer will effectively be brought to book.</P>
    <P>I want the Bill to go through with my acknowledgment of a grand spirit that I have known to exist heretofore between the farmer and the labourer. I hope that no remarks, heated, ill-advised or ill-judged, that may have been made at stages of this Bill will in any way affect that spirit in a deteriorating manner because that union and that co-operation not only brought us where we are to-day but it was the strength and co-operation and co-ordination, in the main, of that section that gave us the very right now to legislate any minimum standards for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right that this House should pay a tribute to the Minister for putting this Bill through the House.  I think it is a good thing that a Bill which will confer such an immense benefit upon the agricultural workers should be sponsored and put through this House by a practical farmer and an employer of agricultural labour.  I think that that makes for unity, goodwill and harmony between those two great sections of the community. I only regret that, at this stage of the Bill, the Labour Party did not more graciously acknowledge the <Col N="456" /> service which the Minister has rendered. There is always a desire, I suppose, on the part of the Labour Party to gain what political kudos they can in a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I should like to see a fair and just appraisal of the stand taken by all Parties and of the stand taken by Independent Deputies.  I took a stand against the original Bill, as introduced by the Labour Party.  It was a bad Bill.  It sought to enforce the compulsory closing down of work on the farms for a half-day each week.  This Bill does nothing of the kind.  This Bill provides that, where the farmer and worker agree, the worker can get additional wages in lieu of a holiday.  I think many workers will find that that is much more advantageous to them in these days than a shortening of their working hours.  It was on that point that I opposed, and rightly opposed, the original Bill and it was because that issue was removed on the Committee Stage that I stated that I would not force the Bill to a division.  I regret that the Fine Gael Party forced a division on the Fifth Stage against my wishes and after I had announced my intention not to challenge a division.  I, of course, had then no alternative to voting against that Bill but I made it quite clear that there would be no division on the Fifth Stage if I had my way.  Deputy Sweetman in his desire to crush the Labour Party, his allies in the inter-Party Government, forced the matter to a division.  It is no wonder that Deputy Larkin said that the Fine Gael Party worked in broad day-light and in the dead of night, to undermine and destroy the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Davin will allow me to continue instead of laughing as he does.  I think Deputy Davin should brush up his ideas in regard to agriculture.  He was one of the pioneers of the great flight from the land.  I think it is 50, 60 or perhaps 70 years since he fled from the land, and he does not seem to have been in touch with agriculture since.  He seems to think that the only gentlemen in rural Ireland are the men who wear riding breeches and follow the hunt.  I hold that the real gentlemen in agriculture are the men with nailed boots, the working farmers who &ldquo;snag&rdquo; turnips side-by-side with their workers in the field.  These are the real gentlemen.</P>

      <P>I belong to the latter class &mdash; to the working farmers.  My people for generations have farmed in Wicklow, in South Kildare and in Carlow, and we have been always proud to regard ourselves as working farmers.  If Deputy Davin would like to make inquiries into that matter, he will find that it is true.  I think it is a good thing that we have had a certain amount of good humour in the debate on this Bill.  It is going to impose a <Col N="458" /> fairly hefty burden on farmer employers. Farmer employers recognise that this House is imposing a fairly substantial burden on them but, since it is a law enacted by an Irish Parliament in a free Ireland, the farmers are patriotic enough to accept it and to work it to the best of their ability, in unity and in harmony with their employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister not alone on his honesty and courage in introducing a Bill of this kind but on having successfully piloted it through the House.  It is, as Deputy Collins said, rather unfortunate that some incorrect statements were made in the course of the debate which will not lend themselves to the better working of the Bill. Fianna Fáil is not to get any credit, according to the Labour Party.  That is very obvious.  Let me remind them, however, that it was Fianna Fáil who helped the agricultural worker to achieve any step forward that he has achieved in this country.  Some of us are old enough to remember the bad days, the bad wages and the bad conditions which prevailed prior to the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government. These days have gone.  We have now advanced a further step forward in improving the conditions of what I consider, not alone the most deserving section of the community, but the best entitled to any concessions that this House can give them &mdash; namely the agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt has been made to suggest that when Deputy Dunne introduced his Bill on a previous occasion, Fianna Fáil did not support it.  Fianna Fáil abstained from voting on that occasion because of a fundamental principle which was involved &mdash; that we believed, still believe, and always will believe, that it is the duty of a Government to accept full responsibility for a measure of this kind.  The previous Government were not prepared to accept such responsibility and left the measure to a free vote of the House. That is why Fianna Fáil abstained. When the Government after that vote of the House decided to accept the Bill, Fianna Fáil sent its nominees to the Select Committee of 15 and I think <Col N="459" /> everybody will agree that their contribution to the labours of that committee was as helpful as that of anybody else.  We are not seeking credit for doing more than anybody else.  The Labour Party are entitled to credit for any suggestions they make in regard to that Bill, but I think they will have to agree that, were it not for the advent of Fianna Fáil to power again, they would be barking up the wrong tree for the next 100 years and they would probably never get a measure of this kind through the House.</P>
    <P>I want to get it out of the minds of some people in this House that Fianna Fáil were in any way responsible for even the slightest damper on any Bill of this kind.  I believe that the last Bill which became an Act was sabotaged.  It led to a considerable amount of trouble in the country.  It led to a number of court cases and decisions were arrived at but it was not an Act that could be described as a sound measure.</P>
    <P>Now, the agricultural worker can be certain that he is going to get his half-holiday, and there can be no doubt either in the mind of the farmer or his employee that the latter is entitled to it.  The half-holiday will, in the near future, be a legal instrument.  I sincerely hope that the good spirit obtaining between the working farmers and their employees will continue. It is hardly necessary to refer to the class that used to be termed &ldquo;gentlemen farmers&rdquo; because they do not employ anyone.  I sincerely hope, regardless of what has been said by those who may be trying to get political kudos from the passing of this Bill, that the good spirit which has always obtained between our working farmers and their workers will continue. Some people have argued that, as a result of giving this half-day, we are going to have less production.  I do not share that view at all.  I believe that, on the passing of this Bill, we will have if that is possible, an even better spirit in the country, and that there will be more production, because the one thing that is needed for the salvation of the country, economically, is more production.</P>

Everyone knows quite well that this Bill would never have been introduced if it were not for the continued agitation of the Labour Party.  Whatever congratulations may go to any other side of the House for it, it must be conceded that the Labour Party are responsible for it. As a member of another Party, I want to pay the tribute that is due to the Labour Party for the successful fight they have made in bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion on behalf of the agricultural workers.  I should like to pay a special tribute to the agricultural workers' direct representative in this House, Deputy Seán Dunne.</P>
      <P>The Bill would have been passed long ago if it were not for the fact that it has taken a considerable time to educate the Minister as to what a half-holiday is.  I hope, now that we are on the concluding stage of the Bill, the Minister will be able to see the difference between a half-holiday with pay and a half-holiday without pay.  I hope that when the Minister himself gives the half-holiday to his own employees it will not be at their expense but at his.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister has paid such a tribute to the agricultural workers, I should like to have it borne in mind that the Fine Gael Party have given every assistance and help to the Minister in getting this Bill passed speedily through the House. The members of the Fine Gael Party have as much regard for the plight of the agricultural workers as the members of the Labour Party or the members of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Fine Gael Party has always given sympathetic consideration to the reasonable demands of these workers. We have shown that by our attitude this morning in the manner in which we supported the passage of this Bill. The members of the Fine Gael Party are with the workers in the just demands they have made for this half-holiday. Now that the Minister has assisted the agricultural workers in getting this half-holiday, I hope he will lose no time in giving increased prices for wheat, oats, beet and barley to enable the farmers to be able to pay their men.</P>

I have experience of what he did in the past in connection with the Bill that he introduced, and I know how capable he can be when he introduces such a measure.  I should like to challenge him on the question of our contribution to the 1950 Bill.

They have held it up, and if it were not for the generosity of Deputy S. Collins this Bill would be coming before the House next week.  I would like to remind Deputy Flanagan of that.  Deputy S. Collins was generous in giving us the time to discuss it, and of having it passed through the House to-day.  Now, we can have the Bill before Christmas.

      <P>If I introduced this Bill at any time sooner than I did, Deputy Dunne and Deputy Davin would have told the House and the country that their Bill did not get an opportunity and that it was a much better Bill than mine.  I gave that Bill every opportunity to prove a failure, and it has proved a failure. However, getting away from that, I hope this Bill when it becomes an Act will be a success.  It was in that spirit that I brought it in.  It was in that spirit that I acted on the Select Committee on the 1950 Bill.  Deputy Cogan also acted on that committee. When we of the Fianna Fáil Party went in to work on that Bill we believed that we were helping, and we did help as much as we possibly could.  If there is a record of the discussion of that Bill when in committee, and I suppose there is, it will be found that our contributions were constructive, and they were meant to be constructive in order to make that Bill workable.  It was not <Col N="464" /> our fault that it was found not to be workable.  I suppose enough has been said about that already, but we can always pinpoint the cause of its not being workable.</P>
      <P>This Bill has the unanimous backing of the House on its Final Stage.  I should like to point out &mdash; I have not already gone into this matter &mdash; that unless it has the co-operation of our farmers and agricultural workers it will not be workable either.  We must have co-operation from those on the land in order to make matters of this kind workable.  If you have compulsion on one side or the other you defeat your own ends.  I believe that this Bill, even as I brought it in and without any amendment, would have had the co-operation of the farm workers and the farmers and would have been a success.</P>
      <P>In the past, when there was no legislative provision for a half-day for agricultural workers, there was always give and take, although I have not heard it mentioned by some of the Labour representatives, in the agricultural community.  No agricultural labourer was ever denied the right of having a day off, and it is wrong for Deputy Dunne to say that the farmer tried to deny him that right.  He had that right.  I know that and I have as much personal experience of the agricultural workers as Deputy Dunne or Deputy Davin and probably more. I have known them for a longer period, I have been in their company and travelled with them for a longer period than either of the Deputies. I also know the difficulties of the farmers.  For that reason I believe that the Bill as introduced by me would have been accepted by both the workers and the farmers.  I hope now as a result of the unanimity we have had to-day that this Bill will be a success and that it will give to the agricultural workers the right that is enjoyed by other workers who are not half so deserving of it.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Maintenance of Main and Trunk Roads&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all main and trunk roads should be maintained from State funds, as local authorities find it impossible to maintain them with present State aid; and that, as turf producing counties have increased road traffic, and should have increased road grants for county roads, the Government should formulate a scheme for the provision of special road grants to all county councils who are engaged in turf production.&mdash; (Deputy O. Flanagan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Minister will say something interesting before this debate concludes and, consequently, I will not deprive him of whatever reasonable time he requires for that purpose.  This motion falls into two parts.  It is certainly 25 or 30 years ago since I, in conjunction with the leader of the Labour Party at the time, advocated what is contained in the first portion of this motion.  A revolutionary change, however, has taken place in the meantime in regard to the whole transport and traffic problems of this country.  I suggest to the Minister, and perhaps it is not the first time it was suggested to him, that the demand made in the motion can be directly related to the big problem of transport reorganisation. I do not know what the policy of the present Government is in regard to transport reorganisation.  I do know, however, that there is in the minds of the principal Ministers of the Government an idea that there should be a closing down of a big portion of the railway system of this country. The Minister for Industry and Commerce forwarded to the Transport Tribunal not very long ago suggestions for consideration and recommendation for the closing down of ten branch lines.  I only referred to this because <Col N="466" /> if these recommendations are eventually approved by the Minister and the Government there will be another aspect of the transport problem to be faced, namely, the provision of better roads in the areas where these branch lines will be closed down.  Arising out of that there will be the consequential problem of who is to pay for the new iron roads in these areas.  The proposals in the motion are only part and parcel of that big transport problem which requires that the collective wisdom of the Cabinet should be brought to bear upon it, and I hope that a decision will be come to at a very early date.</P>
      <P>Since I and others advocated that the main and trunk roads should be made a national charge the cost of constructing and maintaining these main and trunk roads has been considerably increased by the increasing extent to which these roads are used, not principally by the local ratepayers, but by the owners of commercial lorries, who are using these main and trunk roads for profit-making purposes.  I take the view that the main and trunk roads are being used to the extent of 80 or 90 per cent. by the owners of commercial lorries, private cars and hackney cars, and that their upkeep should be paid for by these people, especially the people who use them for commercial and profit-making purposes.  Therefore, the issue raised by Deputy Flanagan in this motion is only part and parcel of a very involved problem, both from the financial point of view and the national policy-making point of view in regard to transport generally.  Nobody knows better than the Minister for Local Government that during the last 20 or 25 years, as a result mainly of the increased cost of constructing and maintaining these roads, as well as the county roads, the ratepaying community have been called upon to bear a much heavier burden than they had to carry previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, in the second portion of his motion, asks for favourable consideration by the Minister and his colleagues of increased grants for the repair of county roads or by-roads which have been practically destroyed in the turf-cutting counties.  The Minister will, from the records at his disposal, <Col N="467" /> know that during the emergency period road maintenance work, so far as it affected county roads in particular, was deferred because the county council road workers were transferred from their normal work of road maintenance to the turf-cutting operations which were undertaken for national purposes by the county councils in the turf-cutting counties.</P>
    <P>In the two counties of the Constituency of Laois-Offaly, the road workers normally employed on road maintenance work were transferred for a big portion of their working year to turf-cutting and turf-saving operations. As the Minister's files will confirm, the result was that these counties were not able to make use of the grants normally given at that time to other non&mdash;turf-cutting counties.  The road grants that were made available and that might have been used by turf-cutting counties like Laois and Offaly were not used and were, I understand, transferred and used by other counties outside the turf-cutting areas.  I would like the Minister to deal with that and say whether, generally speaking, my assertion in that respect can be borne out by the records which are at his disposal. If that is so, I think there is a very good case, on those grounds alone, for the proposal contained in the second part of the motion moved by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>I do admit &mdash; and I do not know whether the Minister will agree &mdash; that were it not for some of the valuable grants that were given to some of these turf-cutting counties under the Works Act, 1949, some of the roads I know fairly well in the Counties of Laois and Offaly would be impassable at the moment.  The county roads or by-roads in the two counties in my constituency are, without exaggeration, in a terrible condition and it is very unfair to the ratepaying community in these turf-cutting counties in my constituency and elsewhere that the roads that have been ploughed up and destroyed by lorries coming from the City of Dublin, and from any outside area for the past few years, should not get special consideration.  It is a terrible state of affairs to say that <Col N="468" /> these counties should be expected to bear the whole of the cost of restoring those by-roads or county roads to a passable condition.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind and I am sure that the reports of his inspectors, if they have been in those areas, will confirm what I am now asserting.</P>
    <P>These turf-cutting counties are in the position now that, not having been able to make use of the grants that were allocated during the emergency period for the reasons I have just given, they are now expected, unless they get the grants suggested by Deputy Flanagan in his motion, to put these roads back into a proper condition of repair at the expense of the local ratepaying community.  That is not fair, and the Minister should find ways and means of allocating from whatever funds are at his disposal grants for this purpose. He should regard that as his duty and as an obligation because of the services rendered during the emergency period by these counties in the turf-cutting areas.  He should regard it as an obligation to make up now or as soon as possible for the loss of the grants that they were unable to use during the emergency period.</P>
    <P>I am probably speaking to the converted when I am mentioning this matter to the Minister but I am hopeful he will make some statement or give some indication that in the immediate future he proposes to provide grants from whatever funds are at his disposal for the purpose of restoring the roads leading into bogs like Clonsast, and into the other big bogs used for turf-cutting purposes for the nation as a whole during the emergency period.  I hope he will allocate from whatever funds he has at his disposal reasonable grants to enable those roads to be, not alone restored to their normal condition, but to be maintained at a proper standard for the future. These roads leading into big bogs like Clonsast and Boora, and used by lorries coming from far outside the Counties of Laois and Offaly, are in a shocking, impassable state and are not in a fit condition for the type of lorry that has to be used for carting turf from these areas, not to towns situated in the Counties of Laois and Offaly but to the City of Dublin and to places far <Col N="469" /> away from those big bogs where turf for the nation is being produced.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more time in the House.  I want to give way to the Minister and I hope in doing so I am going to make it possible for him to give to the County Councils of Laois and Offaly and of other turf-cutting counties some encouragement by way of making some grant available to them in the near future.  I hope he will restore those county roads to their normal pre-emergency condition and that he will be able to inform the House, and the country as well, that the bigger question of the future construction and maintenance of the trunk roads will be dealt with as part and parcel of the national transport system.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest anything that would deprive the county councils of their existing powers because the powers they have at the moment are very limited, but I think there is a good case from a national point of view for having all the trunk and main roads in this country constructed and maintained to a minimum standard.  If that could be done instead of leaving the different counties to adopt their own standard of construction and maintenance for the trunk roads running through all the counties, there would be a better national system of roads in this country and a better opportunity of providing full employment on these trunk and main roads for a minimum number of men under reasonable conditions of service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House but I wish to support this motion to have the trunk and main roads maintained by the State.  The Minister will find from files in his Department copies of resolutions which have been passed over the last 20 or 30 years by the public body in charge of roads in County Wicklow. We have passed resolutions and sent deputations to the Minister's Department requesting that special facilities should be given to County Wicklow because it is a tourist county and because it is so adjacent to such places as Dublin and Dún Laoghaire from which tourists pass through the main roads of Wicklow.  We have <Col N="470" /> demanded on several occasions &mdash; and in many cases were very sympathetically received &mdash; that special consideration should be given to Wicklow above all other counties on account of the excessive traffic on the roads.  The Minister could find out from the minutes of meetings of this public body that resolutions have been passed unanimously that State grants should be given in respect of main and trunk roads, which should be taken over by the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan, contrary to his speeches here, said quite recently in the county that he and his Party were in favour of the trunk roads being maintained by the State and being a national charge.  He opposed that here during the week.  Not being a member of the Wicklow County Council, he may not be familiar with the opinion of the members there who represent all Parties and who are endeavouring to spend the maximum amount they can raise on roads, not alone in order to provide employment but also to put the roads in proper repair.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan also spoke about a five-year plan.  The Minister must have in his Department proposals in this connection; he was not waiting for suggestions from anyone here about five-year plans.  A five-year plan had been prepared by most of the county councils and submitted to the Minister's Department.  He also spoke about machinery.  I have been opposed to the spending of thousands of pounds on machinery.  These machines are in operation for only three months of the year and for the remaining nine months are lying in depots.  Machinery could be interchanged between public bodies instead of each public body purchasing its own machinery, adding thousands of pounds to the roads estimate for repayment of loan and interest. Time and time again I objected to the expenditure of thousands of pounds on machinery that gave employment for only three months of the year and created unemployment for the rest of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is familiar with the grievances of county councils in connection with the roads estimates.  If the Minister is unable at the present <Col N="471" /> moment to accept the motion, I would make a special appeal for favourable treatment for Wicklow, which is the gateway to Ireland.  The roads of Wicklow have to carry very heavy traffic.  We are in an exceptional position and should receive an exceptional grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister may point out that we had an opportunity last week, when he was looking for money to give county councils and was not supported.  I have no apology to make.  The Minister would stipulate, no matter what grant was given to a public body, that a certain amount would have to be raised in rates.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister to look into the case of the coast road in Wicklow, one portion of which is completed. The inter-Party Government made a grant available.  The county council were advised to complete the road.  There was some difference of opinion between the experts in the Minister's Department which was got over.  The county council has been promised a grant for the past two years.  If that road were completed, tourists from Dublin could travel along the sea-coast to Wexford.  It is only a matter of making two miles of road. The county council have spent considerable sums of money on this road.  About £5,000 or £6,000, together with portion of the rates, would complete the road.</P>
    <P>We anticipate that there will be a huge number of visitors in April, and all parties are making preparations to facilitate tourists.  If the Minister meets the request of the county council and makes a grant available, the road can be completed within two months, thereby adding greatly to the amenities of the county.</P>
    <P>I want to refute the charge made by Deputy Cogan.  I would ask the Minister, if he is unable to accept the motion, to hear my special plea for Wicklow, that county being a tourist centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what factors are operating to make me so little inclined to speak.  The audience is small, but I do not think that that is affecting me. <Col N="472" /> It may be that we have been talking about roads for the last four or five weeks.  If I have little inclination to speak on this motion at any length, it is not because I am not interested in the subject of roads.  I have tried as best I could since I entered the Department of Local Government to show my appreciation of the need to tackle the road problem.</P>
      <P>Over the last 25 years, motions on the same lines as the motion now before the House have been discussed. Similar motions, dealing with trunk and main roads, have been discussed by local bodies of which I was a member.  I never really believed in them.</P>
      <P>It is not very safe for a politician to take the line that I am going to follow now.  When a motion is introduced at a county council meeting asking the State to take responsibility for anything, the safest line is said to be to support that request, whether it is reasonable or unreasonable.  The line I took 25 years ago was that you could ask the State to do everything and anything.  You could ask the State to improve the main roads and to maintain them.  You could ask the State to make and improve or remake and maintain county roads.  There is no end to the requests that can be made to the State as far as these important matters are concerned.  But even those who make these propositions and support them by all kinds of arguments such as those that have been advanced in support of this motion, must realise that money must be provided and, whether it has to come from the rates or from taxation, or whether the burden is fairly apportioned between the ratepayer and the taxpayer, makes little difference in the long run.</P>
      <P>What is happening in regard to roads now?  The motion deals with two matters &mdash; the maintenance of trunk and main roads and grants towards county roads that were used extensively for the haulage of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the improvement of main roads, there is a full 100 per cent. grant from the Road Fund, and for maintenance afterwards there is a 40 per cent. contribution. That is going a long way. That meets much of the case made by <Col N="473" /> those who say that the roads should be a national charge.  In addition, grants are now being given &mdash; this year £1,400,000, and it is not nearly enough &mdash; to local bodies to recondition county roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett endeavoured to anticipate what I might say by way of reply to the pleas which he and others made.  He said my reply might be: &ldquo;I have been endeavouring to do so and so, through the proposals to increase motor taxation, to increase the Road Fund, and the Opposition did not see fit to lend a hand in my effort.&rdquo;  I have no complaint in so far as Deputies make up their minds to support or reject any proposals such as these&mdash; but they are not proposals with which we can deal on a motion of this nature. The very fact that Deputy Everett endeavoured to anticipate what I might say in that regard conveys to me, whether rightly or wrongly, the feeling that he must have seen a good deal of justification for them.</P>

      <P>Well, then, I must say I find it hard to imagine what sort of mental approach he has to this whole question of the condition of our roads. My case is that the contributions that have been made from the Road Fund to the improvement of our main roads are 100 per cent.</P>

      <P>The contribution that is being made to the maintenance of these roads is 40 per cent.  Grants have been given and grants are being increased to local authorities to enable them to tackle the county road problem. I agree with Deputies that the country roads will be a growing problem; as for a long time, much of the heavy traffic was confined to the main roads but is now branching in on all sorts of country roads.  Those with an intimate knowledge of the countryside can see at once that additional provision will have to be made to assist local bodies by way of grants to tackle that problem.  It is all very well to couple that with the problem of reorganisation of transport and try to <Col N="474" /> make it involved.  I do not think that the reorganisation of transport arises here at all.  Our task, my task and that of the local bodies, is to try to devise a programme &mdash; be it a five-year or a ten-year programme &mdash; which will bring order into the road system of the country.  Those who have that task to contend with, those who have that problem to handle, must face the necessity to provide the means by which that work can be carried out.</P>

      <P>There is no use in attempting to confuse the issue with the side-issues that have been introduced by Deputy Davin and others. In my view, this problem can be dealt with successfully only by the methods I am trying to apply.  There are people who will disagree with that approach and who will say that this responsibility should be handed over to the State, that the State should be asked to make and maintain the main road system of the country. These people would also ask the State to take over a number of other services for which local bodies are responsible at present.  I do not mind such a request.  I suppose it is put forward for the purpose of enabling such people to ventilate the views they hold, when the question arises for discussion here in Parliament or at meetings of local bodies.  But when responsibility is put on the individual to devise a means of tackling the problem, and when that responsibility is shared by local authorities, I see no way of dealing with it except through the State and the local body, the taxpayers and the ratepayers, sharing fairly and squarely the burdens that the solution of this problem will entail.</P>

      <P>I think there was, but we have only the two now, main and county roads.  The term &ldquo;trunk road&rdquo; is meaningless now.  Sometimes you hear it said that the State makes a poor and ungenerous contribution to our road system, for road improvement, as compared with the contribution made in Britain.  I glanced at the contributions made in both cases and I found that it is not true to say that our contribution is less from the Central Fund or the Road Fund.  I find that the contribution made to local bodies in the Twenty-Six Counties is 47 per cent. while in Britain the contribution is 44 per cent.  I find also that almost half of the proceeds of the Road Fund in Britain goes into the general Exchequer for other purposes.  Last year, I think, the total of the Road Fund was over £70,000,000 and of that some £33,000,000 went into the Exchequer for general purposes.</P>

      <P>We have to deal with 15 miles of road per 1,000 persons, as against their 4½; and the position in the Six Counties is that they have 10 miles of road per 1,000.  When you look at our effort and compare it with the contributions made in Britain, you <Col N="476" /> find that we have been doing not too badly.</P>

      <P>Deputies Davin and Flanagan urged me to make special provision for certain counties owing to the work done during the emergency and because of the effect that the turf haulage had then on roads which were never constructed to carry such traffic. Deputy Everett made a plea from a different angle: he puts forward the claims of Wicklow because it is a tourist county and because, as he says, it is the gateway to a great part of the country.  I think that claim was made at one time for County Kildare.</P>
      <P>Every county has its own problems. As regards the Counties of Laois and Offaly, I suppose there is something in what they say about the turf haulage, but they got grants during the war years to repair those roads.  The grants may not have been adequate.  They are getting grants still to some extent; and, to whatever extent they think it wise, they can use the county road grants that are now being made available for the purpose of reshaping and remaking the roads that are used for that purpose.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
