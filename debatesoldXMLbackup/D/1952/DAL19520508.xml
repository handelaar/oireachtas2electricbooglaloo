      <P>I regret that I was not present when the Minister was making his statement.  There are a certain number of things which I should like to mention.  The first is that I was somewhat disturbed by a statement that I read in the speech of the president of the Irish National Teachers' Association at the congress in Tramore when he said that the machinery for the adjustment of salary questions which was introduced by the previous administration had come to an end some weeks ago, that it was being reconstructed at the moment.  I am sure that it is pretty generally appreciated that under the machinery of conciliation and arbitration set up it has been possible for the representatives of the primary teachers, the Department of Education and the Department of Finance to come, at the <Col N="1290" /> conciliation level, to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to all parties. When that machinery was set up it was intended to be a permanent machine which would eliminate as far as possible friction and agitation in relation to salaries and other matters affecting the financial position of the teachers.  I do not know what can have happened when it can be stated that the machinery came to an end some weeks ago.  I should like to have from the Minister an assurance that there is no gap or difficulty there such as I understood from speeches made in the House appears to have arisen in relation to the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>For a very long period the lack of satisfactory machinery of that kind has militated against the teaching profession devoting themselves to what I call the clinical work of pedagogy and the development of the professional approach by giving to the public in the best possible way the fullest possible advantage of their professional experience. The same assurance is required with regard to the secondary and vocational teachers.  I felt that, with the establishment of that machinery and the satisfactory way in which the present Minister found it to work for him, we had definitely arrived at a time when the friction with regard to pay and salary scales would be eliminated and not only would there be more satisfactory co-operation in purely educational matters between the teaching organisations generally and the Department, but the teaching organisations generally, who are the people with practical experience of the work in the schools, would be better able to devote their individual and organised attention by mutual exchange of opinions and experience to educating public opinion on the work that is being done in the schools and inspiring more satisfactory confidence on the part of the people in the work being done.  I feel there is a very definite ministerial function to be operated by the Minister for Education in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into matters that might appear to be critical or controversial I want to say that my experience in the Department of Education <Col N="1291" /> rather suggested to me that the purely ministerial function, as such, was somewhat absent from the Department to a fairly substantial extent for some years past with the result that other ministerial influences invaded the Department.  Various pet notions of the Minister here and the Minister there introduced matters that were not necessarily a proper part of the pattern of the general departmental approach and distorted the approach of the Department to general problems and deprived, shall we say, the Civil Service side of the Department of Education of the assistance that is undoubtedly the proper discharge of the pure ministerial function.</P>
    <P>It is imperative for the Department of Education that the Department itself be relieved of the charge of being bureaucratic in its approach.  The Minister has now sufficient experience of the Department to appreciate that the Civil Service side of the Department of Education is as devoted in a vocational way to the work they have in hands as many of the members of the religious orders who carry out the work of education throughout the country. They require that the ministerial function will be properly exercised alongside them and part of the ministerial function ought to be the protection of the Department from the fads of other Ministers here and there.</P>
    <P>While there has been a lot of satisfactory comment, there has also been a lot of criticism of the approach to the new spelling of Irish.  I was very much surprised to find that the Department of Education, and the experience of the Department of Education, was hardly sought at all in connection with the initiation of that work and that the matter was finally decided almost entirely outside the Department of Education.  I do not want to discuss the excellence or otherwise of the decision but it is almost inconceivable that that was done.</P>
    <P>The matter of university scholarships for students doing their examinations entirely through the medium of Irish was, I think, introduced without any serious consultation with the Department <Col N="1292" /> of Education on the one hand or the universities on the other hand and modifications might be necessary in particular schemes of that kind to which it might be useful to give some thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that certain examination was made to see what can be done to increase the number of trained primary teachers.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not been able to avoid the thorns put in his path by, say, the Minister for Finance in that matter.  I feel that there is no more urgent problem in the Department than the provision of at least additional women national teachers.  I was very sorry that I was not able to succeed myself in that connection 12 months ago.  I think it must react very much on the general educational system that the Minister is not able to make a definite statement on the matter.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure us in his reply that provision will be made immediately for the training of additional women teachers.  In our whole educational scheme, the only teachers who get fundamental training in their work are the primary teachers.  The difference between the results achieved in later years by students who have gone through the primary schools and been taught by teachers who had two years' training in the primary training colleges and the results achieved by students who went, say, through the junior schools, and were taught by teachers who had not got systematic training in the art of teaching, such as is given in the ordinary training colleges, is in my opinion very marked. I feel that the private schools reflect in the results they are able to achieve a lack of systematic training of the teachers.</P>
    <P>You have a problem in the junior private schools and you have a problem throughout a fairly large part of the country in the matter of untrained primary teachers.  We want additional training for women, particularly, and more training facilities for men.  However, you may not want an additional college for men in the same way as you want it for the women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> A more definite approach is needed in the case of unqualified primary teachers throughout the country.  There is a large number of them.  A number of them have many years' experience, won their spurs, and reached a very high stage of qualification. Something may have to be done to establish them as qualified teachers, but something must be done to prevent the appointment, year after year, of additional girls, in particular, who are not qualified.  They are put into primary schools and will, perhaps, be permanently retained there through the lack of qualified teachers.</P>
    <P>I feel that when there is a lot of opinion as to the different ways in which primary teachers should be prepared for their avocation, there is no better way than to pass them through training colleges specially designed for them.  In that connection, I suggest there is a necessity for raising the status of the professors in the training colleges and reviewing, in the light of improved status, the class and the character of their work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the Minister is directing such a determined advance in the work of building new schools. There is, however, a problem in relation to the repair and maintenance of schools which I think requires, say, a conference between the Department and members of the Hierarchy.  The Minister has drawn attention to the usefulness of the consultative committee set up in Dublin in regard to new schools.  I think something on the same lines might be attempted in regard to the repair and maintenance of schools.  There are one or two disgraceful cases of lack of repair of schools that have come to my own notice, particulary in the last few months.  I know of one Irish-speaking district in which the language is flourishing, and in which the long traditions of our race, of a literary and linguistic kind, are fully maintained. The school there is really a disgrace to civilisation.  I should not like to put down a question to the Minister to ask how many panes of glass out of the total number in that school were completely broken, how many were cracked, how many were stuck with pieces of cardboard and wood, how <Col N="1294" /> many slates were off the roof, how many bricks out of the wall or how many holes there were in the floor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>And when that school was built.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister appreciates what a tragedy it is in an Irish-speaking district&mdash;where you have the language vigorously maintained, where economically everything possible is being done to uplift and strengthen the people in surroundings in which we are endeavouring to nurture what is their real tradition&mdash;to find school conditions so disgraceful. I do feel that some kind of conference, some kind of systematic co-operation such as has been brought about in Dublin with regard to new schools, might be attempted in regard to the repair and maintenance of schools in the country.  We do know that in many parts of the country the burden which falls on the ecclesiastical authorities in the maintenance of such institutions under present-day conditions is very great.  There is one particular type of building, of which perhaps there are a few specimens, for which I would ask the Minister's special consideration.  It has been noted in the traditions of our race that after every national disaster there did come a period of uplift in the form of a literary renaissance.  On some occasions the laity were the prime movers in the matter, on other occasions the lead was given by learned ecclesiastics, and at other times we had a combination of the two.  It has also been noted that these movements were in the past conducted mainly through the medium of the Irish language.  The development and the foundation of our modern educational system and the rise in our literary and educational activities which came with the advent of the Christian Brothers, the Mercy Order, the Presentation Order, the Sisters of Charity and the Ursulines, I feel are in keeping with the periodic rhythm of our nation.  Many of the laity, devoting themselves to the work of <Col N="1295" /> the education of the poor in Ireland found themselves called to the path of religious life.  Buildings that were put up in the very early days of that movement are still in use and are perhaps in a poor, dilapidated condition but never in 100 years or more have they caused to the State, for their maintenance or to replace any part of the fabric, any cost whatever.</P>
      <P>They are now not only historic monuments to an episode in our national life that has yet to be fully recognised in connection with what we are doing in the educational life of our country, but they served a modern purpose for the carrying on of education.  Because of the fact that they are regarded, as not exactly the type of school that would be built in a modern way or a type which could be adapted without more cost than architects think should be applied to them at the present time, they are being left there neglected, left as a burden and a problem to the religious authorities who built them. I think that that consideration of the past, a consideration of what they mean by way of national monuments breathing a particular type of spirituality and a particular message, should dictate that exceptional steps should be taken to assist either a remodelling of these buildings, if the authorities who own them require them to be remodelled, or that special sympathetic consideration should be given to the aspects which I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is some time now since the report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment was issued.  I do not know if I have missed any references to it in the Minister's presentation of the Estimate to the House but I should like to know whether that matter is receiving the attention of the Minister.  Perhaps it is a matter that should first arise in connection with the first report of the Council of Education but I should like to know from the Minister whether that is so or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the amount of money provided in the Estimate for adult education is being reduced.  I am sure the Minister is sufficiently closely in touch with the work that is <Col N="1296" /> being done in the vocational schools to realise that the work done nowadays in the vocational schools is awakening the people to the necessity for taking full value out of the work done in the primary schools and that the work done in the vocational schools has had a new light thrown on it by the courses that have developed for what would be called adult education under the fostering influence of the university colleges and the fruitful influence of co-operation between the vocational education committees and the university colleges.</P>
    <P>When one sees the social objective for which these courses were originally developed and when one sees the mixture of social and economic objectives to which those courses are being directed, one must appreciate how valuable it is to encourage the purely non-State initiative that has moved in this direction.  One must appreciate how little direct demand is being made on the State for the cost of this scheme.  Even if the local authorities make a substantial contribution to the work&mdash;I do not know whether they do or not&mdash;there are also voluntary bodies outside with fully equipped minds on the university side and the machinery of the local authorities.  They form a valuable and inspiring body and they are responsible for giving to our people of all classes a very full appreciation of education.  I feel that the work of the adult education committees is both valuable and progressive in the economic and social life of our country.  There is a movement back from the realities that are touched there to the actual work of the schools.  I would ask the Minister to listen sympathetically to the complaints regarding the reduction of grants and to be sympathetic about any extension of facilities or of finances that may be required for that work.</P>
    <P>What I say with regard to the conciliation and arbitration machinery on the one hand in relation to primary teachers is equally applicable to vocational and secondary teachers.  I am gratified to know that the Minister has been able to reach agreement with the <Col N="1297" /> secondary teachers at the conciliation level.  The vocational teachers have recently demanded, I believe, to be included in that scheme.  At least 25 per cent. of those teaching in vocational schools are qualified in exact detail to teach in secondary schools.  Somewhat more than an additional 25 per cent. are qualified in a way that departmentally is regarded as being analogous to the qualifications required for secondary schools.  It was quite inconceivable to me that there should be radical differences in the payments made to a vocational teacher on the one side of the road and the payments made to the teacher in a Christian Brothers' schools or a convent schools on the other side of the road.  I felt that the pattern that applied to the married and the unmarried and women teachers in secondary schools should apply to vocational schools, and that both should have the same machinery for conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>I know there was the difficulty that the local authority was the paymaster of the vocational teachers&mdash;though the State paid half the cost&mdash;and it was felt reasonable that those who are paymasters would be included in the machinery for conciliation and arbitration. I feel that there is a way out of that.  When the difficulties arising with regard to conciliation and arbitration at present are being settled, I hope it will be possible to have a scheme that will include vocational and secondary teachers to the satisfaction of both of these groups, and that the equation of their work and qualifications will result in bringing their scales and general conditions somewhat into equality.</P>
    <P>In regard to the higher institutes, I feel that one thing which is particularly missing from our primary and secondary schools is some of that warm appreciation of Irish historical tradition and folklore that in some way or other we managed to grow up with as a result of reading weekly national papers.  Our higher institutes are decimal-pointing learning in a valuable and important way, but unless they turn out a by-product that will colour the imagination and paint our <Col N="1298" /> national history and social and folk traditions around us in our daily lives, we are losing something that we should expect from the higher study of history and literature.  I would suggest to the Minister that the bodies which look after the work of the Celtic School in our Institute for Advanced Studies, the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Society of Antiquities, should all be asked to give their assistance to see in what way some of the colour and the warmth of our national folk and historical tradition could be brought into our school books and into our schools.</P>

      <P>Bhí ceist na teangan á phlé ar an Meastachán seo agus ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an gceist sin.  Ní foláir a rá go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó eolais ag muintir na hÉireann ar an nGaeilge anois ná mar bhí triocha bliain ó snoin, agus go bhfuil níos mó daoine i ndon an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Tá a chion féin déanta ag an Aire chun an Ghaeilge a shábháil agus tá cúis na Gaeilge slán faoina chúram.  Mar sin féin, ní féidir a rá go bhfuil gluaiseacht na Gaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh mar ba chóir.  Is cinnte gur féidir le níos mó daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt anois; ach má sea, cén fáth nach labhartar níos minicí anois í imeasc na bhfear óg agus na mban óg a bhfuil neart Gaeilge acu? Orainn féin agus ar an Rialtas atá an locht, im thuairimse.</P>
      <P>Is iad na daoine óga, idir 16 agus 30, na daoine is tábhachtaí i ngluaiseacht ar bith.  Bíonn siad san i ndon an Ghaeilge a labhairt nuair a fhágann siad an scoil agus dá dtugtaí aire chóir le 30 bliain anuas do sna daoine óga, do bheadh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt anois.  Ní foláir iarracht a dhéanamh chun siamsaí cluichí; céilithe, coirmeacha ceoil agus mar sin a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Ba cheart, freisin, faichí imeartha a sholáthar dóibh ins gach aon pharóiste.  Tá fhios agam go dtógfaidh sé a lán airgid chun an obair sin go léir a dhéanamh, ach más dóigh leis an Rialtas gur fiú iarracht a dhéanamh chun an teanga a shábháil ní mór airgead a chaitheamh chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois, cé go bhfuil an tAire <Col N="1299" /> Oideachais féin ag déanamh a dhíchill ar son na Gaeilge, is oth liom a rá gur beag gríosadh atá ag teacht ó aon Roinn Rialtais eile chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Chím neamh-shuim agus neamh-aithne ag gach Roinn, beagnach, ar an bpobal a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Cuir i geás, tá obair ar siúl ag gach Comhairle Contae, ag Córas Iompair Eireann agus ag gach Roinn, beagnach, inniu agus níl siad ag tabhairt a ceart don teangain in san obair sin.  Bíonn litreacha, cártaí agus foirmeacha dhá gcur amach acu go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus is i mBéarla ar fad a bhíonn siad. Ní foláir no tá sé sin ag déanamh a lán díobhála don cheist.  Ba mhaith liom go bhféachfadh an tAire chuige go gcuirfí stop leis an droch-nós san. Ba cheart gur i nGaeilge amháin a clóbhuailfí agus a foilseofaí gach foirm a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht nó le daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Ba cheart gur i nGaeilge a bheadh gach foirm agus gach fógra ag lorg iarrthóirí ar phostanna a bhfuil an Ghaeilge riachtanach lena n-aghaidh.  Má thugann gach Roinn Rialtais faoin obair sin i gceart is mór an feabhas a thiocfaidh ar cheist na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>The future of the language depends almost entirely on the efforts and the initiative of our young people and on the preservation of the home of the language and the reservoir of the language in the Gaeltacht areas.  I have no doubt that the young people to-day will play their part provided they get every help and encouragement by example and in monetary aid. A generation has left our schools during the past 27 or 28 years since the time when Irish was first made a compulsory subject.  That generation had a good working knowledge of the language.  Yet, only a very small percentage speak Irish to-day.  I think I would be safe in saying that Irish is spoken less to-day that it was 25 and 30 years ago and the efforts of our teachers and of our children, therefore, are being wasted because of the failure of the Government to continue the good work done in the schools by making Irish compulsory.</P>
    <P>Our young boys and girls when they <Col N="1300" /> leave school meet only English speakers in their homes and in their work.  They lack the opportunity of continuing the work done in the schools.  The Government should make an effort to provide an opportunity for these people to continue the use and practice of the native language after leaving school by making available facilities for céilidhthe, Irish concerts and other amusements, by providing halls in which nothing but the Irish language will be spoken, by providing playing pitches in every parish in the country, by making more use of the radio to bring the spoken language into the homes, the halls and the clubs and by ensuring that short Gaelic features will be heard in every cinema. All that will probably involve the expenditure of quite a big sum but it will be money well spent and it will justify its expenditure by ensuring the continued progress of the language after our children leave school through the provision of facilities for the continued use and practice of the language.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated in helping to implement the recommendations of the arbitration machinery set up in connection with teachers' salaries and in bringing about some measure of contentment in the teaching profession.  The Minister might now go a step further in helping to allay the resentment and dissatisfaction among a certain section of our teachers that has not been too fairly treated.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the salary claims of the pre-1946 single male teachers who, when the single men and women were placed on an equal pay basis in 1949, seemed to be unjustly treated.  Some of them received as little as 5/- a week increase on the 1946 scale.</P>
    <P>It is to be presumed that they were penalised for not taking on the responsibilities of marriage.  It must be remembered, however, that some of these unmarried male teachers have as great a burden to bear as their married colleagues because of having to care for aged parents, invalid brothers and sisters, and maintain a house and housekeeper.  Many of these teachers are in the heart of the <Col N="1301" /> country, where there are no facilities for lodging, and they have to maintain a car, at great expense now, to take them to and from their work.  I believe they are entitled to salary increases in conformity with the increases granted to persons in other State-paid services.</P>
    <P>There is another appeal I must make to the Minister on behalf of those teachers who retired prior to January, 1950, and who were denied the retiring gratuity awarded to teachers who retired subsequent to that date.  I understand that the principal reason for creating a dividing line between these two groups was the cost of extending the retiring gratuity to all existing pensioners.  I hold that the award of a retiring gratuity to any admits the right of all to a similar gratuity.  All serve in the same capacity and under the same circumstances, and no line of demarcation should be drawn between them. In the interests of justice and equity those who have been denied a retiring gratuity should now be awarded it.  I do not know what the cost will be, but cost should not be a hindrance in meting out justice.  I appeal to the Minister to give active consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is his intention to establish a second training college in order to provide a sufficiency of trained teachers and he hopes to have that college in operation in the near future.  That is welcome news. There is a great need of trained teachers at the moment, particularly of women teachers and teachers for the Protestant community.  That need is due to the unsatisfactory conditions that have hitherto prevailed particularly in relation to the salary, which is at the root of the whole matter. The shortage of teachers is reflected in the size of some of the classes in our cities and towns.  In some cases these classes are so large as to make any effective or worth-while teaching quite impossible.  No obstacle should be allowed to remain which prevents prospective candidates from becoming teachers.  Every effort should be made to bring into the profession the best intelligence in the country since the <Col N="1302" /> success of our educational system depends primarily on the quality of our teachers.</P>
    <P>I notice that the grant for heating, cleaning and maintaining the schools is at the same figure this year as last year.  That grant was considerably reduced by the last Government despite the protestations of both the teachers and the parents as to its insufficiency for the purpose.  A Council of Education has been set up to remedy the defects in our educational system, and to put right the mistakes of the past three decades.  I believe this council will be of little value unless the Government takes immediate steps to provide proper accommodation for the children and the teachers.  The recent statement of the Minister as to the state of some of our schools and the necessity for providing decent schools shows a realisation of both the magnitude and the urgency of this problem. The steps which he outlined, and which the Government propose to take for the provision of decent schools for our children, give us hope that we will not have long to wait for a solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that there are many schools throughout the country, some of them 100 years old, which are in a shocking state of repair.  They are unhealthy and dirty.  It is also a common sight to see, in some of our country schools in the winter time, the teacher and the pupils wearing their overcoats in an endeavour to keep themselves warm, in order to make up for the shortcomings of a very inadequate fire. Many of these schools are cold, damp, draughty and unhealthy, and neither the pupils nor the teachers can give their best in the condition of physical discomfort in which they have to work. The heating and cleaning grant for these schools is not enough.  The children in most cases, because of lack of the wherewithal to pay somebody else to do it, are obliged after school hours to do the cleaning and the sweeping of the schools, when they get choked with the dust and dirt that has accumulated in the school during the day.  That must be very injurious to the health of the children, and is a practice which should not be allowed <Col N="1303" /> to continue.  Many of these schools are breeding grounds of disease, and so I think it is absolutely futile to be providing increased grants for health services while our children are obliged to spend the greater part of their school days in such schools.</P>
    <P>I know that it is the intention of the Government, as it was of the last Government, to provide schools as quickly as possible for our children, but a considerable time will elapse before that can be done.  In the meantime, something should be done to remove the sordid conditions under which our teachers and children have to work. A considerable increase in the heating and cleaning grant would help to remove the physical discomfort under which they have to carry on at present, and would provide an atmosphere for the normal healthy development of our children.  I do not think there is anything else I have to say except to commend the few points I have made to the Minister's consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the speech that was made yesterday by a Deputy from Galway, and I suppose what he said is true, that the only thing which the majority of Deputies in this House do with regard to the Irish language is to give lip-service to the effort to revive it.  I suppose he was perfectly correct in saying that.  Now, I would like to <Col N="1304" /> be able to make my entire speech in Irish on this Vote, but if I were to do so I do not think I would be able to convey to the Minister what exactly I want to convey to him, because my knowledge of Irish is so limited.  I would like, too, to be able to make my speech on the Budget entirely in Irish, because I believe that Irish is important and that its revival is very important.  But, whether the Deputy likes it or not, I think that the Budget is much more important than the Irish language.  The prices of bread, tea, sugar and butter are also important. I feel that I would not be able to convey the viewpoints of my constituents on the Budget entirely through Irish.  I agree with the point made by the Deputy that there could be a little more Irish used in the House.  It would be an encouragement if that were done, because the people at times do look to this House for encouragement in respect of certain movements, and more particularly, I suppose, in respect of the movement to try to-revive the language.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the ordinary individual outside who has not the same interest in the revival of the language as the Minister or the Deputy from Galway, believes that there has not been any advance at all made in the revival of the language over the past 30 years.  I say that the ordinary individual outside would say that, and I think that is the general viewpoint. I suppose that is due to the fact that we have lost so much Irish in the last 30 years.  I do not mean that we lost it in the Gaeltacht area.  The point that I am making is that so much Irish has been lost in the Galltacht areas over the last 30 years, so much of the Irish that had been acquired by the pupils in the schools of the country over that period.  They acquired a knowledge of Irish while in school, up to the age of 16, 17 and 18 years and then lost 75 per cent. of it.  I do not look on myself as a perfect example in that respect, but I should say this that when I left school at 18 years of age I could have conversed quite freely in Irish with the Minister, with the Deputy from Galway or with Deputy Ormonde.  But because Irish was not <Col N="1305" /> used in my town, and because there was no real effort made&mdash;I suppose I was to blame myself as well as others &mdash;to use it by those who left school with me, and because it was not encouraged in the proper way, I lost a substantial portion of the Irish which I had been taught at school.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ormonde says that the problem is to try and keep Irish in the Gaeltacht. That may be portion of the problem, but I think that the bigger portion of the problem is to endeavour to retain amongst young people in the City of Dublin, in the towns in Leinster and generally in those towns and places which we regard as the Galltacht areas, a knowledge of the Irish which they had acquired at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I think that not only the present Minister but the last Minister and the Minister before him could have made some real effort and endeavoured to make the Irish language popular through the medium of the films.  Deputies have heard this many times before, but I propose to repeat it again for what it is worth. Some people would have you believe that the film-going audiences would not suffer a two-reel short which would be entirely in Irish.  I do not think that is correct.  In any case, I think an effort should be made even to inflict it on those people, a lot of whom are antagonistic towards the Irish language.  I am a film-goer myself.  I have gone to see films and have had to endure for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour a &ldquo;short&rdquo; dealing with something in South West Africa, Peru or China.  I just had to endure that. I rather think that if we had short stories portraved through the medium of the films in the Irish language, with <Col N="1306" /> Irish commentaries, our people would gradually acquire a liking for the language, and that even people who are antagonistic to it as well as young people who have just left school would pick up words and phrases in Irish. By that method the Irish they learned at school would be carried on.  We may say what we like about cultural activities in other respects; we may talk about céilidhthe, Irish concerts and other things that are generally regarded as being typical of Irish culture but we must admit that the main form of amusement in the country are films.  If we do not get the Irish language through to the people through the medium of the films I do not believe that we can get it to them successfully in any other way.  What the Minister or the Government can do in that respect I do not know but everybody will agree that for propaganda purposes and for purposes of amusement the films are accepted as the medium.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was perfectly right when he spoke about lip-service because I have some little knowledge of the Club Leabhar which is promoted by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and I would like to discover how many Deputies who profess to be behind the movement for the revival of the language are members of that particular club.  I do not say that the publications are super-attractive.  They provide interesting reading all right but, apart from the reading and amusement that they provide, membership of the Club Leabhar would be in itself a gesture or contribution towards promoting the writing and the publication of these books and would provide some source of revenue for those courageous men&mdash;I think one could call them courageous&mdash;who at the present time are making their contribution to the revival of the language by writing these books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> There is another suggestion that I would like to put to the Minister with a view to keeping the language alive. Again, my interest is in the pupils who leave school at the age of 16,17 or 18. I would suggest, not necessarily the establishment by the Department of Education, but the encouragement of the establishment of Irish holiday camps.  There are many Irish colleges throughout the country and anyone who has been in any of those Irish holiday colleges or holiday camps will readily admit that in the fortnight, three weeks or month that he spent there he learned infinitely more Irish than he would learn by spending six times as long in a school.  The trades unions could do a lot in that respect. Various other organisations could do a great deal.  I have particularly in mind the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland who should be induced or encouraged to form Irish-speaking troops.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are troops within the ranks of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland that speak Irish exclusively but it would be a good idea if the Minister could contact or make representations to that very good organisation with a view to seeing what help they could give in their annual holiday camps towards the promotion of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I asked the Minister before.  I am not aware what stage the negotiations have reached.  I asked him, for God's sake, to try to provide some definite arrangement with regard to the salaries of vocational teachers.  I said, and I think I was correct in saying, that they had been thrown around quite a lot, not only by the present Minister but by the Minister in the previous Government, that while the two other branches of the teaching profession, primary teachers and secondary teachers, had got some improvements over the last few years, the vocational teachers found themselves frustrated at every attempt they made to get finality with regard to their particular problems in respect of scale salary.</P>
    <P>I should also like to support Deputy <Col N="1308" /> Ormonde and, I think, Deputy Peadar Cowan, in a plea for those teachers who retired prior to a particular date in 1950.  It seems harsh that there should be a border between them and those who retired subsequently.  If the Minister could see his way to do something for them, it would be an act of charity.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister for Education&mdash;any Minister for Education&mdash;should say to pupils at the age of 14 years: &ldquo;If you have no prospect of reaching a university, or pursuing a course that will enable you to fit yourself for the Civil Service, Córas Iompair Éireann, local government, etc., I would advise you now to leave school and to take up a trade or to enrol in a vocational school.&rdquo;  There is nothing as pathetic as the number of young boys and girls who believe that they will be able to follow a lucrative profession and who continue at school until they get their leaving certificate.  They find then that they have not the slightest prospect of entering a university.  They have qualifications in Irish, English, history, and geography.  They have a knowledge of algebraic geometry.  They know trigonometry inside out.  They can tell you everything about the binomial theorem.  Having romped about for 12 months, answering every type of advertisement, they find they have to take a clerical post at 25/- a week or, in some cases, less.  It takes them all those years to discover&mdash;because nobody pointed it out to them&mdash;that it is useless to continue at school until they are 18 or 19 years of age and get these grand sounding qualifications and acquire all that knowledge because they are debarred from taking up any real job unless they have the B.A., B.Comm. or some other degree.</P>
    <P>I am not against university education. I have heard Deputies say that if we had less university students and more workers we would get on better. The number of university scholarships given by local authorities is a scandal. The meagre scholarships that they give do not do justice to the bright young pupils who, if they got a chance, would advance.  In County Wexford for the entire county, there are five or, at the <Col N="1309" /> most, six university scholarships given to those pupils who continue at school and do the leaving certificate examination. It is not a considerable amount of money.  The granting of university scholarships, outside Dublin, should not be confined to the county councils. I cannot understand why, say, the Wexford Corporation could not be induced to give or would not give voluntarily a university scholarship, or two, or three or four.  I cannot understand why some of our bigger urban district councils should not be induced to give, or should not of their own free will give, university scholarships to the number of two, three or four.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for the young people of our country who have not got the means to go to a university to do a university course are not sufficient. It is fairly generally accepted that a member of a family who is just normally intelligent, and in many cases who is below normal intelligence, can become a doctor, a solicitor, a barrister or enter any of the other professions, provided his family have sufficient money.  I am not critical of that situation at all-it is a grand thing for him that his family can send him on to become a barrister, a solicitor, a doctor, a dentist or an engineer-but we should be a little more generous through the State and local authorities and through other organisations, and should be able to give to hundreds of young persons, bright and intelligent boys and girls, who cannot afford them, the facilities to get university education and to qualify for the type of degree I mentioned.  Unfortunately, the scholarships are very few.  Hundreds and, I suppose, thousands of young pupils who are above average intelligence discover, when they have reached the leaving certificate standard, that the only thing they are fitted for is some tuppence-halfpenny clerical job in which there is no future.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this last item comes within the jurisdiction of the Minister or not, but I want to advocate that a branch of the university be established at the State farms under the Department of Agriculture, mainly for the purpose of allowing the pupils who attend there to qualify for their <Col N="1310" /> degree in agriculture.  So far as the particular college which I know is concerned&mdash;Johnstown Castle, five or six miles outside Wexford&mdash;it has all the facilities, and if branches of the university, with emphasis only on a degree in agriculture, were established in Johnstown Castle, in Ballyhaise and at the other State farms, it would relieve the congestion in the universities in Cork Galway and Dublin and would be a great boon to these places and to the pupils in the vicinity of these State colleges.</P>
    <P>May I urge again that the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Justice or whatever other Minister is concerned should get together in regard to the revival of the language?  If they want to make a substantial contribution to the revival of the language, I suggest that the best medium is the medium which is popular at present in practically every line of propaganda, the films.</P>

      <P>I think the National Museum next door never survived the acquisition of this House as a neighbour.  The Museum surrendered portion of its premises at the time to enable the additions to Leinster House to be made and £40,000 worth of fossils have since been lying packed in boxes in the National Museum.  Bear in mind that I said &ldquo;in the National Museum.&rdquo;  There are £80,000 worth of fossils in this House, but the real fossils have been there since 1923, and I understand that they have never been unpacked.  They say: &ldquo;The nearer the Church, the farther from God,&rdquo; and I have to admit that I have never climbed the reek myself, though I have often disported myself up in Donegal at Lough Derg.  In the same way, we have forgotten the National Museum next door while concentrating on things much farther away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are skins there which are unclassified, and, I suppose, <i>a fortiori</i> are not on exhibit, for the simple reason that nobody competent to classify them has ever been asked to do so.  I have mentioned to the Minister the name of one person who <Col N="1311" /> is capable of making these classifications and I sincerely hope that he has taken the matter in hand, because the emphasis in all education in this country is rather too much on the practical rather then on the theoretical.  Remember what Oscar Wilde said about art: &ldquo;All art is useless,&rdquo; and, to some extent, all learning is useless.  I do not at all agree with anyone who says that a person who spends four or five years in a secondary school and then goes off, either by choice or necessity, to some ordinary job is any worse off for the four or five years he spent there after completing his primary education course.  Indeed, if it goes to that there is far too great an inferiority complex about the things that are really worth while in life in this country.  You are looked down on if you appreciate Beethoven; you are looked down on if you know anything at all about good painting; and you are regarded as a snob if you read anything but tuppence-halfpenny novels or Mutt and Jeff comics.</P>
    <P>There is a duty cast on all teachers who are responsible for the formation of the characters of the young people of this country to try to mould their minds in such a way as to enable them to appreciate the finer things of life. I appreciate the fact that, as an individual free nation, we are very young, but, at the same time, there is no reason why we should continue to have the traditional inferiority complex which has been bred in us as a result of centuries of oppression.</P>

      <P>It is they who supply to some extent the position of the priest and to some extent the position of the father and mother.  They stand as foster parents and as co-religious educationists during those vital years from four to 14.  They control the destiny of children from 9.30 or 10 o'clock in the morning until 3 or 3.30 o'clock in the evening&mdash;a substantial portion of any person's day. The behaviour of the teacher, his methods of teaching, whether he is flogging mere learning into the children or whether he is inducing knowledge and appreciation of things into them, all leave a mark on every child who leaves that teacher's school.</P>
      <P>In the same way, the rudimentary, fundamental religious truths are taught in the national school and many people leave this country without having much in the way of religious knowledge except what they get from their teacher at school, particularly those who leave between the ages of 16 and 17 and become migratory labourers.  I could not appeal more than I do to everybody here, in so far as they have any power, to mould public opinion&mdash;the minds, the motives and the behaviour of the people.  They, too, with the teachers should realise that, as a country, we still have an enormous amount of inferiority complex in the minds of the people.  They are still carrying over that legacy from the years of oppression, and it rests on us to do everything in our power to eradicate that and make the Irish people look forward to the future, not as something black, hopeless and miserable, but as something to be worked for, something to be lived for.  That is the root of the Budget trouble and that is why we have to ask so repeatedly our people to work harder. They should be proud to work in this country, but I am afraid that many of them are not.  I am afraid they are not being given sufficient assistance by those who are responsible for their development.</P>

      <P>It is up to us to decide how our young people are going to develop.  It is up to us to decide whether we are going to accept the methods that were used by our predecessors or whether we are going to hark back to the lesson taught by Pádraig Pearse.  For that matter, I think the Labour Party of whom Deputy Hickey is a distinguished member would do well to ponder on the meaning of the word &ldquo;worker.&rdquo; That has been bandied about in this House and outside as if it refers only to a person who takes a spade in his hand.  It has been bandied about even as distinct from the poor, unfortunate student.  I was a student myself and I cannot say that I worked terribly hard but I did a certain amount of work.</P>
      <P>Those who teach in primary and secondary schools are workers also. Those who go to the university and have their minds moulded there and have themselves equipped to control the mental development of those who follow them are workers in their own way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the case of the pensioned teachers to which reference has already been made by Deputies Ormonde and Corish.  The position of these teachers is, I am afraid, rather unfortunate.  There is a fallacy in logic known as the fallacy of the heap.  It can be explained very simply.  If you put a straw on the ground and another straw on top of it and then another straw on top of that you still have only three straws, one on top of the other. If you keep on doing that sufficiently long, you will eventually have a heap If, when you have a heap, you take off one straw and then another at what stage will you cease to have a heap and have only a number of straws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take a more homely example. At what stage does a person who is <Col N="1314" /> losing his hair&mdash;I am not to be taken as referring to any person near me&mdash; become bald?  Is it one particular hair which makes a person bald?  Before losing that hair he was not bald but after he has lost that particular hair does he become bald?</P>
    <P>The application of the fallacy to the position of the pensioned teachers, I submit, is that the Minister cannot go back.  He is now asked to go back a year or two and take in a certain number of teachers who retired in 1949. If he did that he would have to go back to 1948 and then to 1947 and eventually you would arrive at the position where it would be as well to take them all in.  The fact is that teachers have had a rather long struggle in this country in the way of getting just treatment for themselves.  They should be very grateful that they have now managed to extract from the State something by way of a pension and something in respect of a gratuity.  If they do not realise that those who retired in 1947, 1948 and 1949 are debarred from getting the pension and gratuity, then, I am afraid, they should resign themselves to the fact that the amount of money involved would be far too much and that they cannot expect the State to give gratuity to every teacher who retired in those years.  When those teachers retired they did so subject to certain conditions. They accepted them at the time and it was only when they thought that others had retired under conditions which were better than the conditions under which they themselves had retired that they put up their case.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy with the teachers and I regret that they cannot be accommodated.  I make that statement because I have many friends in the teaching profession and among the pensioned teachers who are complaining and while it is all very well to stand up in this House to make a plea for something which you know cannot be done, I think it is straighter and somewhat fairer to the people involved to stand up and say that you think it cannot be done, that too much money is involved and that their case is hopeless.</P>
    <P>Many of the residences provided for <Col N="1315" /> primary teachers are in very poor condition and I would suggest that the Minister should either sell them as they stand or have them pulled down and sell the woodwork and rubble.  He should give the teachers a loan of the amount of money he realises on those transactions and allow them to repay it over a reasonable period.  I cannot see any objection to that in practice because the monthly, half-yearly or annual deduction can be made at source from their salary.  In that way many rather unsightly residences could be done away with.  Some of them are situated in remote places which have become remote during the last 40 or 50 years since those residences were built. During that time unfortunately the number of pupils on the rolls of many schools has declined very sharply, so much so that some schools have ceased to be used as such while others have been reduced from four-teacher schools to two or sometimes even to one-teacher schools.  During the passage of years, therefore, some of these residences have become either redundant or obsolete and at the same time, I understand, the official view is that they should be used, on occasion involving great hardship to the teacher.  Isolated residences in remote places should be pulled down forthwith and the proceeds put into the kitty in the Department of Education.  Others which are in a poor state of repair should be either sold or pulled down and the material sold.  The proceeds should be given to the teachers as an inducement to build and the money should be stopped at source from their salaries over the succeeding years. While I am not suggesting that every teacher should have a palace, I do suggest that every residence in the country for which the Department of Education has any responsibility is a measure of its regard for its workers. Even tourists coming to the country who note the condition of some of these residences are shocked to think that the State allows broken-down, old-fashioned premises to house its teachers.  Perhaps in that way too the State would make a useful investment because these new houses would stand for a long time to come.</P>
    <Col N="1316" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree entirely with the previous speaker when he says that teachers should be very grateful for what they have extracted from different Governments.  Some teachers may feel a little grateful but when one thinks of their long continuous fight even to get what they have to-day, one sees nothing to be grateful for.  They have earned all that they have got; they have worked hard and anything they have got they are entitled to it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the lump sum I think it regrettable that the Government does not do something for teachers who retired before the fixed date, January 1st, 1950.  They were promised, I was promised&mdash;I raised the matter by way of question here several times&mdash;that something would be done but we were always put off, we never got a final decision and were told that they would get nothing.  The Minister would be doing a very gracious thing if he reopened the matter and investigated the claims of teachers who retired within a reasonable period of that fixed date. They are entitled to it.  Some of them, instead of being grateful, are very disappointed that they did not qualify for the lump sum.</P>
      <P>My principal reason for rising was to ask the Minister&mdash;I think he has some views on the matter&mdash;about uniformity of holidays for children.  I wrote to the Department last year about it.  I know a mother with five or six children three of whom are of school-going age. One has reached the Christian Brothers' school, the girl is at a convent and the other little boy is in an ordinary school in the centre of the City of Dublin.  The three children get holidays at three different times whereas they all could get them on the 1st July so that if the family wanted to go to Skerries, Balbriggan, Bray, or some other seaside place not too far from the City of Dublin they could all pack up at the same time, or if the children had an opportunity of visiting some country relations, they could all go together.  I was asked to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the day will come when the Government will see the desirability of giving all school-children holidays at a fixed time, say, from the <Col N="1317" /> 1st July to the last day in August. Then they will all know in advance when the holidays are coming.  At present the parent asks one child when he is getting holidays and on asking another gets a different reply.  The Minister should do something about it and also, as other Deputies have said, extend the holidays to two months.  It is well known in this city&mdash;I am only putting the Dublin point of view&mdash;that most reasonably comfortable workingclass families take a small cottage somewhere at the seaside for the month of July or August.  Do not break the months but give the children two months' holidays.  Let the parents pack up and bring them all together, not separately.  Let them know also when they must return to school as arrangements must be made for the children who are returning.  Also, in districts where they have school meals the contractors should know when to have the meals ready.</P>
    <P>The next point is the building of schools in new areas.  In the City of Dublin we have cleared whole parishes of a very large number of tenement houses, depopulating the area, and have left some fine old schools without sufficient pupils.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the municipal authorities will realise that it is not an unreasonable request, when they eventually get the sites, that they should rebuild the houses around the fine old schools and churches in the centre of the city and around the shopping centres.  Such schools should not be left without their pupils while parish managers have to raise very large funds to build schools in outlying districts.  It sometimes happens that there are hundreds and thousands of children living in new housing schemes for a year or two before any school accommodation is provided for them. I know the Minister's views on that. He thinks, in company with every other member of this House, that the moment the plans for a housing scheme are approved and the building starts a school should commence at the very same time so as to have it in readiness for the children who will come to the area.  Large numbers of children go to housing schemes in County Dublin or to schemes adjoining the city, and <Col N="1318" /> I feel it is unfair to ask the parish manager, who up to this had only to deal with a few hundred people, to provide the sum that is necessary by Government regulations in order to build a new school.  The Government should see to it that the grant for the building of new schools is increased in accordance with to-day's building costs.</P>
    <P>Very few people understand or are acquainted with the system of purchasing sites for new schools.  The moment the parish manager hears that a housing scheme is to be built in his area, by either a public society or by private persons, he has instantly got to pay a competitive price for land on which to build a new school.  In my view that is most unfair.  The educational authorities should provide him with a free site as part of their educational plan and, if they do not, power ought to be given by the Government to the local authority in a particular area to provide a site free of charge as part of the amenities of the whole area.</P>
    <P>Having provided a free site, the next thing is to make sure that there is a contented staff in the school.  As one of the Deputies who has just spoken pointed out, a contented staff to impart knowledge and a contented pupil at the receiving end is the best possible thing for the country.  In these days of difficulty for teachers and pensioned teachers, the Government should recognise the difficulties themselves, and make awards and payments accordingly without waiting for agitation for improved conditions.</P>
    <P>We have fairly well provided in this country for the mentally defective. Brothers in many parts of the country look after them very well, but what about the education of the physically defective?  A child whose arms, legs or body may be defective could quite possibly be capable of absorbing a good education but, unfortunately, he is confined to bed and can never attend school.  I must compliment the Government for having done splendid work in providing education for the mentally defective child, and I would recommend to them that the physically defective child's education should <Col N="1319" /> also be looked after.  I understand that there is a polio organisation in this country which is doing something for a fair number of such children. A deputation saw the Minister or some members of his Department about this matter of providing education for the physically defective child, and I would impress on the Government that this is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Corish and one or two other Deputies talking about the boy or girl who leaves school at 18 years of age.  These boys and girls are very fortunate to be able to stay at school until that age.  I have in mind the case of the boy or girl reaching 14 or 15 years whose parents cannot afford to keep him or her at school any longer.  We have seen photographs in the newspapers of queues of boys and girls awaiting admission to vocational schools.  We do not pay the vocational teachers a sufficient salary, nor have we a sufficiency of vocational schools.  I would implore the Government to make matters easier for the boy or girl seeking technical education. There is not room in the professions for everybody, and a good tradesman can go to any part of the world as long as he is skilled.  He can build houses in Canada, in Australia or in Dublin City, or anywhere else.  I am not advocating emigration, I can assure you, but in case people have to emigrate it would be well for them to have a trade.  I came across a few boys who were emigrating within the last few months, but they were fortunate in being skilled men and were confident that they would be a success.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the means test for scholarships.  I notice that one of my colleagues in the Dublin Corporation who is a very prominent, active and useful member of the scholarships committee is in the House at the moment.  I am sure he knows something about this matter.  The means test for scholarships is too high and the classification is too keen. Therefore, many of the boys who could compete for these scholarships if the means test were not enforced so severely, are debarred from doing so. There may be some little easement of <Col N="1320" /> the position, because I have not got any complaints during the last few months.</P>

      <P>I have not heard any complaints for the last few months, at any rate.  May I remind the Minister that the principal reason I stood up was to ask him about the uniformity of holidays? If he has any good news to impart I would ask him to impart it quickly so that it can be availed of for the summer holidays commencing probably 1st July.  It has been suggested to me&mdash;and I just mention it&mdash; by fairly sensible people that from the end of August to Christmas is a little bit too long for school attendance without a break of a day or two.  I wonder would the Minister consider the question of making some arrangement to have a week's holidays, say, at the end of October.  I was requested to put that suggestion forward.  The idea is not my own.</P>

      <P>This is a Department on which a Deputy would need a fair amount of courage to speak, in view of the fact that there are so many lawyers and teachers in this House. However, we who have lived our lives down the country can speak on many of the problems of education affecting us.  I am glad that the bad name which the Department had in years gone by is being left behind and that it is now getting the respect of the country to which it is entitled.  In years past teachers had grievances about salaries. That situation has been relieved and I am satisfied that the Minister's predecessor gave him a good headline.  The present Minister is a worthy successor. In him we have a balanced man and a man of character.  I am confident that he will have a good pull with the teachers and I believe the people all over the country will have faith in him. If he carries on the work in hands as he has been carrying it on, I think education will be put on a good footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that education, as far as this young State is concerned, is merely on a try-out.  We have had only 30 years of native government and we <Col N="1321" /> have not much opportunity to look back and see what are the results.  It takes some decades, or perhaps 100 years, to form the character of a nation.  I am satisfied that things are going reasonably well, as well as in any other country in Europe, or perhaps in the world.</P>
    <P>The other evening I was listening to Deputy Cafferky and I must say that I do not agree with him at all.  You would think that this was a country of illiterate people, that the teachers were useless and that the pupils could not read or write.  If Deputy Cafferky could go back 40 years, as I can, he would realise that in our young days there was hardly a man or a woman who could read or write.  Only one in every ten persons could do so.  The majority of the people were in a semi-educated condition.  While it cannot be said that we are an overeducated people we are turning out of our schools well-educated pupils who can read, write and think for themselves. Of course, we must admit that that is not everything that is needed.  What we are most in need of is greater emphasis on character formation.  That is more important than grinding children in various subjects.  What we should aim at is turning out good, balanced men.  Possibly, we are lacking somewhat there.  It is of no avail to blame the Department or the teachers.  The fault does not lie entirely there.  I lay the blame on the type of family life in which there is a looseness and a drift away from the home.  If we could get many of our parents to realise their responsibilities and duties, to inculcate a proper sense of behaviour in their younger children before they come to school, then the teachers would have a much easier task.  There is a lot to be desired in the raw material our teachers are getting in our schools in the way of children at the ages of six and seven. They are not reared in a proper way at home; they have no manners, no culture and no sense of proper conduct.</P>
    <P>Many of the children who come to school at those ages conduct themselves like wild Indians or wild boars. Therefore, the teachers have responsibility to exercise strict discipline and guide their pupils in regard to <Col N="1322" /> elementary conduct.  This is no easy job for the teachers, and they would want a great deal of patience.  I would like to impress upon the people throughout the country that the children would make much better pupils if they were brought up properly during the impressionable years, from, say, three to six.  At those ages you can give children a good foundation.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the ordinary man and woman who take their responsibility as parents seriously and bring their children to that state of conduct and character that is needed.  You will always find the teacher saying: &ldquo;I wish to God every child in my school was like those parents' child.&rdquo;  The teacher need not worry about such children from the point of view of their ordinary manners and behaviour and can start right away on the very important process of character formation. We need not try to throw the entire blame for any deficiencies in the children on the Department or on the teachers.  I hope these few words, rough and ready as they are, will take effect among all the families throughout the country.  If not, I am afraid the drift which is in progress will not be stopped and we will be brought into the same position in which other countries have been brought, who have different ways of living, are carefree and irresponsible, and do not worry what becomes of their nation as long as they have a good time while it lasts.</P>
    <P>The national teachers are the pivot of the whole activity of this country. Ninety per cent.  of the pupils with whom they deal never go any further than the national school.  I do not worry so much about those who go further, because their parents have sufficient cash to take care of them, I prefer to consider that very large percentage whose education finishes in the national school.  They are the largest part of the nation.  They have to do the hard work and the rough work down the country.  They have to carry on the nation.  We should spend all the money we possibly can on them.  I am afraid we are taking them away from the school at a wrong time. Fourteen years of age is a wrong time to allow them to leave school, because <Col N="1323" /> they are at a loose end between the ages of 14 and 16.  They are too young for employment and they are not much use at home.  I think the school-leaving age should be extended for two years.  I do not know whether the Department has that in mind, but I believe myself it should be done.  I see young people from 14 to 16 years of age going around the country no use to anyone.  They cannot be well controlled and they would be far better off at school.  Even if they were only being disciplined it would be worth while.  To offset any disadvantage in extending the school-leaving age by two years the children could get a longer school holiday in the summer, say two or three weeks extra.  I imagine this would be of considerable advantage to parents down the country who need their children to help with the crops, thinning turnips, making hay, and so forth.  I would ask the Minister to carry out the promise of a few months ago that he would favourably consider giving a longer summer holiday and, in conjunction with this, to increase the school-leaving age to 16.  In so doing he would be performing good work for the nation.</P>
    <P>We are living in very changed times. We need not think, however, that to-day's generation is any worse than the generation of 30 years ago.  I do not think they are.  We are living in a mechanised age and we are fast going into an atomic age.  It is a race with life.  Nevertheless the character of the people is just as good as it was 30 years ago.  I know there were harder times years ago than exist to-day. Children had more discipline.  The parents had a harder life and they were harder on their children than the parents of to-day.  The present generation has an easier way of life.  They have come into a free country.  They had not to face the hazards which the people of 30 or 40 years ago had to face in securing the freedom which we enjoy to-day.  I believe that there should be more taught in the schools to demonstrate what past generations have suffered and the sacrifices they had to make to bring about the conditions which are our heritage.  The <Col N="1324" /> children of to-day should be made proud of those achievements.  Many of those people were stripped of their possessions and endured many hardships to give the oncoming generations a chance to live in peace and comfort.</P>
    <P>The teachers to-day have many problems.  After the vocation of our clergymen the teaching profession is the most noble profession in this country.  It should be the most honoured and the most respected profession, as I believe it is.  Up to this it was not.  Previously most people looked down on the teacher as a person with a big salary who had done well for himself.  We realise that they are the hardest working men and women in the country.  As I said, they have the very serious responsibility of forming the character of the young, rough material entering the schools. I am satisfied that our teachers are making every effort to turn out good recruits and get good results.</P>
    <P>Many of our teachers are not allowed to slap the children.  If they slap children the parents come in threatening them.  The result is that they find difficulty in controlling the children.  If the children got more correction at home the teachers would have an easier task.  It is no wonder that at times teachers lose their patience with such children.  I am only saying that about the minority of the children. The majority of them are good and are sent to school regularly.  But you cannot expect teachers to get results when a child comes to school for two days in one week and one day more for the remainder of the month.  The Guards are supposed to get the children to go to school, but they never do it.  That is certainly never carried out.</P>
    <P>A good attendance at school is essential.  Children should not be kept at home except they are unwell or are needed for some very important task. The place for the young child is in the school.  After all, he is only there from 10 o'clock until 3 o'clock, and he is more of a nuisance at home than anything else.  There are parents who will make no effort to send their children regularly to school, and yet they expect big results.  When, after <Col N="1325" /> many years at school, these children do not learn anything, the parents try to blame the teachers.  Why should they not blame themselves?  If a child is kept to school regularly, he will be able to read and write unless he is a real dud.</P>
    <P>There are many children who do not attend the school for more than one or two months in the year.  When the teacher reports that they are not attending a Civic Guard takes a note of it.  The Guards visit the school periodically, but there is nothing done about it.  The teachers are not getting results.  They cannot get results if the parents will not do their duty.  Regular attendance at school should be enforced. Something should be done about children whose parents will not send them to school.  There should be special classes in the schools for this type of children.  There is no use in putting them into any standard if they do not attend regularly.  It is not fair to other children or to the parents of the other children if a good class in a school is held back owing to this irregular attendance.  When an inspector comes to examine the school he finds five or six of these duds in every class.  I expect he blames the teacher and perhaps makes a bad report on the school.  That is very unfair.  There should be a dunces' class for these children who do not go to school regularly.  There are, of course, some children who are lacking in brains but the teachers cannot do anything about that.  We must only do the best we can for these children.  They should not, however, be allowed to hold back the classes of those who are attending regularly so as to provide for their future lives.</P>
    <P>As to the revival of the Irish language, I am satisfied that immense progress is being made although we may not always see it.  It took 100 years to kill the Irish language and it will take 100 more years to bring it back. Since I was in the national movement 30 years ago a new generation has grown up who have a knowledge of the Irish language.  I have not got a knowledge of it myself as I was engaged in other activities.  My own children, some of whom are over 20 years of age, when the news in Irish <Col N="1326" /> is given on the radio and I am waiting for the news in English, are able to tell me every word of it.  Although they have not much contact with Irish speakers since they left school they are retaining the Irish language.</P>
    <P>What we want now is more moral courage in our people.  With the Gaelic League, the national teachers and the young clergymen who are fostering the Irish language we should be able to lay a good foundation so that we will hear the language spoken in the fairs and markets, at the church gates, and in this House by the people who know it.  I am satisfied that the Irish language is making progress.  It may be dwindling in the Irish-speaking areas in the West but it is not dwindling throughout the country.  All we want is courage and confidence and the putting down of those who say: &ldquo;What good is the Irish language? They are only turning our dunces.&rdquo; The people of this generation are living in freedom, peace and comfort, and they should take up the task of reviving the language.  This nation has its independence but it has not its own language.  If we had our own language we need not worry about foreign periodicals or anything else. The nation would be stamped with its own individuality and could defy the world.  Until we reach that position we will always be fighting to retain our own identity.  We will never do that unless we are a separate nation and have a separate language.  I am saying that as one who cannot speak the language but who would love to see it spoken generally by the children of the present day and those who will come after them.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways of furthering the language is by the Gaelic League. That is the pivot around which we should build throughout the country. The Gaelic League in the past did not do its work well.  If it did, it would certainly have made more progress.  It got around it a whole set of narrow cranks.  I knew them myself.  Behind that set of cranks there were hundreds of job-hunters.</P>

      <P>These people did a lot of harm.  They drove out the enthusiastic people who would not show themselves in the forefront.  At the annual gatherings of the Gaelic League people were saying that somebody was on the platform last year but he was not on the platform this year, that he had got a good job.  We want to get away from that.  We want a position in which the people will take part in the movement for the sake of the country and the love of the language.</P>
      <P>There are some of the old Irish teachers who are now employed in the vocational schools.  They laid the foundation for the Irish language and Irish culture and folklore but they never got any proper recognition for it.  They are in the same position to-day as they were 30 years ago.  Because they have not the higher educational qualifications, they are only employed in a temporary capacity.  They did trojan work in the days of the I.R.A.  They worked day and night for the promotion of the Irish language, Irish culture and Irish folklore.  These people should be put on a permanent basis.  They should get the recognition to which they are entitled. When they retire they should get pensions based on their years of service. People, however, are only waiting to shove them out because they have not the academic qualifications of the younger men.  They did their work in hard times.  Although they are doing their work very well at present they are not getting the recognition to which they are entitled.  Some of these old teachers are in my own county. They are men of the finest type who would not speak English to anybody. They kept the Irish language going even in the worst of times and in the remotest areas to which they were always sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county far more could be done for the Irish language.  We have a big number of migrants in that county from the West of Ireland who are nearly all Irish speakers.  There should be some way of linking them up with the language movement. There should be classes or schools started.  There was a time when the Meath people and the migrants did <Col N="1328" /> not like each other very much but that day has gone.  Although most of these people are Irish speakers no facilities are provided for them to spread the language amongst the people generally.  When the first colony of migrants was established 20 years ago a big school was built for them and they were facilitated in every possible way.  They are kept away from the mass of the people.  They are there as a little unit in themselves. Unfortunately, most of them did not settle down in our county.  The young people have left home and have gone to different parts of the world.  Only the old parents remain at home.  The aim of the Government was to spread the Irish language.  What effort was ever made to spread the language from those centres?  Tens of thousands of pounds were spent on those colonies. They should have been a focal point from which to spread the language in this part of the country.  Instead, they were left there and neglected.  The language is not radiated to all the people in that part of the country. There are scattered colonies of Irish speakers all over the county.  They love and speak the language.  In some areas there are ten, 15 or 20 Irish-speaking families but people who do not live in or close to these colonies have not an opportunity of getting a knowledge of the language.  Something should be done to remedy that matter.</P>
    <P>Irish classes are taught in the vocational schools throughout my county.  I consider that that is a waste of money and a complete farce and a failure.  The average attendance at these classes is three, four or five people.  Sometimes the teacher has to wait hours before they come.  That situation is not bringing us anywhere. The position will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Ten or 15 years ago I was very strong against vocational schools.  They were regarded as white elephants at the time, and for ten years or more people could not be got to attend the classes. The average attendance at a class was six or seven persons.  That was a waste of time and money.  Since then, however, the people have come to realise the importance of vocational education.  We now have full schools <Col N="1329" /> and we are proud of the pupils they turn out.  Year after year there is a big queue of candidates for each class and, as one year succeeds another, we have better attendances.</P>
    <P>I want a review of vocational education as far as my county is concerned and, I suppose, as far as the country in general is concerned. Is it right to build big schools in certain areas and, at the same time, neglect the vast amount of people in other areas?  We have three in the principal towns in my county and there are three in other areas.  However, there are people with young families who live long distances from these schools and who have no hope of sending their children to attend them. We must face the expenditure of large sums of money to attach to our national schools an extra classroom so that people in different areas will be able to get the same type of education at the same time.  It is most unfair that taxpayers in certain areas should have to pay for the education of children who are lucky enough to be near a school while their own children, because they live a long distance from the schools, cannot avail of the same facilities.  Millions of pounds should be spent on that work, because the character of a nation depends on the education of our children.</P>
    <P>Our vocational schools are most important and they will continue to be so.  I realise that it will be a big expense to attach an extra classroom to every national school and also to pay the teacher, but we shall save in other ways and it is important that our children should get the proper vocational education which they require.  A fine type of pupil is being turned out by those vocational schools. Unfortunately almost all of them are training for a job and do not intend to live in rural areas.  All our boys want is to be an instructor or a technical officer in some other area.  They will go to Dublin or to Cork but not one of them thinks of going back home and imparting some of the knowledge which he acquired to the people in a rural area.  Unless we can focus the minds of those living in the country on earning a living in the country instead of in the big towns we shall <Col N="1330" /> not get very far as a nation.  We want the minds of our people to veer towards the land.  The drift is away from the land.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is doing good sound work.  There is peace and progress at present.  While our teachers are reasonably contented they are not contented in the full sense of the word.  They are going to fight for their rights and they believe that they have rights.  They deserve everything that the nation can give them. They deserve the respect of the Department and the people, because from them will spring the learning of future generations.  They are doing a good job.  It is not the fault of the teachers or of the Department if there are duds to be found in this country.  The fault lies with the parents who allow their children to run unchecked around the countryside when they should be at school, where, if they are not able to learn, they would at least get character &mdash;and character is the foundation of any nation.  I hope more heed will be given to the matter of children who are running wild around the country areas when they should be at school. I do not know if the Gardaí are supposed to took after this matter, and if they are not they should be.  If a Garda sees that a child is not attending school and is instead running wild around the country, and asks the parents why the child is not attending school, the parents tell him that Johnny was beaten to-day and that his legs are full of blisters.  That is a lie.</P>
    <P>A teacher cannot teach a child who will not go regularly to school.  Children who go regularly to school, except in the case of illness, get a good foundation and can read, write and do their sums.  But the child who goes to school only three or four days a month will get nowhere.  He is holding back the class and getting bad results for the teacher.  The inspector will say that the pupils are not as good as they should be.  If there is a law in connection with the absence of children from school while the children are in good health, and if that law is not enforced, surely somebody is not doing his duty.  The matter should be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the primary school programme is very good and reasonable.  We hear people clamouring for the teaching of additional subjects such as drawing, manual work, and so forth.  I think the primary schools are meant to lay the foundations for knowledge&mdash;to equip the pupil, as it were, with the tools of knowledge.  I think it is right, in the main, to confine the primary school programme to reading, writing and mathematics.  The programme in the secondary school is quite varied.  I think there is too much of a tendency in the secondary schools to pick out those subjects which tend towards the procuring of a clerical situation such as a position in the Civil Service or in some local authority, and so forth.  I should say that 90 per cent. of the programme taught to the children in our secondary schools in the City of Dublin points in that direction.  I think it is a pity that more pupils are not taught chemistry, physics and possibly rural science even in the town schools. Very often pupils who have done the full secondary course and obtained the leaving certificate are seriously handicapped when they come to enter the professions by lack of knowledge of such subjects.</P>
      <P>The medical profession, for instance, has now become so overcrowded that in their preparatory courses the universities allow only two chances to students.  I think that is the case in the College of Surgeons and in University College, Dublin.  Because parents generally do not know the importance to their children of chemistry and physics, very often quite inferior students&mdash;I mean educationally infer-ior&mdash;get through just because they chanced to follow the right road, as it were, in their secondary course.  I should like the Department of Education if possible to use some influence to persuade secondary schools not to canalise their courses so much as they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the question of the ban on married lady teachers.  A number of them are in the service still but I think one of the greatest mistakes made was putting that bar against the continuance of ladies in the profession <Col N="1332" /> after marriage.  Strictly speaking, one cannot call it a marriage ban but it is a ban against remaining in the profession. That ban has already done a great deal of harm because parents are not nearly so ready now to encourage their girls to enter the teaching profession. When girls finish their secondary course at the age of 17 or 18, they can take a short grind and go into a clerical job&mdash;a shorthand-typist, clerk or some post of that description&mdash;without any further expense or any further waste of time.  For that reason, parents are more reluctant now to allow their girls to enter the teaching profession than they previously were.  That is one side of the question.  I think we are not getting as good material as we did in the old days because we have not such a wide choice in the selection of candidates.  One thing at least which I think the Minister and the Department should do straight away is to cancel the application of the ban to those who had actually entered the preparatory colleges at the time the rule was brought out.  The application of the ban to these ladies amounts to a breach of faith, as it were.  When they were going into these colleges they went there on a certain understanding, believing that they were entering a profession which they could follow till the end of their working days.  Then this ban was introduced with the result that the very best of teachers have been removed from the service.  I think that is a great loss.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the question is that married lady teachers on the whole are, I think, better teachers than single lady teachers.  You have excellent teachers among single lady teachers, but my own experience and the experience of those with whom I have conversed on the matter is that the married lady teacher was a wonderful asset in the schools.  They understood children and they had sympathy for them.  The married teacher herself was contented, as it were.  I think the service given by them was simply excellent.  Some people might argue: &ldquo;Why not allow girls to remain on in the Civil Service and elsewhere after they get married?&rdquo;  There is, however, a big difference.  These girls are not dealing with children, and <Col N="1333" /> I think the married lady teacher who has to deal with children, and children only, in her work is a most valuable asset.  The matter does not affect me or any relative of mine in any way, but looking at it quite objectively, I think it was a great mistake that the ban on remaining in the service was ever introduced.</P>
    <P>On the question of pensions, I have great sympathy indeed for those teachers who went out on pension some few years ago and previously.  The older teachers who went out on very meagre salaries have pensions that could not be dignified by the name of pensions; they are simply doles.  I think if it is right to adjust salaries and wages to the cost of living and living conditions, there is an equally good case for the adjustment of pensions to prevailing conditions.  I am very glad to say that I find general assent on every side of the House to that proposition.  In regard to the gratuity, I think in all justice teachers who retired just before January, 1950, should get the gratuity.  It may be a costly thing, but it is just to them.  We ought to be able to do as well as they have been able to do in the Six County area.  Deputy Palmer, speaking for the other side, stressed the question of salary and emoluments, and some criticism was passed on him for doing so.  I think that was unjust, as when he was making the plea for additional emoluments he was really making a plea for the betterment of education. There are more opportunities now for getting clerical and other positions than there were formerly.  There is a large extension in the Civil Service and under county authorities.</P>

    <P>This section deals with grants to funds of superannuation schemes.  I referred to this section last night.  Where <Col N="1336" /> persons are employed by an employer or where they belong to the same trade union, and where they have a scheme that is approved by the Minister, the Minister may pay a contribution into their fund instead of treating the members individually.  It is a new principle.  It was considered wise to keep a separate account, so that when the accounts are published each year every Deputy would be aware of what is taking place under this section.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often been put to me, and I am sure to Deputy Norton when he was in my place, that it was rather unfair where you had employees getting a pension&mdash;as in the case of Córas Iompair Éireann which was often mentioned&mdash;that it should be taken into account to their disadvantage for the old age pension.  I thought that the best way to deal with that was to take cases where there was a good scheme of that kind by a large employer or in the case of a trade union which had a very distinct membership&mdash;a trade union like the printers, where it is fairly obvious that men who go in would always remain and would not change to another union.  If they had a scheme of superannuation, the Minister would be empowered to approve of it and then, instead of paying any old age pension to their members, he would make a contribution to their fund and let them pay whatever superannuation is decided upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us examine that. This is a kind of provision that finds its way here because of the absence of retirement pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a retirement pension under this Bill, as was <Col N="1337" /> proposed in the previous Bill, the position would be that a person contributing under the Bill would automatically get a retirement pension at 65 if a man and at 60 if a woman; and a man would get a dependent's allowance for his wife irrespective of the age of the wife, and nobody could deny him the right to that pension.  Even if he had a pension from his employer, though it might be a small one, he would still be entitled to get whatever rights he had under the scheme operated by that employer.  Once he contributed under the previous Bill, he got the retirement pension and nobody had the right to deprive him of it.  That provision has been dropped in this Bill.  From what I gather from the Minister, he is taking power here to make some grants to bodies for a kind of staff pensions scheme, under an undertaking, or to a trade union.  Do I understand the Minister to say that instead of paying the old age pension he would pay the equivalent value into the kitty of the body operating the pension scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait, now.  How can he?  Take John Brown, who is a printer and who reaches 70 years of age.  There is no provision in the Act preventing John Brown from making application for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>John can make application. He may have a wife, and by halving the joint income he may qualify either for a whole or a partial pension. Does the Minister propose to say to John Brown: &ldquo;John, you are not getting a pension because we approved of your superannuation fund and I have already put into it whatever you might get as a pension if you were not a member of that fund&rdquo;?  Surely that is not contemplated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly that.  I would not say to John Brown that he would not get a pension.  What I visualise is that the scheme which these people would prepare would give such a retirement allowance to these people <Col N="1338" /> that they would be ineligible for the old age pension.  It would be higher than the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is not the way the scheme is going to operate. Those are uncharted seas so far as the section is concerned.  No one knows what the position will be.  John Brown may say: &ldquo;I am a member of the superannuation fund with my firm or trade union and I know that when I reach 70 my income has to be divided by two and I know what that will come to for myself and my wife.&rdquo; Looking at the table in the Bill he will say: &ldquo;In these circumstances I have a guaranteed right to an old age pension,&rdquo; and he can calculate the amount to which he is entitled.  Under the Minister's scheme it is left to someone else to try to formulate a scheme with whatever moneys are got from John, plus whatever moneys are going to be given to them.  There is a vagueness about the matter and I think the Minister should try to clear it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that this is merely an enabling clause. It is naturally very vague because of that, but when we come down to the individual schemes the Deputy may rest assured that no Minister would sanction a scheme unless the persons concerned would do better under it than they would otherwise do with a superannuation scheme and the old age pension combined.  Suppose an employer comes along and says that he will make provision for a pension of 15/- a week to his employees; in that case, the employees would be entitled to 21/6 under this Act, making a total of 36/6.  I might say to such a person that, if he improved the scheme and guaranteed £2 per week, I would give him a contribution.  This is a clause that enables the Minister for Social Welfare to negotiate with employers or trade unions.  Before a scheme is actually sanctioned any Orders that have to be made will probably require the approval of the Dáil or possibly further legislation before they can be brought to a conclusion.  This clause merely provides an opportunity for negotiating <Col N="1339" /> schemes.  Further legislation will probably be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is desirable to have it vague, then the Minister has hit the high-water mark because the section is delightfully vague.  In so far as this makes for any improvement, I am in favour of it.  In so far as it deprives John Brown of better rights which he might have under existing legislation, I must stand for John Brown's rights. The Minister should do one of two things.  He should require himself to get agreement under this or he should provide that any such scheme must be passed by a resolution of this House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to put the Minister in the position of having to come to the House for every one of a dozen or two dozen schemes that he may make in the course of a year, but he should make provision that any scheme devised will not be less beneficial to this legendary John Brown than anything he would get under existing legislation. The regulations made should be made in agreement with somebody who represents John Brown's interests and who can be relied upon to look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It says: &ldquo;The Minister may make grants.&rdquo;  He will not make grants unless the scheme is a good scheme.  I do not think the Deputy's argument holds any weight because if John Brown is getting less than he would otherwise be entitled to he will then be in a position to apply for the old age pension.  There is nothing to prevent him getting the amount he would be entitled to in old age pension. It may be assumed, therefore, that no Minister would come to an agreement unless he was getting something more than £2 per week because if John Brown is getting less he can apply for the old age pension.  I would not mind bringing in an amendment to the effect that any scheme must have the approval of the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

      <P>As far as I understand the section, it is introducing something new.  It is an encouragement to groups of persons, such as those mentioned in the section, to provide a superannuation scheme of their own.  That scheme is examined by the Minister and his experts and, if it is considered to be a good scheme, the Minister can then decide to make a grant towards it.  I think that is a desirable thing and I see nothing wrong with it.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 61 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if my interpretation of Section 61 is correct?  I think it is the same as the provision in the previous Bill.  Under this Bill we are repealing the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  Under that Act the position was that money was voted by the Dáil and paid to a fund which administered the widows' and orphans' contributory and non-contributory pensions.  That fund was kept at a certain level by means of allocations in order to enable it to meet the demands.  We are now repealing that Act, and we are winding up the pensions fund.  Consequently there will be no filtering in of moneys to the widows' and orphans' pensions fund to pay the non-contributory pensions.  Am I right in thinking that the purpose of this section is to provide that the non-contributory <Col N="1341" /> side will in future be paid through the medium of voted moneys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right.  At the present time both the contributory and non-contributory pensions are drawn from the fund, and the fund is replenished from time to time.  Under the new conditions that would seem to be a senseless proceeding.  Money will be voted by the Dáil for the Department of Social Welfare, and there is no reason why these pensions should not be paid out of voted moneys.</P>

      <P>When the ceiling was raised from £250 to £500 I came across a case where a man had been insured for 33 years, had gone over the ceiling at the £250, was brought in again at the £500 but died in less than a year after that.  His widow found that she could not draw a pension because she did not have 156 contributions since the last entry to insurance.  There is now an extension from £500 to £600.  Can such a situation occur again?  If it can I think provision should be made now to meet such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the position has not changed as far as that is concerned. When a man comes back again into insurance because of the ceiling being raised he must requalify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not quite as bleak as the Deputy thinks.  If a person is at present insured because he is under the £500 ceiling, as it has been until now, or the £600 ceiling in the future, that person can become a voluntary contributor.  Once he goes over the £500 ceiling at the present time, or the £600 ceiling in the future, he will be notified that he has gone over it and he will simultaneously be notified of his right to become a voluntary contributor.  He is told of his right to become a voluntary contributor.  If he exercises that right within 18 months, he can still qualify his widow for a widow's pension by maintaining <Col N="1342" /> his membership as a voluntary contributor. The real difficulty in this matter &mdash;I am wondering whether some greater emphasis could not be put on it&mdash;is that a lot of folk thoughtlessly think: &ldquo;Well, I am over the £500 mark now and I have not to pay this contribution each week in future,&rdquo; for getting that this small contribution qualifies his widow and children for a widow's pension.  They get that entitlement to a pension at a rate of contribution which is absurdly low by actuarial standards.</P>
      <P>I would like, if possible, that some greater effort should be made to induce a person who is passing out of insurance, on moving over the £500 or the £600 mark, to continue with his voluntary contribution, because the small contribution which he makes is trifling when compared to the very valuable benefits which he is assuring to his wife and children in the event of death.  He certainly has the right to do so, but the problem always has been to get such persons to take a sufficient interest in the matter to exercise that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the benefits which are payable for the small contribution that has to be made are very valuable. What I am afraid of is that you will hardly find one person in 100, when they reach that stage, who realises what it means for them not to continue the voluntary contribution.  That has been my experience.  I agree that some effort should be made to get people to realise that.  In fact, it might be well to make them realise it by having to pay some sort of a compulsory contribution for a period.  At any rate, I agree with Deputy Norton that some effort should be made to make such people realise what the position is going to be, should they die, as regards the pension payable to their widows and children.</P>

Take the case of a widow at 45 years of age.  When her children reach the age of 14, she loses the widow's pension and does not qualify again for a pension until she reaches the age of 48.  At the age of 45, she finds it very hard to get employment, even as a housekeeper.  I know one person who is minding her father, a man of 82 years of age.

      <P>There is no change as far as that is concerned, except a slight one.  Under the present law, the widow draws a pension until the children reach the age of 14 years, or if they continue to go to school between the ages of 14 and 16 there is the slight concession that she will draw the pension until they are 16.  She will also get her own pension.  There will, of course, be cases such as Deputy Hickey has mentioned of women going off the widows' pension and coming back again at 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the original Widows' and Orphans' Pensions <Col N="1344" /> Act was that if the widow did not qualify for a non-contributory pension she held the pension so long as there was one qualified child under 14 years of age.  When the youngest child reached the age of 14 years, the widow went off the pension and could not qualify again until she was 55.  In 1948, I amended the permanent qualifying age by bringing it down from 55 to 48.  Therefore, as a result of the 1948 Act, a person could requalify at 48 whereas previously she had to wait until she was 55.  I do not know what the cost of bringing the age down to 45 would be.  The figure is conjectural.  I imagine it would not be too easy to check it.  But some test could, I think, probably be made on what the cost of bringing the age down from 55 to 48 involved.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that between now and the Report Stage, and, in the light of the information he gets, see what the cost of bringing the age for requalification down from 48 to 45 would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I must admit that it is desirable to do something about it.  If we are going to make any change, I do not see any use in bringing it down to 45.  I think the amendment should be that the pension to the widow should continue.  That is what I would like to investigate, and see what that would cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point that I would like to emphasise.  I feel that it is not at all just that because one poor widow, whose husband was unemployed for a couple of years before he died, should be denied the non-contributory pension, while a widow whose husband was employed up to the time of his death should get the contributory pension, and at the same time be free to earn what she could. This is a problem which, I think, we shall have to approach in an entirely different manner from the way in which it is being approached.  My opinion is that, when the children reach the age of 14 years, leave school and go to work, the widow should continue to get the non-contributory pension.  I think that any other approach to this problem is altogether wrong.</P>

      <P>If you do bring the age down to 45, or to a lower figure, it means that if a woman gave birth to a child at 29 years of age, or at any time after that, she is qualified for a widow's pension because of the fact that the child was born.  That will qualify her for the pension until she is 45.  If you bring the figure down to 45, then she qualifies permanently.  It would meet 95 per cent. of these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why &ldquo;thirty-two&rdquo; is introduced is that the non-contributory widow's pension fixed under this Bill will be 20/- per week. <Col N="1347" /> Up to the moment it ranges from 10/- to 16/- a week, according to residence. She will also get allowances for the first two children of 6/- each.  That makes 32/- and it is obvious, of course, that anyone applying for pension in future cannot get more than 32/- a week and, therefore, it is put down here.</P>

      <P>There is a small point on the section.  The section provides that if any person entitled to benefit under the Bill is entitled to apply for home assistance and does apply for home assistance, the authorities investigating home assistance will not take into consideration any benefit except so far as such benefit exceeds 10/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This was originally 5/- until 1948.  In the 1948 Act it was amended to make it 10/- and it has been 10/- since 1948.  Bearing in mind the upward movement of prices since then, and as this does not involve any extra expenditure from a State point of view, would the Minister reconsider the provision with a view to adjusting the 10/- upwards, having regard to the increased cost of living since 1948?  It is 10/- since 1948.  By keeping it at 10/- the local authority would save certain moneys.  The State would not be asked to pay anything additional if 15/-, for instance, were inserted as <Col N="1349" /> a sum which would be disregarded by the local authority in assessing a claim for home assistance.  Probably it would not be doing any more than bringing the 10/- to its 1948 level. There is no additional expenditure involved so far as the State is concerned.</P>

They all stand now at 10/-, anyway. Personally, I cannot see very much in this clause at all because the public assistance authority are supposed to give subsistence.</P>

In County Wexford&mdash;the county which the Minister and I have in mind&mdash;they get 8/- per person in home assistance.  They <Col N="1350" /> reckon 8/- is sufficient per person when they come to the assistance of an individual or family and they will not have any regard at all for the section, no matter what the figure is.  The Minister said that they are bound to do certain things, but so far as local authorities are concerned, with their alleged interest in rising rates, it is pure theory so far as that type of assistance is concerned.

She is not getting the pension from England or here.  I mentioned a case yesterday of a lady who is getting a pension from the Northern Government, but who gets only 10/- because she is living outside what they call the State.  Although she is living in Ireland, she does not get the increase.  There is also the case of a woman whose husband died in England, having been there for ten and a half years.  She is not getting the full pension because she is not living in England.

A man employed as a seaman with any British company will not receive the grant in respect of a newlyborn child, unless the confinement takes place in some part of Britain or the Six Counties.  There is a case for the Minister taking that type of thing up with the British Government, with a view to seeing whether some satisfactory arrangement can be come to.

      <P>This is the same as the section in the previous Bill, but there is one point to which I want to refer, in the light of the discussion yesterday with regard to the people who may now be exempt from the scope of the Bill, according to what the Minister said.  The section provides that no person shall after the appointed day be insured or deemed to be or treated as insured (a) under the National Health Insurance Bill, 1911, (b) under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, or any scheme under that Act, or (c) under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, and this throws us back to the position of the voluntary contributor. If it is proposed, as the Minister indicated yesterday, in reply to representations made, to respect the position of the voluntary contributors who are covered at present under the National Health Insurance Act, it will be necessary to make some provision in this Bill, or in regulations to be made later by the Minister, to carry these people's rights into the future under the National Health Insurance Acts, because they have been voluntary contributors in the past and presumably will continue to contribute for disability benefit and treatment benefit in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Sub-section (4) preserves the right to certain moneys which may be due to the fund immediately before the appointed day and holds these moneys for whatever new fund is created under this Bill.  Under the 1945 Unemployment Insurance Act, the State owes to the unemployment insurance fund a sum of approximately £1,500,000 in respect of persons who joined the Army during the emergency. The State undertook to pay into the unemployment insurance fund contributions for these folk in respect of every week they served in the Army. On discharge from the Army, it was contemplated that they would be entitled to unemployment insurance benefit by virtue of the contributions paid on their behalf, so as to give some sustenance until they were able to rehabilitate themselves in civilian life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the State did in the 1945 Act was to pay no contributions&mdash;the State did not pay the contributions it was liable to pay under that Act&mdash;but to send the soldiers discharged from the Army to the employment exchange, where they were paid the ordinary rates of unemployment insurance benefit out of the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; which was already there, but the State did not put into the fund the contributions which it undertook to pay under the <Col N="1354" /> 1945 Act.  I understand that the position at the moment is the State owes about £1,500,000 under that Act to the fund.  I know, of course, that the Finance Department were seeking to escape paying that contribution, and it would surprise me if they will pay it. Perhaps the Minister would say what the position is in regard to the £1,500,000 which the State owes for soldiers' contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the claim made by the Department of Social Welfare on the Department of Finance over 12 months ago was more in the region of £1,200,000.  It was for the reason stated by the Deputy that the Department of Social Welfare had continued to cover the soldiers.  When they came out, these soldiers drew benefit.  That matter is being pursued.  I must say that I am not too clear as to what benefit we would get by making the Department of Finance pay up because the fund is being invested and the purpose of the investment is that the Department of Social Welfare will get a certain return from that fund, but the Minister for Finance will have to make up the remainder.</P>

      <P>This section is the same as that which was in the previous Bill. There was provision in connection with &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo;.  The Minister may appoint such day and different days if necessary for the different purposes of the Act or for the same purpose in relation to different cases or classes of case.  Yesterday we discussed the question of exempting certain persons from the scope of the Act.  What I would call the Minister's attention to is the necessity for making provision to ensure that he does not make an appointed day operative in respect of a class of worker whose position <i>vis-á-vis</i> exemption from the Bill may not have been decided at the time the Minister makes the Order.</P>
      <P>Suppose this Bill is passed and the Minister makes the 1st July the operative date for the Bill but at that time has not made regulations clarifying the position in respect of those classes which may be exempt from the scope of the Bill, I want to make sure that whatever rights they have will be safeguarded before the Minister makes the appointed day operative for the purpose of bringing this Bill into operation.</P>

    <P>I do not think it is necessary to deal with this in detail because it was discussed very fully on the Budget when the old age pensions were increased by 1/6 per week.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 77, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides for the assessment of the old age pension amounts that are to be paid from 21/6 down to 6/6.  It relates to means. I have been asked to make an appeal on this section to the Minister to insert a clause or a sub-section in the section to provide that military service pensions will not count as means, and that special allowances under the Military Service Pensions Acts will not count as means either.  Under the old Bill, I think there was provision whereby a proportion of the special allowance would not count as means for the purpose of the Old Age Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy look at paragraph (g) of the Seventh Schedule on page 64?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (g), to which Deputy Norton has drawn my attention, refers to</P>
      <P>&ldquo;an allowance, special allowance, dependent's allowance, disability pension or wound pension under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1949, or a combination of such allowances and such pensions except so far as such amount exceeds £80 per year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to remove that limitation of £80, so that a military service pension, a special allowance or any other allowances mentioned in paragraph (g) of the Seventh Schedule will not count as means for the purpose of old age pensions.  A strong case has been made by members representing the organised Old I.R.A.  They have asked me to put that point to the Minister on this Bill and I do so.  I think there is no necessity to point out to him why that should be done.  I do not think it necessary for me to refer to the services rendered by these men to the State.  When they reach the age of 70 and are entitled to the old age pension, I think that everyone would agree that, because of their services to the State, that pension should be paid in full without any deduction because of their receiving any military pension.  I feel that, in pressing the Minister, I am pushing an open door. I would ask him to consider this and bring in an amendment on Report providing that such a person should receive the maximum old age pension without any deduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go back over the speech I made on the Second Reading or on the Budget.  I think that we could discuss the proposed increase of 1/6 per week to old age pensioners without heat or acrimony.  I have reckoned, and I think that any Deputy in the House will discover, that the withdrawal of the food subsidies will mean increased expenditure of 2/1½ per week from the 1st July next provided that the old age pensioner continues to buy 6 lb. <Col N="1359" /> of bread, the ration for a while back, ½ lb. of butter, ¾ lb. of sugar and 2 oz. of tea.  It is proposed in this section to compensate him or her to the extent of 1/6 per week.  I do not think we are doing full justice to the people over 70 by asking them to pay that increase and offering them as compensation 1/6 per week.  Even if we admit for the sake of argument that a gap of £15,000,000 had to be bridged this year to balance the Budget and that the people of the country must make some sacrifices, work and produce more and pay more in taxes, I do not think that anybody in the State would say that a sacrifice should be demanded of the old age pensioners. For that reason I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision to grant a mere 1/6 per week to these people. The 2/1½ I have mentioned is not the whole story; there is the smoke and the drink, which will cost more.  The result of the Budget, even taking this relief into consideration, will be that the old age pensioners' standard of living will be affected very much to their detriment.  If a sacrifice is demanded from the country I think that there are enough of us to make it without making the old age pensioners suffer.  The Minister should at least compensate the old age pensioners who will have to pay more than the 1/6 offered to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in the City of Dublin and I know in my own constituency certain old age pensioners who live alone.  There are also many old pairs, both receiving the old age pension, living in one room and paying rent.  That type of person which we have in Dublin finds it more difficult to make ends meet than the pensioner who lives with a son, daughter or any other relative and who is not paying rent.  Where the old age pensioner is paying rent and obtaining fuel, even though he can obtain it through the machinery for cheap or free fuel under the board of assistance, he has great difficulty in making ends meet.  Some arrangement should be made&mdash;it may not be necessary to make it in the old age pension provisions&mdash;to supplement his old age pension to enable him to <Col N="1360" /> pay rent, to buy fuel and meet the ordinary demands of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be of course that this amendment has its roots rather in the Budget and its consequences than in social welfare; at all events we will meet the problems here in this Bill by the amendment which proposes to grant 1/6 per week to old age pensioners to compensate them for the effects of the Budget.  I think of course that 1/6 is absurdly inadequate having regard to the impact of the Budget on the lives of these unfortunate people.  Everybody knows that the old age pensioner lives in the main on tea and bread and butter.  That represents fish for him and it represents meat for him.  His invariable meal is tea and bread and butter.  He is lucky enough if in his circumstances and at his age he can do anything more than that.  You might say that, in the main, these are the staple articles of diet of ordinary old age pensioners, particularly those who receive no assistance from better-off relatives.  What we are doing under this Bill is giving effect to a proposal made in the Budget speech to provide 1/6 a week as compensation for the effect of the Budget on the old age pensioners' domestic budget.  We are saying that, in our view, 18d. is sufficient to compensate him for the increased price which he will pay for 21 meals in the week by reason of the fact that in the future his tea will be dearer, his butter will be dearer, his sugar and his bread will be dearer.  If he is a human being who smokes cigarettes or smokes tobacco or likes to take a drink, to which perhaps he was accustomed in his more youthful life, then he must compensate himself for the additional charges in respect of tobacco and liquor plus all the additional charges in respect of these four or five items of foodstuffs which represent his means of subsistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will attempt to say in fairness that offering 18d. per week extra to an old age pensioner to cover the cost of a higher price of 21 meals in the week, plus the additional cost of tobacco and liquor, represents fair compensation.  The Minister ought to take back this proposal to the Government with a view to securing a substantially higher increase for old age <Col N="1361" /> pensioners in particular, because, in the main, no exertion or ingenuity on their part is ever likely to result in their being able to increase their present income.  The allowances provided for in the Bill are absurdly inadequate in view of the impact of the Budget on the lives of these unfortunate people.  The Minister and the Government generally ought to provide for the payment of a higher allowance to old age pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised, first of all by Deputy Cowan as regards special allowances, disability and wound pensions, and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>And military service pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will leave that to be dealt with separately.  Such persons are covered to the extent of £80 per year.  I am not sure of my authority on this, but if a person has no other income I do not see why he would not get another £50 means test allowance. He is entitled to an allowance up to £1 a week without having his pension reduced, so that if the Deputy has in mind a wound pensioner or disability pensioner who has no other means, he could actually draw up to £130 a year and get an old age pension.  He is the only person who has no other means who would be entitled to £80.  Such people are definitely getting £80 more than anybody else.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other points raised, I have no desire to revive the discussion on the Budget because I am very anxious to get through this Bill, but I cannot agree that 1/6 is not sufficient to cover the increase in cost of the four items&mdash;tea, sugar, bread and butter.  These figures have been given more than once.  I have not got them with me now but they could be produced.  If the person is drawing his ration only the increased cost would be between 1/6 and 1/7.  If he is drawing less than the ration the increase will not be so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly I do not feel that an old age pensioner will draw less than the ration because I agree with Deputy Norton that the old age pensioner is depending to a great extent on tea, sugar, bread and butter.  If he draws <Col N="1362" /> more than the ration his case is a bit better because, if he was drawing more than the ration of, say, bread, tea or butter, he was paying more for the extra ration than he will be paying under the new circumstances.  Consequently, it is the man who is drawing exactly the ration, neither more nor less, who will be suffering most on account of the increased food prices; and even taking that man who is drawing exactly the ration, his increased cost is somewhere between 1/6 and 1/7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister, I am confirmed in the belief that both this Government and the last Government have a similar attitude in regard to the old age pensioners.  I could never understand why we were so niggardly in regard to these people. The maximum benefit they received is 21/6.  Two weeks ago we were informed by the Taoiseach that the £1 to-day could only purchase 9/9 worth of goods as compared with 1938 and 1939.  We can discuss this matter for a week or a month, but it will not alter the fact that the individual old age pensioner has to live on 21/6 per week for the seven days of the week.  To divide that 21/6 by seven gives you 3/- a day, as Deputy Cowan says, to pay rent to provide heating and light, food and clothing.  Surely it is time we concentrated our minds on that consideration rather than on the compensation he will have by giving him another 1/6.</P>
      <P>It is amazing how these things can be brought home to every one of us. Last Saturday I met an old age pensioner on the street; he held me up, and his comments as to how the Dáil were treating the old age pensioners were anything but complimentary.  He pulled ½ oz. of tobacco out of his pocket and he said: &ldquo;Here is what I got for 1/-, ½ oz. of tobacco.&rdquo;  That is the reality of the situation as far as the old age pensioner is concerned.  If he wanted to go out and get a pint he would have to pay 3d. more for it.  I am not stressing the subjects of tobacco and drink, but I know cases of men and women who are over 70 who have to live on the old age pension, and I can never understand why either this Government or the last Government were so niggardly about giving something more to them.</P>

      <Col N="1363" /> Surely, if they got another 2/6 or 5/- they would not be putting it in the post office or the bank.  It is money that would go into circulation.  It would not be misspent, but would be used in the service of the community.  We do not want to be scoring points on one side or the other, and I would appeal to the Minister to ask the Government to consider increasing the old age pension. It is time we faced up to that problem.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to deal, first and foremost, with the point I made in regard to the matter of special allowances and dependents' allowances, etc., as set out in paragraph (g) of the Seventh Schedule.  I would say it to the Minister that his interpretation that £130 can possibly be received by one of those applicants without affecting his old age pension&mdash;and that may be so&mdash; makes the case all the stronger for treating the complete amount received in those allowances as not being means for the purpose of this Act.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I know it would have a very good effect if those persons who had served with the old I.R.A. and, as a result of their services, had qualified for pensions, would get this special credit now for those services.  I would also impress on the Minister, what has been strongly put to me, that military service pensions should not count as means for the purposes of this Act.  I would ask the Minister also to indicate that he will consider that between now and the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether it would be possible for the Minister to give some allowance to the old age pensioner who lives alone or with his wife, and is not receiving any assistance from a relative?  It would be a great help if these people could be given some special allowance to cover rent and fuel&mdash;a charge that would not be upon an old age pensioner living with a son, a daughter or some other relative.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe assured us and the Taoiseach assured us that the new price of tea would be 5/- per lb.  When the new prices come into operation, the old age pensioner will have to pay 4d. extra if he wishes to buy an additional 2 oz. of tea; it will cost him 5d. extra for ½ lb. of butter and 1¾d. extra for ¾ lb. sugar.  I think we are agreed on both sides of the House that bread is the staple food.  When the new prices come into operation, 6 lb. of bread will cost 2/1¾d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 6 lb., which will cost the old age pensioner 1/7¾d. after 1st July.  Two ounces of tea does not last a man or a woman of 70 years of age very long; these people make tea four or five times per day. Neither does ½ lb. of butter last them very long.  I would say that 6 lb. of bread might be adequate, but ¾ lb. sugar would not.  Again, we cannot ignore the fact that an old age pensioner requires an ounce or half an ounce of tobacco, a bottle of stout or, as I said before, even a small whiskey or a Baby Power the day he draws his pension.  Again, let me repeat that if the Government demands a sacrifice from the taxpayers of this country, they should not inflict the hardships brought about by that demand on the people of 70 years of age and upwards. If the Government made a demand on <Col N="1365" /> me to pay an increase for this, that or the other thing, I would say to myself that I could bear that demand because I am a reasonably young man.  However, it is not fair that the old age pensioner should have his living standards depressed at the present time.  I feel that the Government and the Minister should indicate that, in view of the proposals contained in the Budget, they will consider giving another shilling or two to the old age pensioner so as to compensate him for the increase in the cost of living that will take place from the 1st July onwards.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Corish and Deputy Cowan have said as regards this increase to old age pensioners.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party have a lot of sympathy with those people.  I am sure that the Minister and the Government will do anything they can for them to alleviate their hardship.  They are the one section of the community, I would not like to see suffering.

      <P>I asked the Department of Social Welfare to investigate the possibility of differentiating between the old age pensioner living alone and the other type of old age pensioner&mdash; the one living with a son, a daughter or other relative.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to regard a military service pension in much the same light as retiring allowances for a teacher, a civil servant or anybody else.  We must regard it as being in that category when considering it as means when it comes to an application for an old age pension.  I cannot see how we can differentiate in that case, or take it out for special mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point that would be against that was the point made by Deputy McGilligan when Minister for Finance.  We were pressing <Col N="1366" /> him very strongly to give an increase to military service pensioners at the time when other pensions were increased.  He said then&mdash;I think he made the official case&mdash;that military service pensions were not pensions in the sense of retiring allowances; that they were just allowances paid to a man because of special services and, because of that peculiarity, he would not consider increasing them in any circumstances.  I say that that being so, it would give an interpretation to the military service pensions that would entitle the Minister to consider leaving them out as means for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that that is a good point.  We can consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That section can be looked at through the Seventh Schedule.  In the Seventh Schedule there is a provision made for exempting disability and wound pensions from means, provided that such means do not exceed £80 per annum.  In the previous Social Welfare Bill I broke new ground by putting in that provision. It was the first time that wound or disability pensions were excluded from the point of view of calculating means for old age pension purposes.  I think the calculation which I then made was that the provision covered approximately 75 per cent. of those who were at the time in receipt of wound or disability pensions.  I do not regard the provision as absolutely ideal.  Personally I would welcome an extension of that amount, but at all events it is the first time a move was made to exclude these pensions for the purpose of the calculation of means on application for an old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly I notice that the Minister has embodied in sub-sections (h) (1) and (h) (2) a liberalised means test produced by me in the 1948 Social Welfare Act.  That will continue to operate in future.  Likewise I notice that in sub-section (2) of that schedule he has also given effect to the proposals which I indicated on the previous Social Welfare Bill would be introduced which encouraged the assignment of land by farmers to sons or daughters so as to encourage early <Col N="1367" /> marriages and at the same time assure the father who owned the land that on such assignment an old age pension would be virtually guaranteed to him. These things, taken together, represent quite a substantial liberalisation of the means test as previously applied. In that respect they have everything to commend them.  I do not say that we ought not to go further; I think we should go further as circumstances permit.  But from my point of view I am glad to see that these provisions which were previously announced are being copied in the schedule.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (g) of the Seventh Schedule, there is a point I should like to raise.  This makes provision for excluding amounts under £80 per year from means where that sum is received by way of a disability pension, but the exclusion is only made in respect of persons who served in our Army.  Cases were brought to my notice, and I must say that I sympathised with them to such an extent that I proposed in my Bill to meet the claim where persons who served in the British Army and were receiving small disability or wound pensions approximately equivalent to the types of pensions granted by our own Army, were denied their entitlement to an old age pension simply because the British Government paid them a pension in respect of the maiming or other injury which they sustained in the war.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I felt it was a bit unfair that because another Government paid an Irishman for having been maimed in the war, we should say to an estimable citizen of our own country: &ldquo;We will give you nothing because the British pay&rdquo;, the inference clearly there being that if the British paid him nothing we would have to pay.  If the British merely paid him for the injuries sustained in the war, perhaps permanent injuries, it seemed to me unfair and unreasonable that we should say to that person: &ldquo;Because the British Government have given you a disability pension in respect of wounds you have suffered, we will give you no old age pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are statistics available of the number of persons who might come <Col N="1368" /> under a clause of this kind if it were extended to cover, say, wound or disability pensions from the British Army, and I do not think that the cost would be very considerable.  I proposed to meet it when the matter was raised with me on the previous Social Welfare Bill.  I suggest that in a matter of this kind where we are dealing with human beings who have been disfigured or otherwise maimed, it is not reasonable that we should make a discrimination between one and the other.  I ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the matter with a view to the introduction of an amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For one thing, I think we should at least expect reciprocity.  It would be hardly fair to expect this country to make provisions dealing with those who served with British forces if the British Government were not prepared to do the same thing for our I.R.A. pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, from that standpoint the people who would be effected would be only those working in Great Britain.  If they work in Great Britain, they qualify for retirement pensions as a matter of right, and there is no means test whatever. What you are trying to do now is to compare a situation in which we operate a means test with a condition of affairs in Great Britain in which a person contributes and no means test operates.  There is a completely different set of circumstances there.  I do not know of anybody who would leave here to live in Great Britain on the wound or disability pension he gets from this Government.  If you look at the wound and disability pensions which are being paid, you will see that, <Col N="1369" /> with the exception of people who held very high rank, the amount of the pension in many cases would not keep a person on a coconut island.  Anybody in Great Britain who has an I.R.A. pension is in a job.  The fact that he is in a job gives him the right to a retirement pension.  Firstly, it proves that he is not 70 years of age; secondly, it proves that, if he is working there, he is entitled to a retirement pension without a means test.  That is not a substantial reason for closing your ears or your sympathetic mind to the proposal which I make.  I urge the Minister not to allow that reason, which I think is purely superficial, to influence him against the suggestion which I make.</P>
      <P>If an Irishman served in the British Army or Navy&mdash;the reasons which prompted him to serve are not my business or anybody else's business as he had a perfect right to do it&mdash;and was maimed as result of the service and survives until he is 70, it seems to me harsh and unfair to say to him; &ldquo;Because you have a British wound or disability pension, we will give you no old age pension.&rdquo;  If he were to ask the British Government not to give him the wound or disability pension we would then have to give him an old age pension.  Why should we put him in that position?  He has paid dearly and probably is continuing to pay dearly enough for the pension he has got in respect of his past army service.  Why should we heap a further burden on him by applying a very rigid means test which is modified in respect of the pensioners of our own Army?  There is not much involved from a financial point of view and from a humanitarian point of view we ought to try to meet it.</P>

      <P>I support the appeal made to the Minister in this matter by Deputy Norton.  I am personally aware that a number of my constituents have been affected by the existing penal legislation in regard to the payment of old age pensions.  The number of persons who would be affected if the Minister could see his way to respond to Deputy Norton's appeal is very small, and the cost would not be very much.  Those who would be <Col N="1370" /> affected are mainly those who joined the British Forces in response to the appeal of the leaders of the Irish people at a particular period.  I am certain it is not the desire of the Minister in a matter of this kind to penalise people who responded to the call under the circumstances which obtained at that time.  I have seen the details of the figures.  I believe that the figures which were submitted to me are on the Minister's file.</P>
      <P>I was informed by the leaders of the British Legion that the Minister received a deputation in connection with this matter.  I hope he will not close the door to the appeal that has been made by Deputy Norton to extend the provisions of the Bill to cover the small number of people who are concerned at the moment.  I ask the Minister not to close the door and to give the matter further consideration.</P>

      <P>(5)  Where a claim for a widow's (non-contributory) pension is made during the period beginning on the 5th day of July, 1952, and ending on the 4th day of October, 1952, by the widow of a man who died before the 4th day of July, 1952, and the claim is made after the expiration of three months after the death of the man, the pension, if granted, shall commence to accrue on the 4th day of July, 1952.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary way, if a non-contributory widow applies for a pension within three months of the death of her husband, and if it is allowed, she gets the pension from the date of the death of her husband.  If she applies for a pension when a period of more than three months has elapsed since the death of her husband the pension, if awarded, is given from the date of application.  Under this amendment&mdash; on account of the changes, and so forth&mdash;the pension will apply backwards whether or not the application was made within a period of three months of the death of the husband.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there should be no difference between the non-contributory widow's pension and the contributory pension.  It is a great injustice to penalise the widow and orphans of a man just because he was not in benefit at the time of his death. Consider the plight of the family of a <Col N="1380" /> man who, during his lifetime, suffered a good deal of unemployment. Because he was unemployed or was only in casual employment, he was not in benefit at the time of his death.  The penalty is passed on to his widow and his orphans.  That does not happen in the case of the widow whose husband was in permanent employment at the time of his death.  We find that there is a difference of 4/- in the case of a widow, 5/- in the case of a widow with one child, and 6/- in the case of a widow with two or more children.  I should like to know why that penalty should be passed on to the widow and her orphans because her husband was not in benefit when he died.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that the widows of workers who were not in benefit at the time of their death through no fault of their own, are not penalised.  It is unfair that the punishment should be passed on to the widows and orphans.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, and have all widows and orphans put on the same basis.</P>

      <P>We discussed yesterday the position of those employed by the State, either in the Civil Service, the Defence Forces or the Gardaí, of those employed by local authorities, and their relationship to the Bill.  The Minister indicated his own view was that they would be exempt subject to making a provision that a voluntary contributor could maintain the right to continue in insurance for the purpose of widows' and orphans' pensions.  Is there any hope that the Minister can get the position clarified before the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 1 and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Disability benefit or unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution conditions for disability <Col N="1385" /> benefit or unemployment benefit are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that not less than 26 employment contributions have been paid in respect of the claimant in respect of the period between the claimant's entry into insurance and the day for which the benefit is claimed, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that not less than 50 employment contributions have been paid in respect of or credited to the claimant in respect of the last complete contribution year before the beginning of the benefit year which includes the day for which the benefit is claimed,</P>
    <P>but, as respects unemployment benefit, employment contributions under paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to this Act paid in respect of the claimant shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of each of the foregoing conditions the number of employment contributions which have been paid in respect of the claimant.</P>
    <P>I discussed this question on an earlier amendment.  This is the way we propose dealing with women who are in domestic service or in agriculture to decide whether they would be entitled to unemployment insurance or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A most difficult thing in connection with this Bill and the previous Bill was to explain to people why it was necessary to have 50 contributions to credit in order to be entitled to benefit.  Most people thought that that was an unreasonably high number of contributions to require and it was almost impossible to explain, without having the Bill before one, that it was a relatively easy condition to fulfil since when you worked you got your contributions marked up and if you could not work, because you were sick and there was no work available, you were credited with contributions in respect of the weeks you were ill or the weeks you were not working.  In that way it was not too difficult to fulfil the condition of having 50 contributions.  For the purposes of the record, I want the Minister <Col N="1386" /> to confirm that that is the manner in which this Bill will operate.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the purchasing value of the £ in February for each of the years 1940 to 1952 inclusive, taking the value at February, 1939, as the base, and what will be the estimated purchasing value when the subsidies are withdrawn from certain foodstuffs in July next under (a) the former cost-of-living index and (b) the present index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the value, at prices ruling in February, 1939, of the quantum of goods, purchased at retail (including rent), which could be bought for £1 in February of each of the years 1940 to 1952, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that, assuming all other prices entering into the interim cost-of-living index (essential items) remain as at mid-February, 1952, allowing for the changes in prices following the withdrawal of certain subsidies on foodstuffs in July next, £1 at that period would purchase the same quantum of goods at retail (including rent) as 9/- at the prices ruling in February, 1939.  This estimate, and the figures given in the statement already referred to, are based on the <Col N="1388" /> present official interim index (essential items) linked to the former index at August, 1947.  It is not possible to make such a calculation based on the former cost-of-living index alone, for any period later than August, 1947.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>VALUE at prices ruling in February, 1939, of the quantum of goods purchased at retail (including rent), which could be bought for £1 in February of each of the years 1940 to 1952, inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1392" /> Local Government if he is aware that the Cork City Manager has decided to use hardboard to cover the inside walls of 36 bungalows at Ballyphehane, Cork, instead of plaster; and, if so, if he will state (1) which course is the more economical, (2) if the proposed hardboard is manufactured in this country and (3) whether, in view of the fact that plasterers are now freely available, he has satisfied himself that it is advisable to sanction this change at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a decision to the effect indicated by the Deputy has been made in relation to 30 bungalows at Ballyphehane.  The use of hardboard was specified in relation to one bedroom in each of 20 of these houses and the extension of its use to the entire interior would require my approval.  This has not yet been officially sought.  The city manager's views on the specific points raised by the Deputy appear to be (1) that there is very little difference in cost and that the use of hardboard may prove more economical; (2) that the hardboard is of Irish manufacture; and (3) that plasterers are not available to an extent that will enable due progress to be made with the work if the plastering provisions in the specification are followed.</P>

      <P>Ón uair a bhí sé ina ógfhear ghlac sé páirt ghníomhach sa troid ar son na saoirse.  Dlúth-chara do Sheán Mac Diarmada ba ea é.  Chónaigh sé ar fea tamaill mhaith in aon-tseomra leis agus is minic a théadh sé ar theachtaireachtaí uaidh chuig Tomás Ó Cléirigh, Pádraig Mac Piarais, Tomás Mac Donnchadha agus treoraithe eile de chuid Cásca na bliana 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cheangail sé go luath sna hÓglaigh agus throid sé in aghaidh na Sasanach agus ar thaobh na Poblachta go dtí an Sos Comhraic deiridh.  Bhí sé ina chomhalta de Shinn Féin ón mbliana 1917.  D'oibrigh sé go dícheallach ag bunú Cúirteanna na Poblachta san Iarthar.  Bhí sé ina Chathaoirleach ar Chomhairle Bhaile Bhéal an Átha ó 1919 go 1932, agus ina Chathaoirleach <Col N="1396" /> ar Chomhairle Chontae Mhuigheo ó 1922 go 1926.</P>
