    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Malting Barley Price.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that, at the conference representative of county committees of agriculture, over which he presided at a Dublin hotel on 16th January, 1952, the price expected to be paid for malting barley during the coming season was discussed and if he will accordingly state whether he indicated to the conference any knowledge the Government had as to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the conference to which the Deputy refers is the Food Production Conference which was held on the 16th January, 1952, which I addressed, but at which the Minister for Agriculture presided. It can hardly be said that there was a discussion on the price of barley at that meeting.  There was an incidental reference made to it by some of the speakers in regard to the relative profitability to the farmer of wheat and barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, the only knowledge I had with regard to the price of barley was the arrangement that had been made for the 1951 crop, that is a minimum price of 57/6 per barrel, with the stipulation that not less than 2/6 per barrel would be paid for the crop above the average British price, and any references that were made to the price of barley at the meeting were interpreted by me as referring to that arrangement which I expected was to continue.  It was only on the following day, when the advertisement from Messrs. Guinness appeared, that I was <Col N="1422" /> aware of a new arrangement regarding the position.  The Minister for Agriculture was in the same position, except that he informed me that he had heard that there were rumours that some change had been made.  That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Agriculture discussed with the grain committee of the beet growers' association some seven days before the conference to which the Taoiseach has referred the question of the relativity of the price of wheat with that of barley and was it possible to have such a discussion when the new price then disclosed had already been fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know&mdash; that is, from later information&mdash;the new price was arranged on the 8th January, and if you take it that that discussion took place some seven days before the conference, surely you cannot draw any conclusions from that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I think it is unfair that <Col N="1426" /> Deputy Corry should advertise the port of Cork as being unable to receive large ships.  Recently a ship having 10,000 tons of grain docked at Cork.  I resent the implication that Cork Harbour is unable to cope with larger types of vessels.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware (a) that no form of entertainment, such as concerts, cinema performances, dances or operas, of which copyright music forms a part, may be held in this country without first obtaining a licence from the Performing Rights Society, Limited, of London; (b) that this society recently obtained an injunction in the courts restraining a musical society from carrying on an entertainment without their licence; (c) that this society collects 5 per cent, on all receipts of such entertainments, amounting to over £50 in some cases; and, if so, if he will have a copyright or performing rights society of our own established and thus prevent this <Col N="1427" /> restrictive trade being operated by a foreign concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy at (a) in his question.  The licensing system to which the Deputy refers applies only to the musical works controlled or owned by the society.  I have no knowledge of the litigation to which the Deputy has referred at (b) in his question. As regards (c), my information is that the fees charged by the society in respect of the performance in public of the copyrighted works controlled or owned by the society are scaled on the basis of seating accommodation, frequency of performance and type of entertainment.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension about the position of the Performing Rights Society.  It is an organisation of composers, authors and music publishers, and its function is to maintain and safeguard the copyrights of its members.  The Deputy will appreciate that copyright is a property and that the owners of copyrights are entitled to be paid for the use of the works of which they hold a copyright and that it is open to them at any time to withhold permission to use those works.  The exercise of this right by a copyright owner is not a restrictive trade practice.  Where private property is concerned, as it is in this matter, it would be for the individual owners of the copyrights to take action, if they so desired, to set up an Irish society in place of the society to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that every year, during the low-water period, the River Shannon in the vicinity of Athlone is badly choked with masses of weeds, making it almost impassable for boats and rendering its appearance very unsightly; and, if so, whether he is prepared to make arrangements to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>

      <P>The responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works in the matter of clearing weed growths from the River Shannon is confined to the removal of growths which might interfere with traffic on the navigation channel, and this work is carried out as necessary.  The commissioners have no responsibility for the general clearing of the weeds from the river.</P>

      <P>Might I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that this river is used extensively by boating parties&mdash;tourists and local people? The local association have made repeated representations to the Board of Works, to the Shannon Navigation Company and to the Electricity Supply Board to try to pin-point some responsibility in this connection and cannot establish what body is responsible.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House who is responsible for this work if his Department is not?</P>

Could we get that information so that the people themselves could bring pressure to bear upon them?</P>

      <P>The powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out drainage works are derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, which contemplates the execution of schemes on a catchment area basis and not of piecemeal drainage works, such as are mentioned in the Deputy's question. The removal of sharps and other obstructions from the River Blackwater would be done by the commissioners under that Act only as part of a comprehensive scheme for the entire River Boyne catchment.  It is not, accordingly, proposed to arrange for the survey of the River Blackwater suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember that in a reply to a previous question on this matter on the 4th July last I informed him that a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of a site for this health clinic was made by the local authority in October, 1950, and an Order confirming the Compulsory Purchase Order was requested. An objection to the Order was made on behalf of the occupier of the site in question making it necessary to hold a public inquiry.  As a necessary preliminary to appointing an inspector to conduct this inquiry, the local authority were asked on 20th January, 1951, to forward certain documents in connection with the Order.</P>
      <P>These documents were received in my Department on the 25th October last and arrangements are being made and will shortly be completed for the holding of a public local inquiry in connection with the Order.</P>

It is possible that these estimates, taking into account the number of houses completed since 1947, do not accurately represent the present needs in all local authority areas.  In cases where such a course is clearly necessary I have drawn the attention of local authorities to the desirability of making fresh surveys.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the Kildare County Council are very anxious to take steps under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, to relieve flooding caused in North Kildare by the River Blackwater; and, if so, whether he will provide a special grant to meet the cost of the engineering survey that would first be necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if the Kildare County Council have requested his sanction to an increase in the retaining fees and other remuneration payable to members of the fire brigade; and, if so, if he will state the date of such request and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 22nd August last the Kildare County Council requested sanction to certain increases in the remuneration of part-time fire brigade personnel employed by them.  The matter has been under consideration in conjunction with similar proposals from other local authorities.  I propose to give a general ruling in the near future enabling rates of pay to be varied by local authorities in a manner which will, I think, work out not less favourably to the employees concerned than the proposals submitted for sanction by Kildare County Council.</P>

    <P>*At Albert Agricultural College and Cereals Station, Ballinacurra.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1943 the pedigree seed available at the Albert Agricultural College and at the Cereals Station, Ballinacurra, was allocated to selected growers for further propagation. Under this arrangement it was difficult to ensure that the identity of the produce of the foundation stocks was retained and that such produce was used for seed purposes in subsequent years.  With a view to the propagation of the foundation stocks on a large scale a company entitled Pedigree Growers, Limited, was formed with the approval of my Department in 1943.  This company undertook to grow under contract with growers the foundation stocks made available to them by my Department and to resell the produce to seedsmen for further propagation.  The arrangement with the company in regard to the propagation of wheat ceased in 1950.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;&mdash; (Minister for Industry and Commerce.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that the principle of this Bill has been accepted by all those who have spoken in this debate.  It is true that there has been some criticism in regard to the fact that two boards are to be established under the Bill to control the tourist development industry and publicity.  I do not think there is very much in the criticism that has been made in that regard if we take it that each board will have separate functions to perform.  An Fógra Fáilte will be called upon to carry out an intensive publicity campaign not only in this country but, what is even more important, outside the country in order to encourage tourists to come here.  An Bord Fáilte, on the other hand, will be called upon to promote the development of the tourist industry.  Now, these are two separate specific functions which can be performed efficiently by each board.  If we were to say, as some person might logically say, that all activities connected with tourism should be brought under the control of one board, it would follow, I think, that transport, which is a very important activity in regard to tourism, would also require to be brought under that board.  Again, as regards the development of tourism, we have to consider that local authorities play a very big part in the provision of amenities in regard to the tourist industry.  There, again, it might be suggested that they, too, should be brought under this board.  I suggest that, if the matter is <Col N="1461" /> carefully examined, there is not any reasonable case for objecting to two distinct boards carrying out separate functions, provided, of course, that these functions are clearly defined.</P>
      <P>As I have said, there is nothing perhaps more important in regard to the development of the tourist industry than efficient transport not only within the limits of our own territory but also in the conveyance of passengers to and from this State.  When the Minister was a little younger and perhaps a little bit more ambitious, he did seek to establish a transatlantic air service for the purpose of bringing tourists directly from the United States to this country.  That particular activity was cut short by the Minister's successors. I wonder whether, when they abolished that service, they did so from some constructive motive, or whether they were acting just as children act when they destroy other children's toys.  Anyhow, it is not the intention of either An Bord Fáilte, or of Fógra Fáilte, which is being established under this Bill, to control transport, but I am quite sure that An Bord Fáilte will take a very keen interest in the transport services that have been provided to and from this country, and also in the transport services within the limits of our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of general policy outlined in the Bill which was referred to.  I think that Deputy Giles, when speaking last week, objected to tourism on the grounds that it might possibly demoralise our people.  His suggestion, apparently, was that the morals and the nationality of the Irish people are so tender that they require to be kept under a glass case so that they will not become contaminated by outside influences.  I do not share that view.  I think that our nationality and our religion are more robust than Deputy Giles seems to think.  On general principles, I think it will be accepted that, while we will do everything possible to encourage tourism here, it is not the intention of this Bill, and I am sure it is not the intention of the Government, to lower moral standards in order to encourage tourism.  There are small countries in Europe which encourage and promote <Col N="1462" /> tourism by developing intensive gambling systems, but I am sure that such an intention is not implied in this Bill. I do not think that would be the intention of any Government here.</P>
    <P>So far as the provisions in this Bill in regard to the licensing laws are concerned, I am not too well informed on those matters, but, as far as I can see, these provisions seek merely to give to tourists, staying in our hotels, facilities similar to those which, in the normal course, would be enjoyed by people living in the country.  Having regard to the circumstances under which tourists live, being only a short time in a country, it is necessary, I think, that hotels should have this additional accommodation.  How far we may go in that direction is a matter upon which there might be considerable discussion.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is, as I have said, first of all to attract tourists to this country.  For that purpose, there must be world-wide publicity. When I say world-wide, I mean that there must be publicity in those countries which are likely to send tourists here.  In that connection, it would seem to me essential that Fógra Fáilte should be equipped with powers to advertise our tourist attractions, to advertise them in the Press and in the magazines of other countries where it is possible to do so.  I would imagine also that the radio would be utilised for that purpose.  Just as we have the Hospitals Trust sponsoring a programme over the radio each evening, there is no reason why Fógra Fáilte should not also have a sponsored programme directed towards people abroad who might be inclined to visit our country.  In the same way, short films could be produced showing the advantage of this country from a tourist point of view, thus helping to attract additional numbers of visitors here.  I assume that if and when shortwave broadcasting is adopted it will be possible to broadcast propaganda to the United States, and in that way bring not only to the notice of our own people there but to American citizens generally, the amenities and attractions which this country can offer to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> Some Deputies seem to have a rather poor opinion of the &ldquo;returned American.&rdquo; Very strong views were expressed in relation to him.  The Deputies who expressed those views may have been a little bit unfortunate; they may not have met the right kind of &ldquo;returned American&rdquo;. We all know that the Irish-American is inclined to boast when he returns home but I do not think we should assume from that, as one Deputy did, that when he goes back to the United States he will continue to deride us and disparage the country.  He may express a certain contempt or disapproval of our attractions and amenities while he is here but I am quite certain that, if he runs true to form, he will proceed to boast about the fine country he came from when he returns to the United States.</P>
    <P>There is immense room for development in relation to publicity.  Large numbers of the citizens of the United States bear Irish names.  These names connote for them a definite association with this country.  I think it would be good publicity to publish in periodicals and newspapers circulating in the United States historical sketches of the various families whose members are now living in the United States. I am sure there are hundreds of thousands of Murphys in America and I am sure every Murphy would be anxious to know the history of the Murphy family, where it came from, the spot on which the ancestral castle stood and the part the family played in the making of Irish history.  Information of that type would encourage Irish-Americans to visit the homeland.</P>
    <P>In answer to those who sought to disparage our nation and its attractions from a tourist point of view, there is no harm in reflecting upon the views expressed in the Christenberry report.  If that report does nothing else, it does at least encourage us to count our blessings.  In the Christenberry report it was pointed out that from an American point of view tourism here to-day is comparatively cheap. That may come as a shock to those amongst us who talk so frequently about the high cost of living and high <Col N="1464" /> prices farmers are getting for their produce.  In the report it is clearly indicated that Ireland offers an attraction to American tourists by reason of economy.</P>
    <P>Another surprising feature mentioned in that report is the fact that our summer days are much longer than they are in parts of America.  I must admit that I was not aware of that, but it is mentioned as one of the attractions here; we enjoy a longer period of daylight in summer than do the people in certain parts of America.</P>
    <P>Again, we are not, perhaps, inclined to appreciate our ancient monuments. Yet our ancient castles are looked upon by tourists as an attraction.  There is need in this regard for the Tourist Board to encourage a little more local knowledge on the part of our people in relation to ancient monuments, ancient castles and attractions of that kind.  Local patriotism is always a good thing and it is equally a good thing that our young people should know and appreciate the historic features of their own parishes or counties.  From a commercial point of view, that knowledge is also valuable in order that the tourist may be in a position to obtain information in relation to historic features from any local person he may happen to meet. If we had a little more instruction on these features, not only in the schools but also through the medium of lectures and classes in local areas, that would be a very useful national work and very helpful from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>The Christenberry report referred also to the friendliness of our people. Politicians may be inclined to assume that we are not a friendly people.  The conclusion was definitely reached in the report that we are on the whole a friendly people and, whatever little disadvantages we may suffer from the point of view of our climate, they are more than offset by this friendliness. I hope that will continue to be a characteristic of our people.</P>
    <P>Our much condemned weather receives kindly mention in the report. Some of us may think we have the worst climate in the world.  Apparently people who endure prolonged periods <Col N="1465" /> of brilliant sunshine find a little shower of rain now and again very desirable.  Our cloudy skies are sometimes more attractive from their point of view than the unchanging brilliancy of their skies.  We should, indeed, feel that we have something to offer to tourists and we should have confidence in embarking upon a certain amount of public expenditure in view of the fact that people from outside the country have commented favourably upon the attractions the nation has to offer.</P>
    <P>In regard to the activities of An Bord Fáilte, there has been a certain amount of criticism.  Some appear to think that the grading of hotels constitutes an unwarranted interference with the ordinary day-to-day business of hoteliers.  I think, in reason and common sense, if we are embarking on a fairly considerable amount of public expenditure with a view to bringing tourists to this nation, we ought at least insist that those people who are induced to come here will be given a certain minimum standard of comfort and catering.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when this Bill comes into force, some justifiable criticism of the Tourist Board inspectors will have been considered so that it will be avoided in future.  There are two particular types of inspectors who have incurred a good deal of displeasure.  We have the inspector who comes into an hotel and who offends and insults the hotel keeper in the presence of his staff and in the presence of his guests.  I think that is something that should not happen.  It is unnecessary even for the improvement of hotels generally.  A courteous and competent official could very easily achieve all the purposes it is intended to achieve without giving offence to the hotel keeper and certainly without giving offence to him in the presence of guests or the staff.</P>
    <P>There is another type of inspector who has incurred considerable displeasure, and that is the inspector who is courteous to the hotel keeper and everybody in the hotel but, when he gets away out of sight and out of reach, writes a very adverse report which completely spoils the whole effect of the goodwill which he has achieved <Col N="1466" /> during his visit.  There again that is not quite necessary.  If an hotel is very badly run or very grave faults are found within the hotel, I think the courteous thing to do would be privately to bring its faults to the notice of the hotel keeper.  With goodwill, courtesy and efficiency on the part of inspectors, a good deal of the dissatisfaction that has existed can be removed.  Everybody who is reasonable and who wants to see the hotel business graded upwards will agree that inspection is necessary.  All that is required is to make it as unobjectionable as possible while maintaining efficiency.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another very important matter which, I think, I should mention because it will play a very big part in the development of tourism. This Bill provides for the improvement and extension of hotels but it must be recognised that there is another Department of State which, immediately an improvement of an hotel is reported, will send out another kind of inspector who will examine the building with a view to raising the valuation. In some cases comparatively small hotels have had their valuations doubled and trebled because they sought merely to bring the standard of the hotel up to modern requirements. I think it would be a very good thing &mdash;it would go a long way towards making this Bill more beneficial than it is &mdash;if a stay were put upon increasing the valuation.  If, as I have said, a period of seven years were allowed to elapse from the time construction work is carried out until the valuation is increased, that would be an encouragement to the hotel keeper to spend money upon improvement work.</P>
    <P>We all know that when we talk about hotels we are not talking about big companies with large finances developing a number of large hotels. In the main the majority of hotels are of the smaller type.  We are talking about the small, privately-owned hotel. While we hope that tourism will continue to improve and expand, we have got to look at the two sides of the question.  Tourism is purely a seasonal business and a hotelier, who depends almost entirely on tourism, has to maintain what is, in effect, &ldquo;a white <Col N="1467" /> elephant&rdquo; for eight or nine months of the year.  He has to keep in proper repair a large building which is in many cases subject to damp, particularly if the hotel is near the seaside where it is subject and exposed to all the attacks of weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I think it ought not to be assumed that, because tourism does show signs of becoming better, improving and expanding, the hotelier possesses something in the nature of a gold mine.  I think he has nothing of the kind and I am in complete agreement with those who hold and insist that charges in the hotels should be kept at a reasonable level.  It would be wrong and entirely bad for the tourist industry if excessive charges were allowed in view of those circumstances. In view of the fact that while their charges are regulated to a considerable extent and that their season for earning money is quite short each year, I think it is desirable that they should be encouraged to enlarge and extend their buildings.  That encouragement should be given not only through the aids which are provided under this Bill but also through a temporary exemption from any increased valuation.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to grade hotels so that any person coming to this country can see at a glance what is a first-class hotel and what is a second-class hotel. I think it would be a very good thing&mdash; I believe this was suggested in the Christenberry report&mdash;if some attractive sign were to be placed on every hotel if it were graded &ldquo;A&rdquo; so that a stranger coming into a town or a village would see at a glance where the hotel was situated.  In the same way, it is desirable that road signs should be erected.  The local authorities should erect road signs and all signs should be clearly defined and attractive pointing out places of particular interest.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I might mention that in West Wicklow, through the activities of a county association and also through those of that very deserving body, the Dublin Wicklowmen's Association, we have in the Glen of <Col N="1468" /> Imaal, a monument provided in memory of Sam McAllister.</P>
    <P>That monument takes the form of the reconstruction of the building in which McAllister lost his life.  It was a very praiseworthy work, but the Glen of Imaal, as the Minister knows, is far removed from any kind of main road and tourists wishing to visit that particular monument would find it extremely difficult to locate.  Therefore, good road signs in this connection are very desirable so as to ensure that tourists will not miss points of interest as they travel through the country and so that they will be able to reach them by the easiest and the quickest route.</P>
    <P>Again, I am sure that steps will be taken to open up areas which are centres of scenic beauty but which are out of reach of the general public or the travelling public because of inferior roads.  I hope the Tourist Board will find it possible to assist the local councils to improve roads leading to some of our outstanding beauty spots. Grants of that kind would be very well spent.</P>
    <P>One does not like mentioning one's own constituency but it is hardly necessary to say that the various beauty centres of County Wicklow are to a great extent isolated by reason of the inferior roads cutting through the mountains.  We would have no roads at all in the Wicklow Mountains if it were not for the fight put up by Michael Dwyer and the efforts to hunt him down, which made it necessary for the then Government to provide roads through the mountain districts of Wicklow.  But there are certain of these roads which could be improved and by their improvement a centre of Wicklow would be opened up to tourist traffic.  That would be an amenity and an advantage not only to tourists visiting this country but to our own people, particularly the people in the City of Dublin, who would find this attractive scenery a great boon, being quite near them.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, one of the most important features of this Bill is the proposal for the establishment of local development companies and the provision of finance for the establishment of these companies.  No organisation <Col N="1469" /> is really alive unless it is supported by local bodies.  A big office in the City of Dublin may be run very efficiently but unless there is local interest and local support that body will be to a great extent a white elephant.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to define what exactly is a tourist centre because there are many places in this country which are not regarded as tourist centres at the present time but which could, with development, be made very attractive to tourists.  I believe that in every such local area there should be a local organisation whose primary purpose should be to improve that area from the tourist point of view and to attract tourists to it.  One of the most important things would be the organisation of tours to the various centres. Assuming there is a local development company established, that company should undertake to organise bus tours or other types of tours to the various centres of interest around that locality. That is a work which a local body could do.  It is not generally recognised that the majority of those who avail of holidays to-day are not exactly similar to the people who used to take holidays 50 or 60 years ago.  To-day the ordinary working people of Great Britain, of other industrial countries, and of Ireland also, find that they can afford now and again to take a week or a fortnight's holidays, and it is only right that they should.</P>
    <P>It is also not generally recognised that the people who seek holidays outside their own locality are not always very clear in their minds as to the enjoyment which they desire.  It is because of that fact that organised holiday camps were established in recent years.  The promoters of those camps are cashing in quickly upon a need which exists because there are numbers of people who cannot make up their minds as to what form of enjoyment they intend to take.</P>
    <P>What is done by the promoters of holiday camps can be done more efficiently by a local development company in each area, that is to say, this local development company would not only bring tourists to a district and provide them with better amenities but <Col N="1470" /> would also take some measures to organise daily amusement for those people, to bring them together perhaps in a holiday centre and send with them a guide who would take them to the various spots of interest.  That is work of a constructive nature.  It is work that would bring a great advantage to any tourist area that would undertake it.  I think it was Deputy McQuillan who expressed regret that the people of Roscommon were not allowed to shoot themselves.  We in Wicklow might have a similar complaint.  There are vast areas in Wicklow where the local people are not allowed to shoot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone would object to Deputy McQuillan doing so either.  I believe what he really meant was that there are mountain areas and moor areas which are preserved and the local people are not allowed to shoot there.  That is something which cannot be allowed to continue. Under this Tourist Bill measures ought to be adopted to correct that state of affairs.  Where you have a large expanse of mountain or moor area which is at present controlled, and possibly reserved in some cases to people living outside our national territory, those areas should be acquired and, if possible, they should be acquired by the Tourist Board and leased then to a local body who would take care of the game rights of that area and would ensure that the game stock in the area was increased as far as possible so as to provide amenities, not only for the people residing in the county or the area but also for the people who would be invited there by the local authorities.  In that way new attractions would be provided for an increasing number of tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already said, one of the disadvantages from which this country suffers is the shortness of the season. I feel that the season would be greatly prolonged if we were to undertake this matter in a businesslike way.  People who go on holidays so as to enjoy the hunting and shooting of game are not so much concerned about warm weather or about climatic conditions generally. <Col N="1471" /> We could attract a considerable number of tourists here by restocking our rivers.  Of course, these rivers should be under the control of the local development company.  These are attractions which are within our reach to offer.  I fail to see why we should not be able, to an ever-increasing extent, to offer better shooting, better fishing and, even in a limited way, better hunting.  It is true that many of our hunting clubs are rather exclusive and, perhaps, a little bit old-fashioned. I feel that that state of affairs ought to be remedied also and that our hunting ought to be developed with a view to encouraging more tourists into the country.</P>
    <P>There was one matter to which the Christenberry report referred, and rightly referred, and that was the fact that bus conductors, taxi drivers and the like are not sufficiently versed in the knowledge of local tourist attractions. The suggestion that these people should receive at least some instruction with a view to their being able to impart to any passenger or tourist a knowledge of the district through which they are passing would be to the advantage of the tourist industry. Everything that helps to make the visitor to this country better satisfied with his holiday and better pleased with everything he has seen and heard will help to ensure that next year and the year after the number of tourists will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>There is very little else left for me to say except to recommend this Bill to the House.  There may be details of the Bill with which some of us might wish to express dissatisfaction.  However, as far as the Bill in general is concerned it is a marked advance on existing conditions and I feel it offers to this nation hope for the development of what is, in effect, a new industry but at the same time one of our largest industries&mdash;second only to agriculture. Since it is second only to agriculture it will have to be fully developed so as to afford a substantial increase in our national income and so as to reduce that adverse balance of payments about which all Deputies feel so gravely concerned.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Cogan leaves the House might I ask him to read page six of the synthesis of the report on tourism and he will see there that the strictures which he passed on his colleague, now on that side of the House, Deputy Brennan of Donegal were unjustified and that Mr. Christenberry was most specific in stating that the word &ldquo;breathtaking&rdquo; was to be applied to Donegal, as it was applied by Deputy Brennan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Cogan in regard to this tourist question is that Deputy Sweetman has tried to make himself familiar with the question by reading the whole of the report whereas Deputy Cogan is merely trying to persuade the people that by reading the report here and there he studied the question but, in fact, he did not.  I was only tempted into that remark by certain other observations which Deputy Cogan made towards the end of last Thursday evening and by the provocation which was given by Deputy Burke in the speech which he made from the Government Benches.</P>
      <P>I want to discuss this Bill on its merits and without regard to any question of politics, but for the benefit of Deputy Burke, if he ever does read this debate, might I suggest to him that if he looks up Volume 38, No. 1, of the 22nd April, 1931, he will find there a statement by the Tánaiste which, had he read it in advance, would have prevented him from having the exuberance to make the suggestions which were made here by him last week.  However, I just want to make that reference in passing.  I want to bury them so far as my contribution is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to consider two problems in connection with this Bill&mdash; the general problem of tourism and the method of dealing with the problem. In his review, when he was introducing this Bill, the Minister made one fundamental <Col N="1473" /> omission and one fundamental mistake with regard to the general problem.  Might I say, before I say anything else, that, in view of a certain position which I hold in another place, any views to which I may give expression are my own and not those of the body of which I happen to be a director? I feel that the Minister's one fundamental mistake is also inherent in the title which he has given to the renamed board.  There is not the slightest use in our spending vast sums of money in this country to attract outsiders into it if, at the same time, we make no effort to ensure that our own people get holiday facilities in this country.  There is no use bringing people here from Britain, no use from the point of view of balancing our import trade or from the point of view of the business of those engaged in tourism if, at the same time, we are sending out substantial numbers of our own people across Channel to the Isle of Man, to Blackpool, or to other tourist resorts in Britain or abroad generally.  We have got to remember that there are two aspects to tourism. There should be the aspect of trying to provide for our own people.  The holiday-maker's approach is apart from the tourist approach.</P>
    <P>A tourist has, of course, been defined by the League of Nations&mdash;I think it was the last official definition&mdash; as a person who spends more than 24 hours away from the country in which he normally resides.  The whole of the Minister's approach in introducing this Bill was towards getting at the tourists and there was no suggestion at all that it was also essential, as it is essential, to ensure that proper facilities exist for our own people and that proper facilities exist to develop a holiday traffic amongst, and for, our own people.  One of the things that the Irish Tourist Association did in its early days, which has not been mentioned here at all, was to provide an incentive to groups of people of one kind or another in industries to build up holiday savings clubs and in that way to make certain that, when the time came for these people to take their holidays, they would have preliminary arrangements made to take their holidays in this country.  Unless <Col N="1474" /> we take somewhat similar steps now and make sure that such people realise that they are welcome in holiday resorts in this country, we are not going to get towards the tourist industry as a whole that understanding and general appreciation necessary to make the industry a success.</P>
    <P>Apart from that aspect, that it is essential that we should cover our own people as well as covering those coming from abroad, we must get, I agree entirely with the Minister, a much wider understanding of the effect that the tourist industry will have and can have on the national economy.  One thing that did a considerable amount of damage to the tourist industry was the antagonistic atmosphere that was created some years ago by the famous luxury hotels speech.  That did more damage to the cause of tourism than anything else that ever happened in this country.  It was because of the wrong approach that was made at that time, because of the wrong understanding that was deliberately engendered amongst our own people by that luxury outlook, that we had some of the difficulties that arose.  I accept without question the new outlook that has now been adumbrated in this regard as envisaged by the speech made by the Minister.  There is now to be clearly, as there was not then, a policy of co-operation with those in the industry, a policy of co-operation particularly with those in the hotel industry, and there is not to be, as there was then, a policy in which the State, through the medium of the Irish Tourist Board, was to set up a number of new hotels and to operate these hotels in opposition to hotels run by private enterprise and in opposition to existing hotels.</P>
    <P>The outlook which the Minister has indicated as being his outlook in 1952 towards the industry is one that in my view is going to get infinitely better results than his previous outlook but, while there has been over the years through the efforts, I think I can fairly state, of the Irish Tourist Association an appreciation by those directly concerned with the industry of the benefits that the industry can bring, there has never been, and still is not, any <Col N="1475" /> appreciation amongst the people as a whole of those benefits nor is there any appreciation of the divergent ways in which the money brought in by tourists, or money spent by our own holiday-makers at home, seeps right down to a great many phases of our national life.</P>
    <P>The last analysis I was able to find of the manner in which that expenditure was distributed between various trades is one that is quoted in a White Paper, the Interim Report of the Planning Advisory Board in Northern Ireland.  In that it is stated that of the moneys spent by tourists&mdash;that is to say by persons at home who go on holidays within the country or by persons coming in from abroad to spend their holidays here&mdash;merchandise accounts for approximately 26 per cent.&mdash;that is to say, that about one quarter of their expenditure takes place in the shops.  Restaurants, cafés, hotels and guest houses&mdash;using the word &ldquo;guest house&rdquo; in the sense not merely of a registered guest house but of all room accommodation&mdash;account for approximately 37 or 40 per cent. Yet it has been regularly considered that the only people who are going to get any benefit out of the tourist trade would be those operating hotels or restaurants.  In fact, they account for only approximately 37 to 40 per cent. of the total expenditure of tourists.  Garages, through the sale of petrol, motor spirit and transport of one sort or another, account for approximately 18 per cent. of the expenditure and theatres and amusements for about 8½ per cent.  Small confectionery and incidentals are set down in that report as accounting for the balance.</P>
    <P>But even that is not a full and true picture of the situation because that would imply that only one-quarter of the expenditure was incurred in regard to merchandise.  It is more than that because a considerable quantity of Irish agricultural produce is consumed by these holiday makers.  It is very much better to feed our people here at home and to feed British people here on our cattle, our beef and our mutton rather than that we should <Col N="1476" /> send that beef and mutton on hoof to be eaten by them in Britain.  We obviously get much more from it by having it consumed here at home and we save from the point of view of transport.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the first things that should be done by An Bord Fáilte when it opens up is to extend the distribution of the very useful little booklet published by them a short time ago. It is an excellent little booklet except in one respect.  It does not give the date on which it was published, therefore, I cannot refer to it by date, but if that small little booklet were thoroughly circulated throughout the country&mdash;it is entitled &ldquo;What does Tourism mean to you?&rdquo;&mdash;one would get a far wider appreciation of the benefits that tourism brings and a far richer appreciation of the manner in which the full value of the industry can be obtained than in any other way.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's disappointment that so few copies of the synthesis were bought throughout the country.  I think that that is a great pity.  I can, however, understand that before people have read this synthesis of reports on tourism, they are inclined to believe that it involves something which is inordinately heavy. It is not quite as bad as all that and it is possible to read it through without the agony that might be suggested by its names.  Something, however, much more bright and breezy&mdash;something that, in a diagrammatic way, shows the dollar revenue, as this little pamphlet shows in a diagrammatic way the manner in which our exports in 1949 contrasted with the tourist trade&mdash;would ensure that our people would understand very much more quickly what this trade could mean to them.  It is essential that our people should understand what the tourist trade could mean to them.  Only if there is very general understanding of that position throughout the country can we get the proper approach to the problems of those people who are coming here on holidays or who are going for their holidays here to another part of the country.</P>
    <P>In the modern world, the work of the industrial worker has become a matter of repeating, <i>ad nauseam</i>, the same <Col N="1477" /> motion.  He does not build an article right through all its different phases of production&mdash;his task is to concentrate on one particular part of the finished article.  Obviously, such a worker has a much greater need for recreation and a break than a worker under the old-fashioned system of work where the tempo was entirely different and where the various operations that had to be carried out by any individual worker were such as, themselves, to form a type of distraction and a type of relaxation. In modern days, when the industrial worker has to repeat the same action again and again and again, it is very necessary for him to have a break. From that point of view, therefore, we are going to see in the future, as to some extent we have seen since the end of the war, a different type of holiday-maker and a type who is entitled to get his holiday just as much as anybody else.  We should make a particular effort to cope with that situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the holiday-makers' question, on which I slightly chided the Minister at the beginning, might I mention one small analogy?  We are accustomed to think of Switzerland as a place where tourism has been developed <i>par excellence.</i></P>
    <P>It has been estimated that 50 per cent. of the entire money spent in the tourist industry in Switzerland is spent by Swiss nationals themselves travelling from one part of Switzerland to another, holiday-making in Switzerland. If 50 per cent. of the expenditure on tourism in Switzerland comes from their own people, when they have the name of being the first-class and the primary tourist country in Europe, surely we can make an effort here to make certain that our own people can get the type of holiday in this country which will prevent them from yearning to spend their holiday, when the time comes for it, on the other side of the water or in the Isle of Man.  If we do not do that, we shall be throwing aside to a very large extent the benefits which we may get by bringing in people from abroad.</P>
    <P>A difficulty that has always existed in regard to tourist traffic in this country has been the question of hotel accommodation.  There is only a <Col N="1478" /> limited amount of hotel accommodation available throughout the country&mdash; accommodation which, at the peak time of the year, is always entirely insufficient.  In the Christenberry report and in the other reports referred to in this synthesis, the building of new hotels is suggested.  Quite frankly, I think most of us were rather appalled at the cost of construction of new hotels and at the estimate of the cost of the type of hotel they have in mind.  They suggest £2,000 a room. If 350 new rooms are required, the cost would be £700,000.  Between the 1914-1918 war and the 1939-1945 war there was a very long period in American life when their hotels were almost entirely empty because, to some extent, they had over-built hotels.  In almost every town of any size in America there was a big hotel which had been forced to shut off one or two of its floors and to operate on a very much reduced scale.</P>
    <P>While I do not think there is that danger here in the immediate future, or even in the foreseeable future, nevertheless I feel we should bear in mind the fact that if we were to construct a number of large hotels we should be engaging in a very expensive operation for a very short season and that, therefore, it would be infinitely preferable if we could increase the number of rooms available in another way.  I think that it might help if a proper attempt was made to stagger holidays.  I understand that at present the Minister for Education is considering questions in regard to the dates upon which children should take their holidays.  The result of all the investigations on staggered holidays which have so far been made in this country has been that it is clear that people want to take their holidays when they can bring their children with them. A problem which it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider with the Minister for Education is whether it would be possible to connect them with a staggered holidays plan.  We get just as good weather in May in this country as we get in July or August.  I think it would not be unfair to say that in Ireland most months of May are, on the average, <Col N="1479" /> better than the month of August.  However, our people here cannot take their holidays in May because at that time their children are not available to go away with them.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should consider with the Minister for Education whether a method could not be devised to connect the staggering of holidays with any new arrangements which the Minister for Education may make in regard to the time at which schools will close.  We should endeavour to ensure that, during the months of the year other than those in the peak season, we can switch from our peak season to these other months people who wish to take their holidays at that time.  We would thereby increase our hotel accommodation in the peak months just as surely as if we were to build new accommodation&mdash;and we should be providing that accommodation far less expensively and in a way that would not have the same repercussions at all.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about the prices that hotels are entitled to charge and have to charge in order to make a profit is that in many areas hotels are only filled to capacity during such a short period of the year.  If an hotel has only got three months during which it is 100 per cent. or nearly 100 per cent. filled, if during another three months it is only 50 per cent. filled and during another three months only 25 per cent., if it is not closed, it is clear that it will have to spread its overheads in a way which will mean that its costs will be higher than if it were able to get a reasonable level throughout the whole year.  For that reason, in regard to any new accommodation, I urge the Minister to put it to the board very strongly that the suggestion made in the reports that new buildings should be by way of annexes rather than integral parts of the hotel itself would be far less likely to impose an undue strain on the overheads.</P>
    <P>If we can do anything to stagger our tourist trade in order to ensure that it will not be during the peak period that all the demand will come, then we will have done something which will be just as valuable as building new accommodation. <Col N="1480" /> Fishing and all forms of sport are things that, to a large extent, take place and attract people during the non-peak period.  Other countries make a great effort to have continuous festivals of one sort or another.  I do not mean anything as big as some of the festivals which have taken place. There are, however, small shows of one industry or another periodically in the Mansion House here.  Something much bigger than these and much more continuous could be organised for the purpose of ensuring that there would be attractions during the non-peak period.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of our tourist industry being attracted towards getting us dollars rather than sterling is concerned, I believe that far the best step ever taken or that ever could be taken in that regard was the block-booking scheme started by the Irish Tourist Board.  If hotels did not know that they were to have a certain proportion of their accommodation taken for a definite period, then obviously it would have been unfair to expect them to turn away good customers for six nights of the week because they were to have dollar customers on the seventh night.  The block-booking scheme meant that the hotels could see where they were and in that way put aside an adequate proportion of their accommodation to meet the opportunities of attracting American traffic.  I want to congratulate the Irish Tourist Board on the introduction of that scheme and I sincerely hope that the Minister, if he is giving a valedictory message to his renamed board, when he does go to rechristen it will include in that message an urge to them to go ahead with the block-booking scheme to every possible degree that it can be operated for American tourists.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general question of the Tourist Board, I want to say a few words on the Bill as such.  I dislike the name the Minister has given to the board for the future because it ignores the aspect that I consider so essential of catering for our own people as well as for those who are coming here.  The welcome is primarily a thing which one considers in regard to a stranger coming in rather than a Kildare person, shall I say, going down to Kerry.  For that reason I am not a bit <Col N="1481" /> happy about the name itself.  I am not enamoured altogether by some of the new functions which the board are to have, as set out in Section 5, but the Committee Stage is a more proper place to discuss those in detail.</P>
    <P>So far as Part III&mdash;the guarantee of loans&mdash;is concerned, that is one of the parts of the Bill with which I am in wholehearted agreement.  The old Tourist Board had powers and at one time actually had a scheme by which loans were to be made available to hoteliers to develop and improve their premises.  It was a scheme which, if it were ever used, certainly fell into disuse very quickly.  I think it was practically never used.  As I understand Part III of the Bill, moneys will be made available by banks on a guarantee from the Minister.  I know it would not be proper as an amendment to this Bill as such, but I urge on the Minister very strongly that he should make an effort with his gloomy colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the Valuation Acts will be amended in such a way that a person will know before he makes an improvement to his premises the extent of his commitment if an increased valuation is to be made.  Increasing any valuation is bad enough, but there is much worse than that&mdash;the fact that a man does not know to what figure his valuation will be raised.  It is that uncertainty which has done more than anything else to deter people from making improvements to hotels, or any type of business premises in fact.  If the Minister can ensure that the Valuation Acts will be amended in that respect, with particular regard to these premises which are part and parcel of our tourist industry, he will be making it much more easy for the persons concerned to budget for what they will have to meet if they improve their premises and, in consequence of that, to determine whether the improvements are worth while.</P>
    <P>Certain other Deputies suggested that it is not right that there should be registration or inspection of premises.  I do not at all agree with that.  I am not a bit happy about the system of grading as it was operated by the Tourist Board.  I think that the <Col N="1482" /> board have only dropped their grading this year because they were not themselves happy about the system and because they were not happy with their personnel in operating that system.  I hope it will be possible to have a new system introduced and, when it is introduced, that it will be possible for those engaged in the industry to know what it is.  In that way, they could make their own estimates and see what would be required before they would go to the particular grade they were aiming at.  I think that more could be done to make the investigation by the inspectors easier for the hotel keepers and more lasting in results to the tourists who visit the hotels in question.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself, where the Minister and I will be in categoric disagreement, though I am not without hope that the Minister will change his mind, is on Part V.  I think that the institution of Fógra Fáilte is a very bad step.  I think it is not going to have the effect which has been put forward as a reason for its setting up.  The case, of course, made by the Minister for it was that it was the only way of linking up the activities of the Irish Tourist Association with the scheme under the new Bill, and that it was necessary.  I can understand the case which the Minister made that it is not possible for a body like the Irish Tourist Association, without statutory direction, to be given control of the very large funds which are going to be made available under this Bill.  Since 1925, when the Irish Tourist Association came into existence, it has done a great deal of very valuable pioneering work.  I think the Minister would be the first to admit that it has done so.  But the work it did was, one may say, on the most minute scale compared to the work which has now to be done.  It was work that was only made possible by the generosity of the local authorities, but even that generosity, though large for the local authorities, was on a very small scale compared to the work which has to be done for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry the other day expressed surprise that he saw nothing in the way of advertisements about <Col N="1483" /> Irish tourist resorts when walking around Dublin or Cork.  I suggest that part of the responsibility for that must rest on the Deputy's own shoulders as a member of the Cork County Council for not placing larger sums of money at the disposal of the Irish Tourist Association to enable it to advertise more widely beauty spots like Glengariff and others which he had in mind.  In my opinion, the setting up of this third tourist organisation, far from helping to keep alive the Irish Tourist Association, which is the reason the Minister has given for the setting up of this board, will do more than anything else to kill it.  I think that the Minister could have made a much stronger case, on the same lines, if, say, he tied in Fógra Fáilte with the Tourist Board.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Tourist Board is already in existence, I believe it would have been quite possible to do everything which the Minister hopes to do with Fógra Fáilte, and in exactly the same way, as between the Irish Tourist Association and the Irish Tourist Board.  I think that if the Minister carefully examines the matter, he will find that the effect of setting up this board will be to relegate, even further away, the Irish Tourist Association than would otherwise be the case.  I am not at all sure that the more decent way, if I may use the expression, of burying the Irish Tourist Association, would be to cut it off completely than to have it this way with Fógra Fáilte.</P>
    <P>This is going to have the result of creating what one may call a rather hypocritical approach&mdash;the suggestion that the Irish Tourist Association is still there, that it is still being kept alive, that it is operating as agents for this board, that it is operating certain bureaux and on that account is really operating.  I do not think that is going to be true.  I think the result of that is going to be that, instead of vitalising in one way or another the goodwill that there is behind the Irish Tourist Association&mdash;the local touch that there is behind it&mdash;the Minister will, by setting up this third organisation, kill the association effectively and prevent it from adding its assistance to the tourist <Col N="1484" /> industry as a whole.  I have tried, in the comments which I have made on Part V, to avoid being political in my approach to it.  I quite understand the statutory difficulties which the Minister saw, but I think this is going inevitably to be considered by the country as a whole, and by the local authorities, as another set of jobs.  I think it is quite inevitable that that is the interpretation which will be put upon Part V of the Bill.  I think that is not going to assist but rather to hinder the whole case for the development of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider between now and the next stage of the Bill whether he could not bring in a tie of some sort or another on rather the same lines as between Fógra Fáilte and the Tourist Association.  I see no reason why the Tourist Association would not operate the bureaux in this country as agents for the Tourist Board just as they are going to operate as agents for Fógra Fáilte.  There is no fundamental difference at all.  They can do just as well as agents for one as they can as agents for another.  I think there is an even greater case for it on the lines I suggest, because one of the functions on which the Minister laid great stress was this, that the main board is to develop local initiative and local enterprise.  What better representation could there be of local initiative and local enterprise on the main board than that of the Tourist Association? The members of it would be in a position to judge not merely local feeling but of how local feeling would react.  Quite apart from having a third organisation, I think that the main board itself would be immeasurably strengthened by having direct representation on it from the Irish Tourist Association.  In that way there would be more interest in the association and more anxiety amongst the directors of the association to be able to put forward schemes which would help the development of tourist traffic as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister at this stage whether there is any significance in the fact that there is nothing equivalent in Part V of the Bill to Section 14.  Section 14 is the section <Col N="1485" /> which provides for the superannuation of the staff of the main board.  It does not appear to be a section dealing with superannuation schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer once again to the fact that all of us are agreed on the desirability of extending our tourist and holiday trade.  The only difference of opinion is as to the way in which that should be done.  I hold that the more direct way is the easiest and best way in the long run; and the more direct way is to tie in the Irish Tourist Association into the main board rather <Col N="1486" /> than have a separate section of that board with representatives from An Bord Fáilte and the Tourist Association on it.  If the Minister rules against me on that, we shall have another discussion on the Committee Stage.  In regard to the appointments to An Fógra Fáilte I would strongly urge that there should be specific mention of the fact that these appointments should be composed partly of the main board representatives and partly of the members of the Irish Tourist Association. I am more interested in the Tourist Association but, notwithstanding the fact that the Tourist Association has representation on that board, I think this is a bad way of dealing with the matter and the Bill would be a much better Bill without Part V.  The Minister could get all he wants by adding three additional members to the Tourist Board, renaming it as has been suggested, from the existing Tourist Board and thus get representation on that body of the Irish Tourist Association. That would have all the benefits and none of the disadvantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to some of the criticisms that were made here last week in relation to facilities at the Port of Cork.  It must be many years since the Deputies who criticised have visited Cobh because they do not seem to be aware of the conditions prevailing there at present.  Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll said that one cannot land a car at Cobh, and that the same applies to Dún Laoghaire.  I am not concerned with Dún Laoghaire but I am aware that motor cars are regularly landed and loaded at Cobh. The Cunard Company does it regularly. I understand that the United States Line does not carry cars.  Facilities for loading and discharging cars are quite adequate and that work is regularly carried out at Cobh.</P>
      <P>At column 1390 of Volume 8 of the Official Report, Deputy Corry asked:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;What must be the first impressions of people coming into the town of Cobh to-day when they are met by an antiquated tender belonging to the Cork Harbour Commissioners &mdash;an antiquated tender flying the flag of this country, though the flag is in <Col N="1487" /> such a condition that one could not possibly discern its colours?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey at column 1396 of Volume 8 of the Official Report said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They mentioned about the fine harbour at Cobh, but regretted the treatment of passengers when coming off the liner.  If those people speak about that to their friends in Philadephia or Boston and tell them of their experiences, it is not going to encourage them to go through the ordeal which passengers experience at Cobh.  If they are coming to Ireland they will decide to go on to Southampton rather than get off at Cobh.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At column 1395, the same Deputy talked about passengers coming by direct liner to Cobh and he said that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;they are still exposed to the elements on the tender of which Deputy Corry has given a description.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at two Cork Deputies especially criticising their own port in that manner.  After the last war the harbour commissioners found it impossible to induce the company which had carried on a tender service prior to the war to come to any agreement with the liners.  Rather than let the people of Cobh and Cork suffer, they expended a sum of close on £100,000 in providing tenders to carry on a service to the liners.  At least half that sum was spent on repairs and overhaul in Rushbrooke dockyard in order to make the tenders as up-to-date as possible. These tenders are registered at Lloyds to carry from 1,000 to 1,500 passengers. At most, 300 passengers normally disembark at Cobh and there is ample accommodation on these tenders to <Col N="1488" /> accommodate that number comfortably in the saloon.  There is, therefore, no necessity for them to be exposed to the elements.</P>
    <P>The harbour commissioners have always co-operated with the liner companies in improving the tenders and the landing facilities.  They have appointed a liaison officer to help the passengers disembarking from these tenders.  The tenders are equipped with radio telephones.  They have installed a wireless station at Tivoli, a station much appreciated by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when the Valentia station was put out of action during a recent storm.  The Minister wrote to the harbour commissioners thanking them for lending that station to his officials.  Apparently others think more of the work that is done by the Cork Harbour Commissioners to help tourism than do those who reside there and who benefit most from it.  The liner companies also asked the harbour commissioners to provide up-to-date baggage trucks for handling the passengers' luggage and the harbour commissioners went to the expense of providing that.  They provided public announcers on the tenders.  They have done everything possible.  Everything they were asked to do they did it.  They provided facilities in regard to teas, minerals, etc., for passengers even on this short trip from the liner to Cobh. They have provided such facilities for the Irish Tourist Association on board those tenders.  As far as they as a body are concerned they could not possibly have done more than they are doing. They guaranteed £10,000 or 10 per cent. of the cost in regard to the recent improvements in the facilities for the handling of passengers and luggage by the customs.  Anybody who has been to Cobh recently must know of the big advance that has been made in regard to the handling of passengers and baggage by customs and for the inspections by the customs authority at Cobh.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether those people who have been talking about Cobh have been down there for the last ten or 20 years.  By the way they were talking it is evident that they were not.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that <Col N="1489" /> a lot of that money spent at Cobh was needlessly spent.  I would impress on the Minister the desirability of exploring the possibility of having those tenders sent direct to Cork.  They would reach the City of Cork in three quarters of an hour from the time they left the liner.  It seems a completely senseless bit of business to me to have this double handling of passengers and goods by making them go to the customs at Cobh, get into the train and then go to Cork.  There is no necessity at all for that.  By going up the River Lee they would see the best scenery in the country and, as a Deputy said here last week&mdash;I think it was Deputy Byrne&mdash;&ldquo;first impressions are the best.&rdquo;  They are, perhaps, more lasting than others.  I can assure the Minister that there are plenty of facilities for handling the customs in Cork City. Portion of the quay where the bonded warehouses are near the harbour commissioners could be closed off.  There passengers and &lsquo;passengers&rsquo; baggage could be inspected without any delay and it would be much more convenient to the centres to which the people might desire to go.</P>
    <P>I think it is my duty to reply to those remarks.  People should not be talking about things they know nothing about. It is a wrong thing to say that motor cars cannot be landed in Cobh when they are being landed there regularly. I do not want to say much more in regard to this Bill, but I think that the Minister should, if possible, induce the Tourist Association to have a ground-floor office in Cork.  Tourist or strangers coming to the City of Cork find great difficulty in finding the Irish Tourist Association offices.  That is not as it should be.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity of having a ground-floor premises, if not in Patrick Street, then in some one of the principal streets in the centre of Cork City. I think that would be a great help to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally admitted that the outlook of the public on the tourist industry has changed considerably for the better during the past ten years.  There may be a number of reasons for that upon which I will speak later but it is certain that the <Col N="1490" /> ordinary man in the street now recognises the value of the tourist industry as a method of bridging the gap between imports and exports.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has given us the figure of £32,400,000 as last year's expenditure on tourism.  He has stated that tourism has become the second largest industry in the country.  While that is known and appreciated by the people, I wonder if sufficient credit has been given to the Tourist Association for the wonderful work they have done in this country to bring about that state of affairs?  Starting as a voluntary body and depending on limited contributions from local authorities which were given some years and the next year not given at all, it must be stated to their credit that they did a wonderful job of work and I think they deserve the gratitude of the people of this nation for giving us that industry which has now taken second place in the life of the nation.</P>
      <P>Because of the importance of the tourist industry, it is essential that any proposed legislation or any Bill that comes before this House dealing with that industry should be very fully debated.  It should be criticised and examined and amended, if necessary, by the Opposition and all the more so when we realise that, arising from actions carried out under the 1939 Act, the sum of £311,000 has now, to quote the Tánaiste, &ldquo;practically to be written off&rdquo;.  Under the 1939 Bill, the Irish Tourist Board went into competition with the ordinary hotelier and they erected, equipped and ran luxury hotels.  They purchased land which was to be used for tourist attraction and tourist development but the net result of their endeavours has been a loss of over £300,000.</P>
      <P>It is well that that is not to be repeated and it is well, in view of such a thing happening once, that every Act or every Bill that will come before this House should be examined and criticised and, as I said before, amended, if necessary, by this House in the interests of the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that, due to the financial position in Great Britain and to the fact that a financial limit has been put on people leaving Great <Col N="1491" /> Britain for the Continent, we will have a big quota of tourists here this year. What we should concentrate on is examining what type of tourist is most likely to return if treated well and then to set out to make his or her stay as enjoyable as possible.  I would suggest that the type of tourist who will come back again to Ireland is the ordinary person from Great Britain of limited means going on his annual two weeks' or maybe three weeks' holiday.  While we will very likely have a good number of the rich or wealthy class who will come here because the Continent is practically closed, they will, immediately the ban is lifted in years to come, return to their haunts on the shores of the Mediterranean, Monte Carlo and elsewhere. Ireland and Irish tourist resorts have very little interest for these ladies and gentlemen.  There is, of course, the hunting, shooting, fishing element who will come here.  They will come at first because of the fact that they are invited to stay in the country and fish in the rivers.  There are the wealthy few who will come to shoot over the farms of Ireland where gaming rights have been preserved from the time of Cromwell.  To my mind, that type of person is not worth inviting to this country or to any country in the world.  I would have no truck with parasites.</P>
    <P>However, if we endeavour to attract here some of the 40,000,000 working-class people of England or of countries outside England, then we will be attracting here people who will return to us again and who will appreciate what is being done for them.  Because of that, I feel that the new board should concentrate on hotel improvement and on the improvement of the modern kind of ordinary hotel or guest house which will cater for the ordinary tourist.  A good deal of attention should be paid to hostels and provision should be made that grants could be given to the local authorities to develop camp sites by laying on sanitation and water to that hikers could be attracted to this country, knowing that in an ordinary day's travel they would find a convenient hostel or a convenient <Col N="1492" /> camping ground or, if neither of these were available, a hotel or guest house with charges within their ability to pay.  Contented visitors returning to their homes are the best method of propaganda.  No matter what board be set up, the power of human speech, be it for good or bad, is what is going to matter.  I suggest that if we treat these ordinary hikers and even the ordinary people who come to this country for two weeks' holiday in a proper manner by satisfying them by the food they get, by our charges and by the accommodation with which we provide them, they will come back here and speak of our country in a way which will attract here members of their own family and many of their friends.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I agree with the registration and grading of hotels, though I do not agree that there is much use in the present system.  Any hotelier can get registered and charge any prices he likes as long as he has displayed that charge list in his hotel.  It should be said that competition between the hotels would induce hoteliers to be reasonable in their charges.  I would instance the case of a small town. Visitors either passing through that town or coming there on holidays will find there very small hotels which, if graded, would be graded B or C, but which are charging grade A prices.  A ring has been formed among these establishments, and the visitor has no choice but to pay or stay out on the road.  In Dublin during certain periods of the year, for instance the eves of football or hurling matches, at times of shows or of some other attractions, 30/- to 35/- per night is charged for rooms which could normally be secured for 15/- per night.  There was an instance of overcrowding of bedrooms on the eve of a certain Soccer match only a few weeks ago.  I learned that the actual team taking part in the match were forced to sleep five in a room in an hotel which is registered by the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the manner in which these hotels have been inspected and at what period of the day.  Certainly, if the inspectors copied our police force and carried out night raids, <Col N="1493" /> they would find that the hotel bedroom, which was shown on inspection in the daytime to contain one or two beds at most, was packed so tightly after 11 p.m. with stretchers and additional beds that they would find it impossible to enter the room.  Still, there appears to be no check at all upon that.  Mr. Christenberry in his report assessed, as far as I could make out, that the hotel bedrooms available divided by the number of visitors in any one week allowed about 1.7 visitors per bedroom for the week.  I am sure he must be either a very charitable man or a very gullible man.  He must not have visited many of the Dublin hotels.</P>
    <P>It is the small things which give the bad impression even of the best hotels, such as the absence of bolts in bedroom doors or the absence of keys.  In an excellent bedroom, fully equipped with electric light, one will find that the electric bell does not ring at all.  One will find dirty knives on the best laid tables, complete with flowers.  These are the things that should be investigated, along with the ordinary inspection of toilet necessities and facilities for sleep.</P>
    <P>However, there is one thing which amazes me in all the Tourist Bills and in all the suggestions as to what we should do to make a good impression upon our visitors; there is very little good in giving a visitor the best food that Ireland can produce, cooked to the best advantage unless it is served at the time it is ready, and unless it is served in a willing manner.  How can anybody expect services from people employed in hotels who have to work for an 80-hour week at a weekly wage ranging from £1 to 30/-and their keep?  When the Tourist Board inspectors go to an hotel, they never visit the accommodation of the staff.  The staff may be housed in the basements with the beetles, but it is of no interest to the Tourist Board inspectors.  Whether sanitation is provided, whether proper wash-up facilities are there, whether they are paid decent wages or whether they get decent hours are matters of indifference. But I suggest that as long as the people who serve at the tables, as long as the people who wait on the <Col N="1494" /> guests or visitors are discontented, as long as they are badly paid and badly treated, so long will you have bad service for our tourists.  It is the duty of the board, be it Bord Fáilte or under any other name, to see that the people who serve in these hotels get good conditions of employment and pay that will give them the right to say: &ldquo;We work for the second largest industry in this country and we are paid accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it possible that we can afford the loss of £32,400,000 of an industry because we do not deem it worth while to see that the worker is by legislation protected in his employment, so that he, in his turn, will tend to welcome our visitors, will do everything possible to make them happy and will be glad to see them return?</P>
    <P>In regard to the licensing laws, there is a point I would like to put to the Minister.  While, on the whole, I welcome the extension of hours, I would say that all our visitors to this country do not stay at hotels, holiday camps or guest houses.  Quite 50 per cent., I would say, come here to visit and to reside with friends in ordinary homes. They are visitors and they need increased facilities for liquid refreshment just as much as those who stay in hotels.  Should any extension be given to holiday camps or to hotels, I would suggest that the Minister should consider an extension of the ordinary publican's licence between some particular dates in the height of the season, say, between June and the end of August or September or some other appropriate date.</P>
    <P>From my own knowledge, I am aware that last year in the County of Waterford, visitors found it impossible to secure butter.  There was no rationed butter available and when they went to purchase butter off the ration they found that was not available either. Therefore, a good deal of strain was placed upon the people who had those visitors staying with them.  The ration of the people in the house in which they stayed had to be divided between the visitors.  I understand that later on something was done on that score but I would ask the Minister to take ample precautions to see that this <Col N="1495" /> year such a state of affairs is not likely to happen.</P>
    <P>There was a number of points on which I intended to correct Deputy Cogan but in his absence I feel it would be wasting time to make any further comment than to say that it is strange to hear him advocating the rights of workers to holidays and saying that workers should have two weeks' holidays when he found it impossible to cross the barrier to give agricultural workers even one week's holidays a couple of months ago.  It is strange how he changes his mind at different times.</P>
    <P>On the question in regard to which he stated that bus conductors and those who drive public vehicles transporting visitors should be better instructed on the places of interest, I feel it is wrong that it should be alleged in this House that bus conductors on Córas Iompair Éireann tour buses or any of the other company buses operating in the tourist industry are not capable.  In fact, they have been repeatedly complimented by the visitors on their extensive knowledge of local history and of local beauty spots, and I feel that Deputy Cogan should not be allowed to get away with a remark such as that unchecked.</P>

      <P>Because of the importance of the Bill, I think it should not be treated in any Party spirit and I feel also that the Minister should not treat it in any Party spirit on the amendment stage.  As far as possible, he should allow a free vote on any amendments that are tabled.  I feel that all of us will agree with him in hoping that when this Bill goes through the House it will be a Bill that will attract to Ireland an everincreasing number of visitors from next year on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill and I agree that it is important but, like other Deputies <Col N="1496" /> who have spoken before, I feel that we do not need three boards to deal with our tourist industry.  To make for cohesion and efficiency I think we would be far better off with just one board.  The functions for which these three boards are created are, of course, necessary but it would be better if the Minister saw his way, if necessary, to extend the personnel of the existing board to cover all the functions that are required to be put into effect by the boards in one unified command.</P>
      <P>I think we all accept the fact that this year probably will see into this State of ours and we hope into the whole of Ireland, a greater influx of tourists than possibly we have ever had before.  Our first duty in the interests of these people who intend to visit us is to make it possible for them to get into this country.  After all, there are only two ways people can come to Ireland; the rich can come by air; the ordinary person comes by sea.  None of us can be proud of what happened last year.  I agree, of course, that this country is not entirely responsible for the unfortunate state of affairs that obtained throughout last summer but I think that if we stop to consider the matter for a few minutes it is possible to rectify that unhappy state of affairs.</P>
      <P>The principal gateway of Ireland, at least so we have been told by Deputies, is by Dún Laoghaire or Dublin anyway. Over the ships that bring the tourists or the visitors to this country our national transport has no direct control. It has no control over the British and Irish Steampacket Company; it has no control over the London, Midland and Scottish boats; it has no direct control over the other boats that go to Cork, Waterford and so forth.  But there is one port of entry in Ireland, the port of Rosslare, where we have a joint control over the ships with British National Railways. Therefore, we should be in a position to control and remedy any congestion on that line, over and above what we can do on the other ones I have mentiond before.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

Having furnished us with that flourish to justify the voting of this £1,100, he then broke into the base language of the bloody and brutal Saxon and there is the implication&mdash;&ldquo;I have given a <Col N="1498" /> more comprehensive review of the situation in Irish.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to-day or yesterday I had to remind the House of <i>Il Principe.</i>  This is a matter about which the House must be told the truth. Is there any precedent in Europe, America, Asia, Africa or Australia for setting up an arts council and planting a discarded member of the Cabinet in the chair thereof, for no obvious reason except that the Government wanted to squeeze him out of the Executive?  Is there a prime minister in any of the five continents which I have named who, having done that, would ramble into the House and move a Vote for £1,100, informing the House in Irish, hoping that nobody would understand him, that he had nothing to say and then to say in English: &ldquo;If there are any questions asked, I shall be glad to answer them&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any Deputy in this House, with the exception of the faithful disciple of <i>Il Principe</i>, who occupies the Front Bench who will have the hardihood to get up and say that it is a becoming thing, when you set up an arts council, to choose as its first chairman, a man active in public life but disappointed of political preferment? I remember very well the story being told with great drama of how, when Lord Salisbury informed Sir Stafford Northcote that he could no longer include him in his Cabinet, Sir Stafford Northcote fell dead at his feet.  Lord Salisbury, reciting this afterwards in the House of Lords, said that it was on occasions like this that a man who had spent his lifetime in the public service cursed the day on which he had entered it, when public duty required that he should cause the death of an old and faithful friend, by an announcement which was to prove fatal to him. Lord Salisbury was very unfortunate in that he had not an opportunity to study the tactics of our Prime Minister. If he had had that opportunity, instead of breaking the news to Sir Stafford Northcote in the way he did, he would <Col N="1499" /> have made him chairman of the Tate Gallery and if so, Sir Stafford Northcote would have survived in prosperity and peace, just as Deputy Little survives among us at present&mdash;the Lord spare him for many years&mdash;showing by his present equanimity, his bland enjoyment of this office of distinction.</P>
    <P>The office of chairman of this body is purely honorary but here is a question I should like to put to the Taoiseach for a specific answer.  Is it the intention of the Government that this position should remain honorary? Do they propose to state now that they will not introduce a proposal to change the status of that position?  I ask the Taoiseach to tell us why he chose the ex-Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for this post, not because I believe for a single moment that he will be at the slightest loss to explain that he burned midnight oil wondering if he could ask his colleagues in the Cabinet to suffer the cruel loss of this invaluable colleague, having all the time at the back of his mind the knowledge that the Government had reluctantly consented to make way for Deputy Childers, and that Deputy Little had been appointed chairman of the Arts Council.  I commend his explanation, whatever it will be, to the attention of the Dáil.  It will be a beautiful performance. He will have all the appearances of indignant amazement at being asked such a question and will tell the House that it never crossed his mind that so monstrous a question would be asked and that he had not time to prepare an answer to it.</P>
    <P>Those who are not familiar with the Taoiseach's exquisite technique will feel their hearts bleed at the righteous indignation of this blameless man at the mean, ungenerous and disingenuous attack made upon this noble patriot who was planted where he is sitting now, right in front of me, in order to impose the virtual obligation of silence on every Deputy who is capable of saying anything which would embarrass a colleague who is sitting beside him in the same House in which Deputy Little and I have sat for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I had hopes that this body would <Col N="1500" /> function in detachment from the turmoil of politics and that it would become one of the few institutions about which the Oireachtas would find itself in substantial agreement, granting it what annual grant our resources permitted and leaving a very wide discretion to the body to do the work assigned to it as best it thought fit.  If Deputy Costello's original scheme had been followed, I think that would have been the result.  As the Taoiseach doubtless knows, it was not his purpose to install in the chairmanship of this body a discredited Cabinet colleague.  Somehow, it makes one feel rather hopeless when gestures of the kind to which I have referred are so audaciously made.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Taoiseach, who is so notoriously wrong-headed a man about most things, would, in respect of a matter relating to educational art, show the quite exceptional capacity which he ordinarily shows in dealing with matters of that kind.  Usually, when he dealt in this House with matters concerning education or art, one seemed to be listening to the voice of reason and though I personally found it difficult to conceal my astonishment at the voice of reason proceeding from such a source, it did. This is the first occasion on which I found the Taoiseach rambling into Dáil Éireann and sheltering himself behind a cloak of incomprehensible Irish to excuse himself for his failure to deal with something which he must have known it was his duty to deal with on this occasion.  The evidence of that knowledge sits behind him.  But he brought in Deputy Little in his train.  I wonder does he intend to continue this body the way it has begun.  If he does, then it was a very unfortunate thing that this Fine Arts Bill was ever brought in at all.</P>
    <P>Let me, in conclusion, make a slight comparison between the standards set by the Taoiseach and those set by his colleague who secured the advantage accruing from the political demise of Deputy Little.  The Deputy's successor in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, for the great enlightenment of mankind, ordained that there <Col N="1501" /> should be free and easy discussions broadcast from Radio Éireann.</P>

      <P>I do not know if it is that the Taoiseach looks upon his erstwhile colleague as not only a politician by accident but a Minister by accident&mdash;a disastrous accident at that&mdash;and seeks to insure himself against the possibility of such a disaster recurring by choosing him for the position of chairman of the Arts Council.  The incident of his appointment can have nothing to commend itself except in providing an opportunity for an occasion, which I specially recommend to the younger members of the Fianna Fáil Party, for the Taoiseach to display the exquisite virtuosity of a prince about to appear holy, pious, magnanimous, agreeable and charitable, but always prepared, should the occasion require it, to act in exactly the reverse way to all these qualities, remembering that it is not what you are but what you appear to be that is important because it is what you appear to be that the multitude perceives: what you are is known only to the few&mdash;and them you keep under control.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would give the House any indication as to the annual appropriation which he contemplates in regard to the Arts Council and also if he could indicate to the House the manner in which the moneys made available to the Arts Council will be expended&mdash;in other words, will they be <Col N="1502" /> subject to the ordinary Department of Finance regulations or will it be open to the Arts Council to expend the funds made available to it without the usual Department of Finance red tape?  I welcome the Arts Council.  It was an idea which was conceived by the Taoiseach's predecessor and I think it was a sound and a very necessary idea. But, if the Arts Council is to be of any value, it will have to be independent of the Civil Service and of the red tape of the Civil Service mentality.  I think, too, that if the Arts Council is to be in a position to make any real contribution it will be necessary for it to have an annual appropriation of sufficient size.  No doubt the Arts Council will require premises from which to operate and a staff and will incur the usual overhead expenses that any body of this nature must necessarily incur. I hope, therefore, that the Taoiseach will be able to communicate to the House that it is proposed to make annually available to the Arts Council a sum which will be adequate to cover these expenses and which will also be adequate to enable the Arts Council to give financial assistance to various proposals which it may endorse.</P>
      <P>I had experience in the Department of External Affairs of the work of the Cultural Relations Committee, whose function, of course, was limited to the diffusion of cultural matters outside the country, and, in some cases, the granting of assistance for the diffusion of cultural matters within the State.  But it was not the function of the Cultural Relations Committee actually to assist in the development of art here.  If it did so, it was purely incidental to its main purpose.  The Arts Council should be sufficiently equipped to enable it to give direct assistance to different cultural bodies here for the promotion and development of art.  I forget whether it was set up, but we had in our first Dáil, certainly, the idea of having a separate Ministry of Fine Art. We never lived up to that idea and the Arts Council, I suppose, is the substitute for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House will give any assistance it can to the Arts Council and to the idea underlying it.  It was probably a mistake that the Taoiseach <Col N="1503" /> did not adopt the idea and the plan which his predecessor had formerly in regard to it.  I think the Taoiseach's predecessor had in mind the appointment as chairman of the Arts Council of a person who held a very high position in the world of culture and who was removed from the political arena. When a Taoiseach formulates a proposal of that kind on a non-political basis, I think that his successor should adopt the proposal, particularly when the general scheme itself is being implemented by the succeeding Government. Be that as it may, the present Government did not decide to pursue that policy and I think it is a pity.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is not in any way in derogation of Deputy Little. I am sure the Taoiseach and Deputy Little will both appreciate that it was a matter of regret to me that Deputy Little was not made a member of the Government when the Government was formed, and I think I expressed that view when the Government was formed.  Therefore I should like it to be clearly understood that anything I have to say in this matter is by no means said by way of criticism of Deputy Little himself for whom I have the highest personal regard.  I merely wish to indicate that it was unwise in a case of that kind that the Taoiseach did not pursue the general scheme which had been planned and decided upon by his predecessor.  I have no doubt that Deputy Little will be a good chairman of the Arts Council, but I do not think that an Arts Council which is manned entirely by voluntary effort can succeed.  I think it will require the impetus and drive of one person at the top who would really be in a position to devote his whole time to the work of the council.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will communicate to the House whether it is proposed that the Arts Council should have whole-time staff and also the appropriation which it is proposed to make available to the council.  If the appropriation were too small it might be better to strangle the Arts Council completely now.  I think we would be less than honest with ourselves to set up an Arts Council and then not make <Col N="1504" /> sufficient funds available for it to discharge the functions given to it.  I feel certain that every Party in the House would willingly agree to making available an adequate sum annually to the Arts Council if it were really shouldering its functions.</P>

      <P>I do not mind Deputy Dillon's interjections.  We are used to them in this House and the House can value them at their true worth.  When setting about the restoration of the name of this nation in the field of art, literature, music and those other traits which will bring our nation and its freedom back to some measure of its ancient reputation, I think that the foundation of this council, and the blending together in it of so many eminent men to direct its affairs, will have a very good effect, and will create confidence in the country.  I think that no appointment that has been made will do more in that respect than the appointment of Deputy Little to the <Col N="1505" /> chair.  We know Deputy Little's reputation.  We know of his erudition for many years.  He has in this nation made his mark in several lines.  That has been of great advantage to our nation in helping to restore our ancient culture, our music, and all the rest.  We know his personal character and his uprightness.  We know of his efforts to make a good job of any task entrusted to him.  He has in this body, as we all know, very eminent men to assist him, and under his direction it will, I am sure, be a great success.</P>
      <P>Some, perhaps, would like to see those who are well qualified in the musical sphere with better representation on the board, but seeing that, in order to bring this very desirable movement into closer contact with the people local panels will be formed in the various areas of interested people, I am sure that, ultimately, the restoration of our national culture as envisaged by this Act will have a splendid effect on our people at home and abroad.  I think we need say very little more except to give to this Vote our full accord so that the finances which may be necessary for this very important national work may be at the disposal of Deputy Little and his confrères.</P>

    <P>It was no surprise to me, and not for one moment would I stand here and pretend that it was a surprise to me, that attacks were made by Deputy Dillon on our choice of Deputy Little as director of the Arts Council.  We were fully aware that attacks would be made by Deputy Dillon and, in fact, I would have thought that Deputy Dillon had changed if, when the opportunity was given to him, he did not avail of it.</P>
    <P>We made the appointment, nevertheless. We made it because we believed that the man whom we were appointing was fit for the position.  I will not accept the proposition that because an individual happens to be a member of Fianna Fáil he must not be given any appointment in the country.  Neither will I accept the proposition that because an individual happens to be an ex-Minister in Fianna Fáil he is thereby debarred from being appointed to some position for which he is fitted. I have never taken up that position.</P>

      <P>Any reasonable person who thinks at all will support me in that.  If a man is qualified for a position, the fact that he belongs to Fianna Fáil provides no valid reason why he should not be appointed.  To shirk making such an appointment would be sheer cowardice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> We must face these political attacks. I, for one, will not hesitate to face them at any time when I consider the appointment being made a good appointment.  I believe this appointment is a good appointment.  Deputy Little has been long associated with cultural matters.  When he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs his main anxiety was in relation to cultural matters.  He also left behind him work which will show a permanent result.</P>
    <P>The original idea was to put a salaried expert as chairman of this council with a number of other people to act more or less as an advisory body.  It was intended that this expert should carry a high salary; indeed, if one regards him purely as an expert, perhaps the salary could not be regarded as such a very high one. I did not accept that.  I believe that if a council is to function properly and if the other members are honorary members, that council can best function if it is a completely honorary committee which can effectively direct activities in the way in which they wish them to go and stipulate the course to be taken while using the experts for their own special purposes.</P>
    <P>This committee can appoint experts. If it wants to it can appoint a chief expert.  I think such an appointment was in the mind of the former Taoiseach.  The activities of this committee are to be purely educational.  It must keep in touch with all sections of our people.  It must keep in touch with city and rural groups.  It must, by its own activities, inspire similar activities throughout the country.  For the purpose we have in mind I think no better choice could have been made than Deputy Little.  The fact that Deputy Little had not been included in our present Ministry made him available for this appointment.  It might be said &mdash;I do not propose to argue the point&mdash; that it would be better not to have a member of the Dáil.  It might be better, but I had to look for someone in whom I could have complete confidence. I had to look for someone whom I knew would move in the right direction. I was primarily responsible for the nomination and I nominated my <Col N="1508" /> colleague because I have known him for a number of years and I know him to be a man of culture in himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If one wants to get this work done properly the first step is to select a man who has culture in himself.  It is admitted by everybody who has the slightest knowledge of Deputy Little that he is a man of the highest culture.  The knowledge that we have somebody on whom we can rely outweighs in my opinion the fact that he is a member of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We did try to make it a rule that no member of the Oireachtas would be put on a board in any capacity if there was a salary attached to that appointment. The general idea was to have all members of the council on an equal footing with the chairman, the chairman carrying whatever rights would be given to him as director under the Act. It was suggested, and the suggestion, of course, emanated from Deputy Dillon, that this was only an initial step and that when Deputy Little had been accepted as director and when he had served some little time in office his post would be made a salaried one. That is not the intention of the Government.  This is a purely honorary appointment.  For that reason the main objections to appointing to an office like that a member of the Dáil go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most potent objection and the one upon which I had to satisfy myself in appointing Deputy Little as Director was that he would be present here. Although responsibility for the Arts Council rests under the Act upon the shoulders of the Taoiseach there might be a tendency to ask the Deputy questions as if he were directly responsible to the House for the functioning of the Arts Council.  That is one of the reasons why I have always thought it advisable that the Attorney-General, for instance, should not be a member of the House because he might be asked questions on matters in which he would be called upon to give a more or less judicial decision.  To that extent there is a certain objection in having a Deputy occupying such an office.  I weighed all the objections <Col N="1509" /> and I came to the conclusion that in putting Deputy Little's name to the Government for appointment by the President as Stiúrthóir I had the assurance of my personal knowledge of Deputy Little over a period of years and knew his character, his activities and his inclinations.  I decided for that reason that it was worth facing the disadvantages I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by Deputy MacBride what is the sum we have in mind. I think, when the Act was going through&mdash;there was a sum of £20,000 or £25,000 mentioned&mdash;it was unanimously agreed on both sides of the House that no upper limit should be set because it would depend a great deal on the nature of the activities which would be undertaken by the council.  That is why I did not mention any particular sum in this case. I would like to say that the sum of £10,000 is provided for the coming year.  That sum is provided because it is felt that in the first year of its activities the council will probably not need the sum that was originally envisaged. With regard to the sum of £20,000 or £25,000 that was mentioned, I forget whether it was mentioned in the first drafting of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach bear in mind that there is an inevitable tendency to take the first sum made available to a body of that kind as being the settled sum that it would get in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. That has never been so.  It has never worked out like that.  The sum that would be provided by the Dáil would depend on the case that can be made. If the activities of the council, as envisaged by the former Taoiseach when he introduced the Bill, which are laid down in the Act go in that direction I have no doubt that the sums required would be provided by the Dáil.  With regard to the question of moneys provided by the Dáil and moneys for which the Government will take responsibility, you will always have the pressure of a variety of other demands.  I do not know whether the Deputy who put the question thinks there is, but in my opinion there is a sum in regard to <Col N="1510" /> Government expenditure beyond which we cannot go unless we completely live beyond our means.</P>
      <P>In drawing up this Estimate, as in drawing up others, and making a total sum available, it will have to be borne in mind that these sums have to be got by taxation and, in this case, directly by taxation.  As long as we are the Government&mdash;I believe I am interpreting correctly the attitude of my colleagues&mdash;the cultural side is not the side that will get the axe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach formed any estimate of what percentage of the £10,000 will be taken up for administrative costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important consideration and as long as I have any responsibility for those actions and bear the responsibility in the Dáil of providing money it is one of the things that I will look carefully after and see that the administrative expenses only bear a reasonable proportion to the work that is otherwise done.  In this particular Estimate, £400 was for furniture, about £70 for rent for a period of the year and about £310 for the expenses of the staff.  The staff at the moment consists of a brilliant secretary and a shorthand-typist. That is the staff at the moment, but so far as in any way trying to cut down the administrative expenses as opposed to the money that is spent in getting work done, I cannot tell in the long run what it will be.  One of the costs will be travelling expenses and meetings.  I do not know, but it may be that members of the council are located in areas in which the expenses will not count for very much.  I forget if there was any other question.</P>

      <P>With the consent of the Minister for Finance?  I forget whether or not the Minister for Finance comes in explicitly.  The intention was to do one's utmost to give the Comhairle as free a hand as possible, all that was necessary being to convince the Taoiseach in the first place with regard to any sums that might be made available.  The Minister for Finance, who holds a responsible position, has to try to make ends meet and to raise money having regard to the demands made by the various other Departments.  No head of the Government would cavalierly say that such and such a sum had been voted by Parliament, and that such and such a sum is made available for a particular purpose.  In that connection, I would naturally consult the Minister for Finance.  I do not think he is definitely within the framework of the Act.  As to the question of examining proposals in detail and delays in regard to making sums available, that will be cut as much as it is reasonable to do so.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of reason in what is commonly called finance red tape.  It provides for a careful examination of the proposals that are put up and which involve the expenditure of public money.  I think it is very wise to have one Department of State responsible.  I can quite imagine people who talk about having £40,000,000 available to be scattered throughout the country finding it rather irksome to have a Department which would ask them precisely how much was to be spent this year, how much was to be provided for a particular purpose, and whether we were to provide five or six times as much as it would be possible to spend in order to make a big show.  These are some of the questions which cause some people to find fault with the Department of Finance.</P>

I think it would be better if we approached this matter in the way it was approached when we were in opposition.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1952, for Grants-in-Aid in connection with Technical Assistance afforded by <Col N="1514" /> the United States Economic Cooperation Administration and for other expenditure on Technical Assistance.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Supplementary Estimate I wish to take the opportunity of thanking the American Government and the American people for the technical assistance which under the previous Congress legislation they have extended to us and to our people generally. The need for this Supplementary Estimate arises from the fact that the Congress of the United States has recently passed legislation under which they find themselves unable to defray further expenditure on technical assistance projects except those for which definite and unavoidable contracts had been made before the 8th January of this year.  The Government, notwithstanding this, has decided that facilities should continue to be provided to encourage our producers to seek expert assistance.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary in order to widen the ambit of the Technical Assistance Vote to enable this to be done during the balance of this year.  The necessary provision, of course, is made in the Estimates for the coming year.</P>

      <P>Visit of U.S. experts to survey food processing and food storage industries.</P>
      <P>Visit of U.S. experts to advise on various aspects of sugar beet industry, including maintenance, factory design, agricultural engineering, cost accountancy, plant breeding and plant pathology.</P>
      <P>Joint mission of employers and trade unions delegates to study methods of productivity and labour conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project has been only partially completed because only the representatives of the Congress of Irish Unions have visited the United States.  The <Col N="1516" /> Trades Union Congress delegation have not visited the United States because of certain difficulties which have arisen in regard to personnel.</P>
    <P>Certain projects which have been suspended by E.C.A., some of which, it is hoped, will be taken up as soon as we get the necessary authority from the Dáil, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Visit of scientific officer of Department to U.S. for four months to study statistical methods in connection with agricultural research work.</P>
    <P>Visit of superintendent of Johnstown Agricultural College to U.S. for four months to study plant-breeding methods.</P>
    <P>Visit of U.S. expert to Ireland for two months to advise on the utilisation of milk supplies.</P>
    <P>Visit of U.S. expert to Ireland for two months to advise on a programme for the provision of grain storage.</P>
    <P>Visit of Department veterinarian to U.S. for six months to study abnormalities and diseases in newborn animals.</P>
    <P>Visit of technician of Department to U.S. for four months to study soil classification, clay mineral research, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the expression of thanks voiced by the Minister for Finance to the United States Administration in regard to the assistance which they made available to this country for technical assistance. I think that probably in the long run this will be one of the most lasting benefits to this country which, in common with the other European countries, benefited from the Marshall Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to this Vote but I feel that the Minister has been a little bit perfunctory in the information which he made available to the House. As I understand it, though the Minister has not told us so, this Vote is <Col N="1517" /> necessitated by reason of the fact that some hitch has occurred between this Government and the United States Administration, as regards the implementation of the technical assistance projects.  I feel that we might have been given a little more information on that subject.  I do not want to pursue the matter because the question is still under discussion between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to ask any question which might embarrass the Government in any discussions it may be having with the United States Administration. However, I would like to ask the Minister whether this sum now being voted is rendered necessary by reason of the hitch.  The sum which is being sought under this vote would, as I understand the position, have been made available by the United States authorities had this hitch not occurred.  Am I right in that?  I feel that it is very desirable that the Government should itself finance these technical assistance projects even if the hitch has occurred.  We may as well know what the existing position is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to approach an Estimate of this kind when the Minister for Finance comes into the House and asks for money, has a list of the matters for which this money is required before him on the desk, but thinks it too much trouble to read it out.  However, if he thought it too much trouble to read out the list, he might very easily have circulated a White Paper with his Estimate, and we would have been very glad to read it and so spare him the trouble of doing so.  I feel it to be a very dangerous trend when the procedure of this House is reduced to the level that we are asked to go through the motions of voting public money, although nobody in the House knows for what purpose the public money is required, because the Minister for Finance finds it too much of a nuisance either to get a list printed for our information or to read it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these projects were largely financed out of the generous affluence of the United States Treasury, I felt <Col N="1518" /> it was right and reasonable for the Irish Government to give very great weight to the views of some of the distinguished gentlemen who came here in the service of the E.C.A. and who were urged by the Irish Government to feel at home in this country. They were urged to speak out frankly in respect of any matter which would help to increase the productivity of the land and to be assured that, no matter what their animadversions would be, they would be interpreted as being inspired by friendly solicitude meant for the best interests of Ireland, whether we liked or whether we did not like such animadversions.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that on occasion proposals were submitted to me, when Minister for Agriculture, to bespeak courses of instruction in America for technical officers of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave the House some half-dozen of the 41 projects in progress or in suspension pending provision by Dáil Éireann of the money he now seeks.  He said he was too tired to read out all the 41.  Of <Col N="1519" /> the few he read out he spoke of some which were designed to send technical officers of the Department of Agriculture to the United States for courses of instruction varying from four to six months.</P>

On the point of order I made, I pointed out that sub-head C which is the only sub-head we are entitled to discuss is for grants towards technical projects other than those sponsored by the E.C.A.  I gather Deputy Dillon is now discussing projects which were approved by the E.C.A. and that that has got nothing to do with the Vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister's garrulousness is a bit muddled, as it not infrequently is.  When the Minister was concluding his introductory remarks on this Estimate, I asked him would he indicate to the House any of the purposes for which he was asking this money.  After much coughing and gasping, he said he would, if I would extend to him the indulgence of waiting while he searched through his brief to find the appropriate page.  He then found the page and he started, as I understood it, to read from the page.  Then he said there were 41 entries on this page and that it was too long for him to read out.  Now there can be no manner of doubt that the seven matters which he mentioned specifically certainly created on the minds of the House that those were seven of 41 projects, for the completion of which, or the revival of which, this money was required.</P>

These are projects which unfortunately are being carried out, projects which have been approved by the United States European Economic Cooperation Administration.  It is not in order to discuss these projects now because they do not come within the categories of projects for which the moneys asked for under sub-head E are provided.  I merely mentioned them to quicken the recollection of Deputy Dillon as to what had been done in his own Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I shall turn to the 34 he did not mention.  Is it not astonishing that the Minister for Finance, the custodian of the public purse, can come to Dáil Eireann and say: &ldquo;I want a sum of money under certain heads&rdquo; and before the debate is initiated he is asked: &ldquo;Will you, for the convenience of the House and to save time, at this stage tell us broadly what are the specific purposes for which the money is required&rdquo;?  He stands up and sways like a lily in the wind and says: &ldquo;If the Deputy will bear with me I will search my brief.&rdquo; He searches his brief and then he reads out seven separate sub-heads and sits down.  When they are referred to he puts in: &ldquo;Oh, that was put in to make it more difficult.  Those are seven projects to which this Estimate does not refer.  That is why I read them out.&rdquo;  Outside Bedlam has a Minister for Finance ever, on being asked to state the purpose for which money is being sought, read from his brief seven separate items for no better purpose than to be afforded an opportunity ten minutes later of saying: &ldquo;Oh, you are quite mistaken.  I read these items but it was not to tell you the purpose for which the money was wanted; it was to tell you the purpose for which the money was not wanted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister need not have referred to his brief for that.  He could have told me the money was not wanted to paint Nelson's Pillar or that it was not wanted to buy a druid's robe for Deputy Little.  The number of things for which this money is not wanted <Col N="1522" /> could be woven into a saga by any one of them, but the astonishing thing is that the Minister, having himself mentioned them, on hearing them referred to by a member of the Opposition, throws up his hands in holy horror at this incredible breach of order and the irrelevancy which such references indicate. The Minister ought to learn that those who behave with a moderate degree of reason, such as might be expected from a child in the sixth book, will usually get a reasonable accommodation from this House, but Ministers who come into this House flouncing their petticoats like spoiled children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was stressing the importance of our national transport organisation having control over the ships of the Rosslare-Fishguard service.  Before the first world war two passenger boats travelled daily between Fishguard and Rosslare.  This state of affairs obtained right up to the 1914-18 war.  After the 1914-18 war and up to the outbreak of the last war, one passenger boat sailed daily between these ports.  Since the war, we have had only one sailing three days a week except in the busy season.  Let us examine the number of passengers carried in these boats in the busiest year prior to the outbreak of the recent war&mdash;the year 1938.  In that year, 104,332 passengers travelled on that route and 35,000 tons of goods and 2,968 motor cars were transported. The figures for 1951 are 142,930 passengers, nearly 35,000 tons of cargo and <Col N="1523" /> 5,775 motor cars, which is 70 per cent. of the total number of motor cars that came into the country.  It is obvious from these figures that if this service is increased to two sailings in the busy tourist season and a daily sailing for the rest of the year we could deal with vast quantities of tourists and lessen the congestion that exists at present on the other routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the tourists, the position at Rosslare Harbour is that, when they arrive there, there are no fast train services to transport them to the different parts of the country which they may wish to go to.  Surely it is in the interests of Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;who, as we all know, are in a parlous condition, financially, and have to get a subsidy from this House every year to enable them to carry on&mdash;to supply adequate passenger services from Rosslare to other parts of the country.  Surely it is in the interests of Córas Iompair Éireann, who own 50 per cent. of the Rosslare-Fishguard service, to increase this service and to give us a daily service as well as a nightly service.  I might stress that though some people may complain that the bringing in of motor cars to this country means an extra draw on our petrol resources, there are other advantages to be gained by their importation.  It is well known that many of the cars that came into Ireland in the tourist season last year were repaired here.  That work gave a lot of extra employment in the motor trade in this country.  I urge the Minister to bear in mind the question of the improvement of Rosslare Harbour.  If there are two boats coming in, as happens in the summer period, the tourists have to wait a long time for customs examination.  There is a second berth there, and if the second ship were permitted to go to that berth the customs examination could be carried out more expeditiously, thus easing the congestion at the port.  I have been informed by the Rosslare Development Association, which is a very active and virile body, that it is essential to have a loudspeaker at this port in order to direct the people to the different trains.  That is one of the things that impress <Col N="1524" /> tourists.  Wherever else they may go in the world they have a loudspeaker to direct them&mdash;and why should they not have a loudspeaker to direct them at Rosslare also?  I stated that 70 per cent.  of the cars coming into this country came through Rosslare.  It is suggested that a road right down to the boat itself would greatly facilitate and hasten the unloading of cars.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with the composition of Fógra Fáilte.  I may say that I do not believe in having three boards. Section 2 of the Schedule to the Bill refers to the appointment and conditions of service to Fógra Fáilte.  The section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board shall consist of six members of whom one shall be chairman.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a)  The chairman and the other members shall be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b)  The chairman and two other members shall be chosen from the members of An Bord Fáilte.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I read in the Minister's introductory speech to this stage of the Bill that it was decided that the other three members of the board would be chosen from the directors of the Irish Tourist Association&mdash;that the Irish Tourist Association would be allowed to nominate six members and that from these six members the Minister would choose three members.  I think it would be reasonable to allow the Irish Tourist Association, who have done good work for this country in the matter of tourism, to nominate these three members themselves.  After all, they are a representative body and I think that the procedure I suggest would be a very democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>There are many things in this Bill that commend themselves to me.  I see a section in connection with An Bord Fáilte whereby national shrines and monuments are to receive attention. I fear a lot of us do not realise the great benefit which our national shrines and monuments could be to the tourist industry&mdash;and I have in mind, in particular, the dollar tourist.  Any of us in this House who have travelled abroad have often seen the American tourist going around with his map and camera and generally escorted by a <Col N="1525" /> guide.  That tourist has only one object in mind&mdash;to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the city or town or district as the case may be. I do not think any American is ever satisfied unless he has seen a shrine. These shrines are of sentimental value. They are old and they are associated with our Christian history and our past culture.  It is a good thing to have a scheme whereby signposts are erected to direct the general public to these shrines.  I notice also that roads and highways leading to these shrines and monuments are to be repaired, and that, too, is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have spoken about our ability to provide entertainment for tourists, more particularly in our rural districts.  Hunting, shooting and fishing have been referred to and, of the three, I think that fishing is the most important.  It is very necessary that our lakes and rivers should be restocked with trout and that bailiffs should be introduced throughout the country to keep down the pike which are consuming and destroying fish such as trout and salmon.</P>
    <P>The best type of tourist coming to this country, as he always comes back, is the fisherman, and the fishing industry is the best industry of the three.  If you have people staying at an hotel they can fish the same lake or river every day of the week.  If you have an hotel in a shooting centre, even though there is a very extensive moor there, anybody who knows anything about shooting knows that if you cover a snipe or grouse bog on a Monday you cannot go out and do it again on Tuesday, but you can fish a river or a lake every day of the week. Fishermen also are happy-minded people.  Unlike other people, they do not mind looking out through the window of an hotel at the rain pouring down.  They are quite happy if they have someone to listen to their latest fishing story and they realise that they will probably be able to get back to the job again the next day.  It is my experience that the fishermen who come to this country always come back.</P>
    <P>Hunting is a very necessary adjunct to our economic life here.  Unfortunately, hunting is not in a very good condition at the present time.  The demand that existed for our Irish <Col N="1526" /> hunters is dying out, because hunting in England has almost ceased, and the market for the export of our hunters is going down.  The Tourist Board can do a lot to improve that state of affairs.  There is great scope for hunting amongst the American public. Hunting is confined to the winter months.  If we are going to build a lot of new hotels&mdash;I think it is a mistake to do so and that we should carry on with what we have&mdash;we would want to fill these hotels in the winter months, and in many parts of Ireland you can do that by promoting hunting. You will not only do that, but you will bring back into commission the Irish hunter which is now dying out. Every owner of a thoroughbred sire throughout the country will tell you that thoroughbred hunting mares are not being sent to his sire.  That is proof that we will not be able to export the hunters which were our pride in the past.</P>
    <P>I should also like to touch upon the question of holiday camps and to preface my remarks by saying that I am not a teetotaller.  Good Friday is the day of all days.  It is recognised as such all over the world.  In Ireland, with our old tradition, it is recognised as such more than anywhere else.  I have the feeling, which a great many people with whom I discussed it share, that there should be nothing in this Bill that in any way enables anybody to have an opportunity of consuming alcoholic liquor on Good Friday.  In this Bill there is a section dealing with holiday camps.  It is true that these camps have to have accommodation for 250 people and a valuation, I think, of £200 before they can get an intoxicating liquor licence.  It is also true that they have only been established in the vicinity of Dublin and Cork.  Our culture, our tradition and our way of life are different from those of the people of other countries.</P>
    <P>We will get these people to come here whether we make different or easier licensing laws for them or not. I do not think it is right that we should pass a Bill legalising the sale of intoxicating liquor in these holiday camps on Good Friday.  Anyone you meet abroad who hears that you are <Col N="1527" /> from Ireland will always recognise you as coming from a country that is loyal to the religion which the majority of its people espouse.  I am only expressing my own personal view, but I do not think it right that we should have this section in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give this matter his serious consideration, because 364 days in the year ought to be sufficient for the consumption of alcoholic liquor, and on Good Friday we should abstain from alcoholic liquor in Christian Ireland.</P>

      <P>If we realise that tourists can be the most effective ambassadors that we have we will welcome this Bill, because in many ways it seeks to bridge the gap between what we lack and what we hope for in the future.  There is one very good provision in it which I think is new, and that is, to provide training for the staffs of hotels.  There are many country houses that could be adapted for this purpose, and if girls receive this training it will enable them to take up their duties in hotels with efficiency.  Hoteliers will also be in a position to know that they can get an efficient staff as a result of this scheme.  The girls would also be saved a great deal of embarrassment by being able to tackle properly the tourist and hotel business.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke about sport and some of them stressed the importance of fishing and shooting to this country.  I should like to say a word on behalf of the younger tourists who come here.  We have to realise that fishing and shooting, in England at any rate, are only for the well-to-do people.  The younger people like to play tennis and I do not think we have sufficient hard tennis courts in this country to cater for these people.  The provision of roads and means of access to historic ruins is also a very good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of these places to which you cannot possibly go at the moment.  There is, for example, Inisfallen Island.  The pier there is now gone to pieces because it is nobody's business to repair it.  I think that, if it were put into a proper state of repair, tourists would be able to go <Col N="1528" /> there and see one of our national monuments.  Then, as regards the signposting of roads and the signposting of historic ruins and explaining the different parts of ruins to tourists, something might be done.  For example, public notices might be put up in old abbeys to indicate where the chapter house was and where the dormitories were so as to enable tourists to study the ruins with interest and not be obliged to go around holding a guide book in their hands.</P>
    <P>The tourist bureaux outside the country should be well developed and adequately staffed, because if a tourist goes into one of them and finds that he does not get attention he will go out again and be disappointed and, perhaps, will not come to the country at all.  If, on the other hand, he goes in and can be told the time that his train will depart and is given some information about the county he is interested in visiting&mdash;if he gets quick service&mdash;he will come here and will probably come again.  I think also that great use should be made of the radio and of the schools so as to let our people know the reason why we are pressing this tourist industry to the maximum. There are various ways in which the people of the country can help.  They can help by providing the sort of amenities that the tourist likes.  I have heard complaints on a number of occasions that tourists, when driving for miles along our roads, can hardly see the scenery because the hedges are not cut.  That is a matter that could be attended to through the Press or the radio.  Perhaps it could be talked about in the schools, and in that way the children would soon become tourist-minded. Small things, such as the cutting of the tops of hedges, could give a great deal of pleasure to people coming into this country.  I think it would make them realise that the tourist industry is very important to us.</P>
    <P>We have in this country a great asset in our beautiful strands.  They really could be made gold mines.  They are there for the asking and they are waiting to be developed, but they must have reasonable amenities such as water, bathing huts and sanitary conveniences. If you give these amenities <Col N="1529" /> to the ordinary tourist he will come again, and, what is even better, will bring his young family with him.  At the moment, there are no shelters on some of these strands so that tourists will not visit them.  If they were developed fully by the aid of county council grants or with moneys available under this Bill, you would soon have a great number of tourists visiting them merely for the pleasure of sitting out and enjoying the sunshine, people who, perhaps, would not go to see historic ruins and who would go home definitely satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes a mistake when he draws an antithesis between tourism and agriculture and says that tourism is almost as great an industry as agriculture.  I think tourism is largely agriculture because I believe it is the victuals which we dispense that bring a very large volume of tourists to Ireland.  Mind you, when the Minister in his capacity as the Tánaiste is feeling peculiarly industrially-minded, he might bear in mind that agriculture, when you come down to tin tacks, is the foundation upon which everything in this country rests. Exquisite as may be our scenery, and intriguing as may be our ruins and vast as may be our strands, if they could not be enjoyed by having good food available, a great many tourists would avoid them like a plague; but so long as they are well furnished by the produce of our agricultural industry they are a very considerable magnet.</P>
      <P>I warmly agree with Deputy Mrs. Crowley when she speaks of the provision of simple equipment for our native strands as being a very potent means of bringing an eminently desirable type of tourist to this country, nothing elaborate but sufficient to make it practicable for families to bring their young children to the beach to spend a pleasant day there in peace and quiet, in the enjoyment of the sea and the fresh air. As Deputy Mrs. Crowley has said, such people will not only return themselves but will encourage others to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes my blood runs a little <Col N="1530" /> cold when I hear proposals for expanding tourism indefinitely.  I doubt if there is any economic reward adequate for the conversion of a section of our coastline into a Coney Island or a Blackpool.  I have no quarrel with people who want a Coney Island or a Blackpool, but I have no desire to establish a magnet to draw them here if they can find what they want 3,000 miles away.  I think that the family visitor, the fisherman and the individual who can take pleasure without the yoke that goes round and round and plays like a melodeon, is a better neighbour, shall we say, on a summer's night than the man who cannot last two days without having the roundabout at his disposal, the spangle as his daily companion or the cinema as a refuge from the boredom of living.  I doubt why we should get so excited about earning dollars. People work themselves into the most extraordinary position and say the most preposterous things.  Has any Deputy ever sat down and looked at the sum of dollars that must be earned by the sterling area to bring dollars and sterling into equilibrium and then compared that total sum with the total national income of this country?  It may be true what the old woman said when she spat in the sea and said &ldquo;every little helps,&rdquo; but I think that you can carry that too far, and that you can distort the economy of a country like this on the fictitious thesis.  To say that with the handful of dollars we can earn by the extremest effort and the distortion of our economy is going to make a significant contribution to restoring the convertibility of sterling is just nonsense.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the House that what we want is to provide attractions for tourists, decent tourists whencever they may come&mdash;America, France, Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Holland and Belgium.  Think of all the people in the neighbouring islands who want to go to the Continent.  They do not know a word of French, German, Spanish or Italian, but they batter their way around by shouting loudly in English at anybody whose attention they want to attract. They get away with it and get along <Col N="1531" /> very well.  There must be people in France, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Holland who, if things suited their circumstances, would come to us, and who, even if we did not understand their language, could have quite a good time here.  I think we can throw too much emphasis on the importance of earning dollars from tourism.  My desire would be to earn a decent tourist income whencever it came.</P>
    <P>I want to make this submission to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Irish Tourist Board should have some function in relation to Irish tourists while appreciating that it is important to accommodate the foreigner who brings in his money. There is, surely, some obligation due to the residents of Drumcondra and Glasnevin and Ballyhaunis who want to take a week by the sea.  I want to suggest, in elaboration of Deputy Mrs. Crowley's observations relating to our strands, that from Bray Head to the north of Portmarnock there are stretches of strand which compare with the best in the world.  If they were in as close proximity to Sydney, New York or Los Angeles they would be developed with every conceivable amenity that could make them attractive for city-bred children. I would be very glad indeed to see tourists from abroad sharing those amenities, but I would get a real kick out of it if I felt that every child in Dublin, those in Lower Gardiner Street, Meath Street and York Street would, on a hot summer's day, be able to spend it on the strand and enjoy simple amenities there such as a suitably-sized springboard, off which they could jump into the sea, or a raft on to which they might clamber.  What is needed is suitable equipment.  There should also be a lifeguard to see that the children did not drown themselves. They would have no fun if they did not try to drown themselves about a half-a-dozen times during the day. But a lifeguard should be there to see that they did not succeed in drowning themselves.</P>
    <P>That is what I would like to see. Their parents could go with them and relax on the beach.  What a pleasure <Col N="1532" /> it would be to them to see the children in their bathing costumes disporting themselves.  The duty of the guard would be to see that disaster was not allowed to overtake the children while disporting themselves.  My submission is that, if reasonable amenities are provided, and if, instead of fixing our eyes on the residents of Texas, we fix them on the residents of Drumcondra, Ballsbridge, Stillorgan and Glasnevin, this miracle will prove to be true.  In regard to recreation, if we provide the things which we understand our children desire, then I suggest they will prove fascinating and desirable to the children whether they be rich or poor.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mrs. Crowley that the staffs in our hotels should be adequately trained.  I seem to remember that the Minister did sponsor a scheme and was seeking the collaboration of the trade unions in respect of it, whereby hotel staffs could be trained on a reciprocal basis&mdash;that is to say, that a Swiss young man or woman, a French young man or woman or a German young man or woman who wanted to learn English in order to complete her or his equipment in the catering trade, would come here, and that we would send in exchange to those countries young persons chosen by the trade unions who would benefit from a course of exchange scholarships in Belgium, France, Switzerland or wherever they might with advantage go.  If that project has not been proceeded with, I think it should be gone ahead with.  I know that the trade unions have very strong views on this and will want reassurances of the most comprehensive kind that their membership, when trained, will not be displaced by those who come here as visiting students on an exchange basis.  The trade unions are extremely suspicious about that and it is not always easy to carry assurance to their minds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about fishing in this country.  I agree with him, but I sometimes feel a little abashed that my successful exertions in that sphere do not seem to have impinged on the minds and memories of some of my colleagues here.  I am sure many Deputies are aware that there is in existence a Fishery Trust with an <Col N="1533" /> annual endowment which was established by me, with one of the best secretaries, I think, available to any fishery trust in the world, a fishery trust which is prepared to take over, maintain and develop any fishery for trout or coarse fish in the country and make it freely available to any fishermen, domestic or foreign, who will pay a nominal licence fee.  It will maintain it as a preserved fishery from which excessive coarse fish will be abstracted.  The banks will be maintained and the waters will be carefully policed to prevent unauthorised poaching. It distresses me a little, instead of finding myself embarrassed by the number of Deputies rising on every side of the House to pay a tribute to me for my foresight and prudence in this matter, to discover that most Deputies rose to say that they thought this was something which ought to be done and that the sooner it was done the better.  Well, it has been done. Deputy Esmonde can help me by referring any complaints which he may have received to the Fishery Trust.  If he does so, he will find that it has at its disposal a service which is unrivalled in the world.  That is a bold claim to make.</P>
    <P>I observe that the Minister has made provision in the Bill to enable the board to give credit.  I want to say this, that if there is one subject about which the rag has been chewed <i>ad nauseam</i> by advisory bodies in the United States, here and everywhere, it is tourism.</P>
    <P>Now, there is only one piece of advice that everybody either at home or abroad had, and that was that the two existing bodies&mdash;the Irish Tourist Board and the Irish Tourist Association&mdash;ought to be amalgamated.  There is not a sane body of experts who looked at this problem who has not emphasised that whoever does it it ought to be done in the future. Observe the situation into which the Oireachtas is being led on this Bill. We are now going to have not one board, not two boards, but three boards, all naturally concerned to demonstrate that itself is the most important and each one of which, if human nature has not undergone a <Col N="1534" /> revolution, devoting a good deal of its time to show that the necessity of the other two no longer exists.  I know and the Minister knows and the Minister knows that I know why there is a third leaf to the shamrock; so resourceful is the Minister that the only thing that surprises me is that he did not announce that he was going to bring in a fourth board and make a four-leafed shamrock.  The Minister has a cynical capacity for smiling at his own performances and then reversing them.  There are few people who could construct this elaborate three-leafed shamrock and then admit in public three weeks later that the whole business was a cod, that he was going to ditch it because he had got what he wanted in another way.  This can be one of the first times he turned that capacity for brass to a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I urge him to polish up the brazen aspect of his countenance and flash it on this ill-begotten shamrock and reduce the tourist instrument to a unit that will work.</P>
    <P>Every speaker who intervened in this debate has emphasised this aspect of the Bill.  Is it necessary to point out to the House if the Irish Tourist Board is to be responsible for the provision of accommodation and transport of incoming tourists, would any sane man suggest that the body to be charged with the responsibility of organising the arrival of tourists, the whereabout of their arrival and their requirements, is to be divorced from the body whose responsibility is to transport them on arrival and accommodate them while they are here?  To argue this with the Minister is to bring coals to Newcastle or play a tin whistle to a tinker.  He knows that just as well as every other Deputy knows it.  But he wants to get his way.  Nobody wants to take his cake of soap away from him.  He need not cry any more.  He said he would not be happy until he got it, but he has got it and now let us get on with the job.</P>
    <P>A great many people talk about the things we want and the things tourists want.  Tourists want what is here and they would not come here if they did not want that.  That with which we are familiar may become contemptible <Col N="1535" /> in our eyes.  It was not to-day or yesterday it was written that a prophet has little credit in his own country. We need not worry about providing new amenities by way of amusement. We should make the amenities we have as good of their kind as they can be made for our own people, and those who like to come over will come here and they will be welcome.  What I and everybody else want is a certain minimum standard of comfort.  When you reach the end of the day and want to go to bed you want to be able to wash.  The other thing you want is that when you get into bed you will be able to stay in it and not roll off.</P>
    <P>In America that kind of thing is understood.  There is a kind of an idea abroad here that whenever one thinks of America one thinks of the Waldorf Astoria hotel.  I remember when in an American hotel having to put the chair under the lock on the door in order to prevent the proprietor installing four other gentlemen with me in the room. I said I paid my 3 dollars and was going to get my 3 dollars worth.  I and the proprietor parted bad friends in the morning.  In that room there was a bed, a place to wash oneself with the appurtenances thereto.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister&mdash;if he wants to find that admirably carried out&mdash;that he will find it in the hotel built by the Pennsylvania State College for visitors visiting the State endowed college in the State of Pennsylvania.  It is a star-shaped kind of building with dining rooms and what not in the centre and corridors of bedrooms radiating therefrom.  All the rooms are the same.  There is a modest bed with an interior spring mattress, or one of these rubber sponge mattresses. There is electric light, but above all, by skilful architectural design, in every room there is either a hot and cold shower or a hot and cold bath.</P>
    <P>It is still possible to persuade tourists to do with baths 150 yards away from their bedrooms if there are enough, but the plain fact is that, while that will satisfy English tourists who come equipped to battle their way through whistling winds, flapping <Col N="1536" /> around about in their peignoirs, American women do not like it.</P>
    <P>American men do not like it.  They are accustomed to a bath and that type of amenity in their room.  They know by experience how easy it is to provide it without elaborate luxury and, if they do not get it, they feel that they are being asked to live under primitive conditions.</P>
    <P>If you want American tourists, you have to make up your mind to the fact that that is the way they live.  If you want Chinese tourists, you ought to provide chopsticks and, if you do not want to provide chopsticks, you ought not to be trying to advertise the tourist amenities of Ireland in Peking.  If you want to advertise the tourist amenities of this country in the United States of America, whether you think it is no more reasonable for the Americans to want that kind of thing than it is for the Chinese to want chopsticks, make up your mind that they expect it and want it, not with elaborate style, something very simple. All I can say to the Minister is that he will find it in perfect specimen style in the hotel at the Pennsylvania State University to which I have just referred which, bear in mind, is a cheap place designed for farmers or rural Pennsylvanians who come and spend a night with their sons who happen to be students at the Pennsylvanian State endowed college.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in this Bill to make accessible to tourists and to our own people, not only knowledge of, but the means of visiting the vast number of historic monuments that exist in this country.  I have heard Deputies speak to-day of the desirability of making them accessible.  I want to make them known.  There is not a Deputy who drives home every weekend who does not pass and repass many places of interest that he has never heard of and of which under the existing dispensation he will go down to his grave entirely ignorant.  The astonishing thing is that tourists from America could tell you about features of the countryside and give you exhaustive descriptions of them which you know nothing about yourself because they have the curiosity to find out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> I have prepared a memorandum on the subject.  The Minister will find it nestling somewhere in his Department. It was prepared about the 28th April, 1950.  I refer, Sir, to a copious note for the purpose of refreshing my memory as to the contents of the memorandum:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When in the United States recently, I visited the battlefield of Gettysburg.  I was impressed by the extent to which this historic area had been marked by historical societies showing the exact site of various historic incidents that had taken place there.  This development extended over a wide area in the State of Pennsylvania, and made travel through that State extremely interesting.</P>
    <P>Ireland is full of interesting historic sites, archaeological and historical. I therefore suggest that the chief architect of the Board of Works should be asked to design an acceptable standard stone marker which would be readily recognised as such by passers-by; that a committee consisting of nominees by the Irish Historical Commission, the Museum, the National Library, the Irish Folklore Commission, and the Institute of Higher Studies, be established for the purpose of collecting information about all sites of archaeological and historical interest and preparing a short inscription which could be carved on a stone marker, and that the Ancient Monuments Division of the Board of Works be charged with the responsibility of preparing and installing these markers as opportunity presented itself.</P>
    <P>I think the correct procedure would be for the committee gradually to assemble a catalogue of such inscriptions from which the Board of Works could draw as their resources permitted, so that over 20 or 30 years we would have a pretty comprehensive system of markers established throughout the country.  Whereas from the short-term view we could get the more important ones done forthwith and allow the others to be added over the years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a concise and succinct memorandum. It has the virtue of being on <Col N="1538" /> one sheet of foolscap paper.  If acted upon, it will achieve a great part of the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I renew my urgent appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to assume the brazen countenance of the Tánaiste, bury the shamrock and concentrate on the creation of a simple single instrument to bring common sense to bear upon the development of the tourist industry in this country.  If he will do that, I think he will find that he will receive from all sides of the House a measure of co-operation and support commensurate with the approval that such common sense on his part could not fail to evoke.</P>

      <P>People coming to this country do not expect to find a country the same as the one they have left. They are coming here to see Ireland as it is, its customs and its people, and all they want really is good, clean hotels and good cooking.  In that matter some people have remarked to me that our meat is excellent but that our vegetables are very badly cooked and served and they often found in ordinary country houses in rural Ireland potatoes and other vegetables cooked much better than they would get in the best hotels in Dublin.  I agree because, no matter what hotel you visit in this country, whatever is the cause, you never get vegetables cooked as well as you would get them in a country home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>Even without the bacon. In any case, if the vegetables are not properly cooked and served, they will spoil any dinner.  That is a point that was made to me by an American lady visiting this country.</P>
      <P>Several people have referred to the condition of railway carriages.  I heartily agree that they certainly need some cleaning up.  If employment were given to more cleaners it would make all the difference in the world.  They want extra cleaning and that could be easily carried out.  That applies to all our train services and to the Great Northern Railways as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I wish <Col N="1539" /> to bring to the notice of the Tourist Board.  As has been stated, American visitors to this country like to visit the shrines and monuments.  I suggest that the local authorities should compile a list of the shrines and historic places in their localities and send it forward, even now, to the Board of Works, so that the shrines and monuments might be cleaned up a bit, or at least the most important of them, for the present season.  An account of them could be compiled&mdash; not a very long, elaborate account, because Americans like their data short and snappy and will not read long accounts&mdash;dates and the history of the place would suffice.  These accounts could be available in the hotels for the people who call there.</P>
    <P>American tourists are very keen on Irish souvenirs.  I regret to say that they do not always get Irish souvenirs. I was in Galway last summer and picked up an ornament representing an Irish leprechaun.  It was made in Japan.  That was supposed to symbolise Irish life.  I do not think any of us ever met a leprechaun, even in the remotest part of Connemara. We have some very nice souvenirs that would bring pleasure to visitors.  For those who can afford it we have Carrickmacross lace, for instance, Belleek china, and things of that sort. We have beautiful paintings of Irish landscapes by Irish artists.  These would be in the luxury class.  Then there are cheap prints of Celtic designs that represent Irish thought and Irish character, which would make very suitable souvenirs.  Foreign-manufactured ornaments should not be on sale as depicting Irish life.  Such foreign-manufactured souvenirs often depict barefooted Irish colleens.  These are non-existent.  One does not find them anywhere.  I think the hotels should stock genuine souvenirs of the type I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As regards handcrafts, the Irish Tourist Board should get in touch with the lady who has the honour of being on the Committee of the Arts Council, about which we have heard so much. I do not think there is anyone in this country who would be better qualified <Col N="1540" /> to inform the Tourist Board as to where specimens of Irish handcrafts could be obtained which would be very suitable as souvenirs.  Then we have the work of the blind who turn out beautiful things in wickerwork and leatherwork.  These should be available in hotels for people who like to bring back souvenirs from this country.</P>
    <P>Every phase of the tourist trade has been covered, from lack of parental control over Dublin newsboys to excessive drinking.  I am not an authority on either of these, nor am I a social reformer, and I do not think the Tourist Board has anything to do with either.  I rose to make these two suggestions, because it is very annoying to hear of people coming to this country and paying pretty good sums for ornaments which are supposed to represent Irish life and then finding that they are not made in the country at all.  I agree with much of what has been said about improving our country roads and our transport facilities, and I hope that the sale of these crude ornaments to which I have referred to tourists will cease, and, if we have to sell them anything, that we will sell them something which will be Irish, something representative of the Irish people and something of which we and they can be proud.</P>

      <P>I do not intend, more than I can help, to reiterate many of the excellent suggestions that have been made with regard to the development of our tourist trade.  I might say that I am a reluctant, a rather shaky convert, to belief in tourism as part of the economy of a nation, being very much more of the opinion that a nation's economy should be balanced by the inter-play of industries over which we have more permanent control than the rather ephemeral industry of tourism, which depends upon so many other factors over which <Col N="1541" /> one has so little control.  However, that is all of little importance now that it has been decided that we should develop energetically a tourist trade.</P>
      <P>There are points of general principle governing the development of this trade in which I am interested.  One of these is that to which most Deputies have referred&mdash;the multiplicity of boards controlling the tremendous industry the development of which is now envisaged.  I am rather surprised that the Minister has not decided to take the courageous step&mdash; it would need courage, I think&mdash;of establishing a main supervisory board with executive powers to develop our tourist traffic, on the general principle, with which I am quite certain he is very much more conversant than I am, that, where you have to discharge a single function, it does complicate and render extremely difficult the achievement of the maximum amount of efficiency where there is divided responsibility.</P>
      <P>I can see that the Minister perhaps has his own good answer to that, but I can see no advantage at all in the multiplication of these boards.  I can, on the other hand, see the tremendous advantages which have flowed from many of the enterprises for which the Minister in the past was responsible, enterprises which have prospered as a result of the drive and the initiative and the courage he showed in the establishment of the different industries which he did initiate.  I am surprised to see that he has changed in this very fundamental way in establishing the three boards now envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own limited experience of these matters, I considered that one board entrusted with the functions, powers and authorities acted at its most expeditious and was at its most effective when it contained within its powers all the necessary functions and authorities.  On the other hand, where there were more than one body of people responsible for the achievement of a main objective, I saw nothing but small-mindedness and restricted, narrow views on the proper method of achieving that objective&mdash;a parochial-mindedness about the right way and a selfishness with regard to decisions in <Col N="1542" /> the form of: &ldquo;This is our responsibility,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is not your responsibility,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This comes into our part of the functions and you are interfering,&rdquo; and so on.  The result was that very little progress was made, unless you had an overriding authority to enter into all parts of the particular job to be done.</P>
    <P>If we were to take Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre, the Electricity Supply Board or any of these enterprises and to do in relation to them what it is intended to do in this Bill; if we were to establish a publicity section in Bord na Móna, a section for the control of the power end of the business, another section for turf distribution and another for turbo-electric stations, and to give each of these separate functions in respect of the achievement of the one aim, the development of peat fuel as our national fuel, I am quite certain that we could not achieve anything like the same degree of efficiency, with economy of effort, as is achieved at present under the different boards which run these national companies. I understand that there is a certain amount of liaison by virtue of the fact that a number of the directors are members of the different boards.  I do think, however, that it is taking a step which does not appear to be justified.  Probably the Tánaiste can justify it; I will be interested to hear, but where he has had the example of successful experiments in handing over big undertakings and industries to groups, nominees of his own, under these Acts and regulations it does appear strange that he has not had&mdash;&ldquo;the courage&rdquo; are not quite the right words, because he has never shown a lack of that in these matters&mdash;but direct action in relation to this matter. It has been agreed by everybody that tourism and its development is tremendously important for the national economy, the balance of payments and all the rest, and consequently I would have thought that it was a matter so much above any personal or other considerations that it would merit a very radical approach if he considered that approach desirable in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is very <Col N="1543" /> much I would care to say of the amenities to be provided for tourists.  I consider that it will, in the first instance, be a function of the board and their nominee, the general manager, to work for the money it is intended to pay them.  There are, however, general considerations which condition the development of a tourist industry in any country and which apply here as everywhere else.</P>
    <P>I have only a couple of comments to make concerning the earning of dollars, and I am quite certain that the board will think of these things themselves. One, however, might require a little emphasis, and that is whether, for the encouragement of dollar tourists, it would be possible to provide tax-free export facilities which they find abroad so that they might buy our industrial products, such as those mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Rice&mdash;souvenirs, our whiskey, and so on&mdash;as this would encourage the spending of dollars on these commodities here in Ireland.  The Tánaiste is probably aware that this is done in France, where the American tourist is given every facility in the exportation of liqueurs, brandies and other products of the country.  The difficulty of abuses appears to be overcome.</P>
    <P>There is one other question on the dollar-earning aspect of tourism: To what extent are the British tourist bureaux in America taking over the dollars which are spent by American tourists intending to do a round tour? Is there any arrangement whereby dollars spent on travel in Ireland on a round tour are recouped to our Government, or do British tourist companies take the dollars and make facilities available by sterling through our railways, airlines, and so on?</P>
    <P>I wonder if consideration could be given to travelling facilities for young people of other nations?  I do not think that sufficient emphasis has been laid on that particular point.  One of the few voluntary organisations for which I have tremendous admiration is An Oige, which does a great deal of work here to facilitate foreign young men and women to come over and stay in youth hostels very inexpensively and to see the country&mdash;cycling, walking <Col N="1544" /> and, to a limited extent, by our rivers and canals.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we could give a little more consideration to facilitating these young people to come to Ireland, because it must naturally be remembered that if you could create regard and respect for our country and for our customs in the minds of the young people of other countries you might create the tourist of five, ten or 15 years' time, when the other nations will have developed their tourism and have the three-inch steaks to attract tourists as against what we can offer.  Even if you leave that point aside, I am a tremendous believer in the interchange of young people between the different nations, it being, I believe, one of the most important influences in reducing the likelihood of their having bizarre and odd ideas about one another which can lead to such serious consequences if they are used by the wrong people when they require those young people to take sides against one another.</P>
    <P>I would be particularly glad to see in this Bill an extension of the powers given to the board so that they could acquire some of the considerable estates, access to which is still withheld from our people in very beautiful areas, in Wicklow, Connemara or Killarney.  Their protection and development as national parks is a matter which, if possible, should be taken up by this board.  I am not quite certain whether they have the powers or not, and I would be glad to know if that idea could be developed by them: national parks in areas of beauty, with rivers and lakes.  There are plenty of estates at present owned by individuals who very often spend a great part of their time outside the country, having made sure before they left that their estates were plastered with notices, &ldquo;No trespass&rdquo;, &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo;, and suchlike objectionable features&mdash;in my view, at any rate&mdash;in our countryside. I am quite certain that if our young people and the young people who come in from other nations were given access to these places they would respect them as they have been taught to respect them in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Again, one of the very important aspects which might be developed is the rivers, particularly the Shannon. In order to develop them there is a number of different considerations, but one of the most important is&mdash;as abroad, in Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and France&mdash;the development of river maps for people using canoes, small boats and such other ways of travelling.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the Government is very keen on the earning of dollars&mdash; and I am certain they are&mdash;they might possibly adopt an idea used by the Germans prior to the last war, when they were very anxious to collect sterling above all things and when it was useful to them.  They developed the use of the Reichmark, for which the tourist travel exchange was at the rate of 20 to the £ instead of 12 marks to the £.  It was merely an idea which served them very well indeed.  They were able to accumulate a tremendous amount of sterling which they later blew back in various ways at the people who provided it.  I wonder if there is any way in which dollars at special rates might be won for our people by similar means.</P>
    <P>I suppose that Fógra Fáilte would be responsible for the issuing of maps, tourist brochures and other things like that, which at present are so terribly inadequate and so very poor indeed. If I might mention another point&mdash; which might help a bit regarding Deputy Mrs. Rice's good point about the terribly bad food in the average hotel&mdash;it is a development on the line of the Michelin Guide, in which the hotels are graded according to the standard of the food.  Deputy P. O'Donnell referred to the grading by the A.A., which did help, but the Michelin Guide goes very much further and give a very good idea of the quality of food and the standard of comfort in a very detailed way.  If the hotelier is faced in black and white with this cold-blooded assessment of his limitations or good qualities, it would be an incentive to him to improve or maintain a high standard.</P>
    <P>There is one final point which interests me, namely, the question of the extension of licences to the smaller <Col N="1546" /> hotels.  This must be approached in a cold-blooded, objective way.  If the Minister and the House decide that this industry, for the benefit of the community as a whole, shall be developed in a particular way, then developed in that way it must be.  It does appear, however, that one of the provisions in this Bill which would make it possible for smaller hotels to obtain licences for intoxicating liquor is being very bitterly resented and fought in the way that these gentlemen have for fighting these things, as the famous phrase once used goes, &ldquo;secretly and behind closed doors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly interested to notice around the lobbies of the House a number of these people high up in the hierarchy of this particular trade and a little worried by the effects which this lobbying may have.  However, I am quite certain that the policy outlined in this Bill is the carefully thought out policy of the Minister and of the Government.  It is their considered opinion that we should have these extensions in order to provide facilities for the earning of a lot of money, both dollars and sterling. I am quite certain that they will be proof against the blandishments, pressure, squeeze or whatever it may be to be applied by these people in suppressing the extension of licensing, if that should be considered necessary.</P>
    <P>They have, through their organisations over the years, succeeded in keeping the number of licences reduced to the very bare minimum.  This is, of course, a perfectly understandable thing, in so far as they are fighting for their livelihood.  We here in the Oireachtas, on the other hand, are fighting for the welfare of our people and I am quite certain that the Tánaiste will keep that uppermost in his mind if he does find that he is being subjected to any undue pressure from outside.  As I have said, it has come to my notice directly and also I have seen a familiar figure&mdash;a figure more familiar to me in the old days as an entrepreneur in a very unwholesome business in the past, who now appears to be taking up his old role and using this curious form of diplomacy to seek gain for one section of the community against the best interests of the community <Col N="1547" /> as a whole.  We will watch with great interest the success or otherwise of these people.</P>
    <P>A final point, a very obvious one, which this board will have to bear in mind, is that if we are going to double the number of tourists coming into the country the amount of shipping available to carry them will have to be considerably increased.  There was almost a very grave scandal last summer, due to the queues and the difficulties of people in obtaining accommodation.  I am certain that that point needs no emphasis on my part to the Tánaiste, that long in anticipation of the demand something will be done to provide proper transport and shipping facilities between here and Great Britain.  If he finds that the companies will not co-operate, I am sure he will take steps which are open to him to provide for their deficiencies himself.  Possibly he would also consider having some form of customs clearance carried out in transit, rather than on the quays as at present, something on the lines carried out by the Great Northern Railway, which would facilitate very much the quick disembarkation of passengers.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business - Amendment of Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950&mdash;Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should take immediate steps to introduce proposals for legislation which will ensure that the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, will be amended so as to provide that the housing subsidy will be increased to a figure not less than £350, and that the ceiling value will be increased from £2,000 to a figure of not less than £2,500 in view of the greatly increased building costs, and especially to facilitate persons who are desirous to avail of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.&mdash;(Deputies Eamon Rooney and John Belton.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to make a few brief remarks on the motion which is before the House.  I do so mainly because I feel that, at the present time, a crisis is developing in regard to the building trade, which, though incipient at present, still requires some consideration owing to the fact that it will develop to greater proportions later.  It is already apparent that the City of Dublin, which constitutes the backbone of the effort to provide houses for the masses of the people, namely, the provision of houses by the local authorities, is already running into very grave difficulties.  I do not want, on this motion to-night, to go into detail in regard to the problems in Dublin because we may have an opportunity of doing so another time.  However, it is well known already that the problem, in so far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, is one of growing seriousness, so much so that by next year we may have to face what will be regarded as a most serious, if not a castastrophic situation in regard to housing in Dublin.  That would be regrettable because during the last three years in particular a very great contribution has been made by the local authorities in Dublin and district towards breaking the back of the exceptionally grave housing problem which Dublin and this nation as a whole inherited from the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much progress has been made that those of us who try to assist ordinary citizens to secure a house from local authorities in the city and district find that our quest has become much easier within the last 12 or 18 months.  Nevertheless, even allowing for that improvement, there are still very large arrears to be wiped out. In the course of his speech in support of the motion, Deputy Belton said that a figure of 30,000 houses would meet the present needs of the City of Dublin.  Of course, nobody has the slightest idea as to the needs to-day of the City of Dublin in the matter of housing.  We are all aware that the Corporation of Dublin has recently carried out a housing census.  This gives a figure of some 13,000 or 14,000 actual applications, but the number of applications has to be judged in relation <Col N="1549" /> to the whole background of housing in Dublin over recent years.  Many families in the City of Dublin think that unless they come within certain well-defined categories, there is little possibility of their application being successful within any reasonable period of time.  The result is that there are a large number of families living under conditions which, though not overcrowded and not wholly unhealthy, are, nevertheless, unpleasant and objectionable. These people have refrained from making applications at the present time.  It is equally true that no matter how fully the local authority advertises a census such as the one made by the Dublin Corporation some people fail to put in their applications for houses.  I feel there can be no quarrel with the figure of 30,000 houses. As an actual definite figure measuring the housing needs of the City of Dublin in the immediate future, it is as good a guess as anybody could make, though it is not in any way a definite indication of the size of the problem that has to be faced in Dublin. Everyone who knows Dublin is quite aware that whole blocks in the city are to-day regarded by the corporation as not justifying an immediate consideration as far as rehousing is concerned. Yet one knows quite well that, from the point of view of modern standards and from the point of view of what is now looked upon as the minimum and proper needs for a family, there should be widespread clearance of whole sections of the city.  The clearance of these buildings should be replaced by new structures.</P>
    <P>If the problem in Dublin, which, to a large extent, represents at the moment the main extent of the housing problem in the country as a whole, is of such great dimensions, then we have got to concern ourselves with another factor which is bringing about a setback in the rate of the building of houses.  I feel it is true to say that, in many of the provincial areas, very rapid progress has been made by local authorities, so much so that, in certain counties, the minimum housing programme has been almost completely met.  They are reaching the stage in many counties of making <Col N="1550" /> available a higher standard of living accommodation to those who are already in occupancy of accommodation, which does not qualify under the Housing Acts.  One-sixth of the population of the whole country lives in Dublin.  Not merely has Dublin the greatest concentration of bad housing cases, but, because of the volume of population, it is numerically the largest that has to be dealt with.  So long as that problem continues in Dublin we will continue to have a housing problem local and peculiar to Dublin and also a national problem which has to be dealt with on a national basis.  It is from that point of view that any factors which at the moment are making for a slowing down in the rate of building in Dublin become of very serious import.  Those of us who are acquainted with the position will agree that, for one reason or another, there has been a slowing down and that we are now facing, within a short period of time, a drastic reduction in the number of dwellings being made available for applicants. At present this reduced output is not making itself felt so far as the building of dwellings by the Dublin Corporation is concerned.  That is a future problem which is appearing on the horizon now, and which will, I believe, regardless of any steps which we can now take, make itself strongly apparent within the next nine or 12 months.  Apart from building by the Corporation of Dublin, there is also the large volume of building that is being carried on in Dublin City and the immediate neighbourhood by private builders, almost all of which has been financed on the basis of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
    <P>It is already apparent to those associated with the building trade that a large number of small private builders, those to whom we refer in the trade as speculative builders, have been meeting with ever-increasing difficulties, particularly from the point of view of finance.  We have already had reference in the House in other debates to the question of bank credits, and I do not propose to dwell upon that except to remark that there is quite clearly on the part of the small private <Col N="1551" /> builder much greater difficulty to-day in acquiring financial accommodation for his particular type of activity than he experienced some time ago.  But on top of that difficulty from the point of view of our credit structure, there has also grown up within the last 12 months, because of changing prices, wage rates, and the thousand and one factors that affect the ultimate cost of a house, the problem that the actual provision by way of financial support made available through the Small Dwellings Act and through Government grants to enable the activity of the private builder to be carried on, has become less and less adequate to meet the actual problem.</P>
    <P>From that point of view the terms of the motion asking that the grant be increased to the figure of £350 and that the ceiling would be raised from £2,000 to £2,500 is of immediate importance. There are to-day&mdash;and this is a new factor in our situation in this country since 1945&mdash;considerable numbers of skilled building workers idle, not merely in Dublin, but in other parts of the country.  How many builders' labourers are idle it is better not to venture a guess, but there is an immediate problem of lack of sufficient employment for building trade workers.  Up to the moment in this House, we have had to concern ourselves with the question of the provision of finance for house-building, the provision of materials, the clearing of sites, and finally, the securing of the necessary labour force.  Now we have all these factors present except that the finance is not present in sufficient and adequate measure, and it is, as I say, being reflected in this problem of unemployment in the building trade.</P>
    <P>We should have regard to the men in the building trade, many of whom, not in response to any particular call from either this Government or the last Government, returned and took up employment in this country and made their contribution to the achievements that have been made in the last few years in the erection of houses. Many of those are already becoming extremely nervous as to what their future holds.  There was, of course, a <Col N="1552" /> period before the war when we had a set-back in building activity in 1938. When in 1948 it was possible to envisage an extended housing programme, the suspicions and the doubts that were present in the mind of building trade workers gave rise to many practical difficulties when approaches were made to them seeking their co-operation and their assistance in overcoming certain problems in regard to the supply of labour in this country.  We should bear in mind that employment in the building trade is one of continuous casual employment, of uncertainty for the men, of hardship for their families, irrespective of whether they are skilled or unskilled workers.  I should recall that as recent as 1930 the average wage of carpenters in this country, allowing for broken time, was a little more than 32/- per week.</P>
    <P>Because of these factors it is most important that we should take every possible step to maintain the level of building that has been reached in the last three years.  When we find, as it is clear now, that, because of the rise in prices and in labour costs, the financial provision being made to enable the people to enter into the ownership of their houses and the basis of mortgage under the Small Dwellings Act are no longer sufficient to assist in maintaining that building activity, we should review the matter on the lines set out in the motion.</P>
    <P>I notice that the last night the motion was under discussion Deputy Gallagher did feel that a little more effort should be made by the building worker.  I feel that this is not merely a suggestion; it is an innuendo that has been repeatedly made in public by public men and it should not be allowed to go without some comment. I would point out that, not in this House but before the Labour Court on one occasion, the same suggestion was made by representatives of the Master Builders that building trade workers were not making an adequate contribution from the point of view of output. That complaint or charge was publicly withdrawn by the representatives of the Master Builders completely and without qualification so far as builders' labourers are concerned, and they <Col N="1553" /> were completely unable to sustain it so far as skilled building workers are concerned.  It is not proper or fair that these statements are continually repeated and particularly by a Deputy like Deputy Gallagher who has some knowledge of the building trade and who has some close association with it. When he goes on to suggest that because we are now in what he regards to some extent as a slump in building activity that the building worker should, as he said, put a bit more into it, I am afraid he is forgetting the background of the building worker who has many unhappy recollections of the days when for every hour worked harder he spent another hour unemployed.</P>
    <P>Our purpose should be not to speak in terms that raise fear in the minds of building workers but to try to take steps to ensure that those building workers we have available in our own country will be retained in full employment so long as it is within our capacity to do so.  That can be done at the present time because we are assured that we have the necessary finance.  We can within reason obtain the materials and we will certainly have an adequate labour force, so that all we require to do is to apply our attention to the solution of the kind of problem raised by the motion.</P>
    <P>The particular importance of the motion from the point of view of this House and of local authorities is that with every day that passes we find a growing problem concerning local authorities in regard to the cost of providing houses for citizens and the growing difficulty on the part of the tenants in meeting the rents that have to be charged; we have growing agitation in regard to the differential rent scheme, and it seems to be a reasonable proposition as set out by Deputy Rooney supporting the motion that we should do everything we can to make it readily possible for the citizen who wishes to purchase his own house to undertake that responsibility rather than throw the whole of the burden on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>With the present cost of housing and with the limitation at present existing in regard to grants and a ceiling in respect of loans, the problem has, within <Col N="1554" /> the past six months anyway, grown beyond the capacity of the ordinary private individual whether he be the skilled manual worker or the white-collar worker.  To the extent that these sections of citizens are the very sections that normally are not catered for by the local authorities, while at the same time they are the sections of citizens who are prepared to make very often very heavy sacrifices to try to obtain their own home and in time to secure the ownership of that home, we should, on our part, recognise their willingness to shoulder that measure of responsibility and to make that sacrifice.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I support the motion because, as I say, it is necessary that we should immediately review our present system of housing finance, that we should review it in the light of the still existing needs on the part of wide sections of the citizens for proper housing accommodation, sections of citizens who are prepared to make their own personal contribution financially and otherwise to meet their own problems.  We should review it from the point of view that we are already in the position where, to some extent, a crisis is developing in respect to private building and the employment arising from it, and we may well find, unless we deal with the position promptly, a very grave situation on our hands in the course of the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion, firstly because it refers to the Housing (Amendment) Act of 1950 and to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and therefore gives us an opportunity to raise a number of points which are uppermost in the minds of all who have to deal with housing problems as members of local authorities or as members of this House.  I think the most disappointing thing I heard recently from the Minister for Local Government, when questions were being asked as to what changes he intended to make in the Housing Act of 1950, was that he intended to make no very great changes upwards or downwards in the grants under that Act&mdash;at least I got that impression <Col N="1555" /> from him.  I think that is a pity because I feel that the housing situation at the moment is such that it will have to be tackled fearlessly.  Much of the existing housing legislation will, I feel, have to be changed because, if things are allowed to stand as they are, the whole housing position will deteriorate.  So far as the Dublin Corporation, in which I am particularly interested as a member of the Housing Committee, is concerned, there has been a housing drive in progress since 1948, but we are still in the position that we have families of six living in one room.  It was very upsetting in such circumstances to learn recently that possibly our programme may have to be restricted next year.  The Minister is going to see us on that question. I think we may leave it at that until we have seen him and discussed the matter.  I hope that, as a result of the consultations between the Dublin Corporation and the Local Government Department, we shall be able to put the corporation housing programme once more on a proper basis, and that it will not be necessary for us to discuss the matter here in this House later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the whole position in regard to housing in the corporation area requires to be looked into fearlessly. The financial position of the corporation is so insecure, I feel that it is a great pity that successive Governments have not been able to provide greater financial help for the corporation. Money each year is being advanced to the corporation at rates of interest and terms of repayment which they can never hope to repay and as a result the corporation is going steadily into debt.  How long that can last I do not know.  I am sorry in a way to discuss it now because I do not wish to prejudice the position of the corporation when they come to look for money.  I admit that I should like to see them get money at any price rather than not at all.  That and many other reasons are why I feel that the whole housing position will have to be tackled fearlessly and that any question of leaving the Acts as they stand will only render more difficult the solution of the housing problem in future <Col N="1556" /> and, indeed, will lead to very great difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I agree with the motion in its present form because I personally feel that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act has more than served its purpose.  I do not think that it served the purpose which it was intended to serve in a way, because it ended up by facilitating the building of houses by people who in actual fact could have afforded to build their own houses anyway.  I would far prefer to see the whole Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act recast and drafted in such a way that it would help an entirely different type of persons to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I should like to see assistance given under it to the type of person known as the tenant-purchaser.  If the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act were to apply to smaller houses than at present &mdash;say, to a house of something like 1,000 square feet instead of 1,400 square feet&mdash;and that an equal amount of money were made available, on a higher valuation than at present, the result would be that people whose incomes are between £400 and £1,000 a year and who are in a position to put down a genuine deposit of, say, £50&mdash; I say &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; because it has been suggested that many people seeking houses were asked to put down deposits of £100 or £150 each, only to find when they went to avail of these facilities that the deposit was much more&mdash; could avail to a greater extent of these facilities.  If the Act were recast, I think a tremendous number of people who at the moment are in the unhappy position of having to pay high differential rents to local authorities would be very glad to avail of the provisions of the Act, because the annual payment would not work out very much more than their present rents and they would be buying their own houses.</P>
    <P>I feel also that this would be a step in the right direction because it would begin to reduce the deficit in respect of houses of local authorities, such as the Dublin Corporation, who at the moment are operating a differential rents scheme.  We have adopted that system really as an expedient.  Under present circumstances we have no other means of rehousing people who really <Col N="1557" /> stand in need of houses, because if we had a system of fixed rents I doubt if these poor people in the slums could afford to pay the rents which we would have to ask them to pay for new houses.  This motion, therefore, does not really strike at the heart of the problem, so far as the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to see it changed very substantially in that regard and I do hope that in framing new legislation the Minister will look carefully into the whole position.  He may find it very difficult to introduce legislation for Dublin and the rest of the country at the same time because the problem in Dublin is different from that which faces local authorities in other parts of the country.  One thing at any rate is clear and that is that there can be no justification for any reduction in the number of houses that are being built at present.  On the question of finance, it may be said that these capital works are costing a great deal of money but let us be clear on one thing.  If we do not give facilities to the people to build houses in large numbers to-day, and if local authorities do not engage in building on a large scale, the price of materials is constantly rising and these houses will cost very much more in the future.  I am sorry to see this motion come in that way because I do not think it helps the position.  I think the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts have served their purpose and should now be recast to serve a different section of the community altogether.</P>

      <P>We are under a certain handicap in discussing this motion in so far as the Minister has stated that he intends to bring in a new Housing Bill though naturally we have not the least idea how far the Bill will go or whether it will help the people whom this motion seeks to help. Because we do not know what provisions will be incorporated in the Bill which the Minister has indicated he intends to introduce, we must be prepared to support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll spoke of the problem as it affects Dublin. Though that problem does not affect us very much in the rural areas, at <Col N="1558" /> the same time it arises in the suburbs of Cork City, where unfortunate people are forced to pay £2 10s. 0d. and £3 a week rent.  Undoubtedly, the white-collar worker and other workers are under a severe disadvantage in meeting their other commitments as a result of that high rent.  If this motion can help to relieve them of some of their burdens and problems, then it is worth supporting. While a case may be made for the builder in such instances&mdash;the builder who can get a letting grant&mdash; I believe that the preponderant factor is the fact that the white-collar worker has to pay £2 10s. 0d. or £3 a week rent, and nobody will deny that that is a severe handicap on any man who is trying to rear a family. This motion asks for an increase in the amount to be given by way of subsidy and an extension of the ceiling value to £2,500.  If these increases are granted, it may mean that some of these workers in the city areas may take their courage in their hands and decide to build their own homes in the realisation that they would not have to pay anything more by way of repayments on the loan than they are paying at present by way of rent.  I believe that acceptance of this motion would prove a great incentive to some people to build their own houses.  Of course, if the grant were increased, it would automatically prove a great help to those people, who are under such a severe handicap at the moment, in the matter of providing themselves with their own homes.  It is true that certain builders are rather slack at present, but, if a method could be devised to encourage not merely the builder to build and let on a speculative system, but private people to build their own homes, it would naturally be of great importance and benefit.</P>
    <P>Certain matters were mentioned by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll which, I presume, would be more relevant for discussion on the Bill which the Minister has indicated he proposes to introduce. I agree, however, with Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll in one particular matter.  From experience, we have found that instead of people who deserve <Col N="1559" /> to get loans from the local authority it very often occurs that, by manager's orders, wealthy people and big business people who can well afford to build their own homes, get loans. These are people who, we believe, should not qualify for these loans. However, it is considered a good business proposition to give these people these loans and, that being so, I do not intend to pursue that matter any further at present.  When the Minister introduces legislation in this connection we can discuss the matter more fully.  There is not much point in saying that, in view of the introduction of the Bill which the Minister has promised, we are prepared to wait.  We want to help those people who are undoubtedly handicapped at present by having to pay such high rents in Cork City and suburbs and elsewhere.  For that reason I believe that this motion should have the unqualified support of the members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I earnestly hope that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts will be continued and enlarged.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll that the size of the house should be reduced.  Within the past two years or so a deputation went to the Minister and asked him to agree to a larger sized house, which he did. I may say that I do not know to what extent they agreed on that matter and were working on that enlarged scale, but I know that it was brought about by a number of young people who were able to afford £100 or £150 as a deposit on a house.  They asked the Minister not to confine them to a small house but to give them the best floor space possible in view of the fact that they were sinking their money in the transaction and would have to repay at the rate of about £2 a week.  The Government of the time very graciously agreed to an enlargement of the floor space.  While Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll's point would be a very good one if it were a question that people wanted that style of a house and had only £50 to put down, I think that the vast majority of the people would not agree with his views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not altogether fair or proper to <Col N="1560" /> say that well-to-do people are benefiting under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  They are not.  I see from our list that over the past year or two we received applications from bus drivers, engine drivers, black-coated workers, good clerks, fire brigade men and anybody who could prove to the Corporation that he was earning upwards of £7 per week. These people were encouraged to build their houses because they are regarded as a good type of saving person.  A man with that salary can build a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and, already, a large number of people have benefited under these Acts.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will not reduce in any way the size or type of house for which a grant is available and I earnestly hope that the Minister will, in fact, increase the grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has pointed out that unfortunately the activities of the corporation in the matter of building have been somewhat reduced within the last few months and some of us who are on the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation, including Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, are rather alarmed to see our housing programme going down somewhat.  I think we were down more than 100 houses last year although it is only three years since we advertised in the papers and sent coloured pamphlets across the water saying: &ldquo;Come back to your own country and build for your own people.&rdquo;  The Housing Committee of which I am a member almost gave guarantees to the trade unions concerned that anybody coming home would be guaranteed ten years' work, if not 20, and that in the corporation alone we were aiming at a target of 3,000 houses a year and were talking about a target of 30,000 houses within ten years.  What has happened?</P>
    <P>Some years ago we were permitted by the Minister of the then Government from relief grants to develop sites and lay foundations.  We helped the Government and the country generally by doing that.  We gave very good employment to men who were unemployed at the time.  We laid foundations all over the City of Dublin wherever we could find sites.  Now the Minister's <Col N="1561" /> Department have held up that kind of work.  They have asked not only for blue-prints or sketch plans of the development to take place this year and the next year but of all future development plans where new housing schemes are to be undertaken.  I blame his Department for standing in the way of our continuing that work.  He should remove this restriction and allow the corporation, as they were allowed some years ago, to acquire property and to develop the sites, leaving them until the builders are ready to tender for the houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was encouraged in this by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll who gave me an opportunity of drawing attention to this matter.  The public utility societies and the private builders of this city have done splendid work.  If you want to see where the Small Dwellings Act is worked effectively you should go out to the Swords road to the roundabout or to Collins' Avenue and down to Clontarf and see what is being done there by people whose wages range from £7 to £10 a week.</P>
      <P>The outgoings on these houses are about £2 a week.  The corporation have rented them sites and there is a very large number of applications for sites from that type of man who has £100 or £150 and is prepared to enter into a contract with a builder for the building of a house and pay £2 or £2 2s. 6d. per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to extend the scope of the Small Dwellings Act and give the corporation power to raise money to make advances.  There are some people to-day paying differential rents of a very high amount who, with the aid of another couple of shillings or even the rent they are paying, should be able to purchase houses. There are people paying 32/- a week under the differential rents scheme. That is not fair to them, because other people who are not being housed by the corporation are able to get their own houses built and their outgoings are about £2 a week.  I hope the <Col N="1562" /> Minister will allow the corporation, under the Small Dwellings Act or some other Act, to sell the houses to existing tenants and new tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with this motion to a certain extent and I should like to give my reasons. Deputies who have spoken to-night in connection with this matter are closely associated with the housing problem as it exists in the City of Dublin and from their speeches it is quite evident that the problem is still a very serious one in the city.  I am sure the people charged with the duty of providing houses are doing everything they possibly can to remedy that serious situation. But I should like to know where all this is going to end.  Every day we read in the papers of more and more people leaving rural Ireland either to work in Dublin or to emigrate.  We must face this question, not from the City of Dublin's point of view but from a national point of view.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as being against the housing drive in Dublin; I do not want to be misrepresented in that connection.  I believe it is the duty of any Government to take all possible steps to see that suitable and decent housing is made available to those who are not in a position to provide themselves with houses.  I think, however, that some Government must direct its attention to the fact that, if the present trend goes on, we will have the whole population divided up between Dublin and Cork and the Midlands and the West of Ireland turned into a prairie.  I do not want to develop that point further, as the Minister is about to bring in a Housing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that in Dublin the maximum grant available for a new house is £275.  In my own constituency of Roscommon, in the last 12 months, the county council, as a result of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, are giving a grant to supplement the Department's grant.  Where an applicant is entitled to £275 from the State, the county council is prepared to give a grant of 75 per cent. of that amount, which means roughly a total grant of £450.  That is not a bad grant at all. I think there is a very good case to <Col N="1563" /> be made for this motion, because the figure mentioned in it is £350.  I think that most of the local authorities are giving the 75 per cent. grant, as we are doing in Roscommon, so that the total grant available to a person erecting a new house is well over £400.</P>
    <P>That is a point I should like the Minister to bear in mind.  If he intervenes in this debate, he might give us some information on it.  The Housing (Amendment) Act of 1950 allowed the local authorities to give this extra grant.  In order to make that grant available, it was necessary for them to raise a loan from some outside source over a period of years. Considerable difficulty, I understand, has been experienced by some local authorities in securing the necessary financial accommodation to make those loans.</P>
    <P>The Roscommon County Council have been lucky, as we have succeeded in obtaining this year, at any rate, the amount of money which we hope will be sufficient to carry us over the present period.  I should like the Minister to ensure that the legislation which enables us to do this will be continued, because I understand that that legislation is only on a temporary basis to be renewed, if considered necessary by the Government, from year to year. That particular Act has done more to solve the housing problem in rural areas than anything which has been done in years past.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months there has been an awakening throughout the country in relation to the housing drive.  Every week there are fresh inquiries in the county council offices in relation to grants and the method by which application is to be made.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate a former Minister on having introduced that very excellent Bill in 1950.  I hope the present Minister will bear in mind the points I have made.  There is no need to emphasise the necessity of trying to cut down the population in and around Dublin.  Every Government that has taken office has expressed its desire to decentralise both government departments and industrial concerns in order <Col N="1564" /> to get the people back to the country districts.  There is one excellent inducement that can be held out, especially to industrialists.  Special provisions should be considered in connection with any new Housing Act whereby more attractive grants will be made available for houses erected in the rural areas for the accommodation of industrial workers.  That will provide an incentive to industrialists to establish industries away from Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is admitted that civil servants dislike the idea of moving out of Dublin.  Nobody can blame people who have settled down in the city for disliking the idea of any upheaval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am appealing to the Minister to consider some of the suggestions I have made.  I think the suggestions will prove beneficial in helping to solve the housing problem in Dublin.  It is agreed by everybody that houses are essential.  We have a large number of tradesmen resident here in Dublin.  It is quite obvious that the housing drive will be completed at some stage in and around Dublin, and skilled and unskilled building operatives must then move elsewhere in order to find employment. We should take a long-term view in relation to these people.  If we take the right steps now it will be much easier to establish them in homes outside Dublin.  That is one reason why I suggest the Minister should make the housing grants more attractive in the rural areas.  If I were a city Deputy I might not last 24 hours having made a speech like that. Nevertheless, I am supporting this motion because I believe the grant is not high enough.  At the present moment in the rural areas local authorities are in a position to give grants, coupled with the State grant, in the region of £400 and over.  Because of that I could not do otherwise than support the motion.</P>

      <P>This motion is certainly of considerable value in relation to the possibility of increasing the housing drive.  I intend to support it for that reason.  Many of the points I <Col N="1565" /> wished to make have already been covered by both Deputy Larkin and Deputy McQuillan.  I think this motion is very necessary at the present time because of the high incidence of unemployment in the building trade in Dublin and in other parts of the country.  I think it is particularly opportune in the circumstances that the Dáil should pass this motion at this juncture.  I also want to avail of this opportunity to voice a protest against the cut from £2,500,000 to £800,000 in the Estimates which have just been published for grants to local authorities for housing purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the second part of the motion more than the first, but I favour any motion that will help to remove the present stalemate in the housing drive.  Like Deputy Larkin and other speakers, I believe it would be a tragedy if we lost now the operatives who have been assembled for the purpose of our national housing drive. If we lose them we shall have difficulty in getting them back again.  Anything, therefore, that will facilitate or speed up building deserves the support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that an increase of £75 in the present grant would be in itself an incentive because £275 plus the grant given by local authorities works out at about 75 per cent.  It varies with local authorities but there is a reasonably generous contribution given to any individual who wants to avail of the grant.  I think a more attractive proposition would be to lift the ceiling in order to give a wider <Col N="1566" /> basis to the application of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I do not agree with Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll or Deputy Desmond that that Act has been abused.  I believe the number who did abuse the Act is negligible in comparison with the number who benefited under it.  No matter what kind of net one uses some fish will always escape. The Act has been very beneficial.</P>
    <P>It was my endeavour when in office to keep down building costs as much as possible.  I admit it is a very difficult thing to do.  I think the ceiling should now be raised to £2,500 to enable private builders to engage in that particular activity, particularly when there is a slacking-off in what I describe as public building.  I do not agree with Deputy McQuillan that there is danger of more people flocking into Dublin because every house built here is required for the purpose of slum clearance.  There is a slum problem in Dublin equal with that of any city in the world.  If one compares results one will find that there has been as much building in the rural areas, comparatively speaking, as there has been in and around Dublin. Local authorities have risen to the occasion and responded in a magnificent manner in providing decent housing accommodation in the rural areas and in that way they are helping to solve the slum problem in the City of Dublin by keeping the people in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>I do hope that no opportunity will ever be availed of to build smaller houses, as has been suggested by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  That would be a retrograde step.  Local authorities can build a wide range of houses under the Acts, and I sincerely hope that no financial stress or stringency will ever compel them to go back to a smaller type of house than they are building at present.  It is regrettable that there should be unemployment at the moment in the building trade but, presumably, it is only of a temporary nature.  These building operatives have enjoyed a long period of employment and they will not remain very long unemployed. If the forces built up over the past few years are now scattered it will be very difficult to mobilise them again.  If <Col N="1567" /> this motion speeds up private building, as I believe it will, it deserves the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Every aspect of housing has been dealt with under this motion. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll stated that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act had served its purpose.  For the last 20 years two classes of people have been catered for&mdash;the ordinary workingman who could not find a small deposit and had to be housed by local authorities and the individual who had sufficient money to purchase his own house outright.  I think it was around 1930 that the terms of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act were extended to enable people with a small sum of money to purchase their own homes as economically as possible. Money under that Act is available at less than 4 per cent. for a period of 35 years.  No money for the purchase of a house is as cheap.  Any building society will lend money for a period of 20 to 25 years at 5½ per cent. interest.  If Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll believes that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act has served its purpose he really does not know what he is talking about.  If the Deputy can say where cheaper money is available, then and only then will I agree with him that the Act has served its purpose.</P>

      <P>The middle-classes are availing of the Act.  At the moment the middle-classes cannot avail of the Housing Acts because the ceiling is too low.  That is admitted.  Private individuals got sites from the Dublin Corporation in various parts of Dublin in the past.  Deputy Alfred Byrne mentioned them.  They all availed of the corporation loan.  I mention these things to prove that the public need and want the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to continue in operation.  In the last 20 years no loss was incurred by the Dublin Corporation under the operation of these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am open to correction on this, but I believe no local authority can lend money under the Small Dwellings <Col N="1568" /> (Acquisition) Act if it incurs a loss equivalent to ½d. in the £ on the rates. I would like to point out to those people who do not appear to understand the operation of the Act that this Act does not cost the local authority anything at all.  It pays for itself.  The money is lent and the borrowers pay it back.  Some Deputy mentioned 75 and 80 per cent. as being lent under this Act.  In the City of Dublin and the surrounding districts up to 90 per cent. is consistently lent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the valuation of the 1950 Housing (Amendment) Act which relates to the cost price of the house. I would appeal to the Minister to consider this motion favourably.  I believe that he intends to introduce a Bill dealing with housing in the near future.  The ceiling which permits local authorities to lend money at the moment is too low.  If the Minister delays legislation he may create a position which it will be very hard to overcome subsequently.  If legislation is introduced now it will take at least three, four or five months before it comes into operation.  We are now entering into what will be a very busy period.  The Estimates will be coming on for discussion.  We will have the Budget.  It will be very difficult to find time for a new housing Bill.  There is urgent necessity for immediately increasing the ceiling under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to at least £2,500 to enable people to purchase their own homes.  There is also the desirability of increasing the local Government grant, particularly in the Dublin area.  If the Minister can see his way to giving these two items his favourable consideration he will put building back on a proper footing and he will allay the very grave anxiety that exists at present in the minds of those who are interested in buying their own homes.  In conclusion, I would like to point out once more that no money has been lost by local authorities in Dublin due to the operation of this Act and I appeal to the Minister to give the motion his favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture has indicated that he intends to oppose this Bill, it is necessary to make some brief remarks as to the necessity for its introduction.</P>
      <P>When the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-Holiday) Bill was put into operation on July 3 of last year it was welcomed by every agricultural labourer.  As far as some farmers were concerned, I think I might say it was generally accepted and these farmers accepted their obligations under the Bill.  It is necessary, however, to introduce an amending Bill to meet some of the difficulties which were experienced as far as the agricultural labourer is concerned.  I do not think the Minister or Dáil Éireann will say other than that it was the clear intention of this House and the clear intention of the Seanad to provide a weekly half-holiday for farm labourers. Some unscrupulous farmers took advantage of the fact that the agricultural labourer could not easily enforce his right under that particular Bill.  That is one of the chief defects that the amending Bill proposes to remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity for me to dwell at length on the necessity for giving, in present circumstances, a weekly half-holiday to the agricultural labourer.  The Minister and every member of the Cabinet from the Taoiseach down are loud in their exhortations to the farming community to increase production.  The farmers, to an extent, are offered incentives by way of fair prices, increased prices, subsidies and other things from time to time, but as far as the farm labourer is concerned there is as yet no indication from the Government that they will provide any sort of incentive to him to increase production or to remain on the land.  Down through the years the complaint has been that workers are fleeing the land. Farmers bemoan the fact that agricultural labour is scarce.  Yet these same farmers are not prepared to offer any <Col N="1572" /> inducement or even the ordinary human rights to the workers.  I suggest, therefore, that if Dáil Éireann accepts this amending Bill and makes cast-iron the right of the agricultural labourer to get a half-holiday during the week it will go some part of the way towards increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that many farmers gave the half-holiday during the week to their farm labourers. Other unscrupulous farmers, not recognising their obligations under the Act, did not because they realised that it would be difficult for the farm labourer to demand his right or to enforce it. Under the Act the farm labourer must take the farmer to court to assert his right.  That is an unpleasant task.  I venture to suggest that, if he did take that course, the consequences might be unpleasant.  I know of cases, and I am sure other Deputies know of cases, where the farm labourer sought his week's holiday from the farmer and where the farmer found some pretext to dismiss him.  Similarly, as far as the weekly half-holiday is concerned it has happened where the labourer asked for or demanded it, that the farmer, while not refusing it in so many words, sacked the labourer on some pretext or other, if not on that particular day on some day of the next week.</P>

      <P>One of the purposes of this amending Bill is to place the responsibility on the Agricultural Wages Board for the enforcement of the terms of the parent Bill, that is to say, it would be the responsibility of the Agricultural Wages Board to see that the employer will give the holiday where it is due.  I have mentioned the difficulties confronting the agricultural labourer in <Col N="1573" /> enforcing his right to a half-holiday. This amending Bill merely asks that the Agricultural Wages Board will do in respect of this measure what it does in respect of other measures relating to agricultural labourers.  Apart from that, it is hoped by this Bill to ensure that there will be no odious comparison between the worker in the town and the agricultural labourer, no odious comparison between the agricultural labourer and those employed in rural districts, such as the road workers, the forestry workers and tradesmen, who at present are in receipt of a weekly half-holiday.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the need for holidays, so far as agricultural labourers are concerned, and all we ask in this Bill is that it be done as soon as possible and not put on the long finger during the slack season in agriculture, that it be done in a matter of days in this House and I am sure that the Seanad will be prepared to give it a quick passage as well.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Adjournment Debate&mdash;Bord na Móna Housing Plans.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper I had a question tabled to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which really arose out of a matter which was raised here a fortnight or so ago in relation to the change of policy by Bord na Móna with regard to Boora Bog in the County of Offaly. It is important to realise the seriousness of this matter in so far as it applies to the County of Offaly.  When the Turf Development Act, 1950, was passed, power was given by Section 5 of that Act to Bord na Móna to engage in housing schemes for its employees. That power was one which was needed by the board if it was to proceed along the sound lines of developing bogs with a resident labour potential available for the development of any particular bog, and it was under that power that Bord na Móna announced a very large-scale plan and programme for the development of Boora Bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> That programme which was announced some 12 months ago or so was based on the support and co-operation of the Offaly County Council and it meant&mdash;I have not got the exact figures&mdash;that some 300 or 400 houses were to be built by Bord na Móna and the Offaly County Council, working in co-operation, at Kilcormac, Cloghan and Ferbane, and indeed the members of the Offaly County Council hailed the scheme as being of prime importance in the housing policy of the county. The provision of 300 or 400 houses in a county like Offaly, which is sparsely populated in areas, means a completely new venture for the council, and many people felt 12 months ago that Bord na Móna in its housing drive in the county was going to establish what had been painted from time to time by the Minister and other speakers for the people of the county, a rural village growing up around an important industrial scheme such as the development of Boora bog.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that suddenly, some three or four weeks ago, Bord na Móna altered its scheme of development in relation to Boora bog and changed over from sod production of turf to the milled peat process.  When that change was discussed in the Dáil, the Minister gave no indication that the change was anything more than a different development of the bog with no other consequence.  In my question to-day, I asked whether this change of policy would alter the housing plans already announced by Bord na Móna in relation to the Ferbane area.  The Minister replied to the effect that the change to the production of milled peat at Boora meant that it would only be necessary to proceed immediately with the erection of 100 houses at Kilcormac and 50 at Cloghan and he added: &ldquo;The position will be reviewed later when the bog goes into full production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an answer which, I suppose, makes it possible for the Minister to say that it does not mean that the balance of the houses will not be erected at some time in the future, but, from the point of view of hard facts, it does disclose that the housing scheme announced 12 months ago will not now be proceeded with and that <Col N="1575" /> there is going to be a considerable reduction in the number of houses to be built by Bord na Móna.  Further, it seems perfectly clear that so far as the present development of Boora bog is concerned, there is going to be a considerable reduction in the personnel employed because the number of houses to be provided is to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The matter is of grave importance to the county and I should like to repeat the complaint I have already made that decisions of this kind should not be arrived at without consultation with local interests affected.  For the past 12 months, the entire housing policy of the Offaly County Council has been based on the housing plans of Bord na Móna and if the county council had been aware 12 months ago that the board would not carry out the housing plans which it had announced, more houses would, undoubtedly, have been built or would be in course of construction by the Offaly County Council in this area.</P>
    <P>The entire business has been a very sorry one.  It shows that suddenly an important State service such as Bord na Móna can have its decisions and policies altered to the detriment of a very large section of people and I should like an assurance from the Minister that the possible review which he referred to in his reply will be carried out as soon as possible.  I should like an assurance from him also that as soon as possible the building of the balance of the houses will be proceeded with and that in the Ferbane area the board will exercise to the fullest extent its statutory powers under the Act of 1950.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Minister has access to documents, Cabinet records, of the previous Government, and he will therefore be fully acquainted&mdash;apart from the fact that public statements were made on this matter by his predecessor&mdash;with the decision taken by the previous Government in regard to the number of houses to be erected by Bord na Móna, with the approval of the previous Government, in Cloghan, Ferbane, Kilcormac, Clonsast and other town and village areas adjacent to the bogs <Col N="1576" /> being developed in these two counties. These decisions were taken by the previous Government after consultation with Bord na Móna, and related to the increasing number of people who had to be brought from outside to work in the years to come for Bord na Móna at Boora, Clonsast, Allenwood and other places.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate the extent to which decisions taken by his predecessor and the previous Government are being modified in the figures given to Deputy O'Higgins in the Minister's reply to-day.  If the number of houses to be built by Bord na Móna in the future is to be reduced, it means that the local authority, at the expense of the ratepayers, will have to make up for the reduction now being brought about by the Minister in relation to this modified scheme for the provision of houses for workers employed by Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a matter raised on the Adjournment by Deputy O'Higgins on a recent occasion, stated that all available local labour would be employed in Boora and presumably in other bogs, and, if that is so, there is no justifiable reason for a reduction of the number of houses which the previous Government and the Minister's predecessor originally decided to build.  I should like the Minister to make a statement showing to what extent his predecessor's decision has now been modified and to what extent the original number of houses is to be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision was taken by the previous Government or by my immediate predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the number of houses to be built by Bord na Móna in this locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you sure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision was taken by me on that point either.  The decision was made by Bord na Móna. I have no indication of the housing plans of Bord na Móna except what they tell me.  When Deputy O'Higgins put down his question, I invited Bord na Móna to give me a reply.  I could have replied that it was a matter for Bord na Móna and left it at that, but <Col N="1577" /> I preferred to meet the Deputy's wish for information and, consequently, I sought from Bord na Móna the material for my reply.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the reference to the housing plans of Offaly County Council.  Bord na Móna are building housing for their own employees.  Any housing needs that exist in the area for other inhabitants have to be met by Offaly County Council, and they will get precisely the same amount of financial help from the Government to provide these houses as Bord na Móna will.  Bord na Móna is obviously not expected to build houses which they will not require or until they require them for their own staff.</P>
      <P>So far as the change at Boora affects this issue, it is true that the milled peat process requires a little less labour than the sod peat process.  That is one of the advantages Bord na Móna see in the change, because they had anticipated a difficulty in meeting the full labour requirements of the sod peat process if all the bogs were developed on that basis.  As I told Deputies in a previous discussion, all available local labour will be employed, anyway. There is no question of anybody in the area not being able to obtain employment with Bord na Móna because of the change, although it may affect the number of workers which will be brought in from other districts for employment there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our previous discussion turned on the utilisation of the hostels.  It is obvious that it will be mainly in connection with seasonal work that the change in process will affect the labour requirements of the board.  As far as permanent staff is concerned Bord na Móna will employ the number required and if necessary build houses for them. When they decided to reduce the number of houses they decided to proceed <Col N="1578" /> at once at any rate.  Deputies can be quite certain that Bord na Móna will get on with the project as quickly as possible and that they will be able to foresee when further houses are likely to be required and make plans for their construction.  I have no information as to when that may be and I could not get the information except by asking Bord na Móna because it is a matter for the board with which I am not going to interfere any more than my predecessor did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister's predecessor asked for information about the number of houses required and that the architect's scheme was submitted for his approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not have to be submitted for approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what the Deputy refers.  I left a Bill authorising Bord na Móna to build houses and authorising the Government to give financial help to the board on the same basis as it is given to local authorities.  He introduced the Bill and passed it, and that gave Bord na Móna authority to proceed with the erection of houses.  The only place where the Government come in is in the appropriation of the financial aid they require. I am quite certain that my predecessor asked them, if the point arose in the Dáil, how many houses they intended to build.  When Deputy O'Higgins raised the point I did the same thing: I asked how many houses they had decided to build.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, March 6th.</P>
