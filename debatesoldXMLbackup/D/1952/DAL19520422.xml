      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent reduction in the prices of tyres and tubes did not apply to bicycle tyres and tubes because the previous adjustments in prices provided for a much smaller percentage increase in the prices of these tyres and tubes than in the case of the motor car and heavy vehicle types. The prices of tyres and tubes generally are kept under review and further price reductions will be made if warranted by reductions in production costs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in effect, is asking what have I done to doctor the Official Report in Volume 130, column 1142, of the passage in my Budget statement relating to the proposed increase in the duty on petrol and oils. The answer is nothing, for it is not my practice to resort to such dubious devices to cover up what was clearly a typographical omission.</P>

      <P>What will the Taoiseach say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to deal with this matter when replying to the debate on the General Financial Resolution.  The Deputy's question has, however, presented me with an earlier opportunity which I am glad to avail of in order to clarify the record.</P>
      <P>The portion of my speech in which the omission occurred should have read as a whole as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite last year's increase from 1/2 to 1/4 per gallon in the duty on petrol, the upward trend in consumption continued, duty being paid last <Col N="6" /> year on some 68,500,000 gallons as compared with 45,500,000 gallons in 1948-49 and 63,800,000 gallons in 1950-51.  There has also been a spectacular increase in the registration of motor vehicles, which numbered 73,813 in 1939, 122,536 in 1949 and 155,982 in 1951.  The number of motor-driving licences issued manifested a corresponding trend, being 99,662 in 1939, 173,234 in 1949 and 223,444 in 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey's intervention in the debate has demonstrated to everyone that the statistics relating to motor-vehicle registration and driving licences have, in fact, been published and are readily available to the public. There would be no point, therefore, in omitting any of the relevant figures from the Financial Statement.  What, in fact, happened was that the following words were inadvertently omitted from the text:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;73,813 in 1939, 122,536 in 1949 and 155,982 in 1951.  The number of motor-driving licences issued manifested a corresponding trend, being&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the figures for motor-vehicle registrations which were omitted justify to the full my statement that there has been a spectacular increase in motor-vehicle registrations and wholly corroborate the evidence to the same effect which is afforded by the increase in the number of motor-driving licences issued.  There is, indeed, a very close correspondence between the two sets of figures and the upward trend which they manifest.</P>
    <P>Thus, while the registration of motor vehicles in 1949 showed an increase of 66 per cent. over 1939, the increase in driving licences issued over the same period was 73.8 per cent.  Again, in 1951, the number of motor vehicles registered showed an increase of no less than 27.3 per cent. over 1949, while over the same period the increase in the number of driving licences closely corresponded to this at 28.9 per cent. When we add to these facts the further one that, whereas the consumption of petrol in 1948-49 was only 45.5 million gallons, it was 63.8 million gallons in 1950-51, and last year, despite the increase in the petrol tax for which my predecessor was responsible, rose <Col N="7" /> to 68.5 millions, the conclusion, as stated in my Budget speech, is inescapable.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the number of Irish citizens who have arranged to visit Barcelona for the Eucharistic Congress, nor have I information as to the charges for hotel accommodation in that city.  I do not agree that the basic travel allowance of £25 per adult can be described as very inadequate and, moreover, I am informed that intending pilgrims to the Eucharistic Congress can make arrangements through a number of agencies and organisations which will enable them to attend the congress for an expenditure which does not involve any excess on the present basic travel allowance.  The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the cost of transport to Barcelona and back can be met in Irish currency by the traveller before his departure.  In all the circumstances, I regret I am unable to meet the request in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>Draft by-laws in relation to offensive trades submitted by the Dublin Corporation some years ago dealt with certain trades which were not specified as offensive by the Public Health (Ireland) Act. 1878.  Approval to the draft by-laws could not be given until the question of including these trades in the category of offensive trades had been settled, in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1948.  An order to this effect has been made by the corporation, and will be confirmed shortly, after which the new by-laws will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two matters arising out of the discussion on the Budget which affect me personally and with which I would like to deal now.  The first is in relation to the disclosure of Budget secrets prior to the secrets being announced by the Minister in the House.  I stated here on Friday, 4th April, at column 1573 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was informed of the Budget secrets outside this House, ten minutes before the Minister came to them, by a Fine Gael Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride immediately intervened and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Cogan made a categorical statement that he was informed outside this House ten minutes before the Minister made his Budget statement of its secrets.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in Deputy MacBride's statement a definite attempt to twist and distort the clear-cut statement that I made.  There is an attempt made by Deputy MacBride to represent that I was informed of the Budget secrets before the Minister came into the House to make his statement.  I think it is necessary now to have the matter made perfectly clear.  While the Minister was reading his Budget statement here in the House I happened to go down the corridor and I met a Fine Gael Deputy who quite courteously passed on to me the secrets of the Budget and the increases that were being provided for in the Budget by way of changes in taxation.  He told <Col N="31" /> me exactly what they were, thereby showing that he had received full information of the Budget secrets before the Minister had announced them in the House.  I think Deputies should protest against the broadcasting of important matters contained in the Budget long before these matters are announced to the House.  Apart from that, the matter did not end there because immediately after the Dáil adjourned I noticed two slick little gangsters sneaking into the official reporters' office and I went in there and found Deputy O. Flanagan and Deputy MacBride questioning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw it.  I found Deputy MacBride and Deputy O. Flanagan questioning the official reporter, or the Editor of Debates, in regard to a statement I had made to the House and I want to protest against any Deputy, or combination of Deputies, going into the official reporters' office and trying to influence them to distort the notes taken in this House.</P>

      <P>I have said all I intend to say on that.  In the course of my speech on the last occasion Deputy Sweetman intervened by way of interruption, a technique in which the Deputy is quite efficient, and he accused me of having broken with the Fine Gael Party because I was not put forward as a candidate by a convention in Aughrim over which Deputy Morrissey presided.  I immediately informed Deputy Sweetman that that allegation was utterly untrue.  Not only was it untrue, but it was an accusation calculated to defame me in the eyes of my constituents and of the general public.  In view of that clear-cut accusation against my personal character it is essential that I should make it public that I was in the field as an official farmer candidate three weeks before that alleged convention was held.</P>

      <P>Now we come to the Budget.  It is necessary to say first of <Col N="33" /> all that the attacks which have been launched upon the Budget have been mainly based on the assertion that this is a bankers' Budget.  We have heard that accusation made again and again. Is it not an extraordinary thing to find that the newspapers of this country which have led the attack on the Budget are newspapers that are owned and controlled by the owners and controllers of the leading banks in this country?  You are all aware of the attempts which have been made to distort in every possible way the effects of the Budget but I think in no instance was the distortion more marked, more flagrant or more unjust than in the attack made upon the Coady family in Waterford.  There we have a position in which it was sought to prove that the Budget had effects of a most serious nature upon a family of 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply stating the facts.  I am stating the fact that a very serious accusation was made against this Coady family, inasmuch as four members of the family were represented as scroungers who were idle and who were living on their father's wage whereas, as a matter of fact, that charge was absolutely false and without a shadow of foundation. It is no harm to have that charge refuted.  It is no harm to have the Coady family vindicated, particularly the grown-up members of the family who are working, who have shown themselves to be honest, decent, industrious working people and not loafers as represented by the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they probably will do.  In the course of the Budget debate.  Deputy Dillon spewed <Col N="34" /> his unholy and unchristian hatred upon the five Independent Deputies who supported this Budget and who supported the formation of this Government, the five Independent Deputies who were the means of dethroning him. He referred to us as the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;.  Not being familiar with the jargon of the card-sharper, I do not know the meaning of &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo; but in so far as the words &ldquo;busted&rdquo; and &ldquo;flush&rdquo; are concerned, I am proud of them in this connection because we are the five men who busted the most outrageous conspiracy that ever endangered the life of this nation.  We are the five men who flushed out of the system of this country the dirtiest refuse that ever accumulated there.  We are proud, therefore, to be called the &ldquo;busted flush&rdquo;.  Deputy Dillon talked for the greater portion of his speech about what he described as this &ldquo;weak, silly little man&rdquo;.  It would seem as if Deputy Dillon had spent the whole morning before he started his speech gazing into the mirror.  In the concluding portion of his speech he made three charges which deserve to be refuted. Referring to the present Government, he said that they led us through the civil war and the economic war and that now we were going to have a dollar war.  These are foul charges which must be, and should be repudiated, by an independent and an impartial Deputy.  Everybody knows and impartial historians are agreed that no man did more to avert the civil war than Eamon de Valera and that there would be no economic war if a patriotic and national stand had been adopted by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far from this Budget leading to another war for the Irish people, I want to say that it is the beginning of an honest, straightforward stand for clean administration, for honest administration and for an honest balancing of this country's economic and financial accounts.  From now on, it is hoped that there will be no attempts made to buy popularity by handing over the dearly won title deeds of this country's independence to international moneylenders.  From now on, it is hoped that every Government in <Col N="35" /> power in this country will seek to meet its current expenditure out of revenue without pledging the resources of this country, without pledging the posterity of the country, as I say, to international moneylenders.  That is the fundamental basis of this Budget.  It is an honest attempt to meet current expenditure by revenue, an honest attempt to do the business of this nation in a fair and efficient way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the tax on the dance halls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many arguments which could be advanced and have been advanced in regard to this Budget but one fact stands out clearly. There is no means by which this country's accounts can be balanced and the nation can continue to carry on the administration of its affairs except by either drastically cutting down expenditure or increasing taxation so that incoming revenue will meet current outlay.  No Deputy in the Opposition, I am sorry to say, has attempted to set out in what way this large sum that has got to be found can be provided either by reduction of expenditure or by alternative taxation. Deputy Blowick, I think, rather let himself down when he came into the House because usually he appears to be a good-natured man.  On this Budget, however, he lost his temper, I am afraid, and Deputy Blowick does not lose his temper easily.  He called the five Independent Deputies who supported the establishment of the present Government scoundrels and compared us to Judas Iscariot.  That was not very moderate or temperate language for an ex-Minister to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was particularly immoderate and intemperate when we realise that Deputy Blowick and myself were members of a small Party in 1943 which did exactly the same as we Independents did in 1951.  We, as the Clann na Talmhan Party in 1943, put the Fianna Fáil Party into power although they were in a minority in the House at that time, and Deputy Blowick, I am sure, would be highly indignant if anybody were to compare him in 1943 to Judas Iscariot because we put the <Col N="36" /> Fianna Fáil Government into power. He would be very indignant, also, if someone were to compare him with the scoundrels who sold this country when the Act of Union was passed.  It seems to me that Deputy Blowick completely forgot the stand which he took in 1943, as well as the arguments which he and the rest of us advanced in support of our stand at that time.  We said we were supporting the only possible Government at that time, the only Government that could give stability, and that could carry on the affairs of the nation.  He must remember that, at that time, he and I, and Deputy Donnellan, were all bitterly and foully attacked by the Fine Gael Party, and particularly by Deputy Dillon.  Of course, a short memory is a great asset at times, but I think it is no harm to remind Deputy Blowick of these things.  We did not betray the inter-Party Government.  It was the inter-Party Government betrayed us.  As far as I am concerned, the inter-Party Government fought me for two years before the election in 1951. They sent down their men to Wicklow to oppose me at every street corner and at every chapel gate in Wicklow. That is the truth, but I succeeded in getting elected in spite of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that Deputy Keane will suggest that I am <Col N="37" /> departing from the Budget when I say that the whole burden of Deputy Costello's speech was an attempt to show that there was no need for an increase in taxation in this country. It was an attempt to show that there was an excess of between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 in the Minister's estimate of expenditure for the coming year.  He came in here like a school child, with a jotter and pencil, and proceeded to do sums.  The former Taoiseach is not very good at sums&mdash; he may be good at other things&mdash; because all his calculations were utterly and completely absurd.  Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who at the time was a sick man, was able to tear into shreds every figure that was produced by Deputy Costello.  Deputy Costello said there was an excess of £2,000,000 in the Estimate for food subsidies.</P>
      <P>He made up his little calculations in a silly and childish way without having any regard to the fact as to whether the cost of the subsidies would be higher or lower from month to month.  He said there was an excess of £1,000,000 in regard to social welfare, and made up his calculation by quoting from a speech which had been made by the present Minister for Social Welfare in which the Minister had said that social welfare was going to cost £2,000,000 this year.  But the Deputy completely forgot that, in the Budget statement, the Minister for Finance had announced that he was making provision for an increase in children's allowances as well as increases in old age pensions and other social services which would account for at least £1,000,000.  That was the kind of mathematical buffoonery to which this House was treated by the Leader of the Opposition, or the leader of whatever he happens to be at the moment.  The Fine Gael Party has been described by Deputy Larkin as &ldquo;working in the open light of day and in the dark of night to undermine the Labour Party&rdquo;.  It is a very difficult task to combine these discordant elements into one united leadership.</P>

      <P>I think it does not require very prolonged argument to dispose of the silly, alleged facts and figures produced by Deputy Costello. It is an appalling thing that a man who held the office of Taoiseach for three and a half years should come into this House and attempt to insult the intelligence of Deputies by producing figures which have no basis whatever in fact and which he knew, or must have known, to be utterly absurd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We listened, I think, with considerable disgust and impatience to Deputy Flanagan when posing as a pioneer, a member of the Total Abstinence Association, he protested against and deplored the possibility that there might be a reduction in the consumption of alcoholic liquor. It is, as we know, the aim of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association to achieve some reduction, if possible, in the consumption of alcoholic liquor, particularly by our young people but here in this House we listened to a Deputy, who claimed to be a member of a Total Abstinence Association, pleading for the drinking of more and more and still more beer for fear, as he said, that some barmen might lose their employment.  Was there ever such a contradiction?  Was there ever such a despicable exhibition of complete contempt for ideals and principles?</P>
      <P>We all appreciate that in a free society every man is entitled to his drink of alcoholic liquor if he wishes to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>And if he is able to pay for it and if he feels the enjoyment he gets out of his drink is worth the money he has to pay for it.  I think everybody is agreed that even now, when these increases in the cost of stout and whiskey are in operation, alcoholic liquor is still cheaper in comparison with every other commodity. Alcoholic liquor has not risen in price to the same extent as clothing, food or <Col N="39" /> any other need of the community over the past 20 years.  For that reason, I think no one will seriously contend that the man who likes a drink has any valid reason to complain.</P>
      <P>When we realise that it is essential to finance the services of this State, when we realise that money must be raised from some source, the honest, decent citizen will say: &ldquo;Well, if money cannot be got from any other source, I am satisfied to pay something as a contribution when I am enjoying a drink.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I heard of certain public bodies and county councils condemning the present Budget but I brought to the notice of some of the members of those councils the fact that in their recent budget, when budgeting for the coming year, they had imposed on the taxpayers a much higher impost than was imposed by the Government in the present Budget.  I cannot see how those county councils, controlled in many cases by an inter-Party majority, could justify increasing the rates by 2/6 or 3/- in the £ and at the same time condemn the Government for imposing a similar increase in taxation.  Their increase was in many cases an increase of 12 per cent. in taxation.  I think if we take the figure of increase in the present Budget we will find that it is not quite so much.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to refer to Deputy Collins' contribution.  Gurgling like a gully-trap on a wet day, he produced a certain letter written by the Tánaiste.  It was a letter which any man could stand over&mdash;a simple straightforward letter&mdash;that is was not the policy of the Party of which he was a member to continue taxation of dancing.  I think nobody could suggest for one moment that the Tánaiste did anything that was not simply forthright and straightforward in making it perfectly clear what the policy of his Party was in regard to the taxation of dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the taxation of dancing, I hold that dancing should be taxed not by the State, not by the local authorities but that it should produce the revenue in each parish to provide <Col N="40" /> amenities for the people of that parish and particularly for the young people of that parish.  That should be one of the functions of dancing in addition to providing enjoyment.  Now that the State has taken its hands off the contributions made by the people who attend the local dance hall, I hope that additional revenue will be available from that source for the development of a thing that is most worthily in need of development and that is the provision of cultural recreational centres in each parish throughout the length and breadth of the country.  That is what I want.  I hope that our young people, through dancing, will provide the revenue for that laudable purpose. I hope that every time young people assemble to dance and pay an entry fee they will do so in the knowledge that a portion of the profits of the dance will go towards making their parish and their district better places in which to live and that it will go towards providing better accommodation in the local halls and better facilities for cultural advancement than already exist.</P>
    <P>I have dealt rather briefly with the attacks which were made on the Budget in this House and to a certain extent outside this House.  It is my intention to deal briefly with a few points that were made by the Minister in introducing the Budget&mdash;points that were completely ignored by the Opposition because they were already discussing, amongst themselves and outside the House, while the Minister was making those points, what were the changes in taxation contained in the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very briefly with agriculture.  I think he dealt with it modestly because he simply said it was an extraordinary thing that, while other countries in Europe had increased agricultural output by 10 per cent.  as compared with 1938, there was no increase whatever in agricultural output in the Irish Republic over that period and that, as a matter of fact, there was a slight decline.  He did not go on to express any views as to why that position should obtain.  I think most people realise that it is essential, if we are to go on paying for what is now an expensive administration and expensive social services&mdash;and no one <Col N="41" /> will deny that they are expensive&mdash;to ensure that the output for agriculture must increase rapidly over the next few years.  I think the Minister was wise to draw attention to that fact.  What went wrong since the end of the war in the main was that we drove our farmers away from tillage.  We drove them to rely upon imported feeding stuffs and then suddenly we found that these were not available, with the result that the pig and poultry industries collapsed and, to a very great extent, the dairying industry was severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>We must now approach agricultural policy in a more responsible way than it has been approached over the last 30 years.  It is more necessary now than ever in the history of this nation for all Parties to come together and agree upon the fundamentals of a national agricultural policy.  There is no use in one side of the House fighting against the other about agriculture. There is no use in trampling upon the farmer's body while political Parties are fighting for office.  There is no use using his body as a sort of shillelagh with which one Party belabours the other.  I appeal to all Parties, whatever differences they may have on other questions, to sink these differences and come together and agree upon an agricultural policy.  To make this country prosperous, we must get the maximum production out of the land while maintaining its fertility.</P>
    <P>Can we not get common agreement to eliminate the uneconomic cows, common agreement that it is essential to increase the area of tillage by 1,000,000 acres at least so as to bring the total area of tillage up to about one-third of the arable land of the country?  To achieve that, we must offer an incentive by making it more profitable for the farmer to cultivate his land rather than to use it for grass. Can we not get agreement on these points?  Can we not get agreement that there is need for a vast, rapid and immediate expansion in the pig industry, an industry which should be based on home-produced feeding stuffs?  Can we not get agreement that, for a certain specific purpose calculated to bring <Col N="42" /> about an immediate increase in agriculture, loans should be made available to farmers without having to drag their neighbours in as additional sureties? These are fundamental points upon which, if we sat down together and talked the matter over, we could get agreement.  We have to get away from the attitude in which one side of the House denounces wheat growing and beet growing and in which the other side of the House perhaps denounces grazing and stock-raising.  We have to get immediate agreement on these matters, otherwise this nation cannot survive.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that to carry on the administration of this country we must raise additional revenue.  No one in the Opposition, although they have attacked various forms of taxation, has seriously challenged that contention. Since it is necessary to raise increased revenue, it will be agreed by all fairminded people that the sources of revenue which usually provide that increase must be approached.  These are, alcoholic liquor, tobacco and cigarettes.  Most of us would feel, and I think the Minister would feel, that it would be a good thing if we could spread taxation more widely over a lot of fancy articles, luxury articles.  I am sure all these ideas have been tried out from time to time.  Personally, I should like to have them even further examined to see if it is possible to tax luxuries other than those which are already included in the Budget.</P>
    <P>We must, however, be careful in matters of this kind, because it would be unwise to impose a tax on a particular luxury merely for window-dressing purposes, merely to show that the Government were going after the people with the money when the net result might be to bring no revenue into the Exchequer but to throw a certain number of people out of employment by disorganising some particular industry.  Nevertheless, I should like to see the Minister over the next year examine various sources from which it might be possible to get additional revenue instead of further increasing the taxation on the old stand-bys which have been providing revenue over a long period.  I do not <Col N="43" /> think that income-tax can be further increased.  I think the Minister made a progressive step in giving relief to those in the lower grade of income.  I think those who attacked the reduction, remission or abolition of food subsidies did not give sufficient credit to the Minister for the reliefs which have been given, first, to the man with a family in increased children's allowances and, secondly, to the old age pensioners by way of an increased pension.</P>

      <P>In addition to the reliefs I have mentioned for men with a family and the aged, we have also the substantial relief given to the persons with low incomes under the revised income-tax code.  All these reliefs, for the man with less than £1,000 per year at any rate, more than completely offset any increases in the cost of food owing to the wiping out of the food subsidies.  Therefore we ought to face this matter in a fair and reasonable way and admit that a fair attempt is being made, first, to balance the nation's accounts and, secondly, to ensure that no unnecessary hardship <Col N="44" /> will be caused to any section of the community.</P>
      <P>Let us also face the fact that the cost of administration has got to be dealt with.  It is a difficult matter to cut down the cost of Government.  The present Government took office with a legacy of increased salaries, wages and pensions passed by their predecessors without any financial provision being made for these increases.  The present Government have made financial provision for these increases.  It is time, however, to examine carefully the cost of every Department in order to find out if there are too many officials in any particular Department and if it is not possible to effect some economies. I am not suggesting that any economies which may be effected in this way in regard to higher officials in Government Departments will amount to a very great sum.  As far as the ordinary taxpayer is concerned, it will amount to very little.  The taxpayer is entitled to expect that every effort should be made to ensure that the country is run as efficiently and as economically as possible.  The matter to which I am now about to refer often causes me a certain amount of uneasiness, and that is the manner in which Government Departments purchase their requirements.  I would like some enlightenment on the subject.  Do Government Departments, I wonder, always purchase the cheapest goods? Do they get the highest value possible for the lowest price?  Are the purchases always made with the highest degree of consideration for the taxpayer and with the intention of getting the best possible value for the money expended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another matter in regard to which I and other people have received complaints.  That is the manner in which contracts are allocated as between different firms. Let us suppose that a very large contract involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds for the supply of thousands of articles is involved.  Is that contract distributed over one, two or three firms which can supply goods of the same quality at the same price?  If that is not done, I think it is definitely an injustice. Perhaps I am not as well informed on <Col N="45" /> this as other Deputies in this House, but I raise this matter because I feel that Deputies are entitled to be informed of the manner in which purchases are made by Government Departments, with a view to ensuring the highest degree of economy in the matter of goods and services.</P>

      <P>I have not got the small narrow, rat-like mind which seems to predominate amongst the Opposition. I am simply trying to ensure that the best value is got over the next 12 months for the money which we are raising by this Budget.  In view of the fact that the national bill has risen so high the Minister will be particularly anxious to see in what way he can effect economies.  Even if he cannot effect economies, at least he will take Deputies on all sides of the House into his confidence and show what he is endeavouring to do in order to keep the total bill of expenditure as low as possible.  That is the basis of good government.  We have, I believe, turned our backs on the system under which a Government seemed to buy popularity temporarily by spending freely, not raising taxation and leaving bills after them to be paid by their successors.  We have reached the stage now when the Government will endeavour, from day to day and from year to year, to meet its commitments on ordinary current expenditure out of ordinary revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody believes or would contend for one moment that this is a popular Budget.  The issue before the House, however, is not whether it is a popular Budget or not but whether it is right or wrong and on that issue the House must decide if we are agreed that the money is required in order that the nation can carry on without sinking <Col N="46" /> into bankruptcy and debt.  If we are agreed on that point we must accept this Budget and defend it because, as I have already said, it is an attempt to put the finances of this country on a sound and solvent basis.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose absence through illness we regret very much, gave us credit, when he was last speaking in the House, of being able to do a simple calculation.  He told us that the price of sugar would be 6½d. per lb. and that that was arrived at by a simple calculation, which every Deputy in the House would be able to perform, that is, that half the sugar up to the present was sold for 4d. per lb. and half for 9d. per lb. and that the simple working out of that, which we all could do, would show that we could be quite sure that the price 6½d. per lb. for sugar in future was perfectly calculated. I am very glad that the Minister tells us that Deputies generally are able to do simple calculations of that particular kind because, I feel, that it is essential we should do a few.  I will have to ask Deputies and Ministers to exercise some of their arithmetical prowess.  I suggest that the responsibility which we have in this House for doing the work of Parliament and seeing that the business of the people is properly transacted demands that, before we go any further in this debate, an opportunity should be furnished for a discussion, not on Budget secrets, but on some of the secrecy parts of the Budget.  This would enable us to dispose of some of the arithmetical obscurities, and say something constructive as to the idea behind the Budget, what is the objective of it and what is likely to be the effect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking here on Thursday last, Deputy Costello, very clearly and categorically, stated that there are a half-a-dozen headings under which over-budgeting is being done and that <Col N="47" /> the extent of this over-budgeting runs to the sum of about £10,300,000.  He indicated that, under the heading of subsidies, the Minister for Finance was budgeting excessively to the extent of £2,000,000; that under the heading of reserve stocks he was budgeting excessively to the extent of £1,800,000; that under the heading social welfare and, as has now been added to it, &ldquo;Other Matters,&rdquo; he was over-budgeting to the extent of £1,000,000; that in respect of over-estimation, he was over-budgeting to the extent of £2,000,000; that as regards payments in respect of debt he was over-budgeting to the extent of £500,000 and that, under the heading of what Deputy Costello described as buoyancy, he was over-budgeting to the extent of £3,000,000. These sums add up to £10,300,000.</P>
    <P>When we consider that the effect of this Budget is to put the hand of the State, in one way or another, into the pockets of the people and extricate money from them, it is imperative that we do not further discuss anything connected with this Budget without getting down to the truth or the inaccuracy of the case which is put to this House by Deputy Costello.  It would be too much to ask me to pay any attention to Deputy Cogan's comment on the case put by Deputy Costello to the House.  Let us take into consideration what the effect of this Budget will be on the pockets of the people.  By additional taxation this Budget proposes to take out of the pockets of the people the sum of £11,290,000.  In addition the effect of this Budget is to make the people's own hand go into their pocket and hand across the counter in increased prices for foodstuffs £8,580,000.  This gives a total of £19,870,000.  The effect of this Budget will be that out of the pockets of the people there shall come for the ordinary necessaries of life, an additional sum across the counter of £8,580,000, and out of the same pockets there shall come £11,290,000 by way of increased taxation.</P>
    <P>These are not figures worked out simply by the imagination.  In the table explanatory of the Budget, the Minister for Finance shows <Col N="48" /> that additional income-tax is planned to the extent of £910,000, additional taxation on tobacco to the extent of £5,500,000, beer £2,360,000, spirits £1,020,000, petrol and oil £1,500,000. The same simple rule that the Minister for Industry and Commerce used to deal with the price of sugar will persuade anyone in this House that the people are going to pay £11,290,000 more in taxation, and that is what the Minister for Finance told us in the Budget speech.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister also told us in relation to his removing some subsidies on foodstuffs after 1st July, that on existing rations and at present prices, food subsidies reduced weekly expenditure per person on rationed foods by approximately 2/- and that this 2/- per week had to be met by general taxation.  But when he removes the food subsidies to the extent that he proposes at the present moment as from the 1st July, the rise in retail prices should be almost 1/6 per head per week.  Now the total for subsidies, according to the Minister for Finance's Estimates, provided at the beginning of the year, is £15,250,000. The Minister proposes to pay subsidies at the full rate for the current quarter up to the 30th June next, that is, £3,810,000, a quarter of the full sum. There will then be left of the full Estimate in respect of the subsequent nine months £11,440,000.  According to the Minister, three-quarters of that will fall to be paid across the counter by the people buying these foodstuffs, by reason of the fact that he is reducing the subsidies from 1st July.  A quarter of £11,440,000 is £2,860,000. That is the portion of the nine months' subsidy that the Minister proposes to shoulder, as far as the person buying the foodstuffs is concerned.  When you take your £2,860,000 from £11,440,000 there is left £8,580,000.  That is the additional sum over current prices that the people buying foodstuffs will have to pay across the counter by reason of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>The Budget that we are now dealing with is a Budget that is intended to extract £19,870,000 out of the people's pockets over what their expenditure is <Col N="49" /> to-day.  When that is so and when we consider the effect that is likely to have on production and on employment, particularly in the manufacturing industry that sustains the greater part of the life of our urban people and contributes so much to our agricultural economy, we cannot usefully discuss it until we get some kind of answer as to whether or not the case that Deputy Costello outlined, that there is £10,000,000 over-budgeting being done here, is correct.  I submit that there is no person in this House in any Party who would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will give the Minister every opportunity of examining what we have to say about it but I would like to finish my sentence.  I do not think there are Deputies in this House attached to any Party who would not claim that when it comes to dealing with vital matters affecting the economic strength and well-being of our people, that they stand above Party and if they stand for Party they only stand for Party as an instrument ministering to the economic strength and the social well-being of our people. I am not rubbing the Minister's nose in this, and I would ask the Minister to believe it, when I inquire: Is it true that the effect of this Budget is to take £11,000,000 odd in taxation out of the people's pockets and that it is going to put £8,500,000 more expense on the people over the present prices of foodstuffs for the last three-quarters of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the facts that are here in the Minister's statement and in the tables put before us are there to be examined by every person here and I say emphatically that that is a fact. There is no one going to go down before the people to-day and tell them that they are not going to pay more for sugar, for bread, for tea and for butter, for all those items from which the subsidies are being removed.  Who is going to stand up and persuade the people that is not so?  The people <Col N="50" /> know it.  They are told it.  They have been told how much in the £ they have to pay for these additions.  There are additions going to be made across the counter and they can be figured out from the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>If the subsidies were not withdrawn, 2/- per head per week would be paid. One shilling and sixpence will be taken off&mdash;and that 1/6 works out at £8,500,000.  Let us, therefore, stick to this part of my argument at any rate: £19,870,000 will be taken out of the pockets of the people partly by way of taxation and partly by way of additional payments for food across the counter.  That will be the effect of this Budget on the pockets of the people.  We must also keep before our minds what effect this Budget will have on employment and on industry in general.  When somebody asserts that the Government are budgeting for £10,000,000 more than they require, it is necessary to examine the question carefully.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the headings of Deputy J.A. Costello's speech.  The Minister indicated just now that nobody will believe these calculations. I do not care whether the calculations I put before this House will be found to be justified or not but I consider that if they are wrong I should be told that they are wrong because, if they are wrong, we want to know what is right so as to bring about a clear and simple discussion on this Budget.  The more this debate continues, the more obvious it will be that we cannot get down to a clear discussion either on the intent, which is important, or the effect of this Budget, which is important, too, until we clear up these matters.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the question of what the Government is saving in the matter of subsidies we have to compare what the total subsidies are with what the people will pay when the subsidies are withdrawn. If the difference between what the people pay and the total estimated subsidies is not what the Government are going to have to pay themselves by way of subsidy, then let us examine that figure and ask why the amount <Col N="51" /> of money saved by the Government and the amount of extra money paid by the people is not the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke immediately after Deputy J. A. Costello.  Dealing somewhat lightly with the matter, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that the increase in the price of homegrown wheat, and possibly in the price of imported wheat, would, at the end of the nine months' period, affect the amount of money to be paid by the State by way of subsidy.  Let us have these figures.  When the Estimates for the £15,000,000 subsidies were prepared, the Government, no doubt, had in mind what they would do in regard to an increase in the price of wheat. All the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to say with regard to it was simply to refer to the possible increase in the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, however, dealt with the matter at greater length.  We see at column 1523 of the Official Report of the 4th April, 1952, that the Minister for Social Welfare divided up the subsidies in respect of bread, flour, tea and butter and gave explicit figures as to what the saving to the Government would be.  He stated that the subsidies payable according to the Estimates in respect of bread and flour amounted to £9,280,000 but that the saving would only be £2,710,000.  He stated that the subsidies payable, according to the Estimates, would be £2,440,000 in respect of tea and that the saving would be £1,800,000.  He said, with regard to butter, that the estimated subsidies, payable according to the Estimates were £3,550,000 and that the savings would be £2,158,000.  It would seem, according to the Minister for Social Welfare, that the revised expenditure which the Minister for Finance would have to meet in respect of bread and flour would be £6,570,000; tea, £604,000 and butter, £1,392,000, and that when all these sums were put together to represent the original Estimates&mdash;the revised Estimates for Government expenditure and the saving to the Government&mdash;the figures were £15,234,000, the original rate, and <Col N="52" /> £8,566,000, the revised rate of expenditure&mdash;and he claimed that the saving would be only £6,608,000.  One would be inclined to jump a bit at these figures and to say that, again, the Minister has mixed up his figures and that instead of accepting that a sum of £8,580,000 would come out of the pockets of the people across the counter&mdash;as I have shown to be correct &mdash;the total spending by the Government would be only £6,670,000 and that these figures were transposed because what the Minister claims is that the amount that will be paid in subsidy by the Government is £8,566,000, which is the sum that the people will pay out of their pockets.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister for Social Welfare stated is correct, then the effect of what is being done with these subsidies is that instead of having to pay £15,250,000 between what goes over the counter and what goes in by way of taxation to pay the subsidies, a sum of £17,146,000 will be paid&mdash;or that the shift in subsidies between all the various frills that are involved will cost £1,900,000 that would not be required if the subsidies were left alone and the Government paid the subsidies they had included in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there could be even a little preliminary appreciation of that point.  It is figured out by simple subtraction and division that, in the three latter quarters of the present financial year, the people are going to have to pay £8,580,000 more across the counter and that if all that was being spent on these foodstuffs by State subsidy and additional private purchasing was only to be £15,250,000, then all that would have to be paid by the State would be £6,670,000.  But the Minister for Social Welfare states that, in the presentation of the case to us, the Government take it that they will have to pay out £8,566,000.  What is happening at the present time is that the change in the subsidy situation is being made the excuse for taking out of the people's pockets nearly £2,000,000 more than would be taken out if the subsidies were left alone.</P>
    <P>All I want to get settled before we get into a real discussion of this matter <Col N="53" /> is whether that is true or not.  If there is any flaw in it, will the Minister say what is his calculation of what the people are going to pay additional out of their pockets and across the counter and will he show how he arrives at the calculation?  The Minister for Social Welfare agrees with Deputy Costello's calculation in respect of tea but differs from him in respect of butter.  He says in regard to butter that there are arrears on 1st April and that they amount to £217,000.  There are no arrears with regard to tea, but while normally one would expect that, if they were winding up at the end of June, there would only be one set of arrears to be minded, the Minister works out things in a general way, slaps a lot of different figures together and arrives at the conclusion that the Government's expenditure on butter is going to be £500,000 more than Deputy Costello says.  We ought to have some particulars of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said that his reasons for dealing with butter specially is that he knows all about it, that he does not know about bread and flour, but he nevertheless lays down categorically with regard to bread and flour that there are two items involved in what the Government will have to pay on the subsidy side.  One is that, when there was sale for white flour as against the 85 per cent. extraction flour, there was a considerable Appropriation-in-Aid, but that no one will be compelled to take white flour now and that no income is expected, so that Appropriation-in-Aid will vanish, and the other, that the change from 85 per cent. to 80 per cent. extraction will cost a certain amount of money.  He thinks that these two items alone are going to cost £1,400,000.</P>
    <P>The question that arises in my mind is: If the burden is going to be so great under any aspect of this Budget, however changed as it goes through the House, what is the policy behind the change from 85 per cent. to 80 per cent. extraction just at this time and what are the people going to pay for it by way of additional price for the bread made from the lower extraction and loss of the appropriation.  The main thing which has to be worked out <Col N="54" /> in the end&mdash;and for that purpose the effect of the change in regard to subsidy on all these items of foodstuffs has to be examined&mdash;is why it is that whatever the Government are doing with regard to subsidies as proposed at present is going to cost the people, between cost over the counter and cost to the taxpayer, in the region of £1,900,000 more than they are paying at present.</P>
    <P>The second point Deputy Costello made was that, in the matter of reserve stocks, there was over-budgeting to the extent of £1,800,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce purported to comment on this matter and he said something which I do not think is very relevant.  Further, one has difficulty in understanding what he refers to.  Reserve stocks which were accounted for in the table explanatory of the current Budget of 1951 by Deputy McGilligan to the extent of £1,793,000, or £1,800,000, were not included in any statement on the capital side of the Budget.  The Minister stated that, in order to set up a true reserve of stocks in certain Departments as provision against higher prices and possible shortages, he was arranging for the purchase of these stocks, but that he did not consider it proper budgeting to pay for all these stocks in the year of purchase. He felt that if he were laying up for the future and laying in stocks which were only going to be used in two years' time, the year in which the stocks were used was the year in which they ought to be budgeted for and the necessary taxation imposed.</P>
    <P>At column 1293, Volume 130, No. 9 of the Official Debates the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May I say that the cost of each of the Supply Services has been accurately calculated and there has been deducted from that cost every item of expenditure which Deputy McGilligan last year chose to describe as a capital investment? There is, therefore, no element in that sum which could be so described and in so far as any expenditure is contemplated upon reserve stocks in this year and that <Col N="55" /> expenditure could legitimately be described as an investment, then the amount has been deducted in calculating the bill which the taxpayer has to meet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that last sentence is interpretable at all.  The question that arises for us is this.  With all that has been said regarding difficulties throughout the world, with all the talk about the possibility of this country being put into pawn to the United States, with all the remarks about demands for bases in this country, are we to understand that, while members of the Government Party are speaking in that strain, no provision has been made for the building up of reserve stocks?  The Minister states in his speech that, whereas Deputy McGilligan made provision for £1,800,000 last year, only £800,000 was spent, because of the unavailability of some of those goods. I take it that the necessity remains to get the goods to the extent of that £1,000,000.  Furthermore, if there is any reality in the situation painted by various Government speakers, surely they must, somewhere through the Estimates that have been put before us, be providing for further reserve stocks in the same way as the various Government Departments were providing for them when Deputy McGilligan presented his Budget statement in 1951?  Therefore, can we not take it that the necessity remains to get goods to the extent of the balance of £1,000,000, plus an additional amount equivalent to what was received last year?</P>
    <P>We say that the Estimates as presented to us must cover the building up of reserve stocks in relation to the Department of Local Government, the Department of Health, the Board of Works and so on; and that it is not proper in any year&mdash;and particularly in a year in which the Government are making such demands upon the people &mdash;to charge by way of taxation the cost of goods that are not likely to be used for two or three years.  Anyone will understand that if you buy goods now to be used in five years' time it would be improper to charge the whole of that amount to the current Budget. <Col N="56" /> The same applies if it is three years or two years.  The Minister has to tell us whether it is a fact that no reserve stocks are being laid in for the work of the next two, three or four years for services connected with Local Government, Public Works, Health and other Departments.  Has the Minister anything to say regarding reserve stocks being built up in connection with defence?  These are matters that we ought to know about before we can with any kind of justification take a decision on the general question involved in the taxation that the Minister has put before us.</P>
    <P>The third point concerns item No. 4 in the table explanatory of the current Budget, where the Minister adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provision for proposals in the Social Insurance Bill, 1951, and for other current services, £3,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That matter has been commented on by the Minister for Social Welfare.  He has pointed out that the Minister for Finance has other services in mind as well as social welfare.  I think it is unprecedented to put down a general intention of that kind either in an Estimate or in a table explanatory of the Budget and put £1,000,000 against it. The Minister for Social Welfare has given no indication as to the nature of the &ldquo;other matters&rdquo; the Minister for Finance had in mind.  Deputy Cogan, however, told us that the Minister for Finance was intending under that heading to increase children's allowances and old age pensions and was going to add other social services and that they would amount at least to £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>After listening to the variety of matters that Deputy Cogan spoke about and having seen the precision that he brought to bear on them, the Minister would be asking too much of us if he asked us to take this information, given to the House by Deputy Cogan, as being true.  The Minister cannot leave that figure there for &ldquo;other current services, £1,000,000&rdquo; without letting the House know what exactly those services are and the particular amounts to be allocated to each of them.</P>
    <P>The fourth heading was &ldquo;over-estimation&rdquo; and Deputy Costello very <Col N="57" /> conservatively suggested that there was over-estimation to the extent of £2,000,000 in a bill for £107,000,000. Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Social Welfare, gave it as his opinion, as recorded in column 1530, that one need not say very much about that as it was quite evident from the experience of the last few years that there was no money to be deducted from that Estimate by way of over-estimation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, however, speaks in a very different way.  He said, as given in column 1289:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will admit there is a possibility that the Estimate may be slightly wrong.  However, our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The experience of the Minister for Social Welfare was that it was not worth talking about, that it was impossible that there should be any money there.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, however, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Five per cent. means £5,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister the reasons why he must take these matters one by one and deal with them.  I again want to jerk him back to the realities of the position.  We are criticising these things in circumstances in which £11,250,000 is to be extracted from the people's pockets this year by way of additional taxes and £8,500,000 across the counter for the increased prices of foodstuffs, £19,800,000, therefore, will be taken out of their pockets. With that shocking burden imposed on the people by this Budget I say that every £100,000 that is over-estimated is a matter of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must realise that both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who like to dabble in figures have found it impossible to <Col N="58" /> stand over the suggestion that this big total bill is one in respect of which they can say that there is no over-estimation. The words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are clear and I will read their context in columns 1280-91:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will admit that there is a possibility that the Estimate may be slightly wrong.  At this time of the year, it is not possible to calculate to the last penny the probable cost of a variety of Government services or the probable yield of a number of taxes.  However, our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to allow the matter to be left at that point just because the Minister thinks it desirable or convenient to interrupt me in the middle of a sentence, in the middle of reading what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said for everybody to read.  If the Minister for Finance has any sense of responsibility at all I expect him to deal with these matters in a systematically prepared White Paper which we can examine. I do not think that there is any use in anybody discussing either the intent or object or effect of the Budget until these matters are cleared up.  At least £10,000,000 is involved in this argument. If the Minister will allow me I will read for the benefit of Deputies the whole sentence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;However, our experience suggests that the margin for error is not <Col N="59" /> much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.  Even if we assume that it is in this year as great as 10 per cent, it is obvious that a very substantial addition to the revenue must be secured by higher taxes, or, alternatively, that expenditure must be drastically curtailed.  That is the problem the Dáil is being asked to consider.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will read another sentence that may not appear to have much to do with this in order to get down to a sentence which has.  The Minister continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance has put before the Dáil a number of proposals for bridging that gap involving both higher taxes and reduced expenditure.  Any Deputy who wants to criticise those proposals has an obligation to put forward some alternative to them.  We cannot bridge that gap in the national revenue by passing resolutions here, by recording protests.  The gap is there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The gap is there and we here say that the gap is not as big as the Minister has indicated to the House.  Information can be had and calculations can be made under six different headings to answer Deputy Costello, if Deputy Costello's calculations are wrong.  The Minister is asking us to pass a Resolution this evening or whenever the debate is finished to allow him legislation which will take an additional £20,000,000 out of the pockets of the people who either pay taxes or buy foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister appreciates the type of appeal we will make to him in the interests of this House as an institution and therefore in the interests of the people who set up this House as an institution to do this vital work for them.  I ask the Minister to believe that I was not rubbing his nose in any of these figures.  I am bringing them out simply with the argument: here are figures which require to be put in some perspective and which require some explanation. No person in this Assembly can consider that he has discharged his duty&mdash; his duty at a very vital national <Col N="60" /> moment&mdash;unless he deals with this matter.</P>
    <P>The next question is interest. Deputy Costello has intimated that in making provision for the payment of debt there is over-estimation to the extent of £500,000.  I think that that is a more than conservative estimate. I want to put some figures before the Minister in that regard.  In the White Paper &ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure,&rdquo; page 4, part 3, there are details of the Estimate of expenditure for the service of the public debt by way of interest.  For 1951-52 we have the figure £4,319,767.  The Estimate shows under the heading 1952-53 an Estimate of what the Minister is going to spend as included in his budgetary consideration for the current year and the figure is £6,389,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has intimated&mdash;some of his colleagues have intimated&mdash;that in the current year £600,000 is the sum that is due to be paid by way of interest on the Marshall moneys loaned to this country.  We, therefore, can take £600,000 from £6,389,000 and we get the Estimate of the moneys that he is going to pay by way of interest on public debt on moneys other than the Marshall moneys.  That totals £5,789,000.  There is an increase in the amount of money the Minister estimates that he will pay by way of interest on public debt of £1,469,233, an increase of 34 per cent.  The public debt upon which interest is being paid is indicated in table V of the tables issued in connection with the Financial Statement, 1952, page 7.  There it is given that the gross liabilities on 31st March, 1951, and on 31st March, 1952, were, respectively, £178,941,853 and £213,612,059 and we are told in the notes that these figures contain double reckoning in relation to Marshall moneys, that from the former £16,000,000 has to be deducted and from the latter, £40,500,000.  Making these deductions, the gross liabilities upon which the interest on public debt, the figures for which I have mentioned, is to be paid, are: March, 1951, £162,941,853 and March, 1952, £173,112,059.  That is an increase in gross liabilities of £10,171,206 or an increase of 6.3 per cent.  In the case <Col N="61" /> put before this House as to the moneys that he expects to pay in interest on public debt the Minister has given us figures which represent an increase of 34 per cent. on an increase of 6.3 per cent. in debt.</P>
    <P>If the Minister during the current year paid off the debt for this year at the same rate as the debt was paid off last year he would be paying something like £1,000,000 less than he has estimated for.  I want to know what the Minister has to say to that.  I want to know why the Minister, when he is making up his Budget, is going to pay an increase of 34 per cent. in interest for an increase of 6.3 per cent. in debt. While the Minister will glibly butt in on certain matters, I would not expect him glibly to but in on that.  I would expect the Minister to understand what our feelings are and our desire to see what exactly the situation is when, on looking into these figures, we find that situation.  The figures I have given there are the figures for public debt taking the Marshall moneys out. Deputy Costello has indicated that he thinks there is £500,000 at least over-budgeting in the matter of interest. I think the figure is £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>The sixth point where Deputy Costello has put it to the Minister that there is over-budgeting is in the matter of buoyancy, to the extent of £3,000,000.  When I look again at the White Paper Estimates for receipts and expenditure, I see that tax revenue for the year 1951-52 brought in £73,161,000 and that it is estimated that in the current year, if the taxes were unchanged, the old taxes would bring in £74,765,000.  I could not imagine a greater tribute to the work that was done during the inter-Party régime, to the policy that was pursued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the policy that was pursued by the inter-Party Government in handling the finances of this country, in fostering agricultural production and in fostering the development of industry than that the present Minister for Finance would <Col N="62" /> turn up here in April this year and would tell the House that the same old taxes that were in operation last year, without any addition to them, would bring in during the current year £1,600,000 more than they did last year, if they were never touched.  That is a tribute to the way in which the social and the economic foundations of this country were fostered and developed during the last three years.</P>
      <P>I might be inclined to think that Deputy Costello was a little bit optimistic, that after all that had been said and all that had been done by the Government since they came into office, that that buoyancy would have maintained itself untarnished.  At any rate that £3,000,000 is put down there and, in the light of all that has gone before and in the light of what has been said under each of these other subsidies here, that requires to be answered.  My reading of the position is that, even if that £3,000,000 had to be modified that, in relation to the over-estimation there and in relation to interest, there is a margin there that will leave at the present moment that £10,300,000 unmodified in any way. I put it to the Minister for Finance that there can be no reasonable and no proper or constructive discussion on this Budget until these matters are thoroughly and effectively dealt with and they can only be dealt with by the issue of a clearly set-out White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering that we have had the patience to listen to Deputy Cogan this afternoon and the time we have spent in that fashion and considering that the Minister has introduced his Budget three or four weeks earlier than is normal, I seriously suggest to him that it would be worth while delaying the continuation of this debate on the General Resolution until that matter has been properly cleared up.  Circumstances have been created by the raising of the bank rate, the attitude of scare which Ministers have engendered throughout the country from the end of last year, their changing policies and the disclosure now that they believe no capital development can take place until the people have paid for the current working of the Government, and the astoundingly <Col N="63" /> large increases in taxation that are here put before the people&mdash;I think the situation thus created should impress on the Minister the fact that any discussion that takes place here should take place in an atmosphere in which facts can be clearly seen and in which we ought to be encouraged to keep to a discussion of these facts.</P>
    <P>When we examine, as we shall have to examine, the intent of the Government in relation to the Budget and the effect of the Budget on the country generally, we ought to be kept in the strait-jacket of clearly-defined facts from which none of us can afford to run away if we have any sense of responsibility at all.  I appeal to the Minister to co-operate with us by putting us into the strait-jacket of facts so that we will avoid the hot air, the personalities and the absurdities to which we have been listening even in the short time that the debate has been in progress to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be unique as a Minister for Finance because when presenting his Budget he said not one single word about the condition of employment or the state of production and the effect that his Budget would be likely to have on both production and employment.  I do not think we can feel we are doing our duty in these discussions&mdash;and we have some distance still to go in dealing with this Resolution and the Finance Bill&mdash;if we try to avoid discussing the effect of this Budget or any change that it may bring about in relation to both production and employment.</P>
    <P>We know the bank rate has been raised.  We know that that has had an effect on the commercial and business life of the country and on industrial activity generally.  The British Government raised the bank rate as a matter of policy in order to squeeze out of ordinary industry there both capital and labour and drive them into armaments and other industries where they required additional production for export.  If one examines the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> or any of the publications dealing with our census of production one will find that nearly all our industries here are similar to those out <Col N="64" /> of which the British Government wants to drive labour and capital, so that they can be diverted to armaments and export production.  That bank rate applied automatically here and the effect it will have will be identical with the effect in Britain.  Already there is unemployment and part-time employment and we will eventually find ourselves in the position that, having established a fair foundation to manufacturing industry here and sunk a considerable amount of capital in the process, we are now shaking the foundation of that manufacture by the application of this policy in relation to the bank rate, with a consequential increase in taxation and increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that an increase in the cost of living and an increase in taxation can have very disastrous effects on the maintenance of production and the maintenance of employment. If we permit a quickening of emigration as a result of the operation of this policy here, the fabric of the industries that we have established will be seriously rent and the foundation will be seriously undermined. Both capital and labour will be lost. Our people's instinct in sinking their capital and their energies in the development of native industries will be undermined.  There is no necessity for that.  In the <i>Statist</i> of 19th April an Irish correspondent writing on Irish industrial development concludes his article by saying: &ldquo;For British industrialists with the capital to sink in new enterprises and the technical know-how to run them there would appear to be great opportunities of establishing themselves in Ireland to the mutual benefit of both countries.&rdquo; Here industrialists are being invited to come to Ireland and establish industries in Ireland.  Yet, as far as we are concerned, we are asked by the Resolution in front of us to support a policy that will seriously damage industry here and will undermine to a large extent the faith of our own people in industrial effort.  I think it is vitally important that we should get this matter quite clear in our discussion. Already there-has been a certain amount of acceptance by certain people <Col N="65" /> and no later than this morning there was a rather interesting statement issued by the Trade Union Congress on the situation brought about by the Budget.  That statement says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Firstly, it is necessary to discover whether or not the figure of £15,000,000 constitutes a gap in the current Budget.  We do not doubt for a moment despite suggestions to the contrary, that the various Estimates both of revenue and expenditure were made as accurately as forecasting of this nature would allow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite that doubt in the minds of members of the Trade Union Congress, they suggest a change in the incidence of taxation.  They seem to respond to the Minister's invitation as to the putting up of alternative taxes and they suggest that there is plenty of scope for heavier taxation of higher incomes while they say the taxation of profits could be stepped up considerably. By way of an indication, as to how higher incomes are available for additional taxes, the statement says, under the heading of &ldquo;surtax&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1949-50 there were 5,300 persons liable to surtax whose total income amounted to the colossal sum of £17,600,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The average income of these persons would be £3,300 and the figures here would seem to suggest that only £300 tax was paid on that income of £3,300. Surely to talk in terms of the colossal amount of money that could be got by raising surtax on the small number of persons in this country whose gross income was £3,300, is to suggest something that I think would be very unconstructive.</P>
    <P>In regard to profits, the question of profits in industry has got a bad name from some of the get-rich-quick performances that were brought off in 1934, 1935 and 1936, in the earlier years of the Fianna Fáil rush to industrial development.  I do not think that sufficient is being done at the present moment in industry to secure that the capital foundations on which industries have been laid are being properly maintained or that maintenance is being properly planned for them in <Col N="66" /> future.  I think the workers of the country would find that we were cutting the ground from under their feet if, in any kind of ill-considered way, they wanted to prevent industries accumulating such capital as would preserve in an up-to-date and in a competitive way the capital fabric without which workers cannot have their employment maintained.</P>
    <P>We have been told in the Budget discussions here that industry must export and I think there was a ministerial pronouncement the other day that industry must export or die.  In the competitive world in which our industries have to exist and will have to work, they have to export.  They cannot do that if sufficient provision is not made to see that their capital fabric is maintained.  The whole approach of the Government to the present situation is utterly and destructively wrong. It is in order to clear the ground so that we can discuss things with clarity and reality, that I ask the Minister to realise that these are matters that have to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I should like to end on a note that I am sure will strike our people here with a certain amount of light and a certain amount of understanding.  In the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of Friday last in an article on &ldquo;The Tasks of Economic Policy,&rdquo; Bertrand de Jouvenal, in the tail-end of the article&mdash;he had examined the vagaries of economic and Government policy in the world in recent days&mdash;having examined some of the economic and financial aspects and the application of different policies, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For these reasons and many others, the best economists have always thought the reversal of an inflationary tendency to be a critical moment in the life of an economy. Then it is that economic policy calls for the greatest shrewdness and delicacy.  Hammer blows are extremely dangerous.</P>
    <P>Brutal restrictions on credit, such as certain countries have put into practice, when they are combined with the fiscal frenzy which every country has shown act as such hammer-blows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> In my opinion the present situation conceals strong possibilities of a trend towards an uncontrolled slump. In any case there is already one fairly characteristic sign &mdash; the proliferation of optimistic assertions that there will be no recession and that if a recession does come it will be neither long nor serious.</P>
    <P>There is a recession; one need only ask the industrialists and especially those who serve the consumer direct.  One need only see how the primary producer countries are having difficulties with payments &mdash; always a significant symptom.  Unemployment and short-time working are on the increase.</P>
    <P>On the day then the powers that be take notice of this situation, they will propose a new wave of public investments; that is to say, the State will take a further step in its appropriation of the national wealth. There is a much simpler means of fighting the tendency to a recession; decreases in the rate of taxation.</P>
    <P>The time seems to have come to reverse the tendency of our period to increase indefinitely what our ancestors used to call &ldquo;impositions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It has been a disastrous thing for our people here that the approach to policy that was pursued during the three years' office of the last Government could not be maintained.  Ministers have changed their opinion in recent months from the idea that there was inflation to the idea that there was deflation.  They have changed from nailing to the mast, the flag of subsidies and of promised subsidies, to practically wiping out subsidies, veering in policy for a purpose that no one can understand.  They are hitting right against an idea that is brought out here very clearly by Jouvenal. They are giving a hammer blow to the country that, because of the bank rate, even if they have no control over it, is experiencing many deflationary influences rather than inflationary influences, and they are applying to that situation the kind of policy that they have been told will stop inflation.</P>
    <P>I do not understand what the policy <Col N="68" /> behind this Budget is.  I do not want to go into the matter until we get from the Minister for Finance, if we can get it, a statement on these matters and the explanation of these figures that has been asked for.  It does seem to me that our people are being asked to pay additional amounts to the extent of £19,870,000&mdash;£8,580,000 by way of increased prices for food supplies over the counter and £11,290,000 by way of increased taxation, and for what purpose? Not to maintain our services here but to try to stop the import of nylons or some other articles of that general class, this country is being hit by the sledge hammer with a demand for another £20,000,000 out of the people's pockets for no constructive purpose in this country at all except to do something which the Minister says they do not want to do directly&mdash;stop the import of stockings.</P>

      <P>I am complaining to the Minister that in the area of the milk <Col N="70" /> board for the Cork area, on the report of the medical officer of health, 55 summonses were issued because of the abuse of the regulations in regard to the milk supply to Cork City.  I want to know if the Minister has any knowledge as to whether any of these 55 milk suppliers have been refused a licence to supply milk to Cork City. What I am objecting to is that the citizens of Cork should be asked to pay the same price for dirty milk, for dangerous milk and for tubercular milk as they are expected to pay for milk produced under the best conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is much more serious than what Deputy Corry wants to convey to the House.  This is a matter where people are asked to pay for milk 5 per cent. of which has been proved to be tubercular and so much of it dirty.  The Cork Milk Board should be empowered to tell the people supplying that milk that such will not be permitted.  Deputy McGrath stated that there was no complaint from the Cork Deputies about the milk supply to Cork City.  I repudiate that because I have been continually objecting.  I have personally complained, and I now complain, that the milk supply we are getting in Cork should be dealt with. I blame the Minister for not doing that when introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this <Col N="73" /> Bill because, in effect, it is a big stick held over the producers of milk.  It threatens them that if they do not produce the milk in the way the Government wants them to do, the Government will use State money for the purpose of competing with the suppliers. That will have the effect of putting them out of business.  At the present time the Irish creamery milk suppliers are completely dissatisfied with the position regarding the price of milk. This Bill, when put into effect, will actually worsen the position of the creamery milk suppliers because they will find themselves in competition with State funds.</P>
      <P>We have the milk suppliers trying to put before the Minister a set of costings and just when these costings are being compiled we have this Bill going through.  It is nothing short of a threat.  I can say that the Dublin and district milk suppliers are very bitterly opposed to this Bill because they consider that it will definitely interfere with the ordinary free trading and free sale of milk.  It is going to operate as a threat against them.  They will not be in the position of being able to show a set of costings and then ask for some remedy for the position.</P>
      <P>It is well known at the present time that supplies of milk are dwindling. They are dwindling particularly in the creamery areas because the price being paid to the producers of milk in those areas is not regarded as being sufficient to meet the ordinary cost of production.  If we put through a Bill of this nature we are just telling the farmers in the creamery milk areas to go out of business.  We are telling them that we are not going to recognise their claim for fair play and their claim to have a proper set of costings compiled.</P>
      <P>I think it is sheer hypocrisy on the part of the Minister to make statements to the effect that he is awaiting with interest the findings of this Milk Costings Commission while at the same time he tries to put through the Dáil a Bill which will have very farreaching effects.  I believe myself that it will worsen the position as far as milk production in this country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Corry opposite because he will confirm that the <Col N="74" /> suppliers of creamery milk in his area are going out of business.  They are feeding calves instead of sending their milk to the creameries because they were deceived by Deputy Corry and his Fianna Fáil Party before the last general election regarding prices. They were led to believe at that time that they were going to get a substantial increase.  They were led to believe they were going to get the increase having regard to the statements made by the Minister himself when he indicated that the summer price should be at least 1/6 and the winter price at least 2/-.  Now they have lost confidence and, feeling that the present cost of production is not giving them a living, they are changing over to a different economy.</P>
    <P>We are now importing more butter than ever because the suppliers of creamery milk are feeding calves instead of sending the milk to the creameries for the purpose of butter production.  The production of Irish creamery butter has fallen and will continue to fall in spite of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, when he came into office, calmly informed the general public that in February and March of this year there would not be an ounce of imported butter used in this country.  He thought that he was going to convince the producers of milk for the creameries that his 1d. per gallon was going to make all the difference to the economy of their farms.  It is quite clear that these suppliers have now lost all confidence.  We are in the position where a predominantly agricultural country such as we have must import butter from the four corners of the earth and land it here at 3/1 per lb. to be retailed in the near future for 3/10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that the passing of this Bill is a retrograde step at this <Col N="75" /> particular time when the producers of milk in the creamery areas are going out of business and changing their economy as fast as they can.  A Bill of this nature is absolutely out of time. We know that, even since the change of Government, the costs for people engaged in the production of milk have increased considerably.  Certainly, the miserable 1d. per gallon which was given to the producers of milk in order to keep them quiet and in order to make them believe that they had the goodwill of the Fianna Fáil Party has not had the desired effect which the Fianna Fáil Party had expected.</P>
      <P>This Bill, in my view, Sir, will worsen their position and will make sure that, not alone will we be importing butter, but we will soon be importing milk if this Bill goes through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Rooney, one would think that all you had to do was to turn on a tap and you got all the milk you required. Deputy Rooney quite forgets that he stood behind a Minister for Agriculture who laid down the dictum to the farmers that he was going to give 1/- a gallon for their milk for five years. He guaranteed 1/- a gallon for milk for five years, or 2d. less than they were getting before.  Then the farmers, not being as hopeful as we were that we would succeed in getting rid of this old man of the sea, in despair got rid of some 50,000 cows that year and 50,000 cows more the following year. Between cows and in-calf heifers, in two years there was a reduction of 104,000.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the beef policy carried out by the Department of Agriculture, as long as I know it, anyway, we have been left with cows producing only <Col N="76" /> one and a half gallons of milk per day. When we were faced with that situation and that policy as it worked out, certain measures had to be taken.  At any rate, you will not get as much milk as you were getting before, as you are 104,000 cows short.  That is what we have to face.  To remedy that position, the Minister, under this Bill, proposes to give the farmers the right to use the money that they have accumulated in the two milk boards, the Dublin District Milk Board and the Cork District Milk Board, to increase the production of milk by getting proper dairy bulls.  That will mean that in about four years' time we will reach the turning point in the changing of the policy which has been carried out, unfortunately, in this country for a number of years in regard to dairy herds.  It will take four years.  You cannot, as Deputy Rooney seems to imagine, get one of these 1,000-gallon bulls for your cow and expect to be able to milk the calf the following morning.  That seems to be the idea that Deputy Rooney has.  The evil that men do lives after them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The evil that that Party did is, unfortunately, living after them in more ways than one.  We can see the result of it in the reduction of the milk supply.  Deputy Dillon made no allegation that the cost of the production of milk had been reduced.  He admitted that the cost of production had gone up, but, he said, &ldquo;the old farmer is so well off to-day he can afford to sell his milk at 2d. per gallon less than he did when Fianna Fáil were in office.&rdquo; He went further and guaranteed that 2d. reduction for five years, while every two or three months we had Deputy Dunne and his team increasing the cost of production by increasing the cost of labour.  I do not, of course, consider that the skilled workers on the land are getting enough yet&mdash;they are not.  The skilled worker on the land is entitled to as good a wage as the skilled worker in any other industry.</P>

I consider that we are already too late, if anything, in endeavouring to get in this country the yield of milk from our cows that is essential if we are not to have this continual clearing out of milch cows that we have had up to the present.  It is not for nothing that the farmers decided to get rid of 50,000 cows in 12 months or 104,000 in two years.  They did not do it for fun. We got rid of the biggest menace to them when we got rid of Deputy Dillon.  We are now under a different Minister, who is proceeding to get back to a decent milk yielding cow. We claim our right to use the funds that we have accumulated in the different milk boards for the purpose of getting that good yielding cow.  That is the main object of the Bill.  We do not care whether Deputy Dillon, in his enlightened way, alluded to them as &ldquo;Pekinese cows&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to follow Deputy Corry and Deputy Hickey down the paths of disorder about the milk supply of Cork, nor have I any intention of following Deputy Corry in his efforts to turn Deputy Walsh into an 800-gallon <Col N="79" /> Minister which is, I understand, what his line was a second ago.  I want to say only about three sentences on this Bill.  I do not like Section 4 as it is at present.  I will make a present of this to the Minister that I find it difficult to amend it in a way that would meet the exigencies of a situation that arises when there is a surplus and yet would protect the interests of the farmers from the other difficulties that are obviously there.  It seems to me that the Minister would have been better advised&mdash;I understand it was not in order for us to submit an amendment to the Bill&mdash;to amend this Bill himself, to create what he stated was the position and which, after a little exercise of simple mathematics, he agreed was untrue.</P>
      <P>If the Minister provided a board in Dublin&mdash;I know nothing about the Cork board&mdash;that had a majority of producers, none of the anxieties that were experienced in regard to Section 4 would have arisen.  The fact is, of course, that the producers have not a majority on the Dublin board.  The Minister came to this House and he went to the other House and stated what was untrue, that the producers had a majority.</P>

      <P>That is not a point of order, but the fact is that I am sorry the Minister is unable, but it would be a very good thing if he would try, to take a little exercise in mathematics and then it would help him not merely to count up what a majority out of 14 on a milk board is, but it would help him to count up the very large sum that the farmers of Ireland have lost through the machinations or lack of machinations of the Minister and Deputy Corry in regard to the barley price.  There are 14 members on this board.  Seven of those members are producers; that leaves seven others. <Col N="80" /> Fourteen minus seven is seven.  I think even the Minister can appreciate that&mdash;seven farmers and seven others &mdash;and if there is a tie one of the seven non-farmers has the casting vote. Under those circumstances there never can be a majority in favour of the producers.</P>

No wonder agriculture is going to the devil under this Government.  The reason for all the anxiety about this section is that the Minister has gone out of his way, publicly and privately, to be deliberately insulting to the people who are producing milk in the Dublin sales area.  He went out of his way publicly in the Seanad and publicly in this House, and he went out of his way privately by eating the deputation that went to see him to be insulting.  Of course, it is only natural that the Minister would act in this way in regard to the Dublin sales area, when one considers that he has probably been advised by a person who can only be described as being the nearest thing to a bull in a china shop that has ever existed in any board in this country.  That is the real thing that is wrong with Section 4 and with the working of this Bill, and there will never be peace in the board as long as you keep the chairman that is there at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to follow Deputy Sweetman at this stage.  I will reserve it for a later opportunity. However, the discussion on this Bill has centred around matters that we should not have been asked to listen to.  Even the question of a clean milk supply does not enter into the Bill.  If there is a dispute between the Cork milk suppliers and consumers it is a matter that the Cork Deputies can settle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has raised a question with other Cork Deputies and the only assurance I can give Deputy Hickey is that under the 1935 Dairies Act there are provisions made for the pasteurisation of milk.  It is a question for the local authorities to have pasteurisation brought in.  I understand the Cork Corporation has been agitating for some time to have the milk pasteurised and there is nothing to prevent them doing that.  If that is going to solve the difficulty it is a matter for the Deputy.  I understand that he is a member of the Cork Corporation <Col N="82" /> and he can see that it is done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney meandered around the country as far as the creameries and talked about the milk prices, and so forth.  The price of milk has nothing to do with this Bill.  The question to be discussed here is in what way the moneys that are being collected by the Dublin and Cork District Boards can be most usefully spent in the interests of the producers.  Considerable sums have been accumulated and it is proposed that this money should be spent.  In Dublin, for instance, there is something like £26,000 and in Cork something in the region of £2,500&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said the Cork figure is £8,000.  We understand that this money will be spent so as to increase the production of milk in one form or another. One way in which the production is to be increased in the Dublin district is by the establishment of an artificial insemination centre. There are other ways also in which milk production can be improved; for instance, the giving of lectures, better housing conditions, better food, and so forth.  Money is going to be very usefully spent in those directions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman in that venomous way of his, when dealing with subjects such as this and true to his suspicious mind, believes that there was something ulterior in my mind when I introduced this Bill.  However, it is only a mind like Deputy Sweetman's that could conceive an idea like this.  I am not surprised at it, as we have had experience of it before.  Section 4 has nothing whatsoever to do with putting any pressure on the board.  As I have already pointed out here, the majority of the Dublin board is composed of producers.  Why should the chairman interfere in any discussions that may take place between retailers and producers?</P>

      <P>Why should Deputy Sweetman come into this House and state that he has interfered and would interfere in any question in which he would be asked to give advice or in any case in which he would give a casting vote?  Deputy Sweetman is reading something into this which is not in it. If Deputy Sweetman is prejudiced against the chairman, he had better take that prejudice somewhere else rather than try to foist it on the people of this House.  I do not know what personal reasons he has &mdash; they must be personal &mdash; for coming along here and vilifying the chairman of the Dublin Milk Board.</P>
      <P>Only in the case of an emergency would there ever be any necessity for that board to raise any objections to any decisions which the Minister might make.  In the case of an emergency, there might be a possibility of the Minister having to take some step.  However, there is no reason why we should even suggest any emergency in that direction.  Milk producers are quite capable of looking after their own business and nobody is going to interfere with them in that direction.  Therefore, it is quite wrong for Deputy Sweetman to assume that there is any ulterior motive behind this Bill, or that I had any such motive when introducing it. The Bill is being introduced for the simple purpose of utilising the money collected from the producers over a period of years and using this money for the benefit of the producers themselves. I do not think any question has been raised with which I must deal and, in that case, I would ask the House to pass the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 6, between lines 4 and 5, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  No regulation made by the Minister under this section shall come into operation unless or until it has been approved by resolution of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I regret that I was absent and unable to move this amendment on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I am grateful to you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity of moving it now.  I do not think there is any great need to go over the ground again relating to the seriousness of the proposals in the section.  I feel that the only protection the people of the country can have in this matter is that any regulation made under this section relating to births would be brought into the House for approval by motion.  I know that the Minister will answer me by saying that, under Section 12 of the Bill, every regulation made by him must be put on the Table of the House. However, I know that regulations placed on the Table of the House are very often ignored or go unnoticed.  I admit there are ample means by which Deputies can be informed of their existence.  Yet, in the hurry and bustle of everyday life, many Deputies do not become aware of their existence, or get acquainted with them. Therefore, I feel that the regulations which the Minister proposes to make under Section 6 should be approved of by positive motion of this House and that the wording of the motion would be something like the one approving of summer time, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear to me that the Minister has given way to the demand for the short certificate.  Pressure has been put upon him by members of the House that the short certificate should be compulsory and that it should be the only certificate available.  I am aware that a document has been circulated to Deputies and to the Minister <Col N="85" /> saying that the short certificate should be the only one issued for every purpose except where a court order was sought to make the other one available&mdash;in other words, that it was going to be made impossible to get it.</P>
    <P>By regulation, the Minister can do any of these things; he can say by regulation that the short certificate only will be available and that a court order must be produced in order to be able to get the long one, that the fee for the short certificate will be so much. The fee for the long certificate, as has been suggested here, would be very exorbitant.  When he has the regulation regarding the prices of the long certificate made all he has got to do is to get the consent of the Minister for Finance that the money is sufficient. We all know that the Department of Finance will always approve of any step that brings in more cash.  I stated here that where the short certificate was in existence in Britain and elsewhere the short and the long certificates are issued together.  As a general rule the production of the short certificate is sufficient for all purposes, but the long one is available also.  I do not want to go into the reasons why the long certificate should be available because I feel that I have brought to the notice of the Minister and the Government responsible for this Bill sufficient arguments to show the step they are taking is a rather serious one.</P>
    <P>While there may be no conflict with the cannon law on the matter, I want to stress that when the British Parliament was passing the Act relating to the registration of deaths, births and marriages, it took the canon law as it stood and made it the statute law of Great Britain&mdash;and that continues there up to the present, even though they have the short certificate.  Surely, however, legitimate children have some rights and are also entitled to protection? Arthur Griffith said long ago that the fundamental duty and responsibility of a father was not only to be charitable to those who required it, but that he should be charitable to his own. That argument holds good in this connection. I suggest we should not create a situation for one section of the community as against another.  I admit <Col N="86" /> that very great hardships are imposed on certain people, but I hold that the short certificate will not be a successful method of getting over that difficulty. I consider that this House should know positively what regulation the Minister is making under that section and that the Minister should be compelled to obtain the approval of the House for it before it is made operative.</P>
    <P>As Section 12 stands, a motion can be put down within 21 days to have the regulation annulled.  It might, perhaps, be argued in general that that method would meet the requirements of every other case, but I hold that it does not meet the requirements of this case.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what case Deputy General MacEoin has made for his amendment.  On a previous occasion he argued that we were moving towards a liberalistic approach in bringing in a Bill of this kind.  He made it very plain in his speech to-day that he was quite satisfied that there was nothing wrong with the short certificate from the point of view of canon law.  What he proceeded to argue was that, although the short certificate has been a feature of the British code, it has not been successful.  I do not think that is true.  So far as I can discover, the short certificate has been in use in Great Britain for some considerable time, and has been selected by many people for several purposes, and has been successful as far as it was designed to be successful.  We know that in some instances, such as legal cases, where title is important, the long title will be necessary for the purpose of identification.  Where there is a law case, the people concerned will naturally go as far as they can to find out whether the person concerned is the person who is entitled to whatever goods or property may have given rise to the particular law proceedings in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The short certificate does not appear to me to be a very big issue.  It is very rarely that the Dáil asks to have a regulation approved before it can come into effect.  The usual practice <Col N="87" /> in relation to Bills of this kind which are not so terribly important is that the regulations will be laid on the Table.  If a Deputy thinks that any particular Minister is going too far with a proposed regulation, he can challenge it and can have the matter debated by the Dáil, and put to a vote if he considers it wise and necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why Deputy General MacEoin is making such a big issue of the short certificate. It must be obvious that the Minister is limited to certain items already in the register in respect of any changes which he may wish to make in connection with the short certificate.  The items that are there already are: the date and place of birth; name; sex; name and surname and dwelling-place of the father; name and surname and maiden name of the mother, and the rank or position of the father. Therefore, when we come to consider whether or not we will make the certificate shorter, we cannot omit the name of the person concerned, because it would not be a certificate at all if we were to do so.  The only thing that arises is whether or not we will include the names of the parents and the place of birth.  These may be very important items from the point of view of the person concerned and they may be very important items from the point of view of the person who looks for a certificate.  However, if they are important from his point of view, he can look for the long certificate, and the matter, therefore, does not arise as far as he is concerned.  Viewing the matter in that light, I do not understand how such importance could be attached to it that the approval of the Dáil would be necessary before the regulation could be put into effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy General MacEoin points out that the approval of the Minister for Finance is no great safeguard, because if the Minister for Health proposed to increase very substantially the cost of the long certificate the Minister for Finance would probably agree.  I daresay that is true.  In all probability, the only reason why the Minister for Finance asked that provision be made <Col N="88" /> for his approval was lest the Minister for Health should reduce the price of these certificates.  I suppose every Minister, in a case like this, must have some regard to what is a reasonable cost for a certificate, just like everything else.  He cannot impose some outrageous cost for a certificate of that kind in order to achieve another objective.  Naturally, it will be decided to charge more for the long certificate than for the shorter form and, to the extent to which that difference in price prevails, the short certificate will be asked for by most people where the short certificate will suffice.</P>
    <P>I suggested on other stages of this Bill that the short certificate might be sufficient for educational requirements such as entrance for various examinations, and so forth, and that it might be sufficient in respect of some of the social welfare code where a person is asked to produce a certificate of age. Or in other cases where a person is looking for employment and is asked to state his age, let us say.  I think it is only right that in a case of that kind that person should not be charged too much.  Indeed, it would be wrong and unjust to charge too much for the short certificate.  I do not think the Deputy is right in his fears that we shall have an exorbitant charge for the long certificate in order to make it impossible. I do not know why the Deputy has taken this matter so seriously. In the beginning he suggested it was something we should deprecate and that we were moving in the wrong direction from the moral point of view, as it were.  I think he has dropped that now and his argument is more that it has not been successful in England.  I do not know whether or not it has been successful there but if it is not successful here I suppose people will use the long certificate instead and we will not be any worse off then than we are at the moment if the short certificate is not a success.  I would ask the House not to accept the pleadings of the Deputy that it should have the approval of the House before coming into operation, but that it should be accepted rather as a regulation as under any ordinary Bill by <Col N="89" /> being laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas and, if not objected to by either House within 21 days, will be taken as approved.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared negatived.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 9 (4), between lines 3 and 4, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) the existing position in cases where the assistant register is a dispensary medical officer, as in cities, and not in receipt of any allowance for the former post, so that payments may be made to such assistant registers of allowances similar to those payable to registrars referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, this amendment concerns the position where the assistant registrar happens to be a doctor and it only relates to eight areas and Dublin.  In 1936 an allowance of £10 was made, £8 being for registration of births and deaths and £2 for marriages.  It would appear that even in 1936 the remuneration of registrars was considered inadequate. Where an assistant registrar in these eight areas is a doctor, he is entitled to no part of this fee except at the will and pleasure of the registrar.  No allowance is made when estimating his pension and I think, in equity, the Minister should agree that in these eight areas, where the assistant registrar is a doctor, the grant of £10 should also be made in the case of the assistant registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act as it stands the registrar is the dispensary doctor. In the dispensaries in Dublin there is always more than one doctor; sometimes there are three.  The practice has been that one of them&mdash;the senior man in all cases&mdash;acts as registrar. The dispensary doctor is bound to appoint an assistant registrar.  In the country districts it is usually some lay person who resides convenient to the dispensary.  In Dublin the practice is that the doctor appoints one of his colleagues <Col N="90" /> in the dispensary as his assistant.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that both should be appointed joint registrars, as it were.  I do not think that would make a great deal of difference because it is a well recognised practice&mdash;and I do not think any doctors would like a departure from it &mdash;that the registrar always appoints a colleague as an assistant, and they divide whatever fees accrue between them.  Therefore, they are actually getting at the moment what they would get if this amendment were passed. The amendment indeed might give rise to a certain amount of trouble because there is always difficulty were there are divided responsibilities.  I think it is better in a case like this to have one man responsible to the Registrar-General. I think it would be better if the amendment were not pressed. Things are working smoothly and efficiently and we have no guarantee that they would continue to work smoothly and efficiently if the amendment were passed.  Considering that the doctors concerned would be in the very same position as regards remuneration, I do not think the amendment should be pushed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, at the end of Section 10, line 20, to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the commencement of this section a person holds the office of interim superintendent registrar for a district, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such person was, on the 13th day of February, 1952, neither an officer nor servant of a local authority nor in receipt of a superannuation allowance from a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>sub-section (1) of this section shall, as respects that district, have effect with the substitution of &ldquo;Where a person who on the commencement of this section holds the office of interim superintendent registrar for a district ceases to hold that office&rdquo; for &ldquo;Where a vacancy in the office of <Col N="91" /> superintendent registrar for a district exists on the commencement of this section or occurs subsequently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was some discussion on the Bill in relation to the interim superintendents. Deputies may not remember exactly what the position is.  The superintendent was the clerk of the old régime and where that position became vacant a temporary person was appointed until something like this cropped up to regularise the position. There are a number of these temporary people now acting.  If the Bill were to pass as drafted these temporary people would vacate their offices and that would be the end of it. Some Deputies, in the softness of their hearts, thought we were about to do a grave injustice to certain people.  On examining the position, I do not think we will do any grave injustice to the majority of those concerned.  A number of them are working in the local authorities and some of them get nothing at all for this particular job, as a matter of fact.  Some of them may get some of the fees but most of them are working under local authorities or are pensioned officers of local authorities. There are only two who are not and the amendment I propose will have the effect of allowing these two people, who appear to be dependent entirely on this particular job, to continue as interim superintendents. Otherwise, the section will operate so that the other temporary people will go as soon as this Bill is passed and no further temporary appointments will be necessary.  The local authority will in future be the superintendent. The local authority is impersonal.  I think this meets the wishes of Deputies generally since by this amendment we will not deprive any person of a job on which he is dependent.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the amendment goes part of the way to meet the arguments that were used on the section and, of course, it is an improvement but I do not know that it fully covers the sort of case I had in mind where a person had been appointed to this post in a temporary capacity and had been acting for say five, seven or ten years and then automatically <Col N="92" /> goes out when this Bill becomes law.  Of course, I have certain cases in mind but I would rather argueon the general principle involved.  As the law stands at the moment, such a person holds office until he dies or retires voluntarily but under the new Bill he loses this appointment automatically. The case was made to me on his behalf by people who are not political supporters, that it would be a hardship on him.  I did ask if the view of the local authority and his own views were conveyed to the Department and I was given to understand that they were.  I am not fully briefed on the matter but I was asked to draw attention to it and to request the Minister to see that no undue hardship or no injustice was caused by the Act.</P>
      <P>By way of analogy, I might mention that under one of the Courts of Justice Acts certain persons who were employed as court stenographers were knocked out of their posts automatically and although it was intended by everybody concerned that they should get alternative employment the fact remains that when the Act was put into operation they did not get such employment and they have been left out ever since.  Although there were only two or three persons involved, these two or three persons had built up an expectation of earning a livelihood in that particular manner.  It is a serious thing to knock a person out of a post in which it appeared to him at a certain time that he had fixity of tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in this case, when the Bill goes through certain persons will, in my opinion, be prejudicially affected. Perhaps the Minister's amendment covers it; I am not going to argue that it does not but somehow I have the feeling that it does not.  Take a case where an officer has been temporarily acting for the last six or seven years. The superintendent is seconded to another job.  The officer is appointed when the superintendent is away at that particular post from which he may never come back.  On the passing of the Act, because the person who is superintendent has not come back, the officer who has been acting for him temporarily goes automatically.  There are two persons concerned in this <Col N="93" /> matter, so far as I know.  The case was made to me that it would be a very serious hardship on these two persons.  As I say, I do not know if the Minister's amendment will cover these particular cases but the Bill has still to go to the Seanad and perhaps the Minister, if I send him the facts, will have the matter looked into meanwhile.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the principal Opposition Party repeatedly asked that this important question of the national finances should be treated seriously. We might have been more impressed by Deputy Mulcahy's appeal if there had not been the singularly ill-judged, ill-advised and very partisan attacks on the present Minister for Finance for several months past.  A Minister for Finance at no time has a very pleasant task, because, while all other Ministers can put forward proposals in Government for additional expenditure, new schemes and so on, the Minister for Finance has to provide the wherewithal and, once a year, he has to come before the Dáil and the country and tell us where the money is to come from that is to finance these schemes. In modern times the pressure in every democratic country has all been in favour of increased State intervention and increased public expenditure on all fronts, but there has not been a corresponding awareness or a corresponding sense of responsibility as to what that involves.  Deputy Mulcahy mentioned a French writer in connection with the economic troubles from which countries everywhere are suffering at present and the need for reducing taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, and every Deputy who has any sense of responsibility and has given any consideration to these questions must know, that reduced taxation can only come from reduced expenditure. This Government when it took office was faced with the position of just allowing a situation that they regarded as very serious and which could become very critical and have very serious results for the country, to simply proceed without taking any action.  Further, if they were to take <Col N="95" /> action they were faced with two alternatives, either to curtail expenditure on a large scale and interfere with existing schemes, some of them of the greatest importance, some of which had been in operation for a considerable time, while others which had not been so long in operation, were being geared up, so that the annual expenditure upon them was very considerable or to face the situation that heavy financial provision must be made for them.  If these schemes were to proceed, and if the housekeeping expenses of the State were to be provided for, it was quite clear that additional taxation would have to be levied.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with this matter as reasonably as I can, and to put forward my point of view, realising that there are many other points of view, but I think that the Government was right and will have no difficulty in defending itself before the country for the position it has taken up in putting the facts before the country as we see them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As we see them,&rdquo; and the statistics are there.  Deputy Davin is one of those Deputies who speaks and votes against additional taxation on a few days of the year and spends the rest of the time asking that additional moneys and additional expenditure should be made available by the Minister for Finance.  But does he ever ask himself where the money is to come from to finance these schemes, or has he ever given any thought to the fact that it is quite obvious under modern conditions even for countries far in advance of ours&mdash; owing to the tremendous increase in costs, the rapidity with which the world is moving, the tremendous extension of State services and of the public expenditure that is being asked for&mdash;and quite impossible, with the systems of taxation that are in vogue, to keep pace with the demands that are being made upon them.  Look at the condition of France.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be interrupted by Deputy Davin.  I simply say this, that the Government of France, through the system of taxation which exists there, has not been able to face its responsibilities.  There are other countries in the same position. Take the United States of America which can increase its production by 10 per cent. per year.  Recessions and temporary depressions do not matter there because the machine is so gigantic and the economic power so colossal, that they can gather up the slack and go ahead.  President Truman has said that they can double their standard of living in a generation.  But what about poor old Europe?  We are a European country and we are bound closely to Great Britain in trade and economic matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy MacEoin goes down the country and tells us that the pound may be worth, or is going to be worth only five bob, why has he agreed to spend the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund moneys on land development schemes and on agricultural production for the purpose of providing beef and agricultural produce for a country that can only pay us in pounds?  They are only worth to us what they will purchase in the international market where prices are constantly rising.  Recent reports tell us that a country like Sweden, in view of this lack of equilibrium and the difficult situation that has been created by high international costs, is taking steps to budget for a heavy surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have an example from South Africa, one of the most promising countries in the world.  Deputies, I take it, have received a copy of the South African survey.  The people of South Africa can hardly be accused of not having an independent spirit and <Col N="97" /> a policy of their own in these matters. In his Budget speech, delivered on the 26th March, Mr. Havenga said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since my last Budget speech the shadow of inflation has darkened and the serious balance of payments crisis of the sterling areas has cast a gloom over large areas of the world.</P>
    <P>The Union itself is not faced with a crisis, but we have not escaped the consequences of the world-wide inflationary forces.  Basically the present inflationary conditions are due to the fact that few countries are in a position to devote a considerable part of their national income to defence and at the same time, not only improve the standard of living of their people, but also find the resources necessary to carry out a comprehensive programme of development.</P>
    <P>No Government in a democratic country can deliberately slow down the pace of development and resist the pressure for a higher standard of living unless public opinion is ripe to accept the sacrifices involved in such a policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to talk of the action of the British Government, and further on he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The measure of internal inflation that we have experienced so far is a reflection of the strain that we have imposed on our economy by trying to maintain consumption at a high level and at the same time endeavouring to find the resources necessary for the tremendous developments that have been taking place....  Apart,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;from increased taxation we will have to save more money by consuming less; increase our producetivity and slow down the rate of expenditure on development.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came into office some of us took the opportunity immediately we were acquainted with the position, to acquaint the country, in so far as it lay in our power, with the fact that the predecessor of the present Minister for Finance had left very considerable obligations on his successor and that he had not made provision to meet those obligations. He provided £1,500,000 which was fully mortgaged.  In fact, as the House knows&mdash;it has been repeated in this debate&mdash;as a result of the arbitration award the public service cost an additional £3.6 million in the past financial year.  During the coming year it will cost £3,500,000.  The old age pensioners were given an increase, at a cost of an extra £1,000,000 last year.  When the former Taoiseach was Minister for Health he issued a circular early in May last year in connection with increases in remuneration in the health services down the country.  As Deputies know, additional expenditure on local health services has to be provided from the Exchequer.  The result was that one of the present Minister's unforeseen liabilities was an amount of £850,000 which had to be provided last year by way of an addition to the health grants.</P>
      <P>Then there was the question of Córas Iompair Éireann, in connection with which there was the recoupment of interest amounting to £433,000.</P>
      <P>There were losses for the year amounting to nearly £1,900,000.  That was over £2,250,000.  There was also the question of interest and repayment, the charges on the public debt, coming to an additional £2,000,000. All these the Minister gave a list of in the Supplementary Estimates that had to be introduced.  Some may say that they were not the responsibility of our predecessors but, in the main, they were unless the Minister for Finance and the Government were to embark upon a policy of wholesale retrenchment such as his predecessor had promised in 1948 but which he never carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always amused by these tremendous tirades on capital investment when I remember the scoffing, jeering remarks of the former Minister for Finance at the Fianna Fáil plans <Col N="99" /> for capital investment as put before the country in 1947, the idea of spending millions on public roads, on telephones, tourist traffic and so on. He laughed at the very idea of it and he seems to have carried some of his 1947 ideas&mdash;we must assume they were the orthodox Fine Gael ideas at the time&mdash;into his Budget of 1948 when he promised a retrenchment and a careful examination of all capital expenditure with a view to cutting out everything that could possibly be eliminated on grounds of inefficiency, destroying initiative and private enterprise and so on.  Later on, then, we had this wonderful policy of capital investment, but I have always wondered by what mental processes did the former Minister for Finance, who was so antagonistic to our programme of capital investment in 1947, who threatened wholesale retrenchment and who did, in fact, embark on a policy of retrenchment with regard to certain important schemes that we were very much interested in when he took up office, could, in the succeeding years, have persuaded himself that the capital investment policy which is now spoken so much about was really ever a <i>bona fide</i> policy, was really ever a policy that could have been taken seriously, could even have been regarded as capable of being carried out to the extent claimed.</P>
    <P>Before I deal further with that point, I should like to say, with reference to the current Budget, that Deputy Mulcahy spent a good deal of time trying to persuade us that there was over-estimation, that the expenditure would not reach the estimate that the Minister for Finance has said.  Is it suggested that the Minister and his advisers are not capable, are not honest or that there is anything wrong with the figures they have put before the House?  There is no foundation whatsoever for such a suggestion, and, if that is not the suggestion, what does the Deputy mean?  Was there something experienced during the past three years to suggest that there is any foundation for this contention that the actual expenditure will be below the estimate?</P>
    <P>In 1950-51 the actual expenditure <Col N="100" /> exceeded the original Estimates by £1,500,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told by a former Minister that the Estimates for expenditure were written down last year by the then Government by something like £4,000,000.  I hope the present Minister, at any rate, is going to be more honest with the people than that proceeding would indicate had been the practice with our predecessors.</P>
      <P>Last year, the excess of expenditure over revenue was £7,000,000.  Where is the over-estimation of expenditure there?  The thing is, the underestimation on the revenue side, the failure to provide for expenditure that could have been foreseen, must have been foreseen in view of the position of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is suggested that the former Minister had not up-to-date information about Córas Iompair Éireann.  He did not know about this £2,250,000.</P>
      <P>He knew about the Social Welfare Bill and the social welfare proposals. He knew about the Arbitration Tribunal and he knew that the award of that tribunal would apply to all classes of public servants and would have to be met.  The award was made retrospective.  It was not made from the beginning of the following financial year.  It was made retrospective.  That £3.6 million had to be found with the result that whatever way you take it &mdash;and I challenge contradiction on the figures&mdash;there was a deficit last year of about £6.7 million.</P>
      <P>We are not facing this difficult budgetary position and extremely serious situation in our national finances in ordinary normal times.  The halcyon pre-war days are gone and for all we know they will never come back.  We have been living in an inflationary situation for the past five or six years.  We have not faced up to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Finance could not make up his mind whether we had inflation or we had not inflation. <Col N="101" /> He was always telling us there were inflationary tendencies.  We might have inflation.  It could be very serious and so on but he did nothing about it &mdash;Mr. Micawber waiting for something to turn up.  But if something turns up that hits you a wallop, and you get into an economic blizzard or into a depression, what are you going to do then when you have made no provision in advance?  It shows a peculiar lack of responsibility in a Minister for Finance when the whole credit and finances of the country and, to a large extent, the economic position of the country depends upon the policy he is pursuing.  The Budget statement, of course, as I said when in opposition, contained some wonderful maxims. Every year we had these wonderful maxims, but they remained maxims&mdash; they were never put into practice.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party got up here and made a tirade about inflation. He said there was no such thing as inflation.  Then all these countries in Europe which are so perturbed about the international level of costs, the balance of payments and the reaction that State expenditure and over-consumption is having in worsening that problem and in getting them into greater difficulties if they do not take steps in time to remedy it, must be all fools.  They must not know what they are talking about, although they are independent countries like Sweden and Switzerland, which have managed their affairs pretty well and which have been regarded as models for all the small nations, not for years but for generations.  They are not going to allow themselves to be caught up by some international crisis.  They are going to take steps in advance to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>We can legitimately complain that the last Government allowed&mdash;to put it very mildly&mdash;a feeling of complacency to grow up&mdash;that we were all happy. The phrase was: &ldquo;Giving the country and the people a very easy time.&rdquo;  But how can a country any more than an individual have an easy time?  It can use up its accumulated savings but what is going to happen at the end? Deputy Norton says there is no inflation. <Col N="102" /> Last year the Budget speech, as reported in column 1882 of the Official Report, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is an appropriate point to introduce the term &lsquo;inflation&rsquo;.  The classical definition, in popular language, is &lsquo;too much money chasing too few goods&rsquo;, and therefore, driving up prices.  In our circumstances the definition might be reformulated as &lsquo;too much money attracting too many imports&rsquo;, since overspending by the public and the State is able to find an outlet in purchases from abroad financed not from income but from our past accumulations.  In a state of normality we should be able to live on our income and, indeed, save enough of it for capital purposes not only to maintain but actually to increase our production and, therefore, our standard of living.  It is still proper and eminently reasonable to draw on our external assets if thereby we speed up the process of capital development at home.  What is abnormal and, if it persists, can be seriously damaging, is to use up our external resources for consumption purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to examine that and he concluded, as reported in column 1884:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Only if the gap in the balance of payments is narrowed so that external disinvestment is balanced by additional home investment&mdash; rather than by excessive consumption &mdash;can we be satisfied that as a nation we are making ends meet and not wasting our past accumulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what Deputy MacBride would think of this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the great benefits conferred by the possession of external assets is ability to ride out periods like the present of exceptional difficulty and stress, but this external mass of manoeuvre is the mainstay of our economic independence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The mainstay of our economic independence&rdquo;, because it is the cushion that is there against these vicissitudes, these fluctuations, these <Col N="103" /> depressions that come almost unawares, factors over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the question that has been asked in this Budget speech: What is to happen when all these sterling assets have been exhausted, if, as is the case at present, they are being exhausted in a great degree to provide for consumption that we should be paying for by our current labour and by our current production?  What is to happen then?  Does not our standard of living go down then with a bang?  Do we not then have real unemployment, real distress and real hardship?  Because the Minister for Finance wants to put the affairs of this country into a solvent condition, to put our finances on a proper basis so that we can face the future with confidence and carry out our plans, knowing that we shall have the wherewithal to enable us to do it, and to build up our resources intelligently and wisely, and to develop them as far as ever we can within our means, is it right or proper, because the Minister has put that policy before the country, and because he is trying to right the situation and to clear up the very difficult position that he found, that he should be attacked in this partisan manner as making &ldquo;violent&rdquo;, &ldquo;savage&rdquo; and &ldquo;brutal&rdquo; attacks on the standard of living of the people?</P>
    <P>I wonder what the standard of living of the people, of the Irish worker, would be if the present Minister for Finance had allowed the situation to drift and if we were to enjoy a position of <i>laissez faire</i> for another two or three years.  Who is going to right the situation then?</P>

      <Col N="104" />&ldquo;When what we produce for export does not go as far as before towards paying for our import needs we suffer, as a nation, a reduction in the standard of living we can afford.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcome development; indeed, they can only accelerate the process of inflation and cause social injustice as between those able to improve or maintain their position and those who cannot enlarge their incomes and are, therefore, forced to assume an undue burden of hardship. For this reason, the Government ask for restraint in the putting forward of wage and salary claims and are taking measures intended to limit price increases to those justified by increases in costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputy Davin and his colleagues found that very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>What has made the position more difficult is the fact that in 1949 we had the devaluation of the £. The Government here followed suit and, as a result, in the international market we had to pay 44 per cent. more in pounds for the imports that we are receiving from the hard currency areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Marshall Aid.  For a period of two years the Marshall Aid moneys were being injected into the Irish economy.  Everything was buoyant, and everything was lively.  The Minister could say that he was giving the people and the country a very &ldquo;easy time,&rdquo; but Marshall Aid has come to an end and no provision had been made to adjust the country and the economy of the country to that situation.  It must have been foreseen that it would come to an end.  We are now faced with the position that we have to stand on our own two feet. We are either going to be mendicants, going around with our hats in our hands begging for favours and for financial assistance, trying to make the best bargain we can, or we are going to face up to our responsibilities, <Col N="105" /> as a free people and a free nation and citizens, with a polity that is worth struggling for and worth making sacrifices for.  We are going to face our responsibilities or else we are going to let things drift.  Where, I wonder, are we going to get the financial assistance?  Who is going to lend us the money?  In all this talk about capital investment and borrowing, it is apparent that it is forgotten that there are two parties to State or private borrowing: there is the lender as well as the borrower.</P>
    <P>I quoted here a few weeks ago the former Minister for Finance in a debate in Seanad Éireann calling attention in connection with the question of housing finance to the fact that people cannot be forced to lend money to the State.  They must be offered certain terms and, apart from the terms, they are interested to know what the money is being expended on, the kind of enterprises being embarked upon, whether they are productive enterprises, whether they are going to add to the real wealth of the country, whether they are going to benefit the country generally, or whether the Government is just borrowing money to get out of its difficulties and just framing up some kind of Budget and putting into it some new definitions.  The items that formerly were paid for out of revenue collected from taxation, such as housing grants, the provision of schools and so on, items that had been regarded as proper to come out of revenue and to be chargeable to taxation, should be transferred into the capital side of the Budget.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious question as to whether there is any sound argument put forward that they are productive. I would like to hear the case made some time in favour of treating housing grants, any more than day-old chicks, as proper objects of long-scale capital investment&mdash;borrowing money and repaying it by an annuity over a period of 30 years.  The investing public, those who will have large sums of money available for investment, will look well around them to see where they will get the best value for their investments.  They will ask themselves <Col N="106" /> are the Government and the country serious, and they will ask themselves if the Government is meeting its normal obligations and meeting its Budget deficits in a proper orthodox fashion, or if it is simply postponing the evil day and trying to transfer as many as possible of what ought to be current obligations to the future.</P>
    <P>We are told that if taxation is to be levied and money raised the very rich ought to pay.  I am not aware that we have many millionaires in this country. There was a time when the Labour Party used to vote for an increase in the rate of income-tax, but now they vote against such increase.  That is simply a proof of the changed situation and the new categories who are paying income-tax.  I presume that the great bulk, perhaps not a corresponding bulk, but still a great bulk of the amount that is being collected is coming from the ordinary workers&mdash; skilled workers and salary earners. According to the figures available, about 80 or 90 per cent. of income-tax payers will be paying less this year owing to the increased allowances afforded by the Minister than they were paying last year.  There are some 18,000 people who will be worse off to a greater or lesser degree.  I think it has been clearly established that, so far as the ordinary income-tax payer is concerned&mdash;the ordinary worker, whether he be a skilled worker or a civil servant or other salary earner on a yearly income of up to £1,000&mdash;he will benefit in some degree by the Minister's proposals in regard to income-tax.</P>
    <P>We are aware that, in order to raise the sum of money necessary to bridge the deficit of some £15,000,000, certain well-known revenue-collecting items have had to be attacked.  We all know what these are.  Unlike direct taxes, indirect taxation affords a choice.  The income-tax payer has to write out his cheque and pass on the cash direct to the income-tax collector.  He feels very sore about this.  However, with regard to indirect taxation, he has the choice of restricting his consumption.  If beer is being taxed, he may decide that, instead of drinking four pints, he will <Col N="107" /> do with three.  In the case of cigarettes, he may be satisfied with 30 per day, now that he has to pay an additional tax, while he formerly smoked 40.  It is quite true that if food subsidies had been entirely eliminated during the present year, the Minister for Finance would not have found it necessary to impose this additional charge, while he formerly food subsidies.  Social services and other benefits are being provided, and in the coming year between the proposals in the Social Welfare Bill, as introduced originally in this House and the amendments which are now being brought in to provide for compensation for certain people&mdash;recipients of certain assistance payments&mdash;the expenditure on these items alone will come to £7,000,000.  Can the Labour Party claim that they are really consistent in voting against, let us say, increased income-tax rates or the increased tax on petrol in order to provide the moneys, a great part of which will be utilised in providing these additional social benefits?  If they are not to be provided through taxation they must be provided through contributions.  The Minister for Social Welfare has the agreement of the Minister for Finance and the Government in raising the moneys that are necessary very largely from taxation, and let it not be forgotten that these social service benefits, as I have said, form a very large proportion of the amount that is being raised by taxation.</P>
    <P>It was never intended, as has been stated in the House more than once during this debate, that food subsidies should be permanent.  Everybody knows that rationing will have to be brought to an end some time.  There should be an administrative saving.  It should be a convenience to the business community and to the public generally to have rationing done away with.  We have the position with regard to bread and the wheat that produces the flour that makes that bread that we know that bread is actually being used to provide food for animals because it is cheaper than any other cereal for feeding purposes.  Is it reasonable or is it <Col N="108" /> contended that that is a situation that should be allowed to continue?  Is there any reason, in an agricultural country like this, why we should continue rationing a day longer than is absolutely necessary, why we should not endeavour, even at the cost of some losses or some transitory difficulties when adjustments are being made in trying to get away from this artificial position, in which everybody is being subsidised for the main items of food they are consuming and the public generally is paying?  There may be sense in providing social services and benefits for the lower paid or lower income classes who definitely cannot make ends meet, but is there any sense in collecting money to the tune&mdash;which it would have been this year, when there was an increase of £2,750,000&mdash;of over £15,000,000, to raise that money in taxation from the public generally to pay it out again in subsidies?</P>
    <P>The British Labour Government were driven to fix a ceiling on subsidies. They saw that the position could not continue; two successive Chancellors of the Exchequer in the British Labour Government were responsible for that ceiling which amounted to a reduction. In this country, with food in plentiful supply, with fertile soil and with nearly half our population on the land, it is preposterous that it should be pretended that there is any justification for continuing a policy of subsidising foodstuffs at the taxpayers' expense.  In any case it is thoroughly unreal and artificial. We know that agricultural prices are going up.  Farmers complain that the cost of fertilisers, the cost of their raw materials, the cost of labour is affecting them.  We know of difficulties, for example, about milk. Is that situation going to be made any more easy of solution by simply shutting our eyes to it?  Is it not more natural and sensible to revert to the normal position so that, in the long run, milk like everything else will find its own price level.  The arguments in favour of it should all be in the consumer's interests.  In this agricultural country we should restore freedom to the production and the marketing of milk and milk products?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> We had many references to the increased bank rate and endeavours made to fasten upon the Government the obliquy or odium of having had something to do with that.  The Government had nothing to do with that any more than the former Minister for Finance had to do with it.  I suppose it would be heresy or high treason if one were to suggest that Deputy McGilligan, the then Minister for Finance, was in any conspiracy with the banks, that he was a tool of the banks, in a conspiracy with them, when, in his Budget statement, at column 1879, Volume 125, of the Official Debates of 2nd May, 1951, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In present circumstances it is desirable that the banks, while continuing to finance capital projects, the laying-in of essential stocks, and normal import requirements, should discourage any merely speculative or excessive borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was the former Minister for Finance in league with the wealthy industrialists, these exploiters we hear so much about?  In 1947 he attacked the Dublin drapers, the flour millers, the bacon manufacturers, and the former Tánaiste told us on a celebrated occasion that a great many of these exploiters, if they had their deserts, would find themselves inside the four walls of some of our penal establishments.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing the former Minister for Finance reading out the enormous profits made by the Dublin drapery stores, and I remember, in 1948, when the first flush of enthusiasm was on him, as in connection with his retrenchment policy at the time, threatening those Dublin businessmen that if they did not reduce prices he would consider very seriously introducing an excess profits tax that would make them &ldquo;sit up&rdquo;.  He was not going to stop with that financial year; he was going to go back during the war period and find out what excess profits those gentlemen had been making when they were exploiting the consumers, as was alleged.</P>
    <P>Then he had his opportunity when the Labour Party were in coalition with his Party of enforcing price control, excess profits tax and all the rest of <Col N="110" /> it.  Why did they not do it when they had this golden opportunity?  The records were then available to them. They could make the case.  It was not a case of making a speech in O'Connell Street.  They could go and get the official evidence to justify the necessary legislation and excess profits taxation being imposed upon those people. It is rather sad at this hour of the day that the Trades Union Congress has to ask us now, after three years of inter-Party Government in which the Leader of the Labour Party was Tánaiste and Vice-Premier&mdash;the second most important person in that Government&mdash;with another Minister to support him, to do what they had ample opportunities of doing and did not do.</P>
    <P>We have been told also that the speeches of the Minister for Finance and other Ministers, and the attitude of the Government in calling the serious attention of the country to the position with which we are faced and with which the people are faced, has done harm to employment and has created a panic and a feeling of crisis, and so forth.  Does everybody not know that every country is faced with a trade recession?  It is being experienced in Britain in the textile and other trades.  It is in Sweden, and even in the United States.  People stocked up when the Korean war started, and when the big rearmament campaigns began.  They felt that goods were going to become scarce. The distributors and the big wholesalers stocked up their stores for all they were worth.  Since then, they have been trying to unload these excess stocks on the market.  We, with our limited market, are not like the United States.  We are not accustomed to mass purchases.  People do not buy six suits of clothes or a dozen pairs of shoes at a time in this country.  Our market is limited.</P>
    <P>When there is an amount of over-stocking, and when that over-stocking is a result of excess imports of manufactured and consumable goods into the country during recent years, it is quite natural that such stocking-up should have ill-effects on our Irish factories <Col N="111" /> and create a certain amount of slackness.  There is nothing peculiar to this country in that situation.  It was making itself manifest before the Fianna Fáil Government took office.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the fact is that the State, like the private employer or the private consumer for that matter, has been faced with increased costs all the time.  Costs have been piling up.  When people have been calling upon the State to do more, to provide more social services, more health services, more large-scale schemes for the provision of employment, and the gearing up of housing activities to the greatest extent possible, they have not stopped to consider how the costs have been piling up all the time.  It is only once a year that we have an opportunity of reviewing this situation.  In fact, it was not reviewed last year.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, introduced his Budget. Then there was a general election and a new Minister for Finance took office. That new Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, had to take over and carry on with the situation which faced him. He had to wait until the end of the financial year so that there could be no question or doubt about the position. The figures are there.  The output and the income, the expenditure and the revenue, for the past financial year are there&mdash;and they are the surest indication of what is happening and of what is likely to happen in the coming year.</P>
    <P>We have had these increased costs. If we are to maintain the schemes and services we should like to maintain we shall have to face the situation that the money must be provided and that when the Minister for Finance has balanced his Budget, in the narrower sense of providing for the actual administration&mdash;the Government Departments, and so forth&mdash;he must then turn round and contemplate the commitments which face him in the financing of these big capital investment projects.  Anybody who examines these projects&mdash;for instance, the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;will realise that it is not even by hundreds of thousands of <Col N="112" /> pounds but by millions of pounds per year that the expenditure is increasing.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, also, is undertaking big projects which will run into millions of pounds a year.  Where is the money to come from?  The general belief of those who have studied these matters is that the State, or the community, is in no different position from the ordinary individual.  If the ordinary individual wants to have a holiday abroad or to buy a car or a new house he must set aside a certain amount of his income for that purpose, even if he is going to borrow.  He has to consider what proportion of his income he can set aside in order to provide for these amenities and for this improvement in his position and in his way of living.  Very often he must give up something else if he is going to have his new house or his new car or his holiday&mdash;perhaps not even a holiday abroad but a holiday at home, which can be fairly costly in present circumstances, even if he is a total abstainer and a non-smoker, if he has a family to bring with him.  The State is in exactly the same position.  There is a certain national income.  If we mean to go ahead with the policy of State capital investment, a certain proportion of that national income must be set aside for that purpose. If it is not set aside by way of savings and investment, the Minister for Finance has no alternative, short of closing down on all these projects or curtailing them very seriously with all that that entails, but to find the money by way of extra taxation.  There is no impulse towards saving when consumption is increasing in every direction.  People do not feel they have to save.  It has not been brought home to them that they should do so. I suggest that it is our duty to make the people realise that if we are to have these national schemes we must pay for them.  We have either to provide through taxation&mdash;the hard way&mdash; or we have to save.  We must not encroach upon our accumulated savings except to the extent that is necessary to do so for worth-while projects.  We must save from our current expenditure and keep whatever is there for the &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo;.  We cannot continue <Col N="113" /> the position which has existed for the past two years where not alone were we using and spending and consuming far more than we were earning but where we were dipping heavily into whatever assets or resources we have. If that situation were permitted to continue much longer we should be beggars in a few years.</P>

      <P>The members of this minority Government are endeavouring by their speeches to put those of us on this side of the House in the position of approaching the consideration of the Budget proposals on the assumption that conditions here in this creditor country are comparable in almost every respect with conditions prevailing in Great Britain.  Does any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or any one of the five political perverts responsible for putting them in office believe that? Will any one of them speaking in this debate after me admit that conditions here are comparable to conditions in Great Britain either now or at any time since 1914?</P>
      <P>Britain has been involved in two world wars.  She had to pay the heavy cost of fighting these wars.  In order to do so she had to sell every brass farthing of her foreign investments. Will anybody say that is the position here?  This country is practically at the top of the list of creditor countries on this side of the Iron Curtain with anything between £400,000,000 and £500,000,000 of the money that was hard earned by those engaged in industry and agriculture invested in the Bank of England&mdash;in a country which two chancellors have admitted is almost on the verge of bankruptcy.  I assert here, and I do not care who denies it, that this Budget is a British manufactured Budget.  If it was not actually prepared on the occasion of the interview between our present Minister for Finance and Mr. Butler, there is not a shadow of doubt that the raw material for the manufacture of this Budget was bought by the Minister for Finance on the occasion of his recent visit to No. 10 Downing Street.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister when he is replying tell the House and the country why, for the first time in the history of Budget-making since the establishment of this State, it was necessary for him, as apparently it was necessary for Mr. Butler in Great Britain, to bring in his Budget in the first couple of days of the new financial year?  Mr. Butler may have had good and perhaps grave reasons for rushing the introduction and passage of a Budget in Britain under completely different circumstances.  Why did Mr. MacEntee, our Minister for Finance, bring in his Budget three or four weeks earlier than any Budget was ever introduced in this country?  Will the Minister for Finance also explain why it is necessary here&mdash;I am not denying that it appears to be necessary in Great Britain&mdash;to increase the interest charges on all classes of loans automatically with the decision to do so in Great Britain?  Will the Minister tell the House and the country, if it is not a British manufactured Budget, why was it necessary for him to slash the subsidies for the introduction of which in the first instance Fianna Fáil are supposed to be responsible?  Why was it necessary for him to slash the subsidies in the same manner as they were slashed in Great Britain under completely different circumstances there as compared with circumstances here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the eve of the last general election, 29th May, 1951, many costly advertisements were published by the Fianna Fáil Party in our daily papers. One of them read as follows: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil began the system of food subsidies to keep down the cost of living by reducing the price of essential foods.&rdquo; Now we have the subsidies for which they claim credit for the purpose of keeping down the cost of essential <Col N="115" /> foods being slashed by the Minister responsible for the payment of this advertisement.  It was admitted here recently by the Taoiseach in reply to a question that the cost of essential commodities will go up by roughly 10 per cent.  How can the Minister defend his share of responsibility for that advertisement in the name of Fianna Fáil published one day before the people voted in the last general election and his action now in presenting to the House something which is quite the opposite?</P>
    <P>We will have a young innocent Deputy, and I pay him that compliment because I do not think he has fully grown up yet politically, Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, supporting the Minister in slashing the subsidies.  What did he say on the eve of the last general election?  Amongst other things he said in an election address and in an advertisement which he issued, after elaborating on the value of the subsidies&mdash;nobody knows better than he or Deputy Dr. Browne, and medical men generally, the value of cheap good food to the poor people: &ldquo;If elected by you I promise to focus attention constantly on the cost of living and to press for increased subsidies on food and essential commodities.&rdquo;  I suppose&mdash;I may be wrong in this and I will apologise after the division if I am wrong &mdash; that the young innocent Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll who issued that election address will support the Minister for Finance in slashing the subsidies to the detriment of the poorer sections of our people.</P>
    <P>Another thing that our Minister for Finance felt obliged to do in order more fully to copy the financial policy of his British godfather was to level down the travelling allowances.  I do not suppose that affects a high percentage of our people, but it is one of four or five policy points in the Minister's Budget, which appears to have been copied from the Budget of his political godfather, Mr. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech summed up the situation by appealing to the people, the poorest as well as the <Col N="116" /> richest, to cut consumption by 10 per cent.  Cut consumption and their standard of living and the costs of essential commodities by 10 per cent., for what purpose?  It is quite clear that the purpose behind this Budget in cutting consumption and cutting one's standard of living by doing so is to save more money, not for the purpose of developing our own national and natural resources, but for the purpose of building up higher sterling assets in Great Britain.  If the majority of the members of this House support a policy for the purpose of accumulating savings in order to ensure greater external assets in Great Britain and cutting our standard of living to provide more money for Great Britain at nominal rates of interest to enable her to carry out a policy of rearmament while we here support a policy of neutrality, then there is something very radically wrong, and I want the Minister to deal with all these matters when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>The only other livewire supporting the policy enshrined in this Budget, apart from the members of the Government who have spoken in this debate, is the editor of <i>Irish Industry,</i> the man who claims authority to speak for the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. In his laudatory article which every member has received, and I suppose read, he opens by saying: &ldquo;In our view the Budget is both courageous and realistic.&rdquo;  The workers, especially those of them who have young families to support, will know much more about that after the 1st July and during the weeks that follow.  He goes on to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Whatever temporary value subsidies had when introduced at first, they have lost that <Col N="117" /> value long since and have become a huge incubus on the nation.&rdquo;</P>

Nobody on this side of the House, as far as I know during the period of office of the inter-Party Government, suggested that all the external assets should be repatriated, although I believe that with devaluation facing us at that particular period and still threatening, it is far better to get something for all our external assets than to wait for further devaluation and get nothing for them. At any rate, the policy behind the Budget is one of compelling our people to save in order to invest that money in another country, a country admitted by its own patriotic statesmen to be on the verge of bankruptcy.  How many Deputies will go down and stand up at the chapel gates next Sunday and advocate that policy, if it is the policy of the present Minister and his colleagues in this Government?</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal said here to the effect, and it is no harm to repeat it, that this is a bankers' Budget.  There is not a shadow of doubt about that.  The Minister for Finance has no more control over fixing the price of money in this country than the man in the moon. It is well known on this side of the House, at any rate, that the chairman and certain other members of the Central Bank, if not the members of the Central Bank as a whole, submitted to the inter-Party Government Ministers the very same kind of proposals as were submitted to the present Minister for Finance and which are enshrined in this Budget.  What did the previous Government do with these proposals?  The Minister for Finance must have it at his finger-tips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must have records on his Department <Col N="120" /> files to prove that what I am now suggesting is quite true.  Will he deny that his predecessor and the members of the last Government received similar proposals from the chairman of the Central Bank and turned them down and rightly turned them down?  If they had not done so, they would not have got the support of the members of the group for which I am now speaking. That is an historic fact.  The Minister can get information as to the rejection of these proposals.  Deputy Dr. Browne can get it.  Deputy Dr. Browne knows perfectly well that the report of the chairman of the Central Bank and those other members of the bank board for whom he spoke came before the inter-Party Government when he was Minister.  I challenge Deputy Dr. Browne to say what happened on that occasion.  Having regard to the fact that he disclosed confidential Cabinet correspondence on another occasion and that is one thing that does not stand to his credit, will he say now what happened in the Cabinet when these proposals were considered at the Cabinet meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a few extraordinary speeches from Ministers, some of them delivered in the country and some of them delivered behind closed doors at comhairle ceanntair meetings.  We have here a priceless exhibition in one of these speeches, one of the many speeches made by an understudy, the principal understudy, of our present Minister for Finance, namely, Mr. Childers. Mr. Childers, in dealing with the criticism of the Budget which so far has been delivered from this side of the House&mdash;he is reported and I am sure correctly reported by his own paper, the <i>Sunday Press</i>&mdash; said this among other things at a meeting of the South Longford Fianna Fáil Comhairle Ceanntair.  This was how he concluded his harangue in favour of the Budget against its critics:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is the real argument.  Are the people prepared to pay an insurance for the preservation of their financial independence, already so desperately limited by the pattern of national trade and the complex state of the world?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know, and God only knows, what he means by that.  Perhaps his senior colleague in the Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, will explain to the House when he is replying what is the meaning of that particular portion of the speech delivered by Mr. Childers on the 6th April last.</P>
      <P>Now, we had some extraordinary admissions made by the Tánaiste in connection with this Budget when speaking at length in this House on the 3rd April last.  Dealing with the charge made, and it appears to have been properly made, by Deputy Costello in regard to the framework of this Budget, the over-estimation and the additional taxation that is being imposed as a result without any justification, the Tánaiste said, when dealing with the question of the margin of error:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At this time of the year it is not possible to calculate to the last penny the probable cost of a variety of <Col N="124" /> Government services or the probable yield of a number of taxes.  However, our experience suggests that the margin for error is not much more than 5 per cent. one way or the other.  Even if we assume that it is in this year as great as 10 per cent....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an implied admission, if not a very candid admission, that there is here in this Budget an over-estimation involving additional taxation to the extent of probably up to 10 per cent.  Is not that a very serious admission to be made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. The Deputy is purporting to quote from the Official Report.  I say that he is not quoting correctly.  He is misstating what is in the report by pretending to read it.</P>

      <P>During a previous discussion on this Budget, the Tánaiste, dealing with the question of the withdrawal of subsidies, said at column 1298 of Volume 130, No. 9 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The additional payments they will receive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the people who will have to bear the increased taxation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;will very substantially exceed the additional charges they will have to make.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further down the Tánaiste goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Social Welfare will introduce forthwith amendments to the Social Welfare Bill designed to increase the old age pension and the unemployment assistance payments so as to ensure that the beneficiaries under these schemes will be no worse off either in July next.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does anybody suggest that the additional allowances which are to be given to the old age pensioners will compensate them for the increases in the cost of essential commodities brought about as a result of this Budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of subsidies and the withdrawal of subsidies which are provided for in this Budget, it is no harm to refer the Deputies who did not read the Fianna Fáil programme or who, perhaps, did not understand it, to that portion of the Fianna Fáil programme dealing with this question and which was submitted to the electorate <Col N="127" /> in their name at the last general election.  The programme was published on the 5th June and portion of it is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To maintain subsidies and control the prices of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That has gone by the board inside 12 months from the date they issued that programme.  How can the Fianna Fáil Party face the people and defend the way in which they have repudiated the election address that was issued in their name as part of the 17-point programme which was published on the 5th June last?</P>
    <P>I daresay that no matter what may be said by Deputies on this side of the House in discussing and in criticising, I hope, on their merits many of the matters contained in this Budget there is going to be no change of heart or mind.  Nor will there be a change of vote on the part of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  No matter what we say on this side of the House, the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will vote as they are told if they have to go into division lobbies at the crack of the whip of the Party.</P>

I am sure that they heard what the people of Kilkenny had to say about this Budget, what it has brought to Kilkenny, and what the present Government has brought to Kilkenny.  For the past six months, the textile industry in Kilkenny is at a standstill.  Likewise, in portion of the constituency, the boot and shoe industry is at a standstill. Where the industry was working overtime for two years before that, for the past six months now the people in one part of my constituency have been signing on at the labour exchange.  In fact, I was asked to find out whether that industry had closed down altogether since the Fianna Fáil Government came into power.</P>
      <P>The same applies to other industries such as the building trades.  Since the present Government came into office, the people have lost confidence.  The foundation of one house has not been laid by private persons in Kilkenny since the present Government came into office.  The only building that is going on at present is that undertaken by local authorities, and for the first time, I suppose, for three years you have men in the building trade signing on at the labour exchange.  All that is the result of the loss of confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, Mr. Derrig, stated that the previous Government followed Britain when it devalued the pound, but the present Minister for Finance has followed Britain in his budgetary proposals.  I feel that this is not the time when people should be over-taxed. People were expecting a slight increase in the price of tobacco, beer and other things but they were not prepared for anything like the increase which has come about under this Budget.  The result is that the textile <Col N="129" /> industry is in a bad way.  The boot and shoe industry is much the same.</P>
    <P>We had another very thriving industry in Kilkenny, namely, the brewing industry which has also been hit badly by the Budget.  The result is that a fortnight after the Budget eight or ten men were let off.  Worse still, stocks are piling up.  Apparently, the people will not pay the extra price for the beer and consumption will be very much reduced.  I expect that our brewing industry in Kilkenny, which is one of the leading ones in the country, will be able to survive, but there are other brewing industries in the country which cannot survive.  They will not feel much obliged to the Minister for putting this impost on the people.  People are not able to afford it.</P>
    <P>The people should not be overtaxed at this time when there is unemployment all over the country and a trade recession brought about by the present Government owing to the restriction of credit.  The Government ordered the banks to restrict credit and a great part of the present trade recession or stagnation is due to that.  The Government also gave permission to the banks to raise the interest rate to 6 per cent. The Minister for Finance stated that the reason for that was that he did not want to have the deposits of the Irish people transferred to banks in England in order to get a higher rate of interest.  But although he has allowed the banks to raise the rate of interest to 6 per cent., he has not suggested that the banks should give the same rate of interest on deposits as the banks in England give.  In England the banks give 2 per cent. on deposits, whereas our banks only give 1½ per cent.</P>
    <P>As regards the food subsidies, it is not fair to increase the price of bread to the extent to which it has been done.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that we would have cheaper biscuits as a result of this. The ordinary people are not interested as to whether biscuits will be cheaper or not.  They want cheaper bread.  The Minister for Lands stated that bread was being used for animal feeding.  I am in fairly close touch with the <Col N="130" /> bread trade and I can assure him that in Kilkenny at least no bread is being used for animal feeding.  People there only come in for their weekly ration of bread.  We all know that there was a surplus of bread in Dublin, but whether it was used for animal feeding or not I do not know.  If the Minister for Lands knew his constituents in Kilkenny better he would not say that they were using bread for animal feeding and that for that reason the price of bread should be raised all over the country.</P>
    <P>Sugar has been decontrolled and the price has gone up.  That will be a boon to the manufacturers of sweets.  The manufacturers, apparently, will be subsidised this time to the extent of about £2 per bag of sugar.  The ordinary person will now have to pay 6½d. per lb. for sugar, whereas the sweet manufacturers, instead of paying 9d. per lb., will now get their sugar for 6½d. per lb.  It is hard to see why the manufacturers should now be subsidised.</P>
    <P>As to cigarettes, the Government some time ago allowed the manufacturers to increase their prices by 1d. per packet of 20.  Under the Budget, they are now being given a further increase of 1d.  That increase of 2d. on a packet of 20 cigarettes will, I am sure, amount to an increase of about 20 or 25 per cent. on the net cost of their product.  The Imperial Tobacco Company already is paying a dividend of 32½ per cent.  With this further subsidy from the Minister I am sure they will be able to increase that to 35 per cent. or possibly 40 per cent. so far as the Irish trade is concerned, anyway.</P>
    <P>Tea has also been increased in price. Some people who could afford to buy off-the-ration tea, sugar and white bread will now come into their own. That section of people who can afford to buy these things will now get a reduction, while the ordinary man who finds it hard to buy bread will have to pay an increase of 50 per cent.  The Minister also announced that it was proposed to reduce the extraction from 85 per cent. to 80 per cent.  Nobody objects to the 85 per cent. bread. The Minister has been talking about spending dollars on imports.  Is he <Col N="131" /> not going to spend more dollars on imports of wheat owing to this?  He will have to import much more wheat from America now to produce the same quantity of flour with the 80 per cent. extraction as was previously produced with the 85 per cent. extraction. What is his idea in talking about imports and then increasing them in this way?</P>
    <P>In defending the Budget the Minister for Lands left one thing severely alone, namely, the dance tax.  He did not defend the abolition of the dance tax. Everybody knows why that tax was abolished.  If the Minister was genuine in his outlook and was looking for something to tax he should have taxed the sporting fixtures and the luxuries and not the bread and butter of the people.  There is plenty of money spent at sporting fixtures.  I saw in the papers that on three days' racing on Easter Saturday, Easter Monday and Easter Tuesday there was a turnover of more than £100,000 on the totalisator.  Is not that something which should be taxed rather than the people's bread, butter and sugar?  If he wanted anything to tax the Minister should have turned to the luxuries and the sporting fixtures, such as race meetings, which are packed with people every week.  When he was finished dealing with these, then he could come to the people's bread and other things if he still had not got enough.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Minister has imposed over-taxation this year at least to the extent of £10,000,000.  We think that is a very grave wrong on the country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce expressed the opinion that the recession in trade would pass over in a few months.  Will this Budget help it to pass over?  Will it allow the people to have money to buy goods?  If they have any money, this Budget will take it from them.  In striking the rates this year, the members of the local authorities, owing to the unemployment which exists, were trying to keep the rates down as low as possible.  What did the Minister for Finance do?  For political reasons, in order to try to show that the inter-Party <Col N="132" /> Government had not been doing their duty, he came along and over-taxed the people so that in the coming year he may be able to reduce the taxes and face the country.  The Government have lost the confidence of the people.  They should not wait until next year to have a general election. They should have a general election immediately and let the people decide which side should take office at the present time.</P>

      <P>When I was a little boy I was told there were such things in this country as banshees.  Whenever I heard a cat crying I came to the conclusion that it was a banshee.  But I never imagined at that time to hear such wailing of banshees as I have heard from the other side of the House for the past weeks.  They are wailing and casting gloom over the country because they are presented with an honest, fearless Budget which they were afraid to produce themselves although they knew perfectly well that it was necessary to do these things.  They knew perfectly well that they had come to the end of their tether so far as borrowing is concerned.</P>
      <P>They had come to the stage in this country when they knew they had borrowed to the extent of putting not only the nation's economic independence but her political independence in pawn.  We will not put either the nation's economic or political independence in pawn by refusing to do something that may be unpopular.</P>
      <P>We have heard a good deal of wailing from Deputy Davin.  He is in bad humour to-night and I do not blame him.  He got a pretty good chastisement during the week over his association with the Fine Gael Party and because he allowed himself and his Party to become satellites.  He certainly got what I would term unduly hard criticism; otherwise Deputy Davin would be a very genial man.</P>

      <P>Poor Deputy Davin is in pretty bad humour to-night and naturally if we all got a little chastisement of that kind we would perhaps be the <Col N="133" /> same.  He suggested that there was no comparison between Britain and ourselves. &ldquo;Britain was in two wars&rdquo;, said Deputy Davin.  He forgot, of course, that this nation had 700 years of war and that every Commission that was ever set up, the latest I think in 1908, decided that this country was overtaxed to the extent of £300,000,000. Therefore, I think that when he says he has more sympathy for Britain than he has for this country he is allowing his sympathy to run at the wrong side of the Irish Sea.  Now, again, he states that our external assets amounted to £500,000,000.</P>

      <P>If my memory serves me correctly £500,000,000 was stated by Deputy Davin.  That is not correct.  I heard £400,000,000 was the estimated amount of external assets in 1948, but I can assure you that Deputy Davin's associates have been taking some of them in quite a ready fashion.  They have taken no less than £150,000,000 of our external assets, with that kind word they use &ldquo;repatriation&rdquo; of external assets.</P>

I will give Deputy O'Sullivan another warning: Walt Disney might be around again and he should be careful. The external assets were reduced by £150,000,000 with the result that to-day our external assets are worth in or around £130,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again Deputy Davin said that this was a banker's Budget.  Perhaps he does not know who owns the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I wonder has he read them and has he <Col N="134" /> got any reason at all for their outbursts against the Budget.

We have heard a tirade from Deputy Dillon.  I wonder what would taxation be in this country if the people had agreed to Deputy Dillon's suggestion some years ago when he wanted to get us into the war at the time when the German and British air forces were at their height.

I am certain again that the reason why the Independents who voted for this Budget incurred the berserk fury of the Opposition is that they have made certain that this Government will continue its term of office for the next four years.

      <P>Deputy Davin was dancing to another tune a few minutes ago and he should not be so brimful of that sort of tirade again.  In small towns like mine with about 3,000 population, it is impossible for any section of the community, whether they be Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta or anything else, to run dances without the prospect of losing money.  That is the first reason.  The second reason is that it was costing too much to collect the tax.  The third reason, and I think it is the greatest of all, is that there was too much evasion of tax.  Regardless of how the officers acted, there is no doubt that people were getting under the wire by all sorts of fraudulent methods.  It is better a thousand times that we would do without a tax of that kind rather than encourage or force our people to be guilty of any type of fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> We are told that it is a bankers' Budget, but people forget that the small investors who, up to now, had been getting 1 per cent. in the bank can now invest their money in Post Office savings certificates to the limit of £1,000.  If my memory serves me well, the amount which could be so invested was in the region of half that up to now.  This is not a bankers' Budget, because there is no doubt about the fact that the small investors are going to transfer their money from the banks to a place where they can get a greater percentage for it.  Therefore, I feel that that in itself is a good argument against the statement that this is a bankers' Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We condemned the dual price system, because it meant that the poor person with a meagre income, who would be existing, to a great extent, on tea, butter, sugar and such like goods had, of necessity, to purchase unrationed tea at 6/6 a lb. and unrationed sugar also.  That has been happening to a great extent, in the towns and cities.  The dual price system meant that the people with plenty of money could buy all the food they needed just as if food were unrationed, and that the poor people could only afford to buy the bare ration.  In my view that is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue and, personally, I am delighted that subsidies are finished. They served their purpose during the war period when incomes had to be kept down and prices controlled. Surely we are not going to have war measures in existence for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get back to normality and give the shopkeepers an opportunity of putting their wares in the open market in competition with other towns, villages or establishments, as the case might be.  When that position comes about I believe we will definitely have more stability in business.  Anybody who is accustomed to the rationing system knows perfectly well the shopkeepers of the country have had a pretty difficult time for the past 12 or 13 years since rationing was first instituted.  It was necessary to introduce rationing. <Col N="137" /> Otherwise, it would mean that the poor people would not be able to procure any food because the people with the money would be able to buy it all up and store it.  Therefore, rationing was the only feasible system.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of pious statements about the Budget and its effects on the cost of commodities for our institutions.  It is dangerous to be making statements of that kind without having examined them properly. Let me remind the Deputies opposite that there are hundreds of old age pensioners in every institution in this country who contribute roughly two-thirds of their pension towards their upkeep in the county homes.  Up to the advent of Fianna Fáil, no person who entered institutions of this kind was entitled to receive an old age pension. Therefore, they were a burden on the State.  Their contribution now towards their upkeep in the institutions of the country oversteps by ten times the effects, if any, that this Budget will have on the cost of maintaining the county homes and other institutions.  As it is, with the county homes, so also is it with our hospitals, where insured people are now contributing £2 12s. 6d. per week towards their upkeep.  That is a contribution to the ratepayers which I hope and trust they will appreciate. I hope we will hear no more of these dishonest, foolish statements about the cost of the institutions of the country being increased as a result of Fianna Fáil's expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>£2 12s. 6d.&mdash;52/6.  Is that clear enough?  We hear that this Budget proposes that we should spend less money on afforestation.  That statement is, of course, also false&mdash; deliberately false&mdash;with a view to causing uneasiness amongst the workers engaged in that job.  The truth is that £100,000 more is going to be spent on afforestation this year than was spent last year.  Therefore, I would say to the <Col N="138" /> Deputies opposite, regardless of the political kudos or of popularity, either personal or political, that it is bad form for them to go to either public or private meetings and make false charges and to cast gloom, as they have done in many cases, over the country and say that it is never going to recover again because we are going to put a couple of pence extra on the pint and on the packet of cigarettes.  Money spent on cigarettes, shout and whiskey is money over which every person who spends it has control.  He can do exactly what he likes in this regard. However, he has no control over commodities like tea which we have to import. He has control over the items taxed in this Budget, and he can decide for himself how much he is going to spend on them.  I think this financial crisis should be faced with a greater purpose of honesty.  The Opposition should face matters of that kind with a determination to help out and not in the manner in which they have faced it.  No matter what wailing the Opposition may do, we are going to prove to the country that this Budget will save the nation's finances while we are in power, and for many years afterwards. They might get back to power in 50 or 60 years' time when the present generation have passed on and the country has forgotten the hopeless mess in which it was left a year ago.  They can go round the country wailing like the Banshee, but we will be here like men to support anything that is honest and anything which will save this nation from financial chaos.  It might suit certain people that we should have chaos in this country, but I believe that the majority of our people will give fair consideration to this Budget and look at it in the way honest Irishmen should look at it, despite the criticism and the many dishonest utterances that have been made in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who are now in Opposition are the people who are responsible for doubling our national debt, almost. They borrowed £40,000,000 and we are going to pay back £83,000,000.  The Opposition cannot deny that they borrowed £40,000,000 from America.  We are going to pay back £83,000,000.  The <Col N="139" /> first payment&mdash;£600,000&mdash;will be made on 1st July: in a full year it will amount to about £1,250,000.  The inter-Party Government borrowed and the Fianna Fáil Government pay.  Let us at least be honest about that.  The present combined Opposition Parties should admit that they brought this country to the brink of disaster and, in making that admission, they will help to clear their political and financial conscience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some years past an expression has come into common use in Britain in relation to her efforts to surmount her difficulties&mdash; the expression &ldquo;for export only&rdquo;.  I contend that when they came to frame their financial policy for the coming year and when Mr. Butler introduced his Budget in the British Parliament the application was &ldquo;for export also&rdquo;. In the present Budget we see several inclusions which are identical to those included by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget.  That slavish imitation in respect of the British Budget is completely unnecessary in this country.</P>
      <P>During the past ten months certain Ministers have attempted to create an artificial crisis in this country.  These attempts have now been supplanted by a real crisis&mdash;one which was sponsored by speeches made on several occasions by the present Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the present Tánaiste. It will be noted, however, that these various Ministers could not determine among themselves whether, in actual fact, it was a crisis, whether the crisis had arrived or whether it was nothing greater than a &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On a previous measure, the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, completely repudiated &mdash;as a result of the cogent criticism that emanated from the Opposition Benches&mdash;the Report of the Central Bank.  It is extraordinary, however, that we see proposals in this Budget in connection with the very matters which the Tánaiste completely repudiated when he was referring to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the autumn of 1947, the Party which is now partially in office introduced <Col N="140" /> a Supplementary Budget which imposed extra taxation on our people. Luckily enough, the people had an opportunity, shortly after the imposition of these extra taxes, of expressing their views, and they did so in no uncertain way.  Fianna Fáil found themselves in Opposition.  One would be inclined to admire their courage, now that they have been returned to office, in again imposing extra taxation, though this time under different circumstances. When the Supplementary Budget was introduced in 1947 the Irish housewife was told that even though her husband's cigarettes and drink were being taxed, in addition to cinema seats whenever they went to see a picture, it was all being done for a very good purpose.  The housewife was told that it was essential to pay for the subsidies to keep down the prices of essential foodstuffs.  What is the position to-day?  Not alone have these former taxes been re-imposed&mdash; and re-imposed to a greater extent than before&mdash;but, at the same time, the food subsidies are practically abolished.  What effect will the dual blow have?</P>
    <P>While the Fianna Fáil Party were in Opposition they asserted that they had an alternative to the dual price system which was operated by the inter-Party Government.  We heard Deputy Davern refer to the dual price system as an unfair system.  That was a system under which certain off-the-ration foodstuffs were made available to the people at the economic price. Let us cast our minds back to the time before the inter-Party Government took office.  During the emergency, our people had to pay very much more than they paid under the dual price system. I can recall cases where unfortunate working people had to pay as much as 25/- and 30/- a lb. for tea.  We now know the alternative which the Fianna Fáil Party had for the dual price system.  Their system is one price only, but it is a price which it is beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  We consider that in every instance it is unfair.</P>
    <P>We hear that it was desirable to remove the sugar subsidy.  As Deputy Crotty pointed out a short while ago, the greatest benefit from the abolition <Col N="141" /> of this subsidy will go to the manufacturers of commodities which are not absolutely essential.  Fry-Cadbury, Limited, have a tremendous chocolate crumb concern at Rathmore.  Consider how they will benefit from the abolition of this subsidy.</P>
    <P>No doubt there are people in this House and in the cities and towns of this country who will not suffer greatly as a result of the withdrawal of the bread subsidy, but it will have a serious effect on the hard-working and poorer sections of the community.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance ever saw a farmer's wife come out of a bakery with all the bread which she has to purchase for her household or if he has any idea of the amount of bread which she has to send out to the workers at the threshing, and so forth, or I wonder if he has ever seen the amount of butter which her husband has to bring home from the creamery throughout all the year.  All these hard-working people rely to a great extent on bread and butter to keep them going during the day.  I am not thinking now of the people who can have bacon and egg for their breakfast and a four-course lunch with a bun or half a slice of bread when they are eating their soup.  I am thinking of the dockers and the road workers and those people who take their lunch with them in a bag when they leave in the morning and do not get home until after 6.30 in the evening.  These people depend on a bread and butter diet to keep them going during the day, and they are the people who will suffer most from the abolition of the bread subsidy.  Apart altogether from the injustice which the removal of the bread subsidy imposes on that section of our community, we claim that the present Government have no mandate whatsoever to do these things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin read out for us a portion of the election manifesto of Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, an Independent Deputy who supports the present Government.  Prior to his election to this House, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll found tremendous fault with the Fine Gael Party because they did not increase the food subsidies. No doubt, his attitude had a <Col N="142" /> certain effect in his election to this House.  In his manifesto, he said: &ldquo;I am opposed to the inter-Party Government because I believe that the Fine Gael Party will not increase the food subsidies.&rdquo;  In consequence of the last sentence of his manifesto, wherein he stated that he would lose no opportunity of bringing his influence to bear on the all-important matter of the cost of living, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll was sent to this House by the lowerpaid people in his constituency to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us in this House that the effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies will be to increase the cost of living by 10.2 points. What will be the result of that? What will be the effect on the employment position?  It was bad enough before the Budget, when there was an increase of some 11,000 or 12,000 in the number of unemployed as a result of the election of this Government. During the régime of the inter-Party Government there was an increase in the number engaged in industrial employment. Now there is a slump in industry and business and to-day business is facing difficulties that it never had to face before.  At every turn the business man is faced with increases&mdash; an increase in the stamp he buys, an increase in his telephone calls and an increase in the running of his car. Some of the effects of this Budget are being felt now but other effects will follow indirectly next year from the impositions in this Budget.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to withdraw the subsidies. Very few citizens will be able to consume the same amount of butter in the future that they consumed in the past.  Some of my constituents are gravely concerned at that prospect because the price in the future will be such as to make butter prohibitive in many an Irish home.  My constituency is a butter-producing constituency and my constituents are gravely perturbed. I am sure that Deputies like Deputy Dr. Browne, who are solicitous for the health of our people, appreciate the fact that the consumption of butter increased very considerably during the inter-Party Government's term in office.  I am sure he and they must <Col N="143" /> realise that this colossal increase in the price of butter will have the effect of considerably reducing the amount the normal family can afford to buy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating a reduction in the price of milk and I am glad the Deputy has reminded me of this.  I can see in this yet one more obstacle placed in the way of those farmers who are looking for an increase in the price of milk because the cushion that existed between the producer and the consumer is being destroyed.  Ten months ago the people in the dairying counties gave a mandate to the inter-Party Government to support Deputy Dillon in his policy of improving agriculture. Now the cushion has gone.  Since this Government came into office production costs have increased considerably. Deputy Corry, who has given us such excellent support since the Government was elected, said that the 1d. increase that was given had been absorbed by the increase in wages and the increase in feeding stuffs.  The dairy farmer is faced with another bad blow under this Budget.  Wages have increased again and no doubt the agricultural labourer will seek a still greater increase in the near future as a result of the 10.2 per cent. increase in the cost of living.  He will be perfectly entitled to seek that increase. Deputy Cogan will appreciate that the farmer will find himself faced with a very difficult problem before this year is out.  The Minister for Agriculture, when he was in opposition, advocated a price of 1/6, 1/8 and even 2/- a gallon at one time for milk.  There is good reason to believe that Deputy Davern's solicitude for the dairy farmer will be fully justified in the next few months when the well-documented demands of the creamery milk suppliers will have to be met by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting once more to food subsidies, during the general election campaign there was not a single canvasser for the present Government who intimated to the voters that the Government <Col N="144" /> intended to strike this blow or that they intended to abolish the dual price system and implement a luxury price for everybody.  Had that been made public there is no doubt we would to-day have a very small Fianna Fáil Party in opposition in this House. They made it quite clear in their election manifestos that they supported subsidies.  The Minister for Finance in his own constituency assured the licensed trade that far from doing anything which would be hurtful to their interests he would ensure that no such thing would happen.</P>

      <P>Coupled with the withdrawal of the subsidies we have in this Budget yet another attack on the working classes through the medium of taxes on the simple luxuries of the working man.  Some Deputies have been solicitous in the interests of those who consume intoxicating liquor. No doubt the luxury classes will be able to get round these taxes by taking their cocktails and their wines.  Will the docker who goes for his pint escape?  Some Deputies seem to think that those who drink stout and porter do so because they have a lot of money to spare.  That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there is one essential industry in relation to agricultural production.  I refer to ground limestone.  I would appeal to members of the Government travelling to Limerick from Cork to pause for a moment on their journey and look at the cloud of dust rising out of the works where these men are engaged and see for themselves the conditions under which the men work.  These men need a drink to combat the conditions under which they work.  Does the Government realise the effect this impost will have on their earnings?  Is the Government aware of the effect already showing itself in the employment given to those engaged in the brewing industry and <Col N="145" /> in the retail liquor trade because of the heavy taxation imposed under this Budget?</P>
    <P>I know a small concern in the South of Ireland which during the few short months of the operation of the taxes imposed under the supplementary Budget in October, 1947&mdash;taxes which went nowhere near the taxes imposed under this Budget in their intensity and operation&mdash;kept some men on in employment.  They found work for them whitewashing walls three and four times during these three months because the employers did not like to dismiss them.  They kept them on in the hope that something would happen, as it eventually did, whereby they could continue them in employment, but their employment is now in jeopardy again as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the City of Cork during the past week&mdash;and Deputy MacCarthy, Deputy McGrath and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government must be well aware of it&mdash; many men who were employed in bars in the city have been dismissed.  I am sure that the same conditions, possibly accentuated to a greater degree, affect those who have been employed in the licensed trade in Dublin.  Consequently we shall have an addition to the increasing numbers of unemployed since the present Government took office.  There will be a swift acceleration in the figures.  In the towns and villages people engaged in the licensed trade are extremely badly hit by this measure.  It is not for me to say that these people and their families are assets in these little roadside communiries or small towns.  I know them in my own town and I know that they and their families contribute in a large measure to the atheltic and cultural life of the town.  Now they see nothing for their sons and daughters at home and they can only allow them to join the increasing numbers seeking employment in Great Britain&mdash;numbers which have vastly increased since the return of Fianna Fáil to office.</P>
    <P>We have also to face an increased tax on petrol&mdash;a tax which is general in its application because we can get <Col N="146" /> no assurance that bus fares will not be increased.  The money must be found somewhere to pay the increased costs thrown on Córas Iompair Éireann as a result of this tax.  What of the man in the country town or village who is engaged in transporting goods from a port or from the city?  What of the man who is now using a jeep to convey his milk to the creamery, and who tries to economise on the time devoted to transport of other articles, so as to have more time for the production of goods which are so essential if we are to reduce the gap in our balance of payments?  These people are all affected by the tax on petrol and the Minister adds a final softening blow by telling us that before long he intends to increase the taxation on these vehicles.  There is no doubt that the people generally are very much affected by these taxes which deal a death blow at those who are actively participating in production and who intended to develop still further the work in which they were engaged.  The farm labourer, the man working on the road, and the man working in a factory, all are affected.</P>
    <P>One thing about the Budget is that it has been extraordinarily general in its application.  There is only one small class not adversely affected, namely, the ballroom proprietors.  I do not agree with Deputy Davin about the losses which the imposition of the dance tax imposed on certain organisations in the rural areas.  I know, now that the tax is removed, it will be practically impossible to get a dance hall to run a dance for any purpose whatever beyond the purpose of filling the pocket of the proprietor of the dance hall.  These men of course must be recouped for their very fine subscriptions to the Fianna Fáil funds in the last election.  They must be recouped for the active part which they took in trying to secure the return of Fianna Fáil at the last election.  We saw evidence of the active part which they took in the letters read out here earlier in this debate, and in the letter which was addressed to the Tánaiste by the Dance Hall Proprietors' Association.  We saw that a sum of £250 was donated by one ballroom proprietor to their funds. Will that be related to the effect which <Col N="147" /> the abolition of the tax on dance halls will have in certain rural areas?</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, two young men endeavoured sometime ago to avail of the little protection which Deputy McGilligan afforded to dance halls in rural areas.  At that time there was not the same restriction on credit as has arisen since, and they got money to build a dance hall.  They could not, however, build it while the inter-Party Government were in office, because of the restriction on luxury building, because materials were being diverted to more essential buildings, and also because of the fact that all the skilled labour available was required for housing.  However, since the present Government came into office they were able to proceed with the erection of the hall.  Needless to say, they would not have done so if they knew that within ten months they would be called upon to compete with the big commercial ballrooms in Killarney and Cork.  We think it very unfair that lads such as those should be involved in difficulties by the action of the Government in abolishing the tax on dance halls generally.  The protection which Deputy McGilligan gave to isolated districts was a gesture directed towards improving social amenities in these backward districts in order to keep people on the land. We are being constantly told, even by Deputies from the centre of the city, of the dire effects which the flight from the land is having on the general economy of the country, but, notwithstanding that, we see the little concession that was granted by Deputy McGilligan to people in the more remote areas being swept away by the present Government.  In addition, certain organisations such as Macra na Feirme and charitable societies were given tax-free facilities.  They could run dances without having to pay taxes.  The little advantage which they enjoyed in that way is now taken away from them, and they will have to compete on equal terms with completely commercialised dance halls. People who cannot buy sufficient bread, butter and tea because of the removal of the subsidies and people who will be put out of employment as <Col N="148" /> a result of the implementation of this Budget are now offered the doubtful consolation to dance to their hearts' content in tax-free dance halls.</P>
    <P>When this Government was formed a programme was read out in this House and certain Independents who supported the formation of the Government seemed to be extremely sincere in their belief that it was the intention of the Government to implement that 17-point programme.  I wonder, before they vote further in support of this Budget, will they direct their attention to Item 15 in that programme? A detailed statement of Fianna Fáil objective issued by the Fianna Fáil Party on the 4th June, 1951, and published in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 5th June, 1951, states that in accordance with its election pledges and national policy it would proceed at once to carry out its general programme. The programme consisted, as I have said, of 17 points, and point 15 read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To maintain subsidies to control the prices of essential foodstuffs and the operation of an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, also, is the answer to the challenge which the Minister for Finance threw across the floor to produce evidence of his promises to the licensed trade.  This is an extract from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> dated 16th May. 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee, speaking at Rathmines Town Hall on 15th May, 1951, said: &lsquo;A number of persons in the licensed trade were speading the rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed.  There is no truth in any such rumour.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When the Minister, his colleagues and the back benchers of the Party went to their constituencies within the last few weeks the people no doubt made their opinions known to them, because everyone realises that at this moment, as a result of this Budget, there is greater unanimity of thought than there has been for many a long day.  The people are unanimous in their opinion that one thing is desirable, and that is an immediate general election.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it.  We tested it well over the last week or two.  The people, if given the opportunity, will undo the wrong which these few Independents did when they voted this Government into office.  They did that, despite the fact that they had been reviled in the <i>Irish Press</i> and by the present Fianna Fáil Ministers during the election campaign.  Nothing could be hard enough to say then about the Independents, but this Government got into office on their backs.  Now, not only the people of Wicklow but the people who returned Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, not to speak of Deputy Peadar Cowan, desire the opportunity to undo that wrong.  So do the people of South Kerry who returned Deputy Flynn, the one-time eject of the Fianna Fáil Party, who was insulted again last week by the Minister for Social Welfare.  No doubt the people returned him because of the fact that he went forward as a very good supporter of the inter-Party policy They would like to have the opportunity now of recording their opinion of his actions since he came back to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy who can stand over the campaign which he carried out during the last general election.  Everywhere we went, the crying problem was the increase in the cost of living under the inter-Party Government.  In the City of Cork, the increase of 2d. per lb. on butter dominated the whole campaign in that city. Everywhere we went, we were met <Col N="150" /> with the picture of the harassed housewife which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> and in other newspapers.  We had all that costly advertising shown to us.  I wonder what would her expression be like to-day if she were photographed? I think it would certainly reflect much more misery than that which was on that poor lady's face at that time.</P>
    <P>We are only expressing the opinions of the people at the present moment when we demand that this Government would give them the opportunity of recording their opinions on the taxation which it is now proposed to extract from them by the black hand which brought in the supplementary taxes of 1947.  The people desire the opportunity to record their opinions on the guarantees which were given to them by Fianna Fáil that they had been converted by the chastisement which the people had given them in the spring of 1948: that they had been converted to a policy which would not ever do again the terrible things they did in 1947.  At least at that time they produced some kind of excuses. They said they had to impose taxes on the luxuries of the working man because money had to be provided to keep down the price of food with subsidies. In this Budget there is a double blow to fall on the households of the country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the housewife, when preparing her budget and in trying to balance it, will have to be more particular in the preparation of her figures than the Minister for Finance was in the preparation of his Budget statement.  She will hardly make the same mistake as the Minister for Finance did when he gave us the figure of the number of driving licences instead of the number of vehicles taxed in support of these added impositions on the motorists of the country.  That was a glaring mistake for the Minister to bring into this House.  God help the housewife if she were to make a similar mistake in her little budget.  She has to try to make ends meet on the wages which her husband brings in.</P>
    <P>She has to ask herself, what will be left at the end of the week to clothe the children and to keep them in normal health by giving them sufficient <Col N="151" /> food to eat.  Of course, we have been told that we are actually living beyond our means, that we are wearing too much clothes, living far too high and that we must tighten our belt.  Well, at least it can be said of the British Government that, before they asked their people to tighten their belts, they gave them a very good earnest by the action of their Ministers who reduced their own salaries.  That was a very good gesture to make to the people of Britain before asking them to live under more strenuous circumstances than they had been living in the previous year.</P>
    <P>This Government has not given any such gesture to the people here.  We have had no indication that they intend to economise in Government spending.  We see economies all right in the cutting of expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and in the case of afforestation.  I know, of course, that, in regard to certain items, expenditure will be increased by this Government, but there is definitely no sign of any inclination on the part of the Government to offset by economies the colossal bill which they are asking the people to pay this year.</P>
    <P>This Budget was well described by Deputy McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, as a butchery of the taxpayers.  There is no doubt that was not too extreme a term to apply to the action of this Government.  I am simply repeating what is being said in every household in my own constituency and through the country that the people are itching for an opportunity to undo the wrong which these few Independents inflicted on them when they voted this Coalition Government into office a few months ago.  If given the opportunity, the consumers in Dublin and Cork will unite with those in the rural areas in support of an inter-Party Government which brought such a measure of prosperity and peace to the country during its brief term of office.</P>

      <P>When the Party opposite were here as a Government I remember describing them as &ldquo;a lodger who came into town and took a furnished room.&rdquo;  In the first week, in order to <Col N="152" /> pay his way, he sold the chair; the following week he sold an old table; the week after he sold the dresser; later he sold a few more things, and he wound up by selling the bed.  The Deputies opposite know that their Government sold the bed before they left. One would expect from such a dissolute body of directors, if one may call them that, as we had running this company as a Government for three and a half years that, when their successors came in and endeavoured to pay the debts which they had left unpaid. at least they would, have the decency to shut their mouths while we were trying to find the money to pay the debts.  That is the least we might have expected from them.  What is the reason for this infliction on the people of this country?  There is one little item of £855,000 for health services.  In regard to that I will be told, I suppose, that that was not known to Deputy McGilligan when he introduced his Budget on the 2nd May last.  But there is something else which occurred on the 4th May, and I would ask the gentlemen over there, who talk about corruption, to listen to this.  The day after they handed in their gun the following letters were sent to the public authorities of this country: Circular letter E.L. 4/51, dated 4th May. 1951, from the Department of Local Government; circular letter H.A. 8/51, dated 7th May, 1951, from the Department of Social Welfare; circular letter No. 32/51, dated 4th May, 1951, from the Department of Health; and circular letter No. 34/51, dated 17th May, 1951, from the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Those are very interesting documents. The ratepayers of Cork and of every other county are paying this year 1/8 in the £ in their rates for those four letters.  The ratepayers of the 26 Counties are paying over £2,000,000 in their rates for those four letters which were sent out after the Dáil had dissolved&mdash;the purchase price for the influence of the officials of local authorities in the election.  I am glad that the large majority of the officials of the local authorities were not to be purchased by a few Deputies opposite owing their seats to the price that was paid in those letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> In circular letter EL 4/51, of the 4th May, 1951, it is stated:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That circular continues:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Under that circular letter the county manager and assistant county manager in Cork got an increase of £250 a year and&mdash;for Deputy Hickey's information &mdash;the city manager as well, and a gift of £125 into his pocket a fortnight before the election.</P>

      <P>The date to which the <Col N="154" /> back payment was to go was the 1st November, 1950.  This letter was issued from the Department of Local Government, Custom House, Dublin, on the 4th May, 1951.  Six months' back pay on £250 increase in salaries for city and county managers amounted to £125 per man.</P>

      <P>Poor old Ireland! God help her with the likes of you.  If the Deputy had any shame, which he has not, it is far away from here he would be.  Here is the letter from the Department of Social Welfare, Lord Edward Street, Dublin, dated 7th May, 1951:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare was Deputy John M. Costello.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  This was Deputy Norton's contribution.  It deals with the payment of a bonus allowance to superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers.  The letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am to state that he approves of the proposal to increase, as from a date not earlier than the 1st November, 1950, the salaries of these officers by 12½ per cent.  Where a proposal for an increase has not already been submitted by a public assistance authority, the Minister will be prepared to consider favourably a proposal on the foregoing basis.  Mise, le meas, J.J. O'Sullivan. To each public assistance authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those are the little missives that went out.  For fear there may be a rift in the lute, I have here the letter from Deputy John A. Costello.  It is dated the 4 Bealtaine, 1951, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Health to state that he has considered representations which have been made to him by certain local authorities and by interested trade unions and professional associations&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Sure, they were all on the job&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in regard to the remuneration of certain employees of local authorities and to state that he will be prepared to sanction, with effect from a date not earlier than 1st November last&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the same old date&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the payment to local authority staffs (other than persons remunerated on a fee basis and agricultural workers&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He did not forget the agricultural workers.  No.  They were not going to receive anything&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;tradesmen and other employees whose rates of pay are related to local or trade rates for similar types of employment) in respect of whom he is the appropriate Minister of a temporary bonus not exceeding £60 per annum in lieu of the existing bonus of 11/- per week, or a temporary bonus at the rate of 20 per cent. in lieu of the existing bonus of 7½ per cent. (subject to a maximum increase on present remuneration of £150 per annum) as may be appropriate, with suitable adjustments to cover the cases of part-time employees and persons whose remuneration is partly in cash and partly in kind... Mise, le meas, P. Ó Cinnéide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the dispatches which arrived at the South Cork Board of Public Assistance for consideration within a week of the election on the 23rd May, 1951, when every Deputy and every county councillor would be busy on the hustings.  Can Deputy Hickey deny that after the Dáil was dissolved these letters were sent out to every local authority in this country?  These letters cost the South Cork Board of Public Assistance and the ratepayers £15,800.</P>

      <P>The Cork County Council officials were to get £17,000 as a result of these letters; the sanatorium officials £12,000; the mental hospital officials £18,000; the North Cork Board of Health officials £12,000 <Col N="156" /> and the West Cork officials £8,000.  In all they got £82,800 to divide between them at the expense of the ratepayers of Cork County and at the expense of £1,000,000 on this Budget.</P>

      <P>These are the facts and I challenge any Deputy over there to deny that these are the letters which I received as the Chairman of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  It is not alone the debt which that dissolute body, the former Government, left after them that the people have to face. They also have to face an increase of £2,000,000 in the rates over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They spent £39,000,000 of internal loans and £40,000,000 borrowed from the Yanks.  Where did that money go?  How much of that was given to the Cubans for the foreign sugar?  How much was given for the muck which Deputy Dillon brought in from Iraq?  Will they tell us where that money went?  After 23 years of native Government in this State the repayment of the principal and interest on the national debt amounted to £3,200,000 a year.  After three and a half years of the inter-Party mixum-gatherum it is now £8,187,000 a year.  After 23 years of a Cumann na nGaedheal and a Fianna Fáil Government it was only £3,200,000, but that body in three and a half years increased it by £5,000,000 per year.  Then they have the impertinence to come in here and talk and moan about the poor and about the people whom they robbed in order to carry on here.  If I owed £500 or £600 and some fellow said he would pay my debt I would not worry very much where he found the money.  The next item in this bill is £3,600,000 for the increase in the salaries of civil servants.  That increase was given as the result of an arbitration board set up by the inter-Party Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anybody who will say that Deputy McGilligan on the 2nd May last year, when he was Minister <Col N="157" /> for Finance, did not know that arbitration board had made an award which would put £3,600,000 on the people?  What provision did he make for it?  Deputy Dillon told us, &ldquo;Our only trouble was how we could spend the American loan before the 31st March&rdquo;.  He could have used it to pay off the Government debts but he did not.  That legacy was also left, because on the 2nd May, when Deputy McGilligan was speaking from the Government Benches, he knew that it was his last day here, that he would be here no more as Minister.  Therefore he left this little legacy of £3,600,000 after him.</P>

      <P>Then there is another little item of £1,800,000 for Córas Iompair Éireann losses.  When introducing his Budget on the 2nd May, Deputy McGilligan told us that Córas <Col N="158" /> Iompair Éireann would have to live up to their responsibilities in future and balance their budget and therefore he was not providing any money for them, even though the Government knew that the losses would be there.  On the 15th March, 1951, Deputy Costello came into this House looking for a sum of £980,000 for Córas Iompair Éireann losses.  Deputy Costello said then, as reported in column 2104 of the Official Report &mdash;I want to be fair to him&mdash;&ldquo;I conclude by expressing the hope that the coming year will be no worse than the year the company has passed through&rdquo;.  Therefore, he knew that these losses would be there, but no provision was made for them.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd April.</P>
